The natural map $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}G$ has central image and therefore induces a map between prime spectra $Spec(\mathbb{Z}G) \to Spec(\mathbb{Z})$. The preimage of the ideal generated by $(p)$ under this map is in a natural bijection with $Spec( kG )$ where $k = \mathbb{F}_p$ if $p$ is a prime number and $k = \mathbb{Q}$ if $p = 0$. So $Spec( \mathbb{Z}G )$ is the disjoint union of various prime spectra $Spec( kG )$, where $k$ is a field. A prime $P$ of $kG$ is said to be faithful if $G$ embeds into the group of units of $kG/P$, or equivalently, if $G \cap (1 + P) = 1$. If a prime of $kG$ is unfaithful, then $P^\dagger := G \cap (1 + P)$ is a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$, and $P$ is completely determined by its image inside $k[G / P^\dagger]$, which is then a faithful prime of this smaller group ring. Thus it is enough to understand the faithful primes of $kG$. James Roseblade published a paper in 1978 called "Prime ideals in group rings of polycyclic groups", which appeared in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society (I can send you a copy if you like). Although he did not completely settle the problem of classifying the faithful prime ideals in group rings $kG$ of polycyclic-by-finite groups $G$ over fields $k$, he made some serious breakthroughs in this paper. I'd like to draw your attention to Theorem E, which says: Let $A$ be the Zalesskii subgroup of the polycyclic group $G$. If $G$ is orbitally sound, then any faithful prime ideal of a group algebra $kG$ is controlled by $A$. Being controlled by $A$ for a prime ideal $P$ means that $P$ is generated by its intersection with $kA$ and is therefore completely determined by an ideal in a smaller group ring. The Zalesskii subgroup $A$ is defined by the property that it contains the largest finite normal subgroup $F$ of $G$ and that $A/F$ is the centre of the Fitting (largest normal nilpotent) subgroup of $G/F$. Being orbitally sound is a technical condition that I won't go into here. In particular, if $G$ happens to be torsion-free and nilpotent then $F$ is trivial and $A$ is just the centre of $G$, and then Roseblade's Theorem E essentially says that every faithful prime of $kG$ is controlled by the centre of $G$. This happens for example when $G = \mathbb{Z}^2 \rtimes \mathbb{Z}$ as in your question and when $\sigma$ is the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$. 

Let $Z$ be the centre of $R$, let $S := Z \backslash \{0\}$, and let $Q := S^{-1}R$ be a partial localisation of $R$. Then $Q$ is a simple ring: if $J$ is a non-zero two-sided ideal of $Q$, then $J \cap R$ is a non-zero two-sided ideal of $R$, so by the intersection property $J$ contains a non-zero element of $Z$, which is a unit in $Q$ by construction. [In fact the converse is also true, but we will not need this.] Let $I$ be a non-zero two-sided ideal of $R[x]$, and consider the two-sided ideal $S^{-1}I$ of $S^{-1} R[x] = Q[x]$. Choose a non-zero element $\alpha$ in $S^{-1} I$ of least possible degree: $$\alpha = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \in Q[x].$$ Then $a_n \neq 0$, so the ideal $Q a_n Q$ of $Q$ is equal to $Q$ by the simplicity of $Q$. Hence there exist elements $c_1,\ldots, c_m, d_1,\ldots, d_m \in Q$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^m c_i a_n d_i = 1$. The element $$\alpha' := \sum_{i=1}^m c_i \alpha d_i = x^n + a_{n-1}' x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1'x + a_0'$$ lies in $S^{-1}I$, and is now monic. Let $u \in R$ and consider the commutator $$[u,\alpha'] = [u, a_{n-1}']x^{n-1} + \cdots + [u,a_1'] x + [u,a_0'].$$ This is still an element of our ideal $S^{-1}I$ of degree stricly smaller than $n$, so the minimality of $n$ forces it to be zero. So $[u, a_i'] = 0$ for all $u \in R$ and all $i < n$. Because $Q = S^{-1}R$, it follows that each $a_i'$ is a central element of $Q$. Now if $a = rz^{-1} \in Q$ is central with $r \in R$ and $z \in Z$, then $r = az$ is central in $R$. So $a$ is actually an element of $F$, the field of fractions of $Z$. Thus we have found a non-zero element $\alpha' \in S^{-1} I \cap F[x]$. Hence there is some $s \in S$ such that $s \alpha' \in I \cap F[x]$. This element is non-zero, and by clearing denominators, we see that $I \cap Z[x]$ is also non-zero. 

Then every finitely generated torsion left $R$-module is cyclic. Already if $R$ is a simple ring which is not left Artinian (implied by 1) and 2) above), then every left $R$-module of finite length is cyclic. This result is due to J.C.Robson - see Corollary 5.7.3(i) of his book Noncommutative Noetherian Rings with J.C.McConnell. If $R$ satisfies 1) and 3), then there is a good notion of "torsion module": a finitely generated left $R$-module $M$ is said to be torsion if for every $m \in M$ there is a non-zero-divisor $s \in R$ such that $s \cdot m = 0$. This is a far-reaching and well-behaved generalisation of the well-known notion of torsion module over a commutative integral domain. At the heart of this theory is (a special case of) Goldie's Theorem: the set of non-zero-divisors in a prime left Noetherian ring is a left Ore set. Note that every simple ring is automatically prime. Finally, if we suppose further that 2) holds, then every finitely generated torsion left $R$-module actually has finite length. This follows from Proposition 6.3.11(iii) of the book mentioned above. Although it may appear that these conditions are rather restrictive, it turns out that there are many interesting examples of Noetherian rings "occurring in nature" that satisfy them. 

Yes --- this follows from EGA3 I, Chapter 0, Proposition 13.3.1 . This general result gives conditions under which it is possible to conclude that $H^i( X, \lim\limits_\longleftarrow \mathcal{F}_k )$ is isomorphic to $\lim\limits_\longleftarrow H^i( X, \mathcal{F}_k)$ for an inverse system $(\mathcal{F}_k)$ of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space $X$. 

Let $A = k[x_1,x_2, \ldots]$ be the polynomial ring over a field $k$ in infinitely many variables and let $\mathfrak{m} = \langle x_1,x_2,\ldots \rangle$. Then $(A / \mathfrak{m}^2)^2$ satisfies all of your conditions. 

A Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ satisfying the equation $ad(x)^m = 0$ for all $x \in \mathfrak{g}$ is called an Engel-$m$ Lie algebra. One of the key steps in Zelmanov's solution of the restricted Burnside problem is that any finitely generated Engel-$m$ Lie algebra is nilpotent. Zelmanov won the Fields medal for this work. Let $E(t,m)$ be the free Lie algebra on $t$-generators subject to the Engel-$m$ identity. Then it follows that $E(t,m)$ is nilpotent and therefore finite dimensional, although its dimension and class depend on the characteristic of the ground field $k$. Let us assume that $char(k) = 0$ for simplicity. Then it is not difficult to show that $E(t,2)$ is nilpotent of class $2$, and $E(2,3)$ is nilpotent of class $3$. The dimension of $E(t,2)$ is $t + \binom{t}{2}$, and the dimension of $E(2,3)$ is $5$. But already $E(3,3)$ is actually nilpotent of class $4$, so this gives an example of a Lie algebra where the required inequality is strict. More information can be found in the works of Michael Vaughan-Lee and Gunnar Traustason --- see, for example, $URL$ Traustason observes at the bottom of page 12 of this paper that "it is easy to construct an Engel-$3$ Lie algebra of class $4$". I don't know the dimension of $E(3,3)$, but I'm sure that Willem de Graaf does. This paper contains more relevant information. 

Let $A \to B$ be a map of rings such that $B$ is a finitely generated $A$-module. Suppose $A$ is semi-local. Then $B$ is also semi-local. To see this, note that every simple $B$-module is finitely generated over $A$ hence killed by the Jacobson radical $J(A)$ of $A$ by Nakayama's Lemma. So $J(A) \subseteq J(B)$ which means that $B / J(B)$ is finitely generated as a module over $A/J(A)$ and hence has finite length as an $A$-module since $A$ is semi-local. In particular it has finite length as a $B$-module and so $B$ is semi-local. This argument works even if the rings are non-commutative. 

I would guess not. Here is some evidence towards this guess. Let $S$ be a $p$-adically complete ring of characteristic $0$ and let $M$ be $p$-adically complete $S$-module which is free over $S$. Then I claim that $M$ must be finitely generated over $S$. To see this, suppose that $X$ is an infinite free generating set for $M$ over $S$: $M = \bigoplus_{x \in X} Sx$. Choose some infinite sequence $x_0, x_1, \cdots$ of elements in $X$. Then the partial sums $\sum_{i=0}^n p^i x_i$ form a Cauchy sequence in the $p$-adic topology of $M$ but do not converge to an element of $M$, a contradiction. So $\mathbb{Z}_p \langle x,y \rangle$ cannot be free over $\mathbb{Z}_p \langle x \rangle$. 

The answer to your first question is "yes". You can find a calculation of the full ring of differential operators on a suitably nice scheme here : Theoreme 16.11.2 on page 54 of EGA 4 IV, PIHES 32 (1967). Generally speaking, EGA 4 IV.16 is the original and definitive reference for differential operators on arbitrary schemes. It follows from this result that the answer to your second question is also "yes". If $A$ is the polynomial algebra $K[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ for any commutative ring $K$ and $m \geq 0$ is an integer, then the $A$-module $\mathcal{Diff}^m_{A/K}$ of all $K$-linear differential operators of order at most $m$ is free with basis precisely the divided powers $\frac{1}{\alpha !} \frac{\partial^\alpha}{\partial x^\alpha}$ as $\alpha$ varies over all multi-indices in $\mathbb{N}^n$ with $|\alpha| = \alpha_1 + \cdots + \alpha_n \leq m$. The answer to your third question is "no". If there was a finite generating set for the algebra of full differential operators on $\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$, then by passing to a field $k$ of positive characteristic $p$, we would obtain a finite generating set for $\mathcal{Diff}_{k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/k}$. But it is known that any differential operator on $A = k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ is $A_r = k[x_1^{p^r}, \ldots, x_n^{p^r}]$-linear for some $r$ --- see the reference below. So if there was a finite generating set, then the whole differential operator algebra would be contained in the matrix algebra $End_{A_r}(A)$ for some fixed $r$; this can be seen not to be the case by considering a divided power of order $\geq p^r$. A good reference for the computation of differential operators on $k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ is the following paper by S.P. Smith: "The global homological dimension of the ring of differential operators on a nonsingular variety over a field of positive characteristic", J. Algebra 107(1) 1987, 98---105. It should be possible to access it through www.sciencedirect.com . I should perhaps mention at this point that Berthelot has developed a theory of so-called "arithmetic differential operators", which can be viewed as a refinement of Grothendieck's classical theory. You can find an introduction here.
