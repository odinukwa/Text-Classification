The scientific method is not required. The critical enabling technology was the availability of high quality brass and machine tools and practices to make a perfect bore on the piston. The Newcomen engine had the basic design shown below: 

He was captured and held over for trial in 1865 but eventually was released when full amnesty was declared by Johnson in 1868. The wording of the amnesty proclamation gives Johnson's reasons and rationale for granting it: 

The oldest extant Chinese historical inscription that I know of is the Nestorian Stele, which is dated 781 A.D. The earliest manuscript of the Records of the Grand Historian is allegedly a Song Dynasty (12th century block print), however, many such block prints have fraudulent prefaces because in China older books were more desirable and brought higher prices, so many 16th century block prints were passed off as Song dynasty prints. In many cases the printers executed very elaborate forgeries to make their prints appear to be genuine Song prints. That being said, there are extant at least some Song dynasty prints which are genuine and have historical content. Note that you may see references to a 6th century "manuscript" of Records of the Ancient Historian, but my understanding is that this is just bamboo fragments of very dubious provenance. I have not seen these fragments or any archaeological report on them so I don't know how reliable this claim is. Just as a general rule of thumb the earliest surviving historical inscriptions date from the Tang dynasty. There are some mss that are alleged to be earlier such as some of the Dunhuang manuscripts which are allegedly as early as the 5th century AD, but once again a lot of these claims are spurious or exaggerated. As a rule nearly all the Dunhuang mss are Song dynasty, and I would be suprised if any could be reliably proved to be earlier than 800 AD. The reason for thinking this is that there are many pre-Tang archaeological sites in China, but they NEVER have inscriptions, except rudimentary ownership marks and things like that. Archaeologists have excavated dozens of pre-Tang tombs, for example, and they never have inscriptions anywhere. For this reason it would seem that writing only developed in China around 800 AD. ** Note on Oral Tradition ** It is important to realize that even in the absence of written documents you can transmit information orally and China had a very extensive oral tradition in which many thousands of students were required to memorize long passages and chronicles. It is based on these memories that later writings were created in some cases. ** Notes on Pre-Tang Historical Original Sources ** As I note above it is difficult to find verifiable documents before about 800 AD, nevertheless various sources, often fragmentary exist, including divinatory inscriptions, inscriptions on bronze vessels, bamboo chits included in burials, and books on silk in some cases. For a summary of the way these sources are used to re-construct history a good book is Before Confucius by Edward Shaughnessy. 

National Geographic is generally considered the premier map maker since the inception of the society over a hundred years ago. The National Geographic 1970 World Map probably answers your question of "What was the most accurate map of the Earth before satellites?" Note that the premise of your question may be off kilter. In most cases it is not the accuracy of a map that is important, but its features. If the town you are looking for is not on the map, then it does not matter how accurate the map is. In general, the legibility and features of a map are of more importance than the accuracy. Accuracy is only important for navigational maps, i.e., nautical and aeronautical charts. A pilot will draw bearing lines on charts to plot a course and in that case, accuracy is important. Charts are usually on a local scale because piloting generally is a local activity. So, normally there is not much call for a "world chart". Although I have named National Geography 1970 as the best world map, I should mention that the Soviets were known to have very high quality maps. It is possible they had world charts that were better than NGS maps, however, such maps were considered by them to be military secrets. Some of these maps have been released, so may be obtainable now. Also, the Japanese are known for making extremely high quality maps. It is possible they have published world maps of better quality than National Geographic, but it is very difficult to obtain Japanese maps from outside of Japan, so I have only seen a few of them. The few Japanese maps I have seen are of unbelievable quality. 

In South America, bauxite is plentiful in the Guiana shield. A description of the geology can be found in the following monograph: Aleva, GJJ (1981). "Essential difference between the bauxite deposits along the southern and northern edges of the Guiana Shield, South America." Economic Geology and the Bulletin of the Society of Economic Geologists, 76:1142-52. Bauxite was first investigated, largely as a refractory and abrasive in British and Dutch Guiana right after World War I. A large mine at Moengo in Dutch Guiana opened in 1922. The Guianas were major sources of bauxite through World War II, and in fact the United States invaded Dutch Guiana for that reason during the war. Production peaked in the 1960s and has declined since then, except in neighboring Brazil into which the geologic formation continues. In Brazil good quality nodular deposits of bauxite were found in the 1950s in the Trombetas region, and eventually it became economically and politically possible to mine them in 1979 when Mineracao Rio do Norte was formed for that purpose. Since 1979, the Trombetas mines have yielded around 10 million tons per year. 

To answer your question: of course there were "legal" mechanisms to do anything. The President could have dismissed Hitler at any time. The Reichstag could have passed laws to do anything they wanted, including having BOTH Hindenberg and Hitler removed. The "legal" means are always there. The important thing however is the will of the people. To answer your question specifically... Under the Weimar Constitution: 

As it says in the answer above, even when the games were "free" because some famous person like Caesar was paying for them, there were still tickets required and those tickets were resold by scalpers, thus making the "free" event actually quite costly to attend. 

Ancient sources rarely mention Ireland at all. Tacitus remarks that the inhabitants were the same as those of Britain. The first extensive description of Ireland was in "The Ecclesiastical History of the English People" (731), however this book makes no mention of the Gaels, except as "Britons". The first extensive description of the Gaels is probably in the Book of Leinster (12th century). 

My contributions to the list of dictators who voluntarily abdicated (not already included in your list), arranged chronologically: 

Unless the event is contemporary, gossip never comes out of a vacuum. It always has a source of some kind that is relating it. In those cases, the historian considers the track record and perspective of whoever it is relating the gossip, or the newspaper in which it appeared. Additionally, there are two major ways to verify any information, including gossip: (1) Is it consistent with other known or supposed independent facts? In the same way that you might question a group of criminals separately to see if they all tell the same story, a historian examines different independent pieces of evidence to see if they are consistent. Obviously, each piece must be independent from the other. (2) Is something missing? An effective way to discredit a piece of spurious misinformation is to see if something is missing. For example, once I read a sensational chain email claiming that someone was putting AIDS-tainted needles in coin returns. Obviously it was false, because if it had been true, newspapers would have been reporting it. Also, the email conspicuously lacked any verifiable information: there was no place given, no dates, no hospitals or doctors cited, no police department mentioned; there was a complete lack of verifiable data. When an item lacks verifiable details and no reputable source is repeating the fact, that is usually strong evidence that it is misinformation. 

For the same reason he did not invade Switzerland, the cost-benefit ratio was not good. Also, you should realize that the Germans were not just a bunch of frenzied madmen attacking everybody. They were happy to co-exist with other countries that were friendly, such as Sweden. After the war started, many countries, including the United States (1941), Britain (1939) and France (1939), cut off commercial ties with Germany, which meant that Germany could not trade or do banking in those countries. Sweden, Switzerland, Spain and Portugal did not cut off trade and did business with Germany normally. As far as Germany was concerned why would they want to attack them? They were friends. It's kind of like saying, hey, the United States could easily conquer Mexico and Canada, why aren't we doing it? Germany primarily attacked countries that were either outright enemies, or were expected to become enemies in the near future. Comment on Business Relations with the US/Americas Some people in the comments seem to have taken exception to my comment about Germany's loss of business with the US and other countries. I know there is sort of a propaganda cult about how American big business "conspired" with Nazi Germany, but the reality is that Germany and Italy's trade with the entire world other than Europe was curtailed by the British blockade which included wheat and coffee as "contraband". In fact, even a United States mail ship going to Italy was embargoed by the British on some pretext. The British not only stopped any ships from going to Germany, but often stole their cargo as well. All over the world German merchant ships tried to hide in neutral ports to no avail as Britain and the United States found any means to coerce the country involved to hand the ship over to them. If the British blockade was not sufficient, changes to the Neutrality Act in 1939 gave Roosevelt the power to declare war zones and make it illegal for American citizens and ships to enter those zones. By declaring all of the Axis-controlled places "war zones" Roosevelt accomplished a de facto blockade of Germany even though the US was technically "neutral". Possibly even more damaging to Germany business-wise, was not the economic blockade, but the financial blockade. The US, Britain and France all made their currency inconvertible to Deutschmarks as early as 1936. Since the Germans could not buy Dollars from the US Treasury, for example, and it was illegal under the neutrality acts for American banks to issue credit to any German company, this made it virtually impossible for Germany to buy US goods. A US manufacturer will not take Deutschmarks in payments, only dollars, so by cutting off the dollar supply to Germany, trade became not only extremely difficult not only with the United States, but even with their allies. For example, just to trade with Turkey was very awkward and required all kinds of wierd barter arrangements, even though Turkey was completely out of the Allied sphere of influence. In 1941 when war was declared all vestigial business that the US was doing with Germany through third parties was ended. 

Chariots, LOL, I want a chariot. Well dude, sorry to disappoint you, but they WALKED as amazing as that may seem. Unless you were a child or old guy with bad legs, in which case you rode an ass. The problem with asses is that they are as slow as molasses and they can get ornery if you overburden them. Like horses they are insanely uncomfortable if you ride them more than an hour or two. Before saddles were invented, horses could only be ridden relatively short distances, and in any case, were only for the rich. Try riding a horse for a few hours with only a blanket or bare back. I guarantee you will not repeat that experience. In fact, if you can ride a horse for more than an hour with only a blanket or Roman saddle you are a better man than I. Modern saddles, which were originally developed by the Mongolians, have a very special frame and padding of ingenious design, and stirrups, The Roman saddles were greatly inferior to modern saddles and much more uncomfortable to both the rider and the horse. Even with a modern saddle, long distance travel is uncomfortable. My great, great, great grandfather, who was in the 7th Cavalry rode all the way from Texas to Pennsylvania on horseback with no rest after his tour of duty was up, and this was considered a feat of endurance worthy of his badass reputation. REALLY rich people got carried around on litters, called lecticae. You could also travel by cart, drawn either by oxen or horses, but this was a VERY jarring ride because the carts had no springs; basically an act of desperation. Generally, people only did this if they were so sick they could not walk. Riding in an axel-only cart on a cobblestone or dirt road will make you wish you were dead. Chariots are actually a pretty good way to travel, but you have to stand up, and they were very expensive. For this reason they were more of a war vehicle for the elite rather than a travel device. Romans did not use them significantly. 

"Studies in the History of the English Language" by Christoper Cain. Thus you can see 1490 was really the watershed year when Henry VII basically made it clear: ok, everybody, we are all going English. 

It is the baton of the Constable of France, or rather an imitation of it. The explanation of this particular baton is that William of Orange was originally the disciple and member of the court of Holy Roman Emperor, King Charles V. Charles fought many wars in France and as a sort of propaganda measure Charles let himself out as following in the tradition of the Constables of France, such as Bernard du Guesclin. The emblem of the Constables of France was a plain constable's baton. In the painting below you can see Charles V depicted holding the Constable's baton: 

As you can see, the gun is still in place. The tubes to the north of the gun are alternative barrels. There is a HARP gun on Barbados that you can visit. 

Nearly all of the Swiss guards were killed during the storming of the Tuilleries on 10 August 1792, or in the immediate aftermath. Nearly a hundred were publicly executed in the square of the Hotel de Ville. After the palace and assembly were overrun, the revolutionaries went hunting through the buildings room by room, killing anyone they found, porters, butlers, dish washers, everybody. The guards who survived were mostly those who were not in Paris for one reason or another. 

Deflation is when a given coin buys more and more goods over time. Inflation is the reverse: more and more coins are needed to buy the same thing. If an economy grows, but the money supply (the total amount of gold and silver available) stays the same, then the money will get more valuable over time (deflation). For example, if the country has 1000 pounds of gold coin in it, but over the course of several years the country doubles its production of wheat, timber and other goods, then, other things being equal, the gold will buy more stuff than it did previously. Also, if gold leaves the country, then what remains will buy more, even if production stays the same. Conversely, if the supply of gold increases relative to the goods available, then inflation occurs: a quantity of gold will buy less than it did formerly. Sometimes, gold (or a monetary equivalent) is made into fixed denominations. For example, a Roman aureus was originally about 8 grams of gold. If the standard is changed or if dross metal is added to the coin (called debasement), then inflation may occur instantly. For example, the Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius, decreased the gold content of the aureus to 6.5 grams of gold. This caused inflation instantly: each aureus bought less stuff. If a country uses scrip, meaning unbacked paper money as a substitute for gold, then the value of the scrip will go up or down depending in part on how much of it there is in comparison to the goods available for purchase. If the country prints a large amount of scrip, then inflation can result.
