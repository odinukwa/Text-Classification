Thus for your example, let $R$ denote one half the diameter of the set of three zeros, and let $C$ denote the disk containing the three zeros, with radius $R$. Then the concentric disk with radius $R\cdot\varphi(n,p)$ contains at least two critical points of the polynomial. Note that in general, for the known bounds, the degree $n$ of the polynomial must be known. Various estimates on this function $\varphi$ have been given: Kakeya: $\varphi(n,2)=\csc(\pi/n)$. Biernacki: $\varphi(n,n-1)\leq(1+1/n)^{1/2}$. Marden: $\varphi(n,p)\leq\csc(\pi/(n-p+1))$ and $\varphi(n,p)\leq\displaystyle\prod_{k=1}^{n-p}[(n+k)/(n-k)]$. Richards: $\varphi(n,p)\leq1+\dfrac{8(n-p)^2}{p-8(n-p)^2}$ (subject to the assumption that $p>8(n-p)^2$). (This result is in the linked paper, definitely not in Marden's awesome book!) Complete citations may be found in my linked paper. Sorry I did not think of this earlier as the answer, I was working on trying to find the smallest radius which would catch at least one critical point, not all $n-p$. And in any case I have no excuse for my (now deleted) earlier answer! 

Let $f$ be a rational function with $j$ zeros and $k$ poles, all of which reside in the closed unit disk (excepting of course the zeros or poles at $\infty$ when $j\neq k$). What is the smallest number $R>0$ such that all the (finite) critical points of $f$ must lie in the closed disk centered at the origin with radius $R$? When $j\neq k$, a lower bound for the answer is $\dfrac{j+k}{|j-k|}$, as can be seen by inspecting the example $f(z)=\dfrac{(z-1)^j}{(z+1)^k}$. I suspect that $R=\dfrac{j+k}{|j-k|}$ is the answer in general (again assuming $j\neq k$). When $j=k$, I am not sure what I expect the answer to be. NOTE: This question was originally posted on MSE, without receiving any answers. 

Finally, a natural question is to ask: Which such pictures arise from rational functions? The answer is completely known for polynomials, and the answer is all of them. 

Even in the case where all the parts of $\mathscr{P}$ are finite, the picture seems pretty mysterious to me. For example, it is perfectly fine to have $\mathscr{P}$ consist of all pairs, and one singleton (for example the level sets of $f(x)=(x-1/2)^2$), but impossible for $\mathscr{P}$ to consist of all pairs except for two singletons. Can someone see a non-analytic over-arching principle which discerns the the first case from the second? As a side note, the question can obviously be posed with the $[0,1]$ as domain and codomain replaced by arbitrary topological spaces $V$ and $W$. EDIT: Fixed the counter-example above. 

The corresponding fact for rational functions (ie. all configurations correspond to some rational function, where the additional restriction from Theorem 1 Item 2 is dropped) seems to be almost certainly true, but at the moment defies proof. Unfortunately I do not know of any good methods for computing the critical level curve configuration for a given rational function (other than approximating it with ContourPlot in Mathematica), or to find a rational function with a given critical level curve configuration. All the above may be found in detail in papers 2 and 3 on the Arxiv here, or on my website here. Background on level curve of analytic functions may be found in paper 4 on the Arxiv page linked to above. 

It is a long paper (48 pages), but the proof of Bocher's theorem is entirely contained on page 6. The idea is as follows. Suppose that a rational function $R(z)$ has all of its zeros contained in one disk $D_1$ on the Riemann sphere, and all of its poles on another disk $D_2$, and that $D_1\cap D_2=\emptyset$. Bocher's theorem says that there will be no critical point of $R$ outside of $D_1\cup D_2$. This immediately implies the Gauss--Lucas theorem. PROOF: Suppose that there is a critical point $z_0$ of $R$ outside of $D_1\cup D_2$. We may as well assume that $z_0=0$, and that $D_1$ is contained in the half-plane $\{z:Re(z)<-1\}$ and that $D_2$ is contained in the half-plane $\{z:Re(z)>1\}$. Define $\epsilon=|R(0)|$, and consider the level set $\mathcal{L}=\{z:|R(z)|=\epsilon\}$. Since $0$ is a critical point of $R$, $\mathcal{L}$ has a branching at $0$. In fact, if $0$ is a critical point of $R$ of multiplicity $k$, then $\mathcal{L}$ has a $(2k+2)$--fold branching at $0$. Thus there is some horizontal line segment $H_m=\{x+im:-1\leq x\leq1\}$ which intersects $\mathcal{L}$ in at least two points distinct, say $z_1$ and $z_2$, with $Re(z_1)<Re(z_2)$. However since $z_1$ is closer to every zero and further from every pole of $R$ than $z_2$, it must be that $|R(z_1)|<|R(z_2)|$, contradicting the assumption that $z_1$ and $z_2$ are in the same level set of $R$. 

Let $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ be given. The level sets of $f$ (ie the collection of all sets of the form $\{x\in[0,1]:f(x)=y\}$, for each fixed $y\in[0,1]$) partition the domain of $f$. I am curious for set theoretic or point set topology criteria for which partitions of $[0,1]$ could be the level sets for a continuous function. That is, can someone fill in the blank in the following "theorem". 

Now we can define the non-generic version of the isochromatic graphs. For any point $z\in\mathbb{C}$, let $\Lambda_z$ denote the level curve of $p$ containing $z$, and let $\Gamma_z$ denote the gradient line of $p$ containing $z$. Let $z_o$ be a critical point of $p$. Let $D_1,D_2,\ldots,D_k$ denote the bounded faces of $\Lambda_{z_o}$ which are incident to $z_o$. For each $i\in\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$ a portion of the gradient line $\Gamma_{z_o}$ extends from $z_o$ into $D_i$, and ends at a zero or critical point of $p$ in $D_k$. Let therefore $A_{z_o}$ denote the portion of $\Gamma_{z_o}$ which is contained in the bounded faces $D_1,D_2,\ldots,D_k$, stopping when a zero or other critical point of $p$ is reached (ie. if a gradient line of $p$ reaches down from $z_o$ to a zero of $p$ which has multiplicity greater than $1$, then other branches of that gradient line will emanate from that zero, and we want to disregard those other branches, similarly for other critical points). If we now let $\mathcal{T}$ denote the union of the $A_z$ over all critical points $z$ of $p$, then $\mathcal{T}$ has the following nice properties. 

We see now a clear idea of the shape of the function $r$ in terms of its critical level curves. The critical level curves form a sort of skeleton, either one zero or pole, or one maximal critical level curve in each bounded face of any given level curve. In between the critical level curves there is a smooth sheet of the function, conformally just a pure power. Since the rational function is so simple between its critical level curves, it should come as no surprise that these critical level curves determine the rational function. That is, the geometric "skeleton" of the critical level curves is a strong conformal invariant of the rational function. If some additional data is appended, (like the arguments of $r$ at the vertices, the net change in $\arg(r)$ along each edge of the graph, and the magnitude of $|r|$ on each graph), then the configuration of the critical level curves of a rational function is a strong conformal invariant. 

Call level curves of the second kind (ie. one containing critial points) critical level curves. The two properties together imply that a critical level curve $\Lambda$ of $r$ is a sort of figure eight graph, which can be formed from a figure eight by iteratively joining circles to the graph at single points (with the circle in either a bounded face or an unbounded face). Let us define a figure eight type graph to be one which has the properties described in Theorem 1, and a polynomial figure eight type graph to be one with the additional property described in Item 2 of Theorem 1. We will now classify the way in which the critical level curves can lie amongst each other. 

Edited As @Alexandre Eremenko noted, in the generic case the answer is yes, and in fact it can be shown that any connected finite tree can appear as the isochromatic tree graph of some polynomial (see Theorem 6.1 here, this essentially has the parallel result for level curves, an induction argument will give you the desired application to isochromatic trees). In the non-generic case the picture is even more interesting, and the isochromatic tree graphs must allow critical points as vertices as well, as I describe below. The sets you are considering I will call "gradient lines" of $f$, namely components of the sets $\{z:\operatorname{Arg}(z)=\theta\}$ for various values of $\theta\in[0,2\pi)$. First I need a bit of info about the orthogonal objects, namely the level curves of $f$ (sets where $|f|$ is constant). (I call them "orthogonal" because at any point $z$ not a critical point of $f$, the level curve and gradient line of $f$ containing $z$ are orthogonal to each other at $z$.) EDIT: I just realized that I don't think I need the second bullet point in the theorem below for this answer, but it is none the less true and I think interesting. 

In my own work I have classified the way in which the critical level curves of the polynomial $p$ (level curves containing critical points) may be arranged. This geometric property of of polynomials is a strong conformal invariant. That is, for any two polynomials $p_1$ and $p_2$, they have (geometrically) the same configuration of critical level curves if and only if there is a degree $1$ polynomial $\phi:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$ such that $p_2=p_1\circ\phi$ on $\mathbb{C}$. A similar analysis might be done using the trees described above. See papers 2, 3, and 4 here for this work. 

The derivative of a degree $5$ polynomial $p\in\mathbb{C}[z]$ is a degree four polynomial $p'\in\mathbb{C}[z]$, and as such, the zeros of $p'$ may be found explicitly using the quartic formulae. One may think of a finite Blaschke product as playing the same role on the unit disk that a polynomial plays on the plane (in some ways!). In particular, a degree $5$ finite Blaschke product has $5$ zeros and $4$ critical points in the disk. However in general, a finite Blaschke product $B$ will have additional critical points outside the unit disk. Suppose $B$ is a finite Blaschke product of degree $n=5$. Let $w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4\in\mathbb{D}$ be the critical points of $B$ which lie in the disk. Assume that no $w_i=0$. Due to the conjugate symmetry of $B$, the critical points of $B$ outside the unit disk are exactly $1/\bar{w_1},1/\bar{w_2},1/\bar{w_3},1/\bar{w_4}\in\mathbb{D}\setminus\overline{\mathbb{C}}$. Thus if $B'=P/Q$ for relatively prime polynomials $P$ and $Q$, then $\deg(P)=8$. Can the known conjugate symmetry of the degree $8$ polynomial $P$ across the unit circle allow us to find its zeros using the quartic formulae? NOTE 1: The above is a narrowing of this question on MSE, wherein I also asked about whether a degree $8$ polynomial $p(z)$ whose set of zeros is known to consist of four conjugate pairs could be factored somehow using the quartic formula. NOTE 2: The same question above goes for degree $4$ finite Blaschke products. Of course for a degree $3$ or less Blaschke product, there are at most $4$ critical points anyway, so one may just use the quartic formula straightforwardly. 

I gave a simple geometric proof of Bocher's theorem (a generalization of the Gauss-Lucas theorem) in a paper in Computational Methods and Function Theory in 2015. You can find a pdf at my webpage linked here. The paper is the one titled 

Following is information from Marden's Geometry of the Zeros, Sections 25 and 26. Note: Some further information can be found on my paper "Approximate Gauss--Lucas Theorems" (also linked in the comments). 

Additionally, if this is accurate, then Eric Wofsey's conditions (1) and (2) together imply the condition above (2'). Since these conditions are about partitions only, and do not prima facia have anything to do with continuous functions, it would be interesting to see an explanation of this implication which does not require a discussion of continuous functions. 

In The Shape of Level Curves (link to article on JSTOR), George Piranian constructs a polynomial $p$ with $n$ distinct zeros, such that the set $\{z:|p(z)|<\epsilon\}$ has $n$ components (each of which contains a zero of course, by the minimum modulus theorem), and such that some of these components are not star-shaped with respect to the zeros they contain. I notice however that in this construction, the components (also called polynomial tracts) which are not star-shaped with respect to their zeros, are exactly the ones such that the zeros contained therein have very high multiplicity. Thus my question: If a polynomial tract (say a component of $\{z:|p(z)|<\epsilon\}$) contains a single simple zero of $p$, will it be starshaped with respect to that zero? I am not sure whether the assumption that there are $n$ components ($n$ equaling the number of distinct zeros of $p$) of $\{z:|p(z)|<\epsilon\}$ plays a role or not. 

After reading Eric Wofsey's answer, I make the following observation (and I would like to know if the observation is accurate!). Let $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ be continuous, and let $\mathscr{P}$ be the partition of $[0,1]$ arising from the level sets of $f$. Let $A_+$ and $A_-$ denote the members of $\mathscr{P}$ on which $f$ takes its maximum and minimum values respectively. Then for $A\in\mathscr{P}\setminus\{A_+,A_-\}$, $A$ may be seen to be a cut set by taking $\mathscr{Q}$ to be the collection of members of $\mathscr{P}$ contained in $f^{-1}(-\infty,f(A))$, and $\mathscr{R}$ to be the collection of members of $\mathscr{P}$ contained in $f^{-1}(f(A),\infty)$. So certainly $\mathscr{P}$ can contain at most two non-cut sets, namely $A_+$ and $A_-$ (this is the contents of Eric Wofsey's condition (2)). Conversely, it appears that $A_+$ and $A_-$ are non-cut sets. It appears therefore that Eric Wofsey's solution can be simplified slightly as follows: 

The way that I view the shape of rational functions (and especially polynomials) is in terms of the configuration of their critical level curves. Assume throughout that $r$ is a rational function with a simple pole at $\infty$ (which can always be achieved by pre and post composing with Moebius functions). First lets classify the individual level curves of $r$. 

$T$ also comes equipped with an ordering on the vertices $f:\{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n\}\to\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ which is consistent with the directions on the edges. That is, if $(v_i,v_j)$ is a directed edge in $T$, then $f(v_i)<f(v_j)$ (thus immediately we have $f(v_1)=1$). Question: Can we count the number of all such trees with all such orderings? I asked the more general question (where $T$ is replaced by any connected directed graph $G$) of my graph theory teacher in graduate school, and recall him saying it was NP-complete (a reference for this would be welcome), but I am curious about the restricted question above. 

The picture that arises from Theorem 2 is that, if $A$ is a set containing all the critical level curves of $r$, along with the zeros and poles of $r$, then every component of $A^c$ in $\mathbb{C}$ is a topological annulus. More can be said in fact. 

For $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$, let $f'_{app}(x)$ denote the approximate derivative (that is, the derivative calculated along some set with density $1$ at $x$, if such a thing exists). Assume that $f'_{app}$ exists and is continuous on $[0,1]$. Does this imply that $f'$ exists on $[0,1]$ (of course immediately $f'$ would also be continuous, since $f'_{app}=f'$ when $f'$ exists). Put succinctly:
