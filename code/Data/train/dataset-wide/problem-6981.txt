The standard analysis of repeated games assumes that the payoff of a player from a repeated game is a sum (or arithmetic mean, or discounted sum) of the payoffs in the basic games. But what if the players have decreasing marginal returns? For example, suppose the basic game is Matching Pennies. In each basic game, a player can either win 1 or lose 1. However, the average utility of a player from winning e.g. 10 times, is not 1 - it may be less than 1 if the player has decreasing marginal returns. Are there references that deal with such repeated games? 

In an economy with several agents who have different utility functions, it is common to define a welfare function, defined as an aggregate of the utility functions of the different agents. Then we can ask if and how this welfare function can be maximized. AFAIK, the most common welfare function is the sum of utilities, also called utilitarian welfare. A more general function is a weighted-sum, in which each agent has a different weight. Such functions are well-studied. For example, it can be proved (e.g. Varian, 1976) that an allocation is Pareto-efficient, if and only if it maximizes a weighted-sum welfare function, for some choice of weights. I am looking for references in which social welfare is measured using the median, or a similar statistic (e.g. a certain percentile), instead of a weighted sum. Particularly, I am looking for references about existence of an allocation which maximizes the medial social welfare in various settings. 

To be honest I don't quite understand the question, but it's here for a week so I'll give a short explanation of CAPM. The CAPM is an attempt to explain the risk and return on an asset i.e. it is a risk/return analysis. I don't understand why do we need to transform beta in first place. The CAPM Formula is the following: $E(R_i)=r_f+β_i[E(R_m)-r_f]$ $(1)$ or $(R_{it}-R_{ft})=α_i+β_i(R_{mt}-R_{ft})+ε_i$ $(2)$ Where, 

First of all, please check the properties of money and keep them in mind. Indeed money is a convention, but nobody forces you to use it. For example, prisoners use ciggarettes as a medium of exchange. But let's assume you are the absolute ruler of a country and you want your people to use your currency. You can either do it by force or you have to give incentives to your citizens. The most important function of a new currency is to hold its value. If let's say my new currency holds value against yen, dollar or euro, then there's no reason for not using it. It's convenient and stable. How to do this? Via monetary and fiscal policy, using gold standard or by giving it prefix value against another stable currency. For example, a bunch of eastern european countries have a prefixed exchange like Bulgaria (check Bulgarian lev in wikipedia). 

A really nice methodology for approximating the HJB is the upwind scheme, which I learnt quite quickly using Ben Moll et al's notes and codes The examples are continuous time versions of familiar heterogenous agents economies models such as Hugget and Aiyagari. 

Setup Say you have two types of workers, high and low. The share of low-types among the unemployed population is $P$. I want to find the job-finding rate for these types. Matching Matching is through an urn-ball model: Each unemployed has one single ball (application) that he tosses at random into an urn (vacancy). Each vacancy will then have $ x \in [0, \infty)$ many applications, mixed from both types. The vacancy will pick a high type (at random) whenever there is one, otherwise it will pick randomly among the whole (low-type) pool of its applicants. Denote by $g(x)$ the probability mass function of a vacancy having $x$ many applications. Job-finding rates The average pool job-finding rate of each pool is equal to the likelihood of a specific unemployed of that pool of finding a job. Consider the matching-rate of the low-types: Denote $P(M)$ probability of a specific low-type matching, $P(x_h = 0)$ the probability of a vacancy unconditionally having zero high-types. Then, the low-type's job-finding rate is $$ P(M) P(x_h == 0| M) \frac{1}{E[x | x_h == 0 \wedge M]}$$ A specific low-type will only find a job if 

I'm trying to compare the results of Christiano Fitzgerald bandpass filter with wavelets. I'm familiar with wavelet decompositions in general, but I'm rather new with Christiano Fitzgerald (CF). So far, I have understood that CF is able to decompose the series to trend and cycles and it is also able to decompose the signal in specific time frames as wavelets do. However wavelets operate with a pyramid algorithm where the first level decomposes the signal to mother and father and it finds the 2-4 frequency and the trend. Then, it picks these results and it decomposes them again to find 4-8 and so on. The documentation of mFilter in R states the following for CF: 

As you may already know, we can either regress the $(2)$ if we are interested on both $α_i$ and $β_i$ or alternatively we just use the formula $β_i=Cov(R_i,R_m)/Var(R_m)$, because $α$ should be close to zero (transaction costs). 

As colossus pointed out, technology advance is not associated with Unemployment. Malthus argued upon scarcity, but he has been proved wrong. As you hold an undergraduate economics degree, you might already know that economics "best friend" is history. There's no reason to talk about a future technology boom, as we have already experienced it. There's not any similar technology boom in history from that of 20th-21th century. Not even close. Also, Marx has been proved wrong on this subject. Austrians have worked extensively against Marxist Theory (most notably F.A. Hayek and L. von Mises). About the political tendencies and the left. After WW2, Greece and Korea suffered a civil war between communists and non-communists. Koreas' split is well known, but people do not know much about Greece. In Greece the communists lost, but the implications were tremendous. Left parties (socialists) abused communist ideals and they deindustrialised the economy. Also, they created class conflicts and massive statism was in favor. They created an economy full of rigidities and inefficiency. They gave tremendous power to unions and they abolished any concept entrepreneurship. Some Greek quick facts: 

Think of the following balls as individuals of populations. Say I have $U$ urns, and some balls. Both numbers are really large. So large, that authors like Blanchard and Diamond have approximated the binomial operations that follow with Poisson probabilities. The balls are either red ($R$) or green ($G$). At the beginning of the period, every ball is (randomly, iid) tossed into an urn. There is no miss chance (i.e. every ball is in some urn). Some urns will have more than one ball, some might have none. There are two exercises I want to do in this setup, and I'm not sure to what extent they're overlapping (i.e. helping me understand one would help me understand the other one as well), so I will post both. My issue is kind of that I have a binomial thinking going on, and you can see that from the structure that I have imposed onto solving the following probabilities. Should I switch to Poisson probabilities instead? What is the neatest way to solve the following setups? Red Ball Solo I would like to compute the ex-ante probability of a red ball (from the perspective of a red ball) of being tossed into an urn where there is no other red ball. So far, I was thinking about doing $$ Prob(\text{sole red ball}) = \sum_{x = 1}^{R + G} Prob(\text{Urn has $x$ balls}) \cdot \sum_{y=0}^{x-1}Prob(\text{No other red ball } | x \text{ balls}) $$ Red Ball Super Ball Out of each urn, one red ball becomes a super ball. This probability is uniform. I would like to compute the probability of a red ball becoming a super ball. My abstract idea was again similar: $$ Prob(\text{red ball becomes super ball}) = \sum_{x = 1}^{R + G} Prob(\text{Urn has $x$ balls}) \cdot \sum_{y=0}^{x-1}Prob(\text{$y$ other red balls | $x$ total balls }) \frac{1}{1+y} $$ 

Foreign Investment is not all about taxation. It depends a lot on qualitative factors, such as unionization, regulations, stability, work ethics etc. For example, there are high taxes in Scandinavian Countries, but a potential investor knows that he will acquire high skilled labor and the regulations will not change out of blue i.e. he is able to do a long run plan. Is he able to do the same in Yemen, even if it provides 0% taxation? Also, there's not such a thing "today I decrease taxation", therefore "tomorrow Investment will increase". Corporations plan for today, tomorrow and the day after. Perhaps Investment will increase the day after or even later. Also, there's another problem. Nowadays we talk about taxation without realizing the real purpose of it. In theory, we pay taxes in order to obtain public goods and services, such as national security, railroads etc. Was that 30% tax make sense with the services provided by Au? 

Since it's an evaluation of filtering processes, I don't really care if a filter is better or worse, rather than the justification. I cannot find any resource which compares directly filters. Could you explain to me the pros and cons of those filters in comparison with CF? I would appreciate if there is any resource, but it is not mandatory. 

Formal model: Wage determination under bargaining Let's be a bit formal. We are interested in modeling wage determination. For sake of brevity, I will skip some parts, also I will say nothing about how applicants and firms actually match. We want to see how their wages get formed, conditional on having matched. Let $p$ denote productivity of workers, and hence also the state of the business cycle. Hence, we will index everything by $p$. $w(p)$ is the wage level of hires negotiated given current productivity of $p$. If we normalize labor supply to 1, $p$ will also be TFP. Workers have some outside option to working for a specific firm. That might be informal work, unemployment benefits or similar - denote that $b$. Also, the worker has some chance at meeting some other firm. Denote this aggregate outside-option as $U(w(p), p)$. The firm's outside option is to wait for another applicant and hire him instead. Denote that by $V(w(p), p)$. When the workers and the firm meet, we assume them to negotiate the wage. Bayesian bargaining will need one additional parameter, the bargaining power $\beta$, which is not to be confused with the outside option. Think of it as "how good someone is at bargaining". Here, $\beta$ will denote how good workers are at bargaining, compared to the firms. Since employment is not an instantaneous contract, but will hold for some time, we need two variables that contain the present-discounted value (PDV) of the relationship for both workers and the firm. Let $E(w(p), p)$ denote the value of employment to the worker. It will be related to the wage rate ($w(p)$), and on how long we expect the worker to be employed. Let $J(w(p), p)$ denote the value of the employed to the firm. It will be related to the per-period profit ($p - w(p)$) that it gets from the worker in every period, and the number of periods that the worker will be working for that firm. Then, the Nash bargaining solution is given by $$ w(p) = \max_w [E(w, p) - U(w, p)]^\beta [J(w, p) - V(w, p)]^{1-\beta} $$ subject to the constraint that neither firms nor the worker "can make losses" from the wage. That is $w(p) \geq b$, and $w(p) \leq p$. $\beta = 0$ means that workers have no bargaining power. In that case, Wages are given by the workers fundamental outside option $b$. $\beta = 1 $ means that the firms have no bargaining power. They will make zero profits always, and workers getting the total surplus, $w(p) = p$. You can already intuitively see that as we changed $\beta$ from 0 to 1, the cyclicality of the wages increased (from a variable that is more or less constant, to a very cyclical variable). Trust me that it is also the case for the whole unit interval domain of $\beta$. Or even better, do it yourself. This is a part of the Diamond-Mortsensen-Pissarides model. A great reference is Pissarides' book . Conclusion The model ignores many things and says ceteris paribus, yes. There are many pitfalls to this, so the c.p. is a very strong one. In particular, what are some mechanisms that would interfere? 

Conclusion Are the left parties the right way to go in first place? Democracy by its nature gives more power to lower classes than upper ones. What will happen if there is a party that is willing to redistribute blindly just to keep happy only the lower classes? We all know that upper classes have more political influence than lowers, but if a party achieves to keep happy the lower classes then they will vote them again and again. Therefore, here's a spiral where the government manipulates the masses to vote them, the investors will leave as they will not afford to lose money, and competitiveness will fall. Edit: 

$E(R_i)$ is an asset $i$ expected return, $r_f$ is the rate on a risk-free asset, $E(R_m)$ is the expected return on the market index (benchmark), $β_i$ is the estimate of risk for asset $i$. 

My undergraduate Thesis includes mainly filtering process evaluation. Due to the word limit (low limit), I just realised I have to include more filters than Christiano Fitzgerald (CF) and wavelets. I consider the following filters: 

TTIP is a combination of trade agreements and property rights / legal changes. Trade Liberalization Most of the current debate in European countries is not so much about trade - we all know trade liberalization yields welfare gains. In the first-order, these are split between consumers and firms: Consumer get a larger variety / cheaper goods, and (surviving) firms can reach more customers. These are efficiency gains, and could be split up anyhow between these two groups. To the extent that surviving firms get some of these welfare gains, workers of these firms might get some of the benefits. I'm trying to be very cautious here, because on this last bit, I don't think we have sufficient empirical evidence - and theory will support different results based on the wage setting mechanism. Of course, there will be firms that lose, and workers that will be fired - which is why the US has set up (I think under WIA) Trade Adjustments Assistance for workers who lost their jobs due to trade. This is one way of sharing the welfare gains of trade with those who lose. Copyright and Regulation The issue with TTIP is mostly the legal power that firms get. US american firms could sue France for french regulation at US courts. This downside is off topic here. However, the angst here is that is not welfare gains for each single country. Countries with stronger regulations will lose. Even for the world as a whole, it is unclear whether this yields efficiency gains, or whether firms just reap surplus from countries/governments.
