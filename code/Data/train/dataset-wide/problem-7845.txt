Here I answer the first question, by the negative: no, it is not always possible. Here is a counter-example: take $f=\Delta$, $\mathcal O=\mathbb Z$, $\mathfrak P = 3\mathbb Z$. Then as you say, by Serre's result, $f | T_p \equiv 2 f$ for a positive density, and actually for all primes $p$ such that $p \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. But $f|T_p \equiv 0$ for all primes $p$ such that $p \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$. To see both assertion below, since $f$ is an eigenform, it suffices to check that $\tau(p) \equiv 1 + p \pmod{3}$, which is actually a well-known congruence, where $\tau(n)$ is the $n$-th coefficient of $f=\Delta$. 

EDIT : I wanted to add details after the OP's comment, and I realized I forgot one case (the dihedral case $D_{2n}$ with $n$ even). Below is a slightly corrected version. 

Let me complete Georges' good answer by this. A natural class of object to study on manifolds are vector bundles. There are many reasons to be interested in them, but to name one, there are the examples of the tangent and cotangent bundles, of which the sections are vector fields and differential forms, two fundamental classes of geometric object on the manifold. Now vector bundles are essentially the same thing as locally free coherent sheaves (to a bundle one attach its sheaf which to an one set $U$ attached the section of the bundle on $U$). This is a reason to study at least certain coherent sheaves, namely the locally free ones. But it turn out that the category of locally free coherent sheaves has an important short-coming: it is not abelian. Certain morphisms have trivial kernel and cockerel, but are not isomorphisms, like the multiplication by a function which vanishes at exactly one point from the structural sheaf to itself. So one has to work with a larger category, which is abelian, namely the category of coherent sheaves. 

A statement in higher dimension will almost certainly need more hypotheses on $\Gamma$ than just (i) and (ii). I think that (i) should be reinforced by requiring that the image of $\Gamma$ is Zariski-dense in $G(Frac(A/P))$, where $P$ runs amongst non-zero prime ideals of $A$ or something like this. My question is: has this problem been studied somewhere in the literature? A mathscinet research starting with Pink's paper gave nothing, but I may have missed important things. Since Pink's theorem is fifteen years old and has been widely used ever since, it seems likely that its generalization to larger rings has been considered. Technical remark: when $A$ is as in the question, the fraction field $K$ of $A$ has no natural field topology extending the topology of local ring of $A$, except in the dimension $1$ case. (Otherwise $K$ would be locally compact, hence a finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ or $\mathbb F_p((x))$ by Weil's classification of such field, and $A$ would be a dvr). This is why in formulating the question, I was careful to work over $A$, not $K$. 

I think that not much is known. For example I don't think that we are any closer to prove Leopoldt's conjecture for a given $F$ for infinitely many $p$ than to prove it for all $p$. Here is a result though: for $K_n=$ cyclotomic fields generated over $\bf Q$ (variante: over a fixed quadrqtic imqginary field; over a fixed totally real field) by the roots of unity of order $p^n$, the "defect" of Leopoldt's conjecture (the dimension of $H^2(K_n'/K_n,{\bf Q}_p)$) stays bounded as $n$ goes to infinity. This is a consequence of the main conjecture known in this case and in the variantes. This is already a very useful result (used for example by Minhyong Kim in his beautifull new proofs of old Diophantine results, such as Siegel theorem for a CM elliptic curve). Not really in the same spirit, but somehow similar to the brummer proof of the abelian case; it is important to mention Waldschmidt's beautiful result, that the defect in Leopoldt's conjecture is at most half of the degree of $F$. Since both Brumer's result and Waldschmidt's have proof using fundamentally the theory of transcendence, and for other reasons as well, many people (including myself) think that proving Leopoldt's conjecture will require some transcendence methods (as opposed as methods of algebraic number theory, automorphic forms, etc.). But "generic results" as asked by the question might be more accessible, if by no means simple. 

The theorem of Artin and Brauer of the title are the famous theorem in the theory of representation of finite groups. For example, Artin's theorem is the statement that for every character $\chi$ of a finite group $G$, there are a sequence of cyclic subgroups $H_1,\dots,H_r$ (possibly with repetition), one-dimensional characters $\chi_i$ of $H_i$ for $i=1,\dots,r$, signs $\epsilon_i = \pm 1$ for $i=1,\dots,r$ and an integer $d \geq 1$, such that $$(1)\ \ \ \ \ \chi = \frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^r \varepsilon_i \ Ind_{H_i}^G \chi_i.$$ Brauer's theorem states similarly that if we weaken the assumption that the $H_i$ are cyclic, assuming just that they are elementary, then such a writing (1) exists with $d=1$. I'd like to know if there is a version of these theorems with an explicit control of the complexity of the writing (1) in term of $\chi(1)$ and perhaps of $|G|$. More specifically, if all the $\epsilon_i$ were $+1$, then one one would have $\frac{1}{d} \sum_i [G:H_i] = \chi(1)$ . In general of course, the $\epsilon_i$ can be $+1$ or $-1$, and $\frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^r [G:H_i]$ will be larger that $\chi(1)$ but 

A Sunday question for specialists of eigenverieties: In their important paper "the eigencurve", Coleman and Mazur globalized the earlier construction of Coleman's families, constructing a beautiful eponymous rigid analytic space that parametrizes all systems of Hecke eigenvalues of finite-slope overconvergent modular forms. Since them many generalizations of this construction have been performed (the "eigenvarieties") which each time appear as globalizations of local constructions generalizing Coleman's families. This process of globalization has even been axiomatized by Buzzard ("the eigenvariety machine"). Yet, I wonder: 

I apologize for this vague question: I think it makes sense as it is and it seems that any of my attempt to make it more precise will result in something false or trivial. I also have the frustrating impression that I have already seen this problem, or something very close to it (that is concerning the "independence" of product sets in $\mathbb Z / L \mathbb Z$ with other natural subsets of $\mathbb Z / L \mathbb Z$) discussed somewhere, perhaps even on MO. But I am not able to recall where, and missing even a name or keywords for this problem, I don't know where to look for. So any reference or names for this question is welcome. (PS: I don't even know how to tag this question. Please feel free to change tags) 

So Fermat did not answer with his usual celerity to mathematical questions, but there is nothing but Mahoney's imagination that indicates that it was because he was shocked by a judicial decision. The point (3) might be valid, but remember that Descartes had much more serious problems with (ecclesiastic and otherwise) authorities than Fermat ever had (if indeed he had any), so it seems unlikely that his "ennemies" would use Descartes against him. (1), (2) and (4) are unrelated to the mathematical work of Fermat. Given the evidence provided, I don't see any reason to think hat Fermat was afraid of being found heretical for some part of his mathemamatical work. I understand you are asking for more evidence concerning this supposition, which I have not, pointing in one direction or te other, but that supposition seems to me rather arbitrary at this point. 

I have $k$ distinct prime numbers $\ell_1 < \dots <\ell_k$, and for each $i=1,\dots,k$, a subset $A_i$ of $\mathbb Z / \ell_i \mathbb Z$. Let $L=\ell_1 \dots \ell_k$. Now using the chinese reminder theorem, $\mathbb Z/ L \mathbb Z = \prod_{i=1}^k \mathbb Z /\ell_i \mathbb Z$, hence the subset $\prod_{i=1}^k {A_i}$ of the RHS is identified to a subset $A$ of $\mathbb Z/L \mathbb Z$ (that what I call a "product set"). Now consider an interval $I$ of $\mathbb Z / \ell \mathbb Z$. I would say (that's acknowledgedly a vague definition) that $I$ and $A$ are "approximately independent" of $\frac{|A \cap I|}{|I|}$ is close to $\frac{|A|}{L}$. For exemple, when $I = \mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z$, then these two fractions are trivially equal. Now it seems natural to believe that when $|I|$ is large with respect to the $\ell_i$, even if it is small with respect to $L=\prod_i \ell_i$, then $A$ is approximately independent to $I$. 

I ask this question mainly out of curiosity, but elements of the form $m(S)$ appeared recently in paper I am working on. 

If we start with a Galois representation $\rho_\pi = 1 \oplus \rho \,\oplus$ other terms, with a refinement, and try to apply the method in question, we need at three different steps to assume that the refinement is critical: 

It is not known, I think. For $X$ a point, $k$ a number field, $j=0$, $i=2$, you get the statement that $H^2(k,\mathbb Q_p)=0$ which is Leopoldt's conjecture. 

Dustin, if you know the character $\chi$ of a representation $\rho$ of a finite group, it is easy to see whether it is faithful or not. Your representation is faithful if and only if for every $g \in G$, $\chi(g)=\chi(e)$ implies $g=e$. For if $g \in G$, and $\chi(e)=n$ is the dimension of your representation $\rho$, $\chi(g)$ is the sum of the $n$ eigenvalues of $\rho(g)$, which are roots of unity, hence $|\chi(g)| \leq n$ with equality if and only if all eigenvalues are the same, that is if and only if $\rho(g)$ is scalar, and then $\chi(g)=n$ if and only if $\rho(g)=1$. So each time you have a table of characters for a group, you know which of its irreducible representations is faithful, and you can easily find the one of smallest dimension. You can find tables of characters in many places, like in the atlas of finite groups already mentioned for certain groups (apparently close to simple groups, so not the one for which your question is the most interesting), or for some noteworthy groups on wikipedia, or on sage by typing G.table_of_characters() if G is your group, etc... Now as Derek said in comments, that doesn't really answer your initial question of finding the faithful representation of smallest dimension, which may not be irreducible. For this you just have to test with the above criterion the various sums (with repetitions) of irreducible characters, by increasing order of dimension, until you find one that is faithful, which in general should to take too long. This would be easy to program in sage, say... This is a naive approach of a non-specialist. It is very possible that there are more clever ways to find the smallest dimension of a faithful representation. This suggests many questions -- What can be said about groups such that there smallest faithful representation is irreducible, for instance ? Or, what is the dimension of the smallest faithful representation of, say, $GL_2(\mathbb Z/\ell^n \mathbb Z)$ when $\ell$ is a fixed prime and $n$ varies? In this instance the table of characters has been recently determined, but it is quite complicated and the naive method suggested above seems impractical. 

The best way I can think of is: the curvature of a finite metric space $M$ is the infimum of the real $k$ such that there is a geodesic metric space $X$ which is $Cat(k)$ and $M$ embeds isometrically in $X$. However, I don't know how to compute this curvature form the distance matrice... Is there a way? Moreover is this notion defined somewhere, and has its properties being studied? I would also be open to any other sensible definition, or reference discussing this question. Thanks. PS: I ask this question for experimental purposes. I have a metric set of data I would like to define and compute the curvature of.
