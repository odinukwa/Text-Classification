What worries me about the bromothymol blue proposal is that it doesn't appear to be an organic chemical, i.e. no living organism produces it. This means that it's not possible (or at least unlikely) to be created in nature, and it would have to be artificially replenished. Those are obviously some big hurdles to overcome. There are naturally-occurring pH indicators that serve just the way bromomythol blue does, for your purposes. 

Yes. Here's why. Say you're a politician. You like being in power, and you'll (cough cough take bribes cough cough) do what the people want you to do, unless you plan on going the Palpatine route and seizing complete power for yourself. How do you stay in power? By getting elected. How do you get elected? By satisfying your constituents. Most of your constituents aren't rich. Let's face it: unless the people who elect you are all named Bill Gates, they'll likely be in the average income bracket. At first, this technology is going to be pricey; chances are, most people won't be able to afford it. Therefore, only a negligible amount of your constituents will be able to afford it, if any. They'll be naturally predisposed to hate those who can afford it. Why? Most of us aren't exactly thrilled with the rich - at least, the rich who flaunt their wealth. They also already have a lot of advantages over us, and these new "super-abilities" will only give them more advantages, further broadening the gap between the rich and the Joe Schmoes. So your constituents aren't happy. They'll want this technology gone. So you, the dutiful civil servant, will quickly pass a law that bans this technology, and so you'll happily stay in office. Things do get interesting if you take bribes. That would mean that the rich who can afford this stuff would control you far more than your constituents do. In that case, the rest of us are in trouble because the rich will get their super-abilities, and we'll be left in the dust. Outcome 1: Dutiful civil servant$\to$ banned super-abilities. Outcome 2: Bribe-taking politician $\to$ legal super-abilities. Eventually, though, the technology will get cheaper, and soon the majority of people will be able to afford it. Then, it will be your prerogative to make it really legal really fast. 

The black circle is the planet, the blue line is the elevator, and the red lines are imaginary lines tangent to points on the planet's surface. At any point on the planet's surface, we can draw a line tangent to it that will intersect the elevator cable at some point. We can then draw a line from that point to the center of the planet (this line will be perpendicular to the tangent line): 

The effects of gravity would be interesting, I suppose. Probably not what you're looking for, I'll admit. The tidal forces would be one thing that would change. Tidal forces cause, among other things, tides, and are the result of another object's gravitational pull. The Moon is influential enough. Put the mass of Earth there and you've got some cool effects. Well, actually, the effects wouldn't be too bad. The tidal acceleration on a body on Earth due to the Moon is negligible. Scale that up a bit (because tidal forces increase linearly with mass) and the change won't be too bad. So there probably wouldn't be too much of a difference. Ah, but that's only if you assume that the two planets have the same separation as the Earth and Moon do. This could happen, but it's not necessarily the case, especially if you take into account how the Moon formed. This provides a nice segue into the past of the system. You might have read about the Giant Impact Hypothesis, and it's featured in several answers on Worldbuilding. In short, it says that a two protoplanets collided during the early days of the Solar System. Some debris coalesced around the larger of the two (the other was obliterated, and mostly sank into the larger, forming a combined (proto)planet) and eventually formed the Moon. Did this system form in a similar way? Are both planets the daughters of some other object, or did they meet gravitationally? This can impact the entire features of both planets. 

The remaining three angles ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\theta$) should be apparent. The path of the light is in yellow. Your question features a ring of lasers spaced at some common distance from the center (I assume) with some radius $a$. I'm also assuming that the line connecting the ring and the target is perpendicular to the plane of the ring, meaning the initial path of the light is parallel to the line. Therefore, we have a special case where $\xi=\eta$. One important quantity is $\tilde{\alpha}$, given by $$\tilde{\alpha}=\frac{4GM(\xi)}{c^2\xi}\tag{1}$$ where $M(\xi)$ is the mass contained within $\xi$. If we assume that $a=\xi$ is much greater than the radius of this object, then $M(\xi)=M$, the mass of the object. The angle $\alpha$ itself is $$\alpha=\left(\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}\right)\tilde{\alpha}\tag{2}$$ where $D_S=D_L+D_{LS}$, the distance to the target, and $\theta$ is $$\theta=\beta+\alpha\tag{3}$$ Trigonometry means that $$\tan(\beta)=\frac{\xi}{D_S},\quad\tan(\theta)=\frac{\eta}{D_L}=\frac{\xi}{D_L}$$ We can assume that $\beta$ and $\theta$ is small because $D_S\gg\xi$ and $D_L\gg\xi$, and so, by the small-angle approximation, $\tan(x)\approx x$: $$\beta\approx\frac{\xi}{D_S},\quad\theta\approx\frac{\xi}{D_L}\tag{4}$$ Inserting all of this into $\text{(3)}$ gives us, for our case where $\xi=\eta=a$, $$\boxed{\frac{a}{D_L}=\frac{a}{D_S}+\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}\frac{4GM}{c^2a}}\tag{5}$$ You just need to find an object with approximately the right parameters. I'd advise finding something relatively small. Galaxies are not good because we've assumed that all of these lasers point in the same direction (and don't spread out too much - though that's not likely). If a galaxy was the lensing object, you'd need $2a>d$, where $d$ is the diameter of the galaxy, and that's not really feasible in your scenario! If the lasers could be pointed independently, then maybe you'd have something, but it doesn't seem like that's the case - and anyway, if they could, you could then simply point them all at the target without using any lensing at all. However, I believe that's not the case with the sort of beams you're describing. You're pretty limited by this method because you need three collinear points: The center of your array of lasers, the target, and the lens itself. We all know that Space is Big; more to the point, it's pretty empty when it comes to objects like stars. If you're using gravitational lensing, you really need to pick your targets wisely. $\text{(5)}$ is incredibly important (and, I think, accurate), because it must be satisfied for this to work. 

Probably not. After some more consideration, I'm less confident that the proposal could work. There are two reasons: No guarantee of focusing at any one point, and an inability to control the parameters of the lens. 1. A gravitational lens has no focal point. The analogy to a traditional lens does eventually break down. One reason is that gravitational lenses do not have focal points! They behave differently than the lenses you might be used to dealing with in optics; instead, gravitational lenses have focus lines. This means that if there is deviation in the positions of your lasers, you are definitely going to have problems. The big issue is that the effects of lensing are not linear. A light ray twice as far from the lens will not experience twice the lensing. In optics, you do see linear dependence for lensing, which is what allows you to construct lenses with focal points. That's what makes things like glasses, cameras and telescopes possible and effective. If a laser is offset the wrong distance from the central axis (the large black line in the figure below), its beam will reach the focus line at a different point than that of a laser positioned correctly. This means that your lasers will not, in fact, combine constructively. There's even the possibility for some destructive interference. 2. You need just the right setup for your lens. I put together a diagram of a typical gravitational lensing scenario, assuming that the lensing object is a point mass: 

Bonus question (not necessary to answer): Is the setup possible if the hollow Earth is non-spherical, i.e. ellipsoidal? 

Contamination can also be approached from an archaeological point of view, e.g. as suggested by Yang & Watt (2005). This study relates more to saving ancient DNA, as opposed to stopping new material from being introduced, thereby making it easier to study any traces of old alien life. Contamination in archaeological investigations can come from many sources: 

My idea is for something similar to dark matter - but exactly its opposite. I can't call it anti-dark matter, because antimatter is completely different. So for now I'll call it krad matter. Oh, the lengths I go to in order to create names! Dark matter does not interact via the electromagnetic force. This has some interesting side effects, the most important of which is that dark matter cannot emit photons - that's why it's "dark" (Note: For the non-physics-buffs out there, photons are the bosons that carry the electromagnetic force.). Essentially, dark matter doesn't emit light, which is why we can't see it. (For anyone interested, dark matter can be detected by its gravitational effects on other objects - such as its effect on the galactic rotation curve.) Krad matter would have to be just the opposite - it interacts strongly with the electromagnetic force, and thus absorbs a lot of photons. Normally, it would have all the properties of dark matter, such as density and concentration. But (and here's where we give science a break) perhaps the person controlling it could summon up a lot of it, therefore absorbing all the light in the region. 

Educate the populace. They need to know about governing themselves. Open new education programs, working off of existing schools, that teach the adults about this strange new system of democracy. Delegate new region leaders. Divy the nation up into regions, and have each region have about ten leaders (I'll explain the regions more below). They need to continue the program for about a year. In the meantime, have them govern, but only give them a tiny bit of power. We need almost no government for a few months if we want nobody to have much power. Set the people free. When you think the people know enough, let them lead themselves. Give them control of the new government system that I'm about to explain. 

The top speed of the soldiers is about 20 miles per hour, and their top height is about 100 feet. The wizard can cast the spell about once every minute, so the soldiers are effectively staggered. The armies, though are each about 500 strong. Rather large, compared to the number of soldiers that can fly. 

I would argue, actually, that "dwarf" status is a measure of mass, as well as volume. Here's the IAU's definition of a dwarf planet: 

Here on Earth, the majority of weather-related events happen in a layer of the atmosphere known as the troposphere. It lies from Earth's surface to approximately $20 \text { km}$ - at its highest. Asteroids can range in size from a few meters to $1,000 \text{ km}$, so it's quite likely that we could find one that would be a suitable size for this. I'll pick one about $500 \text { km}$ across - Wikipedia, by the way, claims that only 3 this size likely exist in the asteroid belt. So, let's say that the asteroid hasn't quite been rounded by its own gravity. It's about $375 \text { km}$ long on two sides and $500 \text { km}$ long on the other - sort of like an ellipse. This means that, assuming a very slight thickness, it has an effective atmosphere $170 \text { km}$ high at its highest. At this height above Earth, we're well above the atmosphere, because we've passed the Karman line. But we'll pretend there's an atmosphere everywhere inside the asteroid, because any gas has a tendency to spread out. So, there would be a decent troposphere. This means that there could be weather. Here we have a problem, though. Clouds are composed of water droplets, which only get that high in the first place through the water cycle. But the liquid water on Earth's surface only evaporates because of solar radiation - which there is none of here. But perhaps - and this is a pretty big perhaps - the colonists have erected large structures inside the asteroid, and installed a giant artificial heat source to keep the water cycle going. Problem solved. Rain would also be interesting. I suppose it could fall towards the center of mass, but the local ground would also have a huge influence. For low-altitude clouds, I would imagine it would still fall to the ground. In fact, I'm guessing that the only place it would possibly not fall to the ground would be in the very center of mass - where there is an extremely unstable equilibrium. Eventually, rain will fall. Let's see. What else? Lightning would still be a possibility, and it could be over very short distances, so watch out! Large storm systems might or might not form - it depends on whether or not the artificial gravity is capable of keeping a lot of liquid water on the surface. Moisture helps storms, so, most of the time, they will go where there's water. Hurricanes, cyclones, and other large-scale weather disasters could be possible, but I'm not sure how likely they would be. As you said, 

Option 1 (Earth locked to Moon) is probably not good on small timescales, and as you said, the Moon is drifting farther away. Option 2 (Earth locked to Jupiter) is possible on the right timescale. You'd need to figure out a source of energy, although tidal heating always gets me excited. Alternatively, perhaps you modify things so that Jupiter migrates into the inner Solar System (sending planets tumbling, of course). This means that Earth could still be in the circumstellar habitable zone. Option 3 is arguable the best - the modifications to Jupiter's orbit might fall into this category. Earth being tidally locked to the Sun is definitely not going to work - you'd need a much smaller semi-major axis, which would lead to Earth being cooked like a fried egg!
