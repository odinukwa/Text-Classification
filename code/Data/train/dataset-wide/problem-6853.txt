In your basic introduction to information economics, the two classic interpretations of screening with hidden information correspond to monopolistic screening or a principal agent problem. Viewing the situation through the lens of the principal agent problem; there is a firm who wants an agent to produce a good, and the agent has private information as to how costly it is to her to produce a good of a certain quality. That is there are multiple types of agents--if there is just one type, this is just the full information (first-best) case, and the screening problem is trivial. The producer's problem is to design a contract in order to maximize expected social value while minimizing the agent’s rent. The basic problem with moral hazard, on the other hand, need not concern an agent with multiple types. Instead, the agent has multiple choices of effort. Now, the principal's problem is to choose the optimal level of effort and the best contract with which to elicit that effort level. To sum up, in the hidden information (screening problem), there is an agent with a private type, and the principal designs a contract in order to maximize some objective, given this information asymmetry. In the moral hazard problem the principal chooses a contract in order to elicit the optimal level of effort. Finally, as a caveat, this distinction is only clear at the introductory level, where the problems are very basic. One can easily have more complicated mechanism design problems that incorporate elements of both. 

There are a few sub-questions in this question, and I will not attempt to answer all of them. These “economics 101” models are extremely abstract, and it takes a lot of effort to relate them to observed economic behaviour. (I worked in fixed income research for 15 years, and cannot recall industry research ever referring to them.) “Households” stand in for the entire private sector. (In these models, firms’ financial asset holdings are normally assumed to be zero, as otherwise, they would also have to solve a multi-period optimisation to maximise profits. This breaks the models, as there are then two sectors with competing multi-period optimisations.) Financial assets are issued by the government sector (Treasury/central bank), although the models may allow reverse borrowing by households by allowing them to have negative bond holdings (which little literal sense in the real world). Since you asked about it in comments, I will add some details to the institutional structure. In these models, like in the real world, the Treasury is the financial arm of the government. (In some countries, labelled the Ministry of Finance.) It owns the central bank, and leaves its cash on deposit at the central bank. Since this deposit is a liability between two related entities, it does not show up in the money supply numbers. If we consolidate the accounting, the deposit is money the entire government owes to itself, and so it disappears from the balance sheet. And to repeat: this is not just a model simplification, it is how real world statistical agencies do the accounting for the money supply. Note that governmental liabilities are only the narrowest components of the money supply (“M0”), wider aggregates (“M3”) include private sector instruments - which do not appear in this class of models. The household money demand equation is just a portfolio allocation decision: given a portfolio size, what is the breakdown between money and bonds? The greater the interest rate, the greater the percentage held in bonds. The central bank is the counterparty to the household sector portfolio decision. When it buys bonds, money returns to the central bank. Since money is a liability of the central bank, it does not hold it as an asset, so the money is “destroyed” - the stock of money contracts. The money cannot go to the Treasury or firms, since the model construction does not allow for it. This site wants to keep opinions out of answers. However, it is clear that there are a lot of issues with how (neo-)classical models handle “money”, as most “money” (broad money supply aggregates) are private sector liabilities (e.g., bank deposits). There is a large post-Keynesian literature on money and finance, the key words to look for is “endogenous money”. These critiques of the classical models might help you relate them to real world behaviour, as the post-Keynesians like to explain the deficiencies of the classical models. I cannot think of any immediate reference, but you could search. In anymevent, it would be easier to find an existing critique than attempt to re-invent your own monetary theory. 

This is just @Sadem's argument formalized. Note that we do not need to use any utility function representations, we can use just the preference over lotteries in conjunction with the axiom of independence. The axiom of independence, formally stated is: $L'' \succeq L'$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $$\alpha L'' + (1-\alpha) L \succeq \alpha L' + (1-\alpha) L$$ $\forall L, L', L'' \in \mathcal{L}$ and $\forall \alpha \in (0,1)$. Define $L'' := L_{1}$, $L' := \big((0,1/11), (5,10/11)\big)$, $L := L_{1}$, and $\alpha = .11$. Thus, the first statement implies $$\alpha L'' + (1-\alpha) L \succ \alpha L' + (1-\alpha) L$$ Now, define $L''' := (0,1)$. Hence, the second statement implies $$\alpha L'' + (1-\alpha) L''' \prec \alpha L' + (1-\alpha) L'''$$ Thus the independence axiom is violated. 

Hence, $$\begin{split} M &= 1 - \int_{0}^{7/11}\frac{2-a}{3}da - \int_{7/11}^{1}\frac{3a-1}{2}da\\ &= 1 - \frac{259}{726} - \frac{32}{121} = \frac{25}{66} \approx .3\bar{78} \end{split}$$ Finally, $$T=1-\frac{25}{66}-\frac{101}{264} = \frac{21}{88} \approx .238\bar{63}$$ Since $$\begin{split} \frac{101}{264} &> \frac{25}{66}\\ \frac{101}{264} &> \frac{21}{88} \end{split}$$ the result is shown. 

History $(D,D)$ (Yes, this is with some abuse of notation.): On Path: Each player gets an average payoff of $4$. Deviating: Say player $1$ deviates and instead chooses $H$. Then the resulting sequence of actions is the alternating sequence, $(H,D)$, $(D,H)$, $(H,D)$,... Accordingly, player $1$’s sequence of payoffs is $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $8,0$... Player $1$'s average payoff is $(1-\delta)\big(8 + 0 + \delta^{2}8 + 0 + \delta^{4}8 + \cdots\big)$, which is $$(1-\delta)\frac{8}{1-\delta^{2}}=(1-\delta)\frac{8}{(1-\delta)(1+\delta)}=\frac{8}{1+\delta}$$ Hence, there is no profitable deviation here iff $$\begin{split} 4 &\geq \frac{8}{1+\delta}\\ 4\delta &\geq 4\\ \delta &\geq 1 \end{split}$$ Thus, $\delta \geq 1$ is a necessary condition (not necessarily sufficient because we still need to check that following tit-for-tat is still optimal for the other histories. I'll leave that to you!) 

Governments do offer financial services. It varies from country to country, and changes over time. The political drift has been to reduce the role of government since the 1980s, so this role has generally shrunken. For example, some countries had postal banking - citizens had basic banking functions offered at post offices. I will just use some Canadian examples; other countries have similar programmes. The Canadian government has a Business Development Bank, which helps new firms develop (website). It is taking on risks that commercial banks would be reluctant to take. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC - website) has a programme of mortgage insurance that is compulsory for all high loan-to-value mortgages in Canada (“subprime”). The loans have to meet minimum risk standards, but the loan guarantee means that the private banks are not exposed to the risk of the mortgages. The Canadian housing market slowed down during the Financial Crisis, but fared better than the United States. The fact that the Canadian banks were insulated from the credit risk of risky mortgages was certainly a factor. Returning to your question - why not expand the programme, and have the government completely take over the mortgage lending role? One obvious advantage for the government is that it is not forced to justify lending decisions to citizens - that is being done in the private sector. People could easily be concerned about favouritism in lending decisions if the government controlled all mortgage lending. For example, if the child of a politician gets a big mortgage when other people are being refused, it could easily turn into a political scandal. On top of this, there is the ongoing political argument between government control versus free markets. The objective of this website is to avoid opinion-based answers, so I will not dwell on that political debate. 

I think your one mistake was writing $\Pr(v_{2} < \beta(v_{1})$ incorrectly. It should be: $$\begin{split} \pi_1(v_1,v_2)&=\Pr(v_2<\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1))\\ &=F_{2}(v_2<\beta(v_1))(v_1-\beta(v_1))\\ &= \beta(v_1)(v_1-\beta(v_1))\\ \end{split}$$ $$\begin{split} \left.\frac{\partial \pi_1(w,v_{2})}{\partial w}\right|_{w=v_1} =v_1\beta'(v_1) - 2\beta(v_1)\beta'(v_1)&=0\\ \beta(v_1) &= \frac{v_{1}}{2}\end{split}$$ Loosely we can look at, say, type $1$ of player $1$. If he bids according to this strategy his expected payoff is $1/4$. Suppose he picks any other bid amount $a$. Then his expected payoff is $(1-a)F(a) = (1-a)a$. This is clearly maximized at $a = 1/2$. 

The Envelope theorem is arguably one, $URL$ . I would say Blackwell's papers on comparisons of experiments are a significant mathematical contribution--extending Hardy,Littlewood and Polya's earlier results, and paving the way for further investigation. Econometricians have made statistical contributions as well; see e.g. $URL$ . More recently, I saw a paper presented last year on how a certain type of stochastic PDE could be solved by reinterpreting it as a (stochastic) differential game. I would expect to see more related to this (the relationship between differential games and stochastic pdes) in the coming years, especially given the recent surge of interest in mean-field games. 

To keep the published balance of payments balanced. The problem is: how do we measure these flows? In particular, we generally have no idea where non-electronic currency (e.g., $100 dollars bills) is being held. If illegal activities were disguised as something else ("money laundering"), the cash flows should end up in whatever accounts the activity was disguised to be. Countries tend to only include illegal transactions in the national accounts if the statisticians believe that they have a way of tracking them. For example, Statistics Canada was able to estimate the extent of tobacco smuggling (to avoid taxes) based on the disruption in other data. The underground economy behaves differently in each country, and so attempts to measure its effects varies across countries. To what extent illegal transactions are just a measure to evade currency controls (and not for trafficking in illegal goods) they would once again show up in the form that the transaction was registered. One typical way this is done is to adjust invoices in trade, so that the amount of money exchanged is greater than the true value of the goods. This shows up in the national accounts as an excessively large imports/exports (depending on the direction of the flow).
