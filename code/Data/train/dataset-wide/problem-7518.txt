I'm not sure you can hope for much. For example consider the case $c_n=1$ if $n$ is not a square, and $c_n=-1$ otherwise. The associated Dirichlet series has a pole at $s=1$, but of course the terms are not of fixed sign for sufficiently large $n$. In general, knowing analytic properties of a Dirichlet series (such as convergence) cannot tell you much about any of the individual terms $c_n$, since you can always change infinitely many of the $c_n$ for $n$ in a "sparse" set. 

In my situation, I have a smooth conic bundle surface $p:S \to \mathbb{P}^1$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, and I have chosen a regular model $\pi: X \to \mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{Z}}$, i.e. the morphism $\pi$ restricted to the generic fibre is exactly the morphism $p$ and every fibre is a conic. 

If such a $K$ and $D$ exist, then it would also be nice to see an explicit example. As a non-example, I believe that it follows from local and global class field theory that if $K$ is a local or global field, then every element of order $2$ in $Br(K)$ may indeed be represented by a quaternion algebra. 

The answer to 2. is yes. A sketch of a proof is as follows: $G$, being finite étale, is étale locally on $X$ isomorphic to a constant finite group scheme. Therefore, by a standard descent argument, it suffices to prove the result for constant finite group schemes. However here $Z(G), \mathrm{Aut}(G)$ and $\mathrm{Out}(G)$ are all clearly finite étale, as required. 

This result has been generalised a fair bit. The main generalisation is that you can replace congruence conditions by so-called "Frobenian conditions", namely conditions of the type which arise in the Chebotarev density theorem. There have also been some improvements in the error term, but substantial improvements are not really possible without assuming GRH. Serre has written quite a bit about such topics. See for example Theorem 2.8 of the paper: Serre - Divisibilité de certaines fonctions arithmétiques. The associated zeta functions don't admit a meromorphic continuation to all of $\mathbb{C}$ in general; they have natural boundaries along the line $\mathrm{re}(s) = 0$. You can read more about this in the paper: Hashimoto - Partial zeta functions. (the author works in an even greater generality than I describe here). 

One way to define toric varieties is as quotients of affine $n-$space by the action of some torus. However, this is not strictly true as we need to throw away "bad points" which ruin this construction. For example consider the construction of projective space as a toric variety. Let $\mathbb{G}_m$ act on $\mathbb{A}^n$ in the obvious way. Then the quotient of $\mathbb{A}^n$ by this action is a single point, as "everything is rescaled to the origin". More rigously the only functions invariant under this action are the constants, thus the quotient is the spectrum of the ground field. To fix this we of course we remove the origin and then take the quotient and we get projective space as required. So given an action of some torus on affine space, how do we know which points to remove before we take the quotient to make sure we get a toric variety? My first naive guess is to remove the points which are fixed under the action, but Im wary it may be more subtle than that, as I know GIT can get quite technical. 

Here by split I mean that the two singular lines are defined over $k(D)$, rather than conjugate over some quadratic field extension. Also I am slightly abusing notation, as really it is the generic fibre of $\pi^{-1}(D)$ over $D$ which is a conic over $k(D)$. Finally, one might expect that conic bundles for which all singular conics $\pi^{-1}(D)$ are not split over $k(D)$ are in some sense "relatively minimal". Unfortunately I can't make this precise except in the case where $\mathrm{dim}~ Y = 2$, where relatively minimal means that one may not contract any of divisors lying in the fibres of $\pi$. I would like a higher dimensional analogue of this. 

The answer is yes when $X$ and $Y$ are abelian schemes (this follows from the theory of the Néron model). In general though it is not the case that morphisms between the generic fibres extend to the special fibre. I am also particularly interested in case where $R$ is the localisation of $\mathbb{Z}$ at some prime, and hence the generic fibres are smooth proper varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$. 

Let $k$ be a field. Recall that a del Pezzo surface $S$ over $k$ is a smooth projective surface with ample anticanonical divisor $-K_S$. We define its degree to be $d = K_S^2$. We say that $S$ is minimal if every birational morphism $S \to S'$ is an isomorphism. We say that $S$ is rational if it is birational to $\mathbb{P}^2_k$ over $k$. Manin proved in his book that every minimal del Pezzo surface of degree $3$ (i.e. every cubic surface) is non-rational. My question is whether the same is true for del Pezzo surfaces of degree $d=2$ or $1$. 

Let $X$ be a smooth cubic threefold over $\mathbb{C}$. Let $F(X)$ denote the Fano variety of lines in $X$, which is a smooth surface of general type. 

I think part of your confusion lies in the definition of a finite morphism (see e.g. wikipedia). By definition, there is a finite affine open cover $U_i = \mathrm{Spec}(B_i)$ of $Y$ such that $f^{-1}(U_i) = \mathrm{Spec}(A_i)$ is affine and $A_i$ is a finite $B_i$-module. Therefore there exists some $d$ such that for all closed points $y \in |Y|$, the fibre $f^{-1}(y)$ is a finite scheme of degree at most $d$ over the residue field of $y$. In particular, there are at most $d$ points above $y$, and each such point $x$ satisfies $N(x) \geq N(y)$. One therefore obtains \begin{align*} |\zeta (X,s)| & = \prod_{x \in |X|} \left|1- N(x)^{-s}\right|^{-1} \\ & = \prod_{y \in |Y|} \prod_{\substack{x \in |X| \\ f(x) = y}} \left|1- N(x)^{-s}\right|^{-1} \\ & \leq \prod_{y \in |Y|} \left|1- N(x)^{-s}\right|^{-d} \\ & = |\zeta (Y,s)|^d. \end{align*} Hence the absolute convergence of $\zeta (X,s)$ for $\mathrm{re}(s) > \mathrm{dim}(X)$ follows from the absolute convergence of $\zeta (Y,s)$ for $\mathrm{re}(s) > \mathrm{dim}(X)=\mathrm{dim}(Y)$. 

This is proved when $G$ is a linear algebraic group in Corollary III.2.4.3 of Serre's book on Galois cohomology (p. 135 in my version). I believe it is only stated here for linear algebraic groups as Serre is at that point looking at general fields of cohomological dimension at most $1$. In the special case of finite fields where one has Lang's theorem, it seems that the proof generalises to your setting. 

First note that you can't do better than the trivial bound $q^n$ in general; for example if $q$ divides all the coefficients of the $F_i$. However this silly problem only occurs for finitely many primes (by the Chinese remainder theorem we can reduce to the case of prime powers). So let $p$ be a prime such that $V_{\mathbb{F}_p}$ has dimension $d:=\dim V$ (here I denote by $V_{\mathbb{F}_p}$ the reduction of $V$ modulo $p$). By Noether normalisation there exists a finite map $$f: V_{\mathbb{F}_p} \to \mathbb{A}^d_{\mathbb{F}_p}.$$ Let $C$ be the degree of $f$. Then we have $$\#V(\mathbb{F}_p) \leq C\#\mathbb{A}(\mathbb{F}_p) = Cp^{d}.$$ This is much easier and weaker than the Lang-Weil estimates, which are much deeper and require the Riemann hypothesis for curves. To treat prime powers, there are some subtleties. One needs to understand the cardinalities of the fibres of the map $$\#V(\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z}) \to \#V(\mathbb{F}_p) \quad (*).$$ If $V_{\mathbb{F}_p}$ is smooth, then a version of Hensel's lemma states that the fibres of the map $(*)$ all have cardinality exactly $p^{d(k-1)}$. This gives the upper bound $$\#V(\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z}) \leq Cp^{kd}.$$ By "spreading out arguments" (essentially applying Noether Normalistion to the variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ then spreading out the map), one finds an absolute constant $C$ such that $$ \#\{ \mathbf{x} \in (\mathbb{Z}/q \mathbb{Z})^n: F_{i}(\mathbf{x}) \equiv 0 (\text{mod }q) \text{ for each } 1 \leq i \leq R \} \leq C^{\omega(q)} q^{\dim V} $$ holds for those $q$ which satisfy the above conditions on the dimension of $V \bmod q$ and smooth reduction. Here $\omega(q)$ denotes the number of prime divisors of $q$. 

This is slightly vague so I will try to make more precise what I am after. Naively, one might expect that $\mathrm{res}_v(A)$ is non-zero since the fibre over $D$ is singular. However, this is not quite true as birational conic bundles should give rise to the same Brauer group element on sufficiently small open subsets of $X$. So there may be some another conic bundle also giving rise to $A$ for which the fibre over $D$ is non-singular. The following is a more precise version of the previous question which hopes to get around this issue (we use the same notation as Question 1).
