The Earth's gravity (call it the curvature of space) at the center of the Earth is approximately zero. Similarly, we assume a dense early universe was still infinite and homogeneous, so no worries, the gravity canceled out to approximately zero. There is no evidence that it was a lump of matter surrounded by an empty space, like a black hole usually is. Remember, the Big Bang happened right here where you are now, and all the matter became more and more distant from the point where you are. Simply all the distances increased all the time without matter accelerating or moving into some imagined "outer space". 

Singularity means "my theory doesn't work here". In other words, GR is unable to predict what happens at the point, so it calls this point a singularity. The most important thing is not to mistake map for the territory. GR is the map, a real black hole is the territory. GR is the map which allows us to predict what we will find in the territory. If the map says "don't really know about this point" you really shouldn't expect that when you go into the territory you will see an Unmeasurable Infinite Thing there. It's very much against our historical experience. To date, time after time we observed normal finite things in the territory, but we never have seen Unmeasurable Infinite Things. In every case when an old map said we would see infinity, we found that measurements of a territory were finite and so falsified that map (that theory). So it seems we should expect singularity as a word to only refer to the map. You really shouldn't expect to observe a singularity (a map thing) when your actual ship enters a black hole (a territory thing). It might turn out that GR is approximately right about an event horizon, but we already know it is not good enough to describe what is at the center. 

A "model" inside a brain is made by imagining something very close to reality and then by deliberately removing the details until you got something so simple that is becomes computable. You forget all the attributes of a star (color, alien civilizations around it, its prehistory, its internal dynamics) and you only think of the star as the mass, etc. This way you turn "enlightening imagination" into a "primitive mechanism usable for predicting experiences". Marjin, I'd like to say I love the style of your questioning, and I've signed up especially to attempt to answer this one question. 

It is thought likely that black holes would produce Hawking radiation and evaporate. We can't yet describe the end products of an evaporating black hole, and space is too warm to detect Hawking radiation anywhere. There are some recent new ideas regarding complementarity that are difficult to reach a decision on as well. Hawking seems to be pulling away from the black hole concept recently. I don't know what to make of that. Regarding particle colliders: every few years some team gets into the general news cycle with an announcement about detections that resemble particular models of black hole behavior. Miscommunication tends to produce journalism about real black holes being created. Now there may be developing interest in the possibility of the galactic core lighting up. Maybe that would lead to better journalism. 

First, note that by the time Andromeda is close enough for collisions with wandering stars to become a concern, Earth's average temperature will have changed significantly, and the planet will be unrecognizable. When Sol is 8.5 billion years old, it will still have hydrogen available for fusion, but as it fuses it contracts and expands differentially. The contraction causes hydrogen fusion to become more favorable, so that Sol will have 50% greater power output ($6 \times {10}^{26}\ \mathrm{W}$) and 3% greater effective temperature ($6000\ \mathrm{K}$). Fusion also causes Sol to lose mass at a prodigious rate (currently $4 \times {10}^9 \mathrm{kg/s}$); it will release $6 \times {10}^{43} \mathrm{J}$ from fusion, which corresponds to $7 \times {10}^{26}\ \mathrm{kg}$. That is about one hundred Earth masses of sunlight but only $1 \over 3000$ the mass of Sol. Gravitation with Earth decreases proportionally, so Earth's orbit might on average expand $3000\ \mathrm{km}$ per billion years. Other gravitational effects might change Earth's average distance by as much as $6 \times {10}^5\ \mathrm{km}$, 4‰ of an astronomical unit. Expansion of Sol's outer layers due to reduced gravitation will increase its radius by 20%, $3 \times {10}^5\ \mathrm{km}$. Thus Earth will receive nearly 50% more power as well. The energy balance of Earth wrt Sol gives the expected surface temperature: $$ \begin{align} \bar{a} = & 0.7 & \small\text{(Average absorption)} \\ P_p = & 1366\ \mathrm{W/m^2} & \small\text{(Average solar flux incident on Earth at present)} \\ P_f = & P_p \cdot 1.5 \approx 2000\ \mathrm{W/m^2} & \small\text{(In future)} \\ \sigma = & 5.670373 \times {10}^{-8}\ \mathrm{W/m^2/K^4} & \small\text{(Stefan-Boltzmann constant)} \\ \\ T_p^4 = & \frac{\bar{a} P_p}{4 \sigma} \\ \approx & \frac{0.7 \cdot 1366\ \mathrm{W/m^2}}{2.268149 \times {10}^{-7}\ \mathrm{W/m^2/K^4}} \\ \approx & 4.2 \times {10}^9\ \mathrm{K^4} \\ T_p \approx & 250\ \mathrm{K} \\ \\ T_f \approx & T_p \cdot {1.5}^{1/4} \approx T_p \cdot 1.11 \\ \approx & 280\ \mathrm{K} \end{align} $$ Since the average surface temperature on Earth is not $-20\ \mathrm{°C}$ — it is $+15\ \mathrm{°C}$ and already around $8\ \mathrm{K}$ warmer than in an airless future — we can see the atmosphere has a significant role in retaining heat. Assuming increasing cooling needs do not lead to the atmosphere retaining more heat, the average surface temperature can be expected to rise to $+50\ \mathrm{°C}$. The average temperature of Antarctica is now $240\ \mathrm{K}$ in winter and $270\ \mathrm{K}$ in summer. These can be expected to rise to $270\ \mathrm{K}$ (just below freezing) and $300\ \mathrm{K}$ (well above freezing) respectively, and this is a best-case scenario. Antarctica will melt. That will produce the largest component (60%) of sea level increase, in total around $100\ \mathrm{m}$. 

in physics we were learning about the universe and the big bang. we were being told that everything came from one point and 'exploded' outwards, and is continuing to expand. I felt that this explanation was unclear, so I said that it was more like everything being one the surface of an expanding 'balloon', but with an extra dimension, a space which is the hyper surface of the expanding universe. my teacher disagreed and said it was just like a big explosion. I think this is wrong-it implies that there is an edge of some description, or that the universe is just an expanding sphere of stuff inside infinite space. what is the best way to visualise the universe? 

hawking radiation. electrons and positrons created from the vacuum must 'repay' their energy, usually through annihilation of each other. however, if one crosses through the event horizon of a black hole and the other escapes, the energy from the black hole as well as that of the particle will 'repay' and the escaped particle becomes real. this is a very slow process and in most circumstances I would assume that a black hole would accumulate more energy than it loses. 

I was just wondering what the normal amount of planets is in a star system, because in my mind 8 planets seems like a relatively large amount. so are we above average? can we even see all the exoplanets in one star system? also, do we know if belts of asteroids are common? is it even likely for a star to have planets? 

Simple question: I read that the axial tilt of Uranus is 97.77 degrees. I don't understand why it would be this instead of 82.23 degrees the other way. It seems like saying that the Earth's axial tilt is 157 degrees rather than 23, or something. can someone explain why Uranus's axial tilt is bigger than 90 degrees? EDIT: this is not a question of how it came to be so tilted, I am sure that is answered elsewhere, but simply why it is accepted as being bigger than 90 degrees rather than less than 90 degrees the other way. it is the same for Venus. 

If Earth were still inhabited four billion years from now, it is extremely unlikely that Earth would fall into a star from Andromeda. 

The Milky Way is about 100,000 light years in diameter and contains about 400 billion stars. Andromeda is bigger and denser; it may have one trillion stars and a diameter of 140,000 light years. It is 2.5 million light years away but appears six times larger than Sol. $$ \begin{align} d_M \approx & \frac{4 \times {10}^{11}\ \mathrm{stars}}{{10}^{10} \pi/4\ \mathrm{{ly}^2}} \\ \approx & 50\ \mathrm{stars/{ly}^2} \\ \\ d_A \approx & \frac{{10}^{12}\ \mathrm{stars}}{2 \times {10}^{10} \pi/4\ \mathrm{{ly}^2}} \\ \approx & 60\ \mathrm{stars/{ly}^2} \\ \end{align} $$ If the two galaxies were simply superposed, there would be about one hundred stars per square light year, viewed from infinitely far along the rotation axis. However, the Milky Way is a 2:1 ellipse as seen from Andromeda, while we see Andromeda as a 3:1 ellipse. Projecting both onto a plane between them, perpendicular to a line between their central black holes, would give a region of overlap with dimensions between $50 \times 50\ \mathrm{{kly}^2}$ and $50 \times 100\ \mathrm{{kly}^2}$, with at most half the Milky Way outside it. Sol is likely to be involved in the collision, since it is about 27,200 light years from the galactic center. That doesn't mean, though, that Earth will come close to another star, that Sol might collide, or that the solar system will be disrupted. Considering probabilistically the worst-case scenario (the entire Milky Way falls through Andromeda on their first pass), there is a mean free path for stars. The actual stellar density of the colliding galaxies is: $$ \rho \approx 1.4 \times {10}^{12}\ \mathrm{stars}\ /\ V_{A \cup M} $$ where the union of the two galaxies' volumes would be a very complicated expression. Very roughly, their volumes can be described as joined cones, ignoring their spheroidal dark matter halos (which are mostly harmless). $$ \begin{align} \rho \approx & \frac{1.4 \times {10}^{12}\ \mathrm{stars}} {\left( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left( {10}^3\ \mathrm{ly} \cdot {10}^{10} \pi/4\ \mathrm{{ly}^2} + 1.4 \times {10}^3\ \mathrm{ly} \cdot 2 \times {10}^{10} \pi/4\ \mathrm{{ly}^2} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{3} \right)} \\ \approx & 0.28\ \mathrm{stars/{ly}^3} \\ \\ V_\star \approx & 3.6\ \mathrm{{ly}^3} \\ \\ r_\star \approx & {\left( V_\star \cdot \frac{3}{4 \pi} \right)}^{1/3} \\ \approx & 0.95\ \mathrm{ly} \end{align} $$ At a distance of 1.9 light years, Betelgeuse would look a lot like Mars. If we assume disaster results from a star closer than the diameter of the heliosphere (about 200 AU), then: $$ \begin{align} m = & \frac{1\ \mathrm{star}}{\rho \cdot \pi \cdot 4 \times {10}^4\ \mathrm{{AU}^2}} \\ \approx & 1.1 \times {10}^{21}\ \mathrm{m} \\ \approx & 7.2 \times {10}^9\ \mathrm{AU} \\ \approx & 1.1 \times {10}^5\ \mathrm{ly} \end{align} $$ On average, a star can travel 110 thousand light years before it grazes past another, slightly less than the diameter of Andromeda. The proportion of stars from the Milky Way that do not approach within 200 AU of stars in Andromeda is at least $1/e^{1.4 / 1.1} \approx 100/400\ \mathrm{billion\ stars}$. For Earth to approach within 4 AU of another star (one Betelgeuse radius), it can be expected to travel at least 2500 times farther, which at a relative velocity of 300 km/s would take $9 \times {10}^{18}\ \mathrm{s} \approx 300\ \mathrm{billion\ years}$.
