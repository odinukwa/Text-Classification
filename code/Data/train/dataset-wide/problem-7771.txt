We use this to cope with the fact that we'd like that $(E)'_{\mc U} = (E')_{\mc U}$ but this is only true if $E$ is super-reflexive. Suppose that $E$ is reflexive but not super-reflexive, so that $(E)_{\mc U}$ is not reflexive. Hence we can find sequences $(x^{(n)})$ in $(E)_{\mc U}$ and $(\mu^{(n)})$ in $(E)_{\mc U}'$ such that $$ \lim_n \lim_m \ip{\mu^{(n)}}{x^{(m)}} \not= \lim_m \lim_n \ip{\mu^{(n)}}{x^{(m)}}. $$ That is, the iterated limits exist, but are not equal. By the above result, we may suppose that each $\mu^{(n)} \in (E')_{\mc U}$. For each $n$ let $x^{(n)} = (x^{(n)}_i) \in (E)_{\mc U}$ and $\mu^{(n)} = (\mu^{(n)}_i) \in (E')_{\mc U}$. Fix $y\in E, \phi\in E'$ with $\ip{\phi}{y}=1$. For each $n,i$ let $$ a^{(n)}_i = \mu^{(n)}_i \otimes y, \qquad b^{(n)}_i = \phi \otimes x^{(n)}_i. $$ Let $a^{(n)} = (a^{(n)}_i) \in (A)_{\mc U}$ and $b^{(n)} = (b^{(n)}_i) \in (A)_{\mc U}$. Define $$ \psi : (A)_{\mc U}\rightarrow\mathbb C; \quad \psi((c_i)) = \lim_{i\rightarrow\mc U} \ip{\phi}{c_i(y)} \qquad ((c_i)\in (A)_{\mc U}). $$ Then $$ \ip{\psi}{a^{(n)}b^{(m)}} = \lim_{i\rightarrow\mc U} \ip{\phi}{a^{(n)}_i b^{(m)}_i(y)} = \lim_{i\rightarrow\mc U} \ip{\mu^{(n)}_i}{x^{(m)}_i} = \ip{\mu^{(n)}}{x^{(m)}}. $$ Hence the iterated limits of $\ip{\psi}{a^{(n)}b^{(m)}}$ are not equal, and so $(A)_{\mc U}$ is not Arens regular. 

This is an expansion of Nik Weaver's comments. I'm using Effros+Ruan, "Operator Spaces" as a reference, but this is no doubt a little overkill. A unital CP map is self-adjoint, so $f(B) \subseteq A$ is a (non-closed) operator system, namely a linear subspace which is unital and self-adjoint. (Most results in this area assume a closed subspace, but this is unnecessary). We have the following result: 

Suppose I have a Banach space $E$ (which may be finite dimensional if you wish), a Hilbert space $H$ and a tensor $\tau \in H\otimes E$ in the algebraic tensor product. There are lots of ways to choose a measure $\mu$ and an isometry (not assumed surjective) $\theta:H\rightarrow L^2(\mu)$. Then $(\theta\otimes\iota)\tau \in L^2(\mu)\otimes E \subseteq L^2(\mu;E)$, and so I can compute the norm of $(\theta\otimes\iota)\tau$ in the vector-valued space $L^2(\mu;E)$. 

Do you think you have "three year's research experience outside of the EU"? If so, you could look at a Marie Curie International Reintegration Grants: $URL$ Fortunately the deadline is September; you'd need to find somewhere in the EU to support your application (such a grant doesn't bring overheads, so people won't be falling over themselves to host you, but it does pay salary etc.) Marie Curie grants are competitive, but I think are a little less competitive than some national based grants. 

A (reasonably) standard trick to convert finite-dimensional limiting type problems into single, infinite dimensional problems is to use Ultraproducts (or non-standard hulls, if you know more model theory than I do). Let $(E_i)$ be a family of Banach spaces on an index set $I$, and let $\ell^\infty(I,E_i)$ be the Banach space of all bounded families $(x_i)_{i\in I}$ where $x_i\in E_i$. Let $U$ be a non-principal ultrafilter on $I$, and consider $N_U=\{ (x_i)\in\ell^\infty(I,E_i) : \lim_{i\rightarrow U} \|x_i\|=0 \}$. This is a closed subspace, so we can form the quotient Banach space $\ell^\infty(I,E_i) / N_U$. This is the ultraproduct on the $(E_i)$. If $E_i=E$ for all $i$, we get an ultrapower of $E$. (If you know about ultraproducts from logic, there are the obvious "normed" definitions). Heinrich has a nice paper in Crelles on this. For example, Dvoretzky's theorem now becomes: for any infinite dimensional Banach space $X$, all ultrapowers of $X$ contain an isometric copy of $\ell^2$. (Okay, so I've lost some constants). I'm not sure quite how to get this into a category theory setting, however. 

As I'm leaving too many comments... For a compact group $G$, you write $$ L(G) = \bigoplus_{\pi\in\hat G} \dim(\pi)\pi. $$ This isn't quite correct. $L(G)$ is the von Neumann algebra generated by the left regular representation $\lambda:G\rightarrow B(L^2(G))$. What you mean is that $$ \lambda = \bigoplus_{\pi\in\hat G} \dim(\pi)\pi. $$ Perhaps I shouldn't write "=" here; this is isomorphism of representations. This means that $$L(G) = \prod_{\pi\in\hat G} \mathbb M_{\dim(\pi)}. $$ That is, the algebra of each irreducible is a full matrix algebra (because $\pi$ is finite-dimensional, and irreducible). We no longer worry about the $\dim(\pi)$ part, because the von Neumann algebras generated by $\pi$ or $n\pi$ are canonically isomorphic. To be explicit-- if $\pi$ is irreducible, then $\pi$ is primary. But $\pi\oplus\pi$ is also primary, and obviously not irreducible. The point is that the projection onto the first or second coordinate shows that $\pi\oplus\pi$ is not irreducible. But these projections are not in the von Neumann algebra $L(\pi\oplus\pi)$. Indeed, this is generated by the operators of the form $\pi(g)\oplus\pi(g)$, and so weak continuity (or a bicommutant argument) shows that any member of $L(\pi\oplus\pi)$ is of the form $x\oplus x$. Hence the map $L(\pi) \rightarrow L(\pi\oplus\pi)$ sending $x\mapsto x\oplus x$ is an isomorphism. Knapp's Notices article alludes to the fact that the left regular representation $\lambda$ of $\mathbb F_2$ is primary but not irreducible. It's a fun, and not too hard, exercise to show that $L(\mathbb F_2)$ is a factor; I don't know a good explanation of why $\lambda$ is not irreducible or even quasi-equivalent to a direct sum of irreducibles. Finally, you ask if all irreducibles appear in $L(G)$. Again, I think you mean: do all irreducibles appear in $\lambda$? Well, the trivial representation occurs in $\lambda$ if and only if $\lambda$ is amenable; if $G$ is amenable, then all irreducibles occur in $\lambda$. Again, I'm not sure of a good reference-- maybe the recent book by Valette et al. on Kazhdan's property (T) (I'm not quite an expert on this stuff, so I might have glossed over some technicalities and/or used the wrong language...) 

Let's start with a general lemma. Let $E,F$ be Banach spaces, $E\overline\otimes F$ be the completion of a reasonable crossnorm. Let $\newcommand{\mc}{\mathcal}T\in\mc L(E), S\in\mc L(F)$ be such that $T\otimes I = I\otimes S$. Then $T=S$ is a scalar multiple of the identity. This follows, as pick $f\in F, f^*\in F^*$ with $f^*(f)=1$. Then $$ T(e) = f^*(f) T(e) = f^*(S(f)) e \qquad (e\in E). $$ Thus $T = \alpha I$ where $\alpha = f^*(S(f))\in\mathbb C$. Then $\alpha I\otimes I = I\otimes S$ so $S=\alpha I$. So if your case, we get that $[A^*,A] = -[B^*,B]$ is a scalar multiple of the identity. Now use the famous result that the commutant of two bounded operators cannot be a non-zero multiple of the identity. So $A$ and $B$ are normal. 

Can't you argue as follows: given $f\in L^\infty(G\times G)$ for any $a\in L^1(G)$ define $f_a$ by $$ f_a(s) = \int_G f(s,t) a(t) \ dt. $$ Then $f_a\in L^\infty(G,\mathbb R)$ with $\|f_a\| \leq \|f\| \|a\|$. Thus the map $$L^1(G) \rightarrow \mathbb R, \quad a\mapsto m(f_a) $$ is bounded and linear, and so there is some $g=m_f\in L^\infty(G)$ with $$ \int_G g(s) a(s) = m(f_a) \qquad (a\in L^1(G)). $$ Now define $\tilde m$ by $$ \tilde m(f) = m(g). $$ Then, let $x,y\in G$ and define $\hat f(s,t) = f(xs,yt)$, say $\hat f = (x,y)\cdot f$. Then check, for the obvious notation, that $$ \hat f_a = x\cdot f_{y^{-1}\cdot a}, \quad \hat g = y^{-1} \cdot g, \quad \tilde m(\hat f) = m(y^{-1}\cdot g)=m(g) = \tilde m(f), $$ so $\tilde m$ is left invariant. Notice I use that $m$ is left invariant in the calculation of $\tilde m(\hat g)$, and in the calculation of $\hat g$. Finally, clearly if $f=1$ then $g=1$ and so $\tilde m(f)=1$. Then set $f=\chi_{B\times G}$ so that $g = m(B) 1$ and hence $\tilde m(f) = m(B)$ as you want. 

Some partial results: By Hewitt+Ross, Theorem 22.18 ($URL$ a Borel measurable homomorphism between two locally compact groups is continuous if the codomain is separable or $\sigma$-compact. (I think this result goes back to Banach). A nice paper (see edit below!), which proves some similar results, is: MR1473172 (98i:22003) Neeb, Karl-Hermann(D-ERL-MI) On a theorem of S. Banach. (English summary) J. Lie Theory 7 (1997), no. 2, 293–300. $URL$ I'm afraid that I don't know the limits of these sort of results (i.e. a counter-example in the non-separable case, say), or if being an automorphisms gives anything more. Edit: As Julien points out in a comment, this paper of Neeb is a little suspect, so I withdraw my recommendation. André Henriques shows, in a short argument, that given a bijective group homomorphism which is measurable for the completed Haar measure, the homomorphism must be continuous. I was a bit worried about the difference between "measurable" in the sense of "inverse image of open set is Borel or Haar measurable" and this stronger sense. But I think uniqueness of Haar measures rescues us. Indeed, if $\tau:G\rightarrow G$ is a continuous automorphism of $G$, then the map $A\mapsto |\tau(A)|$ will be a left invariant measure; as $\tau$ is a homeomorphism, this measure also assigns finite measure to compacts, and non-zero measure to open sets. Thus it will be proportional to the Haar measure. As $\tau$ preserves Borel sets, it follows that it will preserve all the Haar measurable sets, and so will be measurable in this strong sense. Note that the example of Robin Chapman shows that this isn't necessarily so for a merely injective, continuous homomorphism. 

I think this works. Suppose $B(X)$ with WOT is second countable, so there is a countable base to the topology $(U_n)$. This means that if $(T_i)$ is a net in $B(X)$, then $T_i\rightarrow 0$ WOT if and only if, for each $n$ with $0\in U_n$, there is $i_n$ so that $i\geq i_n \implies T_i\in U_n$. Each WOT open set is of the form $$ \mathcal U(T_0,(x_j),(x_j^*)) := \{ T\in B(X) : |\langle (T-T_0)(x_j), x_j^* \rangle|\leq 1 \ (j=1,\cdots,n)\} $$ where $T_0\in B(X), (x_j)_{j=1}^n\subseteq X, (x_j^*)_{j=1}^n\subseteq X^*$. Let $Q\subseteq X^*$ be the collection of all $x_j^*$ which occur for some $U_n$. Thus $Q$ is countable, and so the rational linear combinations of $Q$ is also a countable set. Towards a contradiction, suppose that $X^*$ is not separable. Hence the closed linear span on $Q$ is not all of $X^*$. Thus there is $f_0\in X^*$ and a (bounded) net $(x_i)$ in $X$ such that $f_0(x_i)=1$ for each $i$ but $x^*(x_i)\rightarrow 0$ for each $x^*\in Q$. Choose some $f_1\in X^*$ and let $T_i$ be the rank-one operator $x\mapsto f_1(x) x_i$. Let $U_n$ have the form $\mathcal U(T_0,(x_j),(x_j^*))$. As each $x_j^*\in Q$ we have that $$ \langle T_i(x_j), x_j^* \rangle = f_1(x_j) x_j^*(x_i) \rightarrow 0 $$ and so as $0\in U_n$, if $i$ is sufficiently large also $T_i\in U_n$. This is a contradiction, as if $f_1(x_1)=1$ say, then $\langle T_i(x_1), f_0 \rangle = f_0(x_i) = 1$ for all $i$, and so $T_i\not\rightarrow 0$ WOT. Thus $X^*$ is separable. 

Maybe I'll risk an answer. It is perhaps natural to expect that the projection maps $$ P_X: Z\rightarrow X; \qquad P_Y:Z\rightarrow Y $$ be bounded. If so, then $Y \cong \ker P_X$ is closed in $Z$, and $X\cong\ker P_Y$ is closed in $Z$. By the Open Mapping Theorem, $Z/Y \cong X$ and $Z/X\cong Y$, which means that the norm on $Z$ is equivalent to the norm $\|(x,y)\|_1 = \|x\|+\|y\|$. Conversely, of course, if $Z$ has a norm equivalent to $\|\cdot\|_1$, then the projections will be bounded. So: the natural projections are bounded if and only if you have a "nice" norm on $Z$. 

I know quite a bit about the abstract theory of Interpolation of Banach spaces. Today I had a colleague from Environmental sciences (who used to be in our Applied Maths department) come and ask me about (complex) interpolation of Sobolev spaces. I was, in the end, able to explain enough to give him a "black box" which seemed to do enough (recover norm estimates for odd cases from formula established for even cases by partial integration techniques). Now, the book which he'd been pointed to (by another book) was "Interpolation spaces" by Bergh and Lofstrom. I've read this, of course, but it takes a (almost caricatured) pure maths approach: you have to read it cover to cover to catch all the definition etc. So my question is: 

By the Tietze theorem, the restriction map $C(\beta X) \rightarrow C(\beta X \setminus U)$ is a surjection. So we can identify $C(\beta X\setminus U)$ with the quotient $C(\beta X) / \{ f\in C(\beta X) : f(x)=0 \ (x\not\in U) \}$. So by the above, we identify $C(\beta X \setminus U)$ with $C^b(X) / \{ F\in C^b(X) : F(x)=0 \ (x\not\in U) \}$. If $X$ is normal, then we can again use Tietze to extend any $F\in C^b(X\setminus U)$ to all of $X$. It follows that $C^b(X) / \{ F\in C^b(X) : F(x)=0 \ (x\not\in U) \}$ is isomorphic to $C^b(X\setminus U) = C(\beta(X\setminus U))$. So $\beta X \setminus U = \beta (X\setminus U)$ (in a fairly canonical way) under the hypotheses that $X$ is normal and $U$ is relatively compact. (I'm not sure what happens for non-normal $X$. For $X=\mathbb R$ and $U$ an open interval, we obviously don't need Tietze.) 

Let $E$ be a Banach space, and let $(\sigma_t)$ be a strongly continuous one-parameter group on $E$: so for $t\in\mathbb R$, we have that $\sigma_t$ is a contraction on $E$, $\sigma_t \sigma_s=\sigma_{t+s}$, $\sigma_0$ is the identity, and for each $x\in E$, the map $\mathbb R\rightarrow E; t\mapsto\sigma_t(x)$ is continuous. We have the notion of the analytic continuation of $(\sigma_t)$. For example, set $S(i) = \{ z=t+iy\in\mathbb C : 0<y<1 \}$ with closure $\overline{S(i)}$. Then $D(\sigma_i)$ consists of those $x\in E$ such that there is a bounded continuous map $f:\overline{S(i)}\rightarrow E$ with $f$ analytic on $S(i)$, and with $f(t) = \sigma_t(x)$ for $t\in\mathbb R$. Then we set $\sigma_i(x) = f(i)$. Then $\sigma_i$ is a densely defined, closed operator. Under favourable circumstances, the following is somehow "folklore": 

Okay, this is very far from being a complete answer. But... Firstly, if you are interested in $\mathbb R$ acting on $M$ by the modular automorphism group (which is an incredibly interesting object!) then you're getting dangerously close to trying to understand all the Type III factors. Compare with Takesaki's "solution" to this problem (see Takesaki volume 2, or his paper in Acta, 1973. Another place to look is two (IMHO much overlooked) papers by Haagerup, "On the dual weights for crossed products of von Neumann algebras. I." and "II." in Math. Scand. 43 (1978/79). In particular, Section 2 of the 2nd paper is an excellent resource if you are interested in the weight on the group von Neumann algebra. But, I doubt this will answer your original question. Maybe a real expert will wonder by...
