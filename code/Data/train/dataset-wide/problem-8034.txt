Let $C$ be a compact Riemann surface, let $C^2$ be the cartesian square of $C$, let $J(C)$ be the degree zero Jacobian of $C$, and let $\delta : C^2 \to J(C)$ be the map $(x,y) \mapsto [\mathcal{O}(x-y)]$. In this paper $URL$ of Hain and Reed, page 9, they say that it is an elementary exercise in algebraic topology to show that $\delta^\ast(\phi) = \Delta + (\psi_1 + \psi_2)/2$. Explanation of notation: 

Let $\pi : C_g \to M_g$ be the universal curve over the moduli stack of genus $g$ curves. Let $\omega_\pi$ be the relative canonical bundle. Then $\mathbb{H} := \pi_\ast \omega_\pi$ is a rank $g$ vector bundle, and it is called the Hodge bundle. Its $i$-th Chern class $c_i(\mathbb{H})$ is denoted by $\lambda_i$. These classes are called Hodge classes. 

There is a conjecture of Kontsevich which states that Hochschild (co)homology of the Fukaya category of a compact symplectic manifold $X$ is the (co)homology of the manifold. (See page 18 of Kontsevich's "Homological algebra of mirror symmetry" paper and page 16 of Costello's paper "TCFTs and CY categories".) Moreover: 

How about any countably infinite group with trivial topology (the only open sets are the empty set and everything)? 

I think graph theory is a good source for nice "labs" (see Deane Yang's post)... There are nice activities you can do involving: 

Hey Theo --- I don't think it is reasonable to expect Lagrangian fibrations to be cotangent bundles globally. Easy example: take a 2d torus, give it a symplectic form (equivalently a volume form in this case); every 1d submanifold is automatically Lagrangian; the torus is a circle bundle over a circle; realizing it this way, it is a fibration over the circle with fibers being Lagrangian circles. Certainly this is not a cotangent bundle. Another example, integrable systems yield Lagrangian fibrations over R^n: these are usually not cotangent bundles. See the section on integrable systems in Cannas da Silva's book. 

Try looking up some references on rational homotopy theory. Rational homotopy theory studies the homotopy groups tensor Q, so basically you kill all torsion information. If we focus only on homotopy groups tensor Q, the question you ask becomes easier. As Steven Sam mentions in the comments, the homotopy groups of spheres are really crazy. But the rational homotopy groups of spheres are quite tractable (in fact completely known, by a theorem of Serre) and can be more or less obtained from cohomology, if I recall correctly. One particularly impressive theorem, of Deligne-Griffiths-Morgan-Sullivan, says that if your space is a compact KÃ¤hler manifold (e.g. a smooth complex projective variety), and if you know its rational cohomology ring, then you can compute for instance the ranks of all of its homotopy groups (maybe you need an extra assumption that the space is simply connected or has nilpotent fundamental group). 

Try Patrick Clarke's paper Duality for Toric Landau-Ginzburg Models, which contains a general procedure for determining mirrors of (not necessarily compact) toric varieties (with superpotential, or without (i.e. with superpotential = 0)). 

This is just a rephrasing of Deane's answer, but let me add one general comment. To any Riemannian metric (or pseudo-Riemannian metric) $g$ on a manifold $M$, you can associate a Levi-Civita connection $\nabla : T_M \to T_M \otimes \Omega_M$, where $T_M$ is the cotangent sheaf and $\Omega_M$ is the cotangent sheaf. Just like how the de Rham $d : \mathcal{O}_M \to \Omega_M$ can be extended to $d : \Omega_M^i \to \Omega_M^{i+1}$, the connection $\nabla : T_M \to T_M \otimes \Omega_M$ can be extended to $\nabla : T_M \otimes \Omega_M^i \to T_m \otimes \Omega_M^{i+1}$. Then being able to find local coordinates $x_i$ such that $g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$ is equivalent to $\nabla^2 = \nabla \circ \nabla : T_M \to T_M \otimes \Omega_M^2$, which corresponds to the Riemann curvature tensor that Deane mentions, being zero. This should be reminiscent of the $d^2 = 0$ of de Rham cohomology, or homological algebra in general... ;-) It is perhaps not-so-standard (or not as standard as I would like) to talk about connections in terms of sheaves, but this point of view is better because it generalizes better. What I said above works in all of the "standard" geometric categories: $C^\infty$, real analytic, complex analytic, super-, etc. (Maybe it even works in the algebraic category? But I'm not sure, as the notion of local coordinates is more complicated in algebraic geometry.) 

I am looking for the Oxford PhD thesis of S. Agnihotri, "Quantum cohomology and the Verlinde algebra". I can't seem to find it online. Does anyone know how / where I can find this? Thank you! 

There is supposed to be a philosophy that, at least over a field of characteristic zero, every "deformation problem" is somehow "governed" or "controlled" by a differential graded Lie algebra. See for example $URL$ I've seen this idea attributed to big names like Quillen, Drinfeld, and Deligne -- so it must be true, right? ;-) An example of this philosophy is the deformation theory of a compact complex manifold: It is "controlled" by the Kodaira-Spencer dg Lie algebra: holomorphic vector fields tensor Dolbeault complex, with differential induced by del-bar on the Dolbeault complex, and Lie bracket induced by Lie bracket on the vector fields (I think also take wedge product on the Dolbeault side). I seem to recall that there is a general theorem which justifies this philosophy, but I don't remember the details, or where I heard about it. The statement of the theorem should be something like: 

One way to concretely realize the Kodaira-Spencer map is via Cech cohomology. Take a vector field downstairs, lift it to a vector field upstairs, and apply the Cech differential to the lifted vector field... (I had posted another answer, but then I realized that what I wrote was nonsense...) 

Let A be an algebra (or dg algebra). Where can I find a proof of HH_*(A) = HH_*(Mod_A) and HH^*(A) = HH^*(Mod_A)? (And does this hold for any A?) Here Mod_A is, e.g., the category of left A-modules. One reason why this is interesting/important/useful is because many categories which arise "in nature" are of the form Mod_A. For example, there is a theorem of Bondal and van den Bergh which states that derived categories of a large class of varieties (I forget their exact hypotheses) are equivalent to Mod_A for some A. Dyckerhoff also proved that categories of matrix factorizations are of this form. By mirror symmetry, Fukaya-type categories should be of this form as well... Anyway, so to compute HH of such a category, it suffices to find this A and then compute HH(A). I think that it generally(?) should be easier to compute HH of an algebra than HH of a category. (Of course finding this A can be a very nontrivial task.)
