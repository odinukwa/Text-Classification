So now it should be pretty clear how to translate between the different viewpoints (modulo some natural isomorphisms). For example, every tangent vector $X \in T_e E$ can be written as a sum $X^v + X^h$, where $X^v = \omega(X)$ and $X^h$ is the horizontal lift of some vector $Y \in T_{\pi(e)}M$. 

I find the following viewpoint helpful to translate between the different incarnation of a connection. To every vector bundle $\pi: E \to M$ (in your case $E = TM$) we have an associated exact sequence of vector bundles (sometimes called the Atiyah sequence, at least in the principal bundle case): $$ 0 \to V E \to TE \to \pi^* TM \to 0 $$ Here $VE$ denotes the bundle of vertical tangent bundles. Now there are three ways to split an exact sequence: 

The easiest way to see that the norm of the curvature corresponds to the energy is to consider the special case of an abelian U(1)-Yang-Mills theory (i.e. electrodynamics). If you write out the norm squared of the curvature in terms of the $E$ and $B$ fields you get the expression $E^2 + B^2$. This is exactly the familiar energy density of an electrodynamic field, see for example wikipedia. 

I'm trying to understand the definition of a differential form on $M$ in the context of Fréchet spaces or, more generally, locally convex spaces. The standard procedure defines a k-form as a map $\alpha: M \rightarrow L^k_{\text{alt}}(TM)$ such that the coordinate representation $U \times E^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is smooth. Here, $L^k_{\text{alt}}(TM)$ denotes the space of k-multilinear, skew-symmetric and continuous maps on $TM$. Another method ([1], [2]) endows the spaces $L^k_{\text{alt}}(T_mM)$ with the strong topology, constructs a vector bundle structure for $\Lambda^k M := \bigcup_m L^k_{\text{alt}}(T_mM)$ and finally defines differential forms as smooth sections of this bundle. I have two questions about this later construction: 1) How is the smooth structure of $\Lambda^k M$ defined? 

The requirement of an irreducible representation (and thus of a 'not to big' Hilbert space) can be motivated by mainly two points: 

extends the notion of a slice to the case where the underlying space is not a manifold but only a stratified space. They also proof a slice theorem in this setting, but this is clearly adjusted to the discussed case of General Relativity. 

In more detail, one finds the following result (slightly paraphrased) in Dieudonne's Treatise on Analysis Vol.1 (10.7.2): 

The classical phase space of the spin degrees of freedom is represented by the two-sphere with a symplectic form given by $s$ times the standard volume form. This is clearly no cotangent bundle to some configuration space (and in particular non-exact). Geometric quantization results in the well-known quantization $2s \in \mathbb{Z}$. By the way, examples arising from symplectic reduction are very natural and important. Often this is the only procedure available to endow a space with a symplectic structure. 

If you just require that the holonomies coincide for the canonical $2g$ loops, then the answer is not that easy. In the abelian case, these holonomies determine the topological structure of the bundle (which is given by an element of $H^1(M, U(1))$) and you need the curvature form to reconstruct the connection up to gauge transformation. I think, this picture generalizes at least to central (Yang-Mills) connections (see the paper by Atiyah and Bott 1983 and some follow-ups by Huebschmann). 

The variational bicomplex seams to provide a modern formulation of the variational problem in terms of modern differential geometry. In particular the bigraded complex of differential forms $\Omega^{p,q} (J^\infty E)$ with $D = \delta + d$ on the infinite jet bundle of some vector bundle $E$ encodes all the information from the Lagrangian view: If $L \in \Omega^{0, n}$ is the Lagrangian density and $\theta \in \Omega^{1, n-1}$ the variational form than $\delta L + d \theta$ equals the Euler-Lagrange equation. Futhermore as $\omega = \delta \theta \in \Omega^{2, n-1}$ is $\delta$-closed (and also $d$-closed on solutions) it seams natural to regard it as a generalized symplectic form. But I couldn't find any account on the Hamiltion viewpoint (Legendre transformation, Hamiltion equation, Hamiltion Jacobi, Poisson structure, ect.). What are the possible routes to generalize symplectic geometry to this regime and what are the problems one is faced with? The standard procedure seams to be to choose an Cauchy surface of the base manifold and integrate $\omega$ over it to get a (pre)symplectic form. But there seams to be issues for non-compact Cauchy surfaces and the independence wrt. to the choosen surface does not work off-shell. Also this approach is not really "in the spirit" of the variational bicomplex, so I search for alternatives. 

As Henry T. Horton already pointed out, there exists a Fréchet version of the inverse function theorem. Therefore, the easiest way to get an intuition about what can go wrong with the classical Banach-inverse function theorem in the Fréchet context is to consider the stronger requirements of the Nash-Moser-Theorem: 

Let $M$ be a Riemann surface and $P \to M$ a principal $G$-bundle (with compact structure group $G$). Fix a connection $A$ in $P$ and consider a nearby connection $B$, which is in Coulomb gauge relative to $A$. That is, the difference $\alpha = A - B$ satisfies $d^*_A \alpha = 0$ and is small in the $C^\infty$-topology. I'm interested in the operator $d_B \, d^*_A = d_A \, d^*_A + [\alpha \wedge d^*_A \,\cdot ]$ on $2$-forms with values in the adjoint bundle. Of course, for $A = B$ this is just the covariant Laplacian $\triangle_A = d_A \, d^*_A$. So the operator $d_B \, d^*_A$ is elliptic and has vanishing index for close enough connections $A, B$. Question: Does $\ker d_B \, d^*_A = \ker \triangle_A$ holds so that $d_B \, d^*_A$ induces a bijective operator $B^2_A \to B^2_A$ as it is the case for $\triangle_A$ (here $B^2_A = \mathrm{img} \,d_A$)? What I have so far are estimates of the form $||\, [\alpha \wedge d^*_A \,\beta ]\,||_{L^p} \leq ||\,\alpha\,||_{W^{1,q}} \, ||\,\beta\,||_{W^{2,p}}$ for the perturbation term. However, I'm unable to convert these estimates into statements about the (co)kernel of $d_B \, d^*_A$. In my situation, $A$ is even a central Yang-Mills connection if this fact changes things. 

Normally the theory of (elliptic) differential operators between vector bundles (or $\mathbb{R}^n$) is presented in the language of Sobolev spaces. I'm searching for a book (or something similar) which exposes the theory completely in the setting of smooth sections, that is using Fréchet space techniques. In particular, I'm interested in how the Fredholm theory translates into Fréchet spaces. The basic results should transfer without big modifications, however some results are not so straightforward (like "Fredholm operators are open in the space of all continuous linear maps" since the theory of dual spaces is more complicated). 

Furthermore, if you are interested in moduli spaces in the language of Fréchet manifolds you should have a look at 

Smooth vector fields are in a one-to-one relationship with flows $\Phi: D \subseteq M\times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow M$, $$X_m = {\frac{d}{d t}}_{t=0} \Phi(m, t),$$ and by the symplectic form also with 1-forms $$X \longleftrightarrow \; - \iota_X \omega. $$ The following is well known (e. g. Abraham Marsden, Proposition 3.3.6): $X$ is local Hamiltonian iff $\iota_X \omega$ is closed iff the flow $\Phi$ of $X$ is symplectic. $X$ is Hamiltonian iff $\iota_X \omega$ is exact iff ??. Question: What is the corresponding property for flows of (global) Hamiltonian vector fields? I am a bit confused about this, as the existence of flows can be guaranteed only for small times and only in neighborhoods of each point (so it is a strongly local object), but the difference between closed and exact forms is determined by global/topological characteristics. 

If the holonomies of two connections coincide for all piecewise-smooth loops, then these connections are gauge equivalent. The basic idea is to consider the path bundle $PM$ over $M$, which is a principal bundle with the based loops $LM$ as the structure group. Then the holonomy map $LM \to G$ allows to reduce/extend the structure group to $G$ and thus gives an isomorphism $P = PM \times_{Hol} G$. Moreover, $PM$ carries a natural connection (whose horizontal lift is essentially composition of paths) and it is easy to see that the induced connection on $PM \times_{Hol} G$ coincides up to gauge transformation with the original connection on $P$. This viewpoint is explored in: 

Note sure if you can call it "calculating" but there is a rather straightforward construction. Let us fix some generators $A_i, B_i$ of $\pi_1(\Sigma)$ (i.e. a canonical system of curves such that slicing $\Sigma$ along them gives the fundamental polygon). Consider the central extension of $\pi_1$ $$ \mathbb{Z} \to \Gamma \to \pi_1(\Sigma),$$ where $\Gamma$ is generated by $A_i, B_i$ and the central element $J = \Pi_i [A_i, B_i]$ (with the commutator being $[A, B] = ABA^{-1}B^{-1}$). Since this extension is universal, every group homomorphism $\beta: \pi_1(\Sigma) \to G$ lifts to a group homomorphism $\hat{\beta}: \Gamma \to \tilde{G}$ where $\tilde{G}$ is the universal covering group. Then $\hat{\beta}(J) \in \pi_1(G)$ is the characteristic class of the bundle coming from $\beta$. I think more details about this construction can be found in Atiyah and Bott's classical work on the Yang-Mills equation over surfaces. 

Let $(M, g)$ be a finite-dimensional Riemannian manifold. It is well-known, that the Riemannian metric induce a metric on the manifold by $$d(x, y) = \text{inf} \int_a^b \| \dot\gamma(t) \| \, dt\,,$$ where the infinum is taken over all $C^1$-curves connecting $x$ and $y$. I'm interested in the basic properties of the usual constructions which solely depend on the metric and not on $g$. So what can be said about the smoothness of geodesics, exponential map,... if one forgets $g$ and only consider $(M, d)$ as a smooth metric manifold. Clearly one can define geodesics only with respect to $d$ and assuming that the space is locally uniquely geodesic one can define the exponential map $\text{exp}$ as a map from (a subset of) local geodesics $\mathcal{G}$ to a neighborhood of $M$. This is basic topology of metric spaces, but I could not find any exposition discussing the smoothness of this constructions if $M$ is a manifold. So for example: Can $\text{exp}$ be considered as a map from the tangent bundle to the manifold (thus is the map $\gamma \rightarrow \dot\gamma(0)$ a bijection of $\mathcal{G}$ with some open subset of $TM$) and is it smooth? Does there exists a (adapted) definition of Jacobi-Fields? (I'm not so interested in results which first recover the Riemannian metric $g$ [I think there is an old paper of Palais discussing this issue] and then run along the basic route to define geodesics, exponential map and Jacobi-Fields. The reason is, that I have a generalization of Riemannian geometry in mind where the standard procedure is definitely not possible.) 

Let $S$ be a closed manifold and $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. Minimal submanifolds are by definition the critical points of the volume functional $$F: \mathcal{Imm}(S,M) \to \mathbb{R} \qquad \iota \mapsto \int_S \mathrm{vol}_{\,\iota^* g}$$ defined on the space $\mathcal{Imm}(S,M)$ of immersions of $S$ into $M$. There exists a well-known expression of the Hessian of $F$ in terms of the Jacobi operator $J$. The Jacobi operator is Fredholm of index $0$ but has a non-trivial kernel in general. Vector fields annihilated by $J$ are called Jacobi fields. Since the critical points of $F$ are degenerate (in general), we cannot apply the Morse lemma to get a quadratic normal form of $F$. However, the splitting lemma of Gromoll & Meyer applies and entails that $F$ is locally equivalent to $$\frac{1}{2}\langle J \cdot, \cdot \rangle + G$$ where $G$ is a function defined on the finite-dimensional space of Jacobi vector fields (and the quadratic part is the Hessian of $F$). Question: What is known about the singular part $G$? If the concrete form of $G$ is not known, what can be said about its zero set $G^{-1}(0)$? 

Yes, the space of gauge orbits of connections is paracompact (even when you the use Fréchet topology). First, the space of all connections is paracompact since it is an affine space modelled on a nuclear Fréchet space (and/or it is metrisable). Narasimhan & Ramadas (Geometry of SU(2) Gauge Fields) showed that the action of the group of gauge transformation is proper (they actually only consider SU(2) gauge theories over $S^3$ but their argument generalizes to arbitrary structure groups and arbitrary compact base manifolds). For proper group actions, the orbit space is Hausdorff and the canonical projection map is closed. Since the image of a paracompact Hausdorff space under a closed continuous map is also paracompact, we conclude that the orbit space is paracompact. Moreover, the gauge orbit space is stratified by smooth (Fréchet) manifolds (it's the usual orbit type stratification, the top stratum being the space of irreducible connections, see for example The orbit space of the action of gauge transformation group on connections or On the gauge orbit space stratification: a review). Since every stratum is modelled on a nulear Fréchet space, they are even smoothly paracompact (see Convenient Setting of Global Analysis by Kriegl & Michor for further details, especially chapters 14 (Smooth Bump Functions) to 16 (Smooth Partitions of Unity and Smooth Normality)). 

This is just a special case of Integration along fibers ($URL$ However, notice that integrating of $f \omega^n$ along the natural fibration results in an $n$-form on the base manifold. In your coordinate language, you then have contracted this $n$-form with the global vector fields $e_i = \partial_{q^i}$. 

Ad 1.: Since every vector can be decomposed in its horizontal and vertical part. Thus it is enough to consider the case a) where all vectors are horizontal (this is trivial) and b) where at least one is vertical and the rest is horizontal (this has to be calculated explicitly but is relatively simple since one can use the fact that the vertical vector is a Killing field). Ad 2: As soon as one has a bilinear form $A \times B \to C$ one can form a wedge product of forms with values in $A$ and forms with values in $B$ to get forms with values in $C$ (by the above formula). For example the wedge product of Lie algebra valued forms is defined in the same way using the Lie commutator as the underlying bilinear form. Ad 3: Use 1 and the identification of sections of $E$ with equivariant maps $P \to V$ (under which $\nabla$ corresponds to $D$) 

There is a construction that works for connections on arbitrary principal bundles (and not just for the frame bundle): Let $P$ be a principal $G$-bundle over a $n$-dimensional manifold $M$. The space of principal connections on $P$ can be identified with sections of an affine bundle $QP \to M$. In order to realize $QP$ as an associated bundle, we need a first-order jet bundle of $P$ (since connections are first-order operators). However, the first-order jet bundle $J^1 P$ fails to be a principal bundle in general and has to be replaced with the so-called first principal jet prolongation $W^1 P \to M$ of $P$. Then $QP$ can be seen as an associated bundle to $W^1 P$ with typical fibre $\mathfrak{g} \times (\mathbb{R}^n)^*$. The action of the structure group $W^1 G$ of $W^1 P$ on this fibre is a bit complicated and so I've to refer you to section 17.5 of Natural Operations in Differential Geometry by Kolar, Michor & Jan Slovak for a explicit expression. I'm not sure if these formulas simplify for the special case $P = FM$.
