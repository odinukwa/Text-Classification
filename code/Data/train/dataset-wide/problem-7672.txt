Suppose you have two players $X$ and $Y$ fighting, both of which have $n\in \mathbb{N}, n\geq1$ life. Each player has a probability $p_i$ of doing $i$ damage for all $i\in[0, n]$. Note that $p_0$ is the probability of doing no damage, and all $p_i$ should sum to 1. $X$ and $Y$ both share probabilities, so all $p_i$ for $X$ equals $p_i$ for $Y$. Now play the game as follows (each step is one turn): 

The game ends when a player's life is $\leq 0$. Now a person watching this game would like for it to end after about $t\in \mathbb{N}, t\geq 1$ turns. In what ways can they assign the probabilities $p_i$ such that the expected number of turns is $t$? Edit: To be clear I am looking for all possible $p_i$ such that the expected number of turns is $t$. 

Okay so I haven't proved this yet but in practice this seems to be working pretty well for me. The trick is that you use interval arithmetic for the real and imag component of your number, using fractions with biginteger type numbers for their numerator and denominator. The bits still grow very quickly, but what you can do is "bound" them at each iter. For example, 0.000123141532 can become [0.000124, 0.000123], then you use those as your new intervals. If you end up having your upper estimate of the norm get >= 4 but the lower estimate of the norm be < 4 then you want to try a closer interval (so like [0.00012314, 0.00012315]). I find that usually 200 bits is plenty enough precision to run 1000 iters which wouldn't be practical otherwise, but these could grow as much as needed. Of course this code isn't super fast and optimized and using floating point numbers for rendering fractals is much easier, but the important part here is that these results are exact, this is guaranteed to give you whether or not it breaks in k steps. It runs basically in time linear in k since you can just fix precision, but there may be worst case behaviors on the edge of the mandelbrot that require the interval to get so small that you get exponential slowdown. There was some stuff on perturbation theory that might help prove that this doesn't happen but I haven't done that yet. I haven't ran into that issue in all my renders I've done with this so far at least. For now, here is that idea implemented in python. I'd like to clean up this code/comment it but I figured I'd just share it first so others can believe me that this works and maybe help with proving perturbation theory stuff I'm not sure about. Specifically, here is the interval class I made in python: 

I'm studying Dehn surgery, and it says that the coefficient $(p,q)$ which says how the meridian curve on solid torus is attached will determine the entire resulting manifold. I'm wondering whether the coefficient $(p,q)$ of the meridian also determine the coefficient for longitude. If not, then can any $(r,s)$ with $ps-qr=\pm 1$ be the coefficint for the longitude? 

Let W be a manifold with boundary such that \partial W is a union of two compact manifold A,B attached along their boundary. Does poincare duality hold for (W,A) and (W,B)? 

Can anyone give me the reference for this statement?: Let $M$ be a closed oriented smooth 4-manifold. Any element $a\in H_2(M)$ can be represented by a smoothly embedded, oriented surface. I found this statement and the proof at Saveliev's book, Lectures on the topology of 3-manifold, but I think it is not a complete proof and I couldn't fill the gap. Let me know other reference. 

For a given group presentation of a group(finitely presented), I want to check whether it is residually solvable or not. Is there any good way to do it? Actually, I'm curious whether the finitely presented group $G = < x_i, 1\leq i \leq m | w_i x_i w_i^{-1}x_{i+1}, 1\leq i \leq n-1 > $, where $w_i=x_j^{\pm 1}$ for some $j$. 

I'm studying Farb and Margalit's A primer on mapping class groups and trying to understand Wajnryb's finite presentation of Mod(S). I understand that There exists a finite presentation, but I can't understand how they got explicit Wajnryb's finite presentation. More precisely, I want to know how they knew that those 5 kinds of relation generate all relations. 

Suppose we have a system of complex polynomials $f = (f_1, \ldots, f_n)$, where each $f_i$ can be viewed as a function $\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}$. The solutions of $f$ are the points $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ such that $f(x) = 0$. There are results bounding the magnitude of the zeros of univariate polynomials. One result for instance is given here. With this result we know that all zeros of a univariate polynomial $p$ are inside a complex disk or radius $R$ centered at the origin. The value $R$ can be determined using only the coefficients of $p$. In the title, by simple set I mean a set like the above, which is a disk. What I mean by simple is a set which is determined explicitly by the coefficients of the $f_i$'s and has some simple determining rule. I'm looking for a way to know where the solutions are in advance. Sharp results are welcome. I know there are some results relating this systems with Newton polyhedra, but I only saw results about counting solutions. If there is a connection between Newton polyhedra and the location of the solutions I would be glad to know. If anyone know some relevant article or book please share it here so I can read it. Thank you very much. 

Consider the block matrix given by $$\textbf{D} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} D & \ldots & D\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\ D & \ldots & D\\ \end{array}\right] & \textbf{X} & \textbf{X}\\ \textbf{X} & \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} D & \ldots & D\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\ D & \ldots & D\\ \end{array}\right] & \textbf{X}\\ \textbf{X} & \textbf{X} & \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} D & \ldots & D\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\ D & \ldots & D\\ \end{array}\right]\\ \end{array}\right]$$ where each $\textbf{X}$ represents a dense matrix (but possible different from each other) in $\mathbb{C}^{nr \times nr}$. Each matrix in the form $$\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} D & \ldots & D\\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\ D & \ldots & D\\ \end{array}\right]\\$$ is composed by $r \times r$ of these matrices $D$, which are diagonal matrices (but possible different from each other) in $\mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$. So each of its $r^2$ entries is a diagonal matrix $D \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$. This matrix has a sparse pattern and is supposed to be invertible. What I'm trying to do is to obtain some upper bound for the norm of its inverse. Concretely, I want an upper bound for $$\|\textbf{D}^{-1}\|$$ where the norm can be the spectral norm or the Frobenius norm. I am looking for some bound in terms of these blocks, in a way it take advantage of its sparsity. I already looked through several papers and searched on the internet, but couldn't find anything helpful. All my ideas also didn't work, so my last hope is that someone here may have a good idea. This looks to be a very specific problem, and since I'm not so familiar with results about sparse matrices, the best option is to share with you in the hope someone knows something about it. Thank you!
