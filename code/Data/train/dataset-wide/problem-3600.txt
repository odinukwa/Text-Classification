Solution Update February 1, 2010: The problem appears to have been a hardware failure in the RV082, as QuickVPN is now working after replacing the RV082 with a new unit, identically configured. If I had to guess, I'd say that it was caused by a lightning strike, so I'm not blaming Linksys/Cisco for a defective unit. Background/Analysis We now have two sites each with their own RV082 providing a connection to the internet, so I have another test site. I am able to get QuickVPN to work on RV082 #2, so I think the problem is either: 

To find this information, I went to IBM's Storage Accessories & Upgrades Shop and then added one of each into the cart. At the next screen, I clicked on the product description for each to get the screens shown below. Going this route, both drives were priced at $139.00 each. Based on the IBM Express Advantage portfolio webpage, it appears to me that the Express designation is just a marketing offering geared toward the midsized market. I wouldn't be surprised that they are offering the same products under different model numbers for different prices/markets. IBM Express 43W7598 Drive $URL$ IBM non-Express 39M4526 Drive $URL$ 

I'm trying to upgrade the firmware on a Linksys/Cisco RV082 router using Mac OS X and it's not working. The current firmware version is 1.1.6.14 (Jul 28 2005 18:12:59), and I've tried upgrading to both 1.3.98-tm (Jun 20 2008 18:37:29) and 2.0.0.19-tm (Feb 20 2009 15:15:20).

Background I've created a Python script using Fabric to configure a freshly built Slicehost Ubuntu slice. In case you're not familiar with Fabric, it uses Paramiko, a Python SSH2 client, to provide remote access "for application deployment or systems administration tasks." One of the first things I have the Fabric script do is to create a new admin user and set their password. Unlike Pexpect, Fabric cannot handle interactive commands on the remote system, so I need to set the user's password non-interactively. At present, I'm using the command, which reads the username and password as clear-text. Current Code

Is there a way to install Windows XP on an IBM x335 server? When I boot from CD-ROM with the Windows XP installation disk, the screen is just blank. Initial research indicates this may be due to the SCSI controller. I'll update as I find out more. Purpose We need a license server for both Pspice and SolidWorks. Currently, our Pspice server is an IBM x3800 running Win2k with a dongle on the parallel port. The SolidWorks server is currently a Mac Mini running Windows 7 with a USB dongle. I'd like to consolidate these two license servers onto a single piece of hardware. I have an x335 available, which has the required USB port and a PCI card can provide the parallel port. The SolidWorks server must be running WinXP or newer, hence the requirement. If the parallel port and the USB ports can be properly seen by the Pspice and SolidWorks servers, respectively, when using virtualization, then one option is to install WinXP inside of Ubuntu server. Update on March 24, 2011 I tried installing WinXP bare-metal onto the x335, but I was not successful. I'll admit that I quickly reached my threshold and simply bought a 1U SuperMicro system that had the required parallel and USB ports. I did find a discussion on IBM DeveloperWorks about how to Install Windows XP on x3250 M2 4194. The last post in that thread states that the process described works on x335s as well. The process basically involves creating an unattended installation disk that includes the required LSI integrated SCSI adapter. I created an unattended installation disk, but I don't think I did it correctly as it didn't work. What did work for me was to install WinXP inside VirtualBox running on Ubuntu. However, that seemed a little too convoluted, so for $100 I bought the 1U SuperMicro based system. Hardware Configuration 

I found detailed steps at the HP Support Document for Configuring TCP/IP through the Front Control Panel. The steps are summarized below for convenience. HP LaserJet 4000, 4050, 4100, 4500, 4550, 5Si, 5SiMX, 5000, 5100, 8500, 8550, 8000, 8150 printers, HP 2500c Professional series, HP Business Inkjet 2200, 2250, and 2600 printers To configure TCP/IP parameters from the control panel, use the following instructions: 

I'm wanting to configure our Linksys RV082 wired router as our primary DHCP server and then have our Linksys WRT54G wireless router as a secondary DHCP server. My plan is to have them serve different ranges of IPs as shown below (showing host portion only and using CIDR range of 10.10.100.0/24). The RV082 has the ability via its web based configuration to enter the static IPs even when acting as the DHCP server, which is what I want since we have the routers, servers, and printers configured with static IPs and the local clients configured with dynamic IPs. In addition to setting the static IP, for each entry the RV082 requires you to include the MAC address, name, and whether it's enabled (checkbox). In contrast, the WRT54G does not appear to have the ability to enter information about the static IPs. This leads me to my question: What's the purpose of setting the static IP entries in the RV082? IP Configuration 

RV082 #1 has some setting configured incorrectly Update January 29, 2010: I went through every page on the RV082 web management and configured the two routers identically (except for things like static IP address of the WAN, which have to be different), so this doesn't appear to be the problem. RV082 #1 is damaged such that the VPN is not working even though internal routing is fine. (We know that we took a lightning strike last year, but that didn't seem to be at the same as when the QuickVPN stopped working.) Update February 1, 2010: Changed out the grey market RV082 #1 with a new RV082 configured exactly as the old one. QuickVPN is now working again.
