You are allowed to practice as a team. In fact in Lord Buddha's time and even now people and Monks do it. But the important thing is to use this good friendship as a boat and use the excitement of teamwork to your benefit. Remember not to be too attached to the team. You will be more willing to meditate when yo got friends around. Even Lord Buddha said 

Good attachments Not all the attachments are bad, For example the need to reach the end or the need to reach nirvana is an attachment. But without such an attachment you will not reach anywhere. So it is necessary for a being to have some incentive to work on something. And this is true to both good and bad things. So as you can see Lord Buddha never said that you should get rid of good ones along with the bad ones. You must have this need to Meditate and you should feed it. This is called "Shraddha". Now you have realized the path and you are willingly going towards the goal. 

As there has been no proper explanation to these events what so ever people have came to the conclusion that this is the power of Lord Buddha, There is another idea. Some think it's the Devas trying to encourage the people to do good more.

So the simpler explanation is that one must give happily with detachment and he or she must keep the happiness of giving before giving,while giving and even afterwards. That is the correct detachment. 

I have heard about the beings called Brahma who do not have a Physical appearance.But they have different names. How does the identity factor come into this scenario. Is there some Suttas or texts explaining their lives? 

** There are four great elements which are responsible for all conceivable objects and forms. If we take a human being, we have a body made of the 4 great elements and a consciousness. As we know there is no such thing called a person beyond the grammatical meaning, therefore neither mind or body is a person or a soul or any such thing. Let's expand this to a universal level, the same way a body host a consciousness, the universe hosts all consciousnesses. So the assumption here is that 4 great elements provide the infrastructure for the birth of a consciousness. if we forget the identities like human,animal,heavenly,etc, what we have is a sea of 4 great elements that facilitate the existence of all so called "beings". this shows an uncanny resemblance to what we call a being. - Allow me to elaborate - A body is a housing for a consciousness, the body consist of the 4 elements. The universe is a housing for consciousnesses, the universe consist of the 4 elements. Take into account that according to the teaching, the consciousness is not a permanent one, it is explained as a static that occurs and ceases with every though,recognition,comparison,etc. Taken as a static, a consciousness does not even last a second. Bearing this in mind, allow me to end the question. * 

About the Greek connection... The statues were not made by the Asian artists because of respect and the fear of their creation being not god enough, This should go withot saying Gauthama Buddha was considered the most charming person in India and people even became monks just to see Buddha's beauty. As the story goes the appearance was unique and it was not alike with any other person (But as the suttas say only The great arahant kashyapa looked a bit like Lord Buddha). With the scientific knowledge we have today we can say the DNA structure of a Lord Buddha is either unique or a complete anomaly. A king called Kanishka who ruled a certain part of India took a Greek wife and with her came a lot of people as it was a tradition to send skilled people as gifts with princesses who marry to countries abroad. At the time Buddhists had many other depiction of Lord Buddha to worship Like the "Anandha Bodhi" - Video and Lotus carvings on rock pallets. The princess questioned the king Kanishka why there is no statue of Lord Buddha in his kingdom and the king explained why. So she ordered her people to create a statue and with time finally Asian artists came up with their designs. Why Buddha is not bald and what was the appearance of Gauthama sage? When Prince Gauthama started his journey he used his sword to cut his hair. But later on even though Lord Buddha advised monks to shave the hair there is no mentioning about Lord Buddha shaving hair. This should go with the special look all the Lord Buddhas shared "The hair with very small curves." A lord Buddha never appears without hair and the unique hair is sign for others to know who it is. 

One day a young man came to our monastery asking to be a monk. He was a committed person and soon he started screaming in the night and he had other discomforts too (Loosing focus & interest). One night he was screaming and the Monks gathered to see why. The young man was talking oddly and monks understood that he is under the control of a "Pretha" (A being from a lower ralm, a bad birth caused by bad karma). When the conversation went on the being revealed his true identity.It was his Grandfather. The being said "I can't let him reach nirvana, i will never see him again". No matter how much Monks tried the being did not listen. But in the end the young man was relieved from that.(Monks had to chant). The Reason i said this was that sometimes the reasons aren't tangible.So it's better to take all precautions than being ill prepared. The solution for this issue is... 01 - Start your meditation with this :- Paying Homage to Buddha 02 - Learn this Meditation (Loving Kindness Meditation) and practice it (This meditation can be done on the go and does not require you to sit down). This Meditation can help you with any other realm disturbance and it will also gain good Karma too. 03 - Breathing Meditation can aid any other meditation. So use it before your meditation begins. 04 - If you feel any discomfort stop and give it a break. After it pass away start with this Meditation Budhdhaanussathi meditation. This is Lord Buddha's values so after doing this wish no pain or discomfort to come by the power of good karma you gained from this meditation and by the power of lord buddha. 

One Day i was thinking about the "Thrikoti parishuddha sila" (The ultimate version of five precepts) Let me give an example how this version works.... 

So it is wrong to think that Darvin's Evolution is the same with Buddhism's Evolution. But it is clear that Buddhism is the only religion that actually proposed Evolution among all other faiths (2600 + years ago). Buddhism has its own version of evolution and i doubt that we will live long enough to see either one of these evolutions get proven by physical facts. May the triple gems bless you!

The best answer you can get for these questions are in one place. You should learn "Tipitaka" for the most accurate answer. This book will help (it is free for download). Comprehensive-Manual-of-Abhidhamma 

(A) The coin falling down is the fixed future,the coin is influenced by a natural force that we call gravity.So without any doubt and even before it happens you can say that the coin is going to fall.This is the technique used by Lord Buddha when predicting fixed future (Looking at the variables of an event an use logic and the reach of Buddha's mind to predict the conclusion). (B) But you can't predict the side of the coin whether it is going to be "Head" or "Tail".Now you see some room for action.This is when a Lord Buddha change the future events.When it is possible to make a positive change in a chain of events. Let me provide some examples to the above (A) and (B) to make things more clear. Example for (A) If you see the story of "Devadatta thero" (the one who wanted to harm the life of Lord Buddha) you see a very good example for (A). One day the question was asked from lord Buddha "Why Lord Buddha didn't helped Devadatta thero to become better." Lord Buddha said "I wanted to help,i looked for any opportunity tosave him from what he would do.But it was clear that there is no helping Devadatta." Here lord Buddha had to accept the future. Example for (B) When Lord Buddha saw that "Angulimaala" (The one who killed people to collect fingers) is about to kill his mother who will enter the forest to see him.Lord Buddha went there and stopped it.This event caused a nice chain reaction ("Angulimaala" became the famous "Angulimaala arahant"). This is a good example to a "Modifiable future". So the conclusion is.... Future is not fully fixed or fully open.There is free will. But free will also make no difference (see how "Devadatta thero" time and time again to harm lord Buddha using his free will and choice,His free will did not make any difference). Future is not predetermined.Some events are in a possibility that is so unchangeable,this is what causes the Fixed future.But some events are with certain variables that can be exploited to make a positive change in the events to occur,This makes the changeable future.
