As you can see, there's a coronal place effect: vowel insertion is far more common for them than for /p/ and /k/. In fact, every instance of final [d] was adapted with vowel insertion. 

In Daniel Nettle's 1995 paper Segmental inventory size, word length, and communicative efficiency the author takes a sample of 10 languages and demonstrates a correlation between mean word length and the number of segments. 

Following up on jlovegren's point that head directionality does not empirically hold: Anders Holmberg and other researchers have been attempting to sharpen the analytical relevance of mixed order languages such as Finnish into the Final Over Final Constraint which states, paraphrased very loosely, that head-finality is restricted to positions where it only dominates head-final structures. Hence mixed order languages can have head-final configurations up to some point in the (relevant) syntactic structure, where it switches to being head-initial. As support of this proposal, Biberauer, Holmberg, & Roberts 2010:19-21 point out the observation from Holmberg 2000 that while both postpositions and prepositions are present in Finnish, a postpositional phrase involving a complex NP is ungrammatical: 

One language I speak, Polish, has a fairly asymmetric vowel inventory despite having only 9* vowel phonemes (if you count the nasal diphthongs as vowels, that is) /i/ /ɪ/ /ɛ/ /ɛ̃ w/ /ɔ/ /ɔ̃ w/ a/ (The vowel [e] occurs as an allophone before /j/ or a palatalised consonant, the and /ɔ/ occurs as [o] before /w/ or /l/) There are two high front vowels, and the default tends to be +lax/-tense, rather than +tense/-lax (which is fairly unexpected). So there are languages with asymmetric vowel inventories, but none as extreme as only having front vowels. There are many reasons why this wouldn't happen, or would be highly improbable. For example, there is a tendency for languages to end up with an asymmetric inventory if [u] shifts forward to [y] or [ʉ], and sometimes to even shift forward to [y] and then un-round to [i]. Usually, what happens though, is the vowel does not shift forward before [k] [x] or another velar consonant, and then they wind up in allophonic variation, or over time, even in phonemic variation. Another tendency is for [o] to raise and fill the place of where [u] used to be. So let's say a 5 vowel inventory language has: /i/ /u/ /e/ /o/ /a/ It shifts: /i/ /y/~/u/ /e/ /o/ /a/ Then, a few generations later we have: /i//y/ /u/ (o shifted up) /e/ /a/ Or even: /i//y/ /u/ (the vowel became contrastive) /e/ /o/ /a/ *There is debate on even this in Polish, sadly. The controversy is over the front vowels, and whether the contrastive vowel is [ɪ] or [ɨ]. In many Slavic languages, such as Russian, there are two vowels in allophonic distribution: one occurs after palatalised consonants and /k/ [i], the other after non-palatalised consonants [ɨ]. Sanders (2003) identified the Polish vowel as [ɪ], at least in Warsaw Polish. In Polish, the only consonants with a palatalisation contrast are the bilabials, and before a back vowel. Some Slavicists like to transcribe the bilabials before /i/ as being something like [mʲ] instead of [m]. If you don't do this for pure consistency-with-other-Slavic-languages concerns, it is fairly obvious that /ɪ/ and /i/ are minimal pairs: /mi/ 1sg-DAT /mɪ/ 'we' /bitɕ/ 'to beat' /bɪtɕ/ 'to be' They are phonemic at least in the environment of bilabials.

Example: mom's native language is Arabic, dad's native language is Japanese, family is living in Hungary. Each parent is fluent is the other's native language as well as Hungarian. The ideal environment in this household is one in which, when the child is present, the mother speaks exclusively Arabic, the father speaks exclusively Japanese, and they speak exclusively Hungarian when interacting with locals. Here, chances are the child will end up acquiring all three languages simultaneously. Obviously, this is an idealized situation. More common are situations where the parents are not totally fluent in each other's native languages and/or the local language. In these cases, you'll need to adjust a bit, but you'll be fine so long as you keep points 1. and 2. in mind. 

The closest thing I can think of are honorifics in a number of East Asian languages (most prominently, Japanese, but also Korean and Thai). See, for example, the entry about sonkeigo on wikipedia. Japanese also has a number of suffixes to proper names to indicate respect and deference (e.g., "-sama" 様, roughly translatable as "highly respected"). 

Of course the two above sentences would both be highly ungrammatical in any American, Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian English dialects. 

That is just a /t/ sound, not a morpheme. This makes as much sense as asking where the /n/ in near and nickel come from. The words night, fight, and others like right historically had a fricative before the /t/, and words like through and rough ended in that fricative (compare English through [θɹu:] with German durch [dʊɐ̯çç]). In Middle English, the fricative likely varied regionally, and it inconsistently either deleted (through, plough, night, fight, wight, drought) or became [f] (rough, trough, enough) in Modern English. Just because night and fight end in -ght it does not mean that sound was one morpheme. It just happens to be the consonant cluster they ended in. 

American, Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand varieties of English are all strut~put splitting dialects, because most of the initial settlers of the colonies came from southern and western England after the split. The split was probably originally phonologically constrained, but then something happened to make it phonemic in many dialects. 2 Lexical Diffusion Most sound changes start in a set of words, and then spread to more words. This is called Lexical Diffusion, and was described in depth by Kiparsky (1995). It is pretty obvious from pieces written in Early Modern English, that the Great Vowel Shift did not happen all at once to every word in the lexicon. In 1582, John Hart wrote his book An Orthographie in which he proposed a spelling reform due to the change in the language in his lifetime. He designed a phonetic orthography based on his own speech, and spelled the vowel in TIME and BY as , but the vowel in MIGHT and TITLE as <ị>. It is evident, that the Great Vowel Shift started in a group of words, and then spread to others. With the back vowels, we see the least-complete shifts. Kiparsky (1995) noted many patterns with the back vowels. Kiparksy's original explanation for this, was that some words have underlying phonological forms, while others are unspecified in the lexicon, and are instead built by analogy. I personally find that explanation far-fetched, but there are some experimental phonology papers which would support it, I'll get back to those. Another explanation would be an Exemplar Theory approach, where a speaker produces vowels based on their input. The entire system is analogy, but some more high frequency words might either be more innovative, or more conservative. There is a bit of evidence supporting the idea that some words are more lexically encoded with phonological information, while others aren't. In nonsense word vs real word production experiments such as Hay, Drager, and Thomas (2013), speakers often are more conservative with nonsense words than with real words: 

Freeze's excellent 1992 article "Existentials and other locatives" (Language 68, 553-595) points out that "the English existential is unique even among the truly exceptional existentials of its sister languages" (p. 575). 

Short answer: no. Slightly longer answer: not that we know of. The closest you can get is polysyndetic coordination, which follows the pattern "and A and B". Note that this isn't really circumfixation, it's just each conjunct being preceded by its own instance of "and". A nice example of this is Brad Pitt's speech in Ingloriuous Basterds:

Two follow-ups seem to verify this result: Nettle (1996), Coevolution of phonology and the lexicon in twelve languages of West Africa Wichmann et al (2011), Phonological diversity, word length, and population sizes across languages: The ASJP evidence. However, none of these are indicative of a causal relation. As mentioned in this Linguist List discussion on Nettle 1995, Maori has a very limited segment inventory and their words are quite short. One possible reason is that the metric of word length (either by segment or syllables) varies with morphosyntactic variability. A language may form predicates by using light verbs/phrases consisting of short words (dance -> do a fun move), in which case neither phonemic diversity nor word length are crucial components. It's also a methodological question what is measured by mean word length. Syllable count can be a worse measure than word length because languages differ in how complex a syllable can be. A language with only open syllables ("sa") will need more segmental variety to convey the same amount of information with monosyllables than a language which allows complex onsets and codas ("sploink"). 

There are a few factors that might confound your answer. For example, I'm pretty sure "actively" know several thousand more words than my father does; but then, I have a doctorate and lost count many years ago of how many books I own, whereas my father stopped going to school at age 15 and all the books he owns fit in a single shelf. So that's something you want to control for. If you are going to compare American English against, let's say, Mongolian, differences in education level alone are going to be enough to give you a false positive. Similarly, you want to average across a large cross-section of the population, to avoid effects related to some speakers (e.g., writers, journalists...) having an anomalously large vocabulary. Once you get all those things into account, my best guess is that you won't find any significant differences in vocabulary size. Again to give a personal example, my uncle, who owns a farm, has an "active" vocabulary that includes many dozen words for farming implements, animal parts, different stages in the life of individual animals, types of crops, etc, that I simply do not have in my "active" vocabulary. Similarly, tribal languages of the Amazonian rainforest or the Australian outback lack science- and technology-related words, but they also have words that we lack, related to life in that particular environment. 

For #3, for all of the vowels before /ɹ/, look at the phonetic environment. There's your explanation for why floor is [flɔɹ]. In very few dialects of Modern English, is [u:ɹ] even a sequence that is allowed. In my native dialect of English (Pacific Northwest American English), that segment is only phonotactically allowed if the [ɹ] is its own syllable. So brewer is [bɹu:w(ə)ɹ̩ ]. This is also true for me of [l]. Fool and fuel are definitely two syllables for me: [fuwəɤ̯ ]~[fuɫ̩ ] and [fjuwəɤ̯ ]~[fjuɫ̩ ] This is also true for my girlfriend, who speaks Australian English. So, we can surmise that when */o:/ became /u:/, it then lowered before [_l] and [_ɹ] in most dialects of English. For phonological splits, those are more tricky. In Southern British dialects of Early Modern English, there was another shift after the Great Vowel Shift called the FOOT~STRUT split. In Northern England and Scotland, as well as some dialects in Ireland, the vowels in FOOT is the same as the vowel in STRUT and FLOOD. Liverpool speakers would pronounce the vowel in FLOOD, RUN and SUN the same way they pronounce it in HOOD, FOOT, and BOOK. Here's a map of England where the Isoglosses of this split are, per Wikipedia (this is the vowel for SUN in various British dialects): 

Independent of implementation-specific details such as one that acattle mentioned, the possible alternative that you mentioned appear word-finally only in native Korean nouns -- word-final coronals do not appear in Sino-Korean nouns (Sohn 2001). It's plausible that they're more likely to adapt to the Sino-Korean pattern, which has the common t-s alternation. More significantly, I think it's too strong to say that it's "systematically adapted as /s/." Kang 2003 took a corpus of loanwords and found that word-final coronal stops ([t]/[d]) were largely adapted with an epenthetic final vowel. 

As the implementation of tone across languages differs considerably, it's also worth wondering about adaptation between tone languages. The Hsieh and Kenstowicz paper mentions that Tibetan adaptations of Mandarin words, for example, ignores the original tone in favor of the voiced/voiceless distinction. 

Maria Giavazzi's 2010 dissertation, The phonetics of metrical prominence and its consequences for segmental phonology, discusses stress-dependent consonant length alternations as part of a broader investigation into the relation between prominence and segmental phonology. See pp. 43-46 for an overview. The author mentions Carolina Gonzalez's 2003 USC dissertation, The effect of stress and foot structure on consonantal processes, which also should have some examples.
