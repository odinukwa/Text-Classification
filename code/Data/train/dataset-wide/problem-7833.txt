I don't think you can get this directly from GAGA. The reference that I know for this result is Grothendieck, On the de Rham cohomology of algebraic varieties. It is short, beautiful, and in English. 

I believe that this is the subject of Jon Kelner's paper Spectral partitioning, eigenvalue bounds, and circle packings for graphs of bounded genus. In particular, he proves a lower bound of the form $O(g/n)$ for $\lambda_2$, resolving a conjecture of Spielman and Teng. 

So, an awkward admission. I've never actually read a basic intro to ZFC, nor taken a course on the subject. So, while I suspect this can all be found in any basic text, I don't know which one to refer you to. But it isn't hard to do all of this by hand, just tedious. I'll get you to the point of showing that ordinals, by your definition, are totally ordered. I think that's the part which is most different from the Von Neummann ordinal case. The rest is not too much more difficult, and I assume someone will be recommending a textbook soon anyway. 

I'm not sure that this is the answer you are looking for, but you might be interested in Mnev's universality theorem. Unwinding the language of semialgebraic sets, this says the following: Consider any finite set of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer coefficients, such as $$\zeta^3=1 \quad \zeta \neq 1.$$ Then there is an arrangement $A$ of points and lines such that $A$ can be realized over a commutative ring $R$ if and only if $R$ contains a solution to those equalities and inequalities. For example, the Fano plane is representable only if $2=0$ in $R$. The statement "you can find $9$ points $x(i,j)$ labeled by $\mathbb{F}_3^2$ such that $x(i_1, j_1)$, $x(i_2, j_2)$ and $x(i_3, j_3)$ are collinear if and only if $\sum (i_s, j_s)=0$" is equivalent to the statement "$R$ contains a nontrivial cube root of unity." But all of this is for $R$ commutative; I don't know if there is a noncommutative version of Mnev. 

Over a field $k$, this is a special case of quiver loci. The general framework is that you are given a triangular array $(r_{ij})_{1 \leq i \leq j \leq n}$ of nonnegative integers. Consider a list of $n-1$ matrices $M_1$, $M_2$, â€¦, $M_{n-1}$ of size $r_{ii} \times r_{(i+1)(i+1)}$. The quiver locus is the set where $\mathrm{rank}(M_i M_{i+1} \cdots M_{j-1}) \leq r_{ij}$. Your case is where $r_{ij}=0$ for $j-i \geq 2$. See Knutson, Miller and Shimozono, and the many citations therein. To be a bit more explicit, if you want $\dim V_i = d_i$ and $\dim H_i(V_{\bullet})=h_i$, then take $r_{ii} = d_i$, compute $r_{i(i+1)}$ by solving the linear equations $r_{(i-1)i} + r_{i(i+1)} + h_i= d_i$, and put all other $r_{ij}=0$. 

Have these polynomials been studied? Do they have a standard name? Is it true that all the roots of $f(x)$ are real numbers in $[a,b]$? 

Let $X \subset \mathbb{C}^2$ be a smooth algebraic curve. Thinking of $\mathbb{C}^2$ as $\mathbb{R}^4$, is there a smooth map $\phi: \mathbb{C}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ so that $\phi: X \to \mathbb{R}^3$ is a closed injective immersion? I mean this question in two senses: 

So, let's finish this. Starting from Qiaochu's formula, $$\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (r^2 \cos^2 (2 \pi k/n) + s^2 \sin^2 (2 \pi k)/n))=1$$. Each factor is $$\left(\vphantom{\frac{r}{2}} r \cos (2 \pi k/n) + i s \sin(2 \pi k/n) \right) \left(\vphantom{\frac{r}{2}} r \cos (2 \pi k/n) - i s \sin(2 \pi k/n) \right) =$$ $$\left( \frac{r+s}{2} e^{2 \pi i k/n} + \frac{r-s}{2} e^{-2 \pi i k/n} \right) \left( \frac{r+s}{2} e^{2 \pi i k/n} - \frac{r-s}{2} e^{-2 \pi i k/n} \right).$$ Putting $u=(r+s)/2$, $v=(r-s)/2$ and $\zeta=e^{2 \pi k/n}$, we have $$\prod_{k=0}^{n=1} (u + v \zeta^{2k}) (u - v \zeta^{2k})$$ If $n$ is odd, this is $(u^n+v^n)(u^n - v^n)= (u^{2n} - v^{2n})$. If $n$ is even, I get $(u^{n/2} - v^{n/2})^2 (u^{n/2} + v^{n/2})^2 = (u^n-v^n)^2$. So either $u^{2n} - v^{2n}=1$ or $u^n-v^n=1$ or $u^n-v^n=-1$. These are all forms of FLT. 

I think that showing the lattices $(1, \sqrt{-5})$ and $(2, 1+\sqrt{-5})$ is a good idea. As Felipe Voloch says, not all lattices are ideals, but the fact that these lattices are ideals can be shown visually: You just need to check that $\sqrt{-5} I \subset I$ and, of course, multiplication by $\sqrt{-5}$ means multiplication by $\sqrt{5}$ and rotation by $\pi/2$. And it is geometrically obvious that $(2, 1+\sqrt{-5})$ is not principal -- it does not have a rectangular fundamental domain. (You could contrast this with $(2, 1+\sqrt{-1})$, which is principal.) Beyond that, if you are going to talk about reduced forms, you could plot the roots of $a z^2+bz+c=0$ for all reduced forms of some discriminant and show how they lie in the fundamental domain. For example, here are the $23$ reduced forms of discriminant $-647$ (with real and imaginary axes transposed to fit nicely on the page). 

Counter-example to (2): Take $N=6$, $k=3$ and $R$ to be $156$, $126$, $246$, $234$, $345$, $135$. The point is that, if you draw the simplicial complex with vertices $1$, ... $6$ and these faces, it is two dimensional and has nontrivial cohomology in $H^1$. (Specifically, if I didn't make any typos, it is a triangulation of the annulus.) By Reisner's criterion, if this were to be CM, it would only have top dimensional cohomology. 

I haven't used EXCEL in forever, but here is how I would implement the Knuth shuffle in what I would think of as a generic spreadsheet. I want two 1-dimensional arrays, which I will call $x[i]$ and $y[i]$, and one 2-dimensional array $z[i,j]$. Think of three worksheets. $x[i]$ is a random variable with value chosen from $\{ 1,2, \ldots, n-i+1 \}$. $z[1,j]=j$. For $i>1$, we have $z[i,j] = \mathrm{IF}(j \geq x[i],\ z[i-1, j],\ z[i-1,j+1]]$. (Here $\mathrm{IF}(P,a,b)$ returns $a$ if $P$ is true and $b$ otherwise.) And $y[i]$, our output, is $z[i][x[i]]$. 

I thought about this a bit and didn't get anywhere. I'm just posting to point out that the following problem appears to contain the fundamental difficulties of the original, while eliminating some of the irritating details: Do there exist $0 &lt;r &lt; 1$ and $0 &lt; c &lt; 1$ such that, for every (or infinitely many) $n$, there are $n-1$ complex numbers $u\_1$, $u\_2$, ..., $u\_{n-1}$ and $n$ other complex numbers $v\_1$, $v\_2$, ..., $v\_n$, with $|u\_i|$, $|v\_i| &lt; r$ and $$1+\sum_i u\_i^k = \sum\_i v\_i^k \quad (*)$$ for $0 \leq k \leq cn$? This problem is easier in that we are allowed to use complex numbers rather than real ones. It is harder in that $(*)$ has to hold for all sufficiently small values of $k$, rather than $\ell \leq k \leq 2 \ell-1$. Therefore, there is no direct reduction either way. There is also an aesthetic change (improvement, to my mind). I made the change of variables $u\_i = 1-x\_i$ and $v\_i = 1-y\_i$. This made the extra $1$ appear on the left hand side: conceptually, it is $(1-0)^k$. As a result, I now am asking for my solutions to be in a disc around $0$, and $(*)$ is valid for $k=0$. My bet is that the answer is "no". But I'd like to see a proof. 

Many people have recommended Neukirch's book. I think a good complement to it is Janusz's Algebraic Number Fields. They cover roughly the same material. Neukirch's presentation is probably the slickest possible; Janusz's is the most hands on. I love them both now, but I found Janusz understandable at a point when Neukirch was still completely impenetrable. Neither of these is particularly strong on the Pell equation, though. 

UPDATE: This is dead wrong. See comments below. Can you give a combinatorial proof of the infinite Ramsey theorem? That is: 

You can reverse engineer a zillion examples by starting with the normalization: Let $S$ be a normal local domain. Let $I$ be an ideal of $S$ with $\sqrt{I}=\mathfrak{m}$ and let $A$ be a subring of $S/I$. Take $R = \{ f \in S : [f] \in A \}$, where $[ \ ]$ denotes reduction modulo $I$. Then $\mathrm{Frac}(R) = \mathrm{Frac}(S)$, since $I \subset R$. I claim that $S$ is the normalization of $R$. Clearly, $S$ is a normal subring of $\mathrm{Frac}(R)$ containing $R$. Using that $\sqrt{I}= \mathfrak{m}$, one can show that $S$ is a finite $R$-module, so $S$ integral over $R$. (An earlier version of this answer had a weaker condition on $I$, but then $S$ need not be integral over $R$. For example, take $S=k[x,y]$, $I=(x)$ and $A = k \subset k[x,y]/(x)$. Then $y$ isn't integral over the (nonnoetherian) ring $R$.) To get the cusp, take $S = k[t]$, $I = (t^2)$ and $A = k \subset S/I = k[t]/t^2$. 

Elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. Nonisotrivial curves over $E$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $|E(\mathbb{Q})|$ infinite. Nonisotrivial curves over $\mathbb{QP}^1$. 

No. $\mathbb{R}^4 - \{ 0 \}$ obeys all your conditions, but it retracts onto the unit $3$-sphere, so $H^3(\mathbb{R}^4 - \{ 0 \}) \cong H^3(S^3) \cong \mathbb{R}$. 

For completeness, I add an example of a map which induces zero on homology and can not be written as $du+vd$. Consider $$\begin{matrix} 0 & \to & \mathbb{Z} & \to & \mathbb{Z} \\\\ \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow \\\\ \mathbb{Z} & \to & \mathbb{Z} & \to & 0 \end{matrix}$$ where the nontrivial horizontal maps are multiplication by $p$, and the vertical map is the identity. The nontrivial homology is in different degrees in top and bottom, so the map on homology is zero. But any map of the form $du+vd$ would be $0$ modulo $p$ in the central column. 

Here the phrases in quotes are meant to be nonrigorous: the disc could be a square or an oval rather than a perfect circle, and I don't claim to have a definition of "plane" in a general Riemmannian manifold. The point is that we should be should be working locally enough that our Euclidean intuition for these concepts is adequate. 

I'll do this over $\mathbb{C}$, since you'll let me get away with it. The geometric fact you need to know is the following: If $D \subset Y$ is a branch divisor for the $G$ covering $X \to Y$, then the inertia group of $D$ is generated by the monodromy around a small loop $\gamma$ encircling $D$. In other words, near any smooth point of $D$, the divisor $D$ locally looks like $\{ z_n=0 \} \subset \mathbb{C}^n$, and you are supposed to take the monodromy around $(0,0,\ldots, 0, r e^{i \theta} )$ for some small $r$. Well, that's not quite right because (1) the inertia group is only defined up to conjugacy and (2) I need to specify a path from my chosen basepoint in $Y$ to the loop I am computing monodromy around. Specifying the path in (2) lets me talk about inertia groups without saying "up to conjugacy". I'll ignore these issues. So, suppose that $x$ is a point of $Y$ at which two components, $D_1$ and $D_2$, of the branch divisor cross normally. Passing to an analytic neighborhood of $x$, we may assume that $Y$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^2$, and that $D_i = \{ z_i =0 \}$. I'll use your notations $Y'$ and $E$. Inside $Y'$, consider small loops $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$ and $\delta$ around $D_1$, $D_2$ and $E$. The monodromy around these loops will generate the inertia groups at $D_1$, $D_2$ and $E$. The key fact is that,
