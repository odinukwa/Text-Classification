Is there a method to find a tight upper bound on the given integral? Note that the integral is upper bounded by $\sqrt{\pi/2}$, and thus converges. I first thought about applying Laplace's method. However, the function $-x^2/2-a(1-e^{-x})$ is decreasing and achieves maximum at $x=0$ which is an endpoint of the domain of integration. As a result, I don't think using Laplace method is a good idea to find an upper bound. Numerical evaluation indicates an asymptotic of $\sim \frac{1}{a}$, but I am not sure how to proceed to say anything about an upper bound in terms of $a$. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

Isn't the point that human reason is generally frail altogether, especially when making conclusions by using long serial chains of arguments? So in mathematics where such extended arguments are routine, we want their soundness to be as close to ideal as possible. Of course, even generally accepted proofs are occasionally later seen to be lacking, but to give up proofs as the ideal changes the very nature of mathematics. I heard that the example of parts of the Italian school of algebraic geometry of the 19th century was an important example of this overextension of intuition. Furthermore, it is only in the attempt at proof that the real nature of the reasons why a statement is true are finally exposed. So the reformulation and refoundation of algebraic geometry in the 20th century is said to have exposed revolutionary new ways of seeing mathematics in general. Finally, it is only by proof that the limits of applicability of a theorem are really understood. This comes into play many times in physics, say where some "no-go theorem" is elided because its assumptions are not valid in some new realm. 

Let $\{X_n\}$ be an ergodic sequence of random variables, $X_n:(\Omega,\mathcal{F})\to (S,\mathcal{S})$ where the target set $S$ is a matrix ring. My question is, 

Let $\{X_k\}$ be an ergodic process. I know that if $f$ is a smooth real valued function then by Birkoff's ergodic theorem, $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n f(X_k)=\mathbb{E}(f(X_1))\ a.s.$$ Is there any similar result for the $\limsup_n$ or $\liminf_n$ of the sequence $\{f(X_k)\}$, i.e. results which involve expectation? More specifically is there a way to find $$\limsup_n f(X_n),\ \liminf_n f(X_n)$$ almost surely? Though I have asked the question for the general ergodic processes, even results for stationary processes like Gaussian processes will be helpful to me. Also, if they are not available, it will be very kind if someone can give me some references that I can use to find methods to find these results. Thanks in advance. 

Suppose we call a knot an equivalence class of embeddings of S1 --> R3 under ambient isotopy, a knot representative a particular such embedding, and a knot diagram the "2 1/2 dimensional" shadow of such a knot representative on S2 from a particular vantage point P, i.e. the light source for the shadow is at P, and the "2 1/2" means that the over and under information is shown. My question involves how the set of knot diagrams of a particular fixed knot representative vary as P, the viewpoint varies. We know about the Reidemeister rules, which generate a group of transformations of knot diagrams in a way such that the underlying knot remains invariant under changes of both ambient isotopy and projection. Intuitively there is also a smaller group of pure "projective" transformations of knot diagrams under which any fixed knot representative remains invariant. Assuming that, what are the relations between these two groups of transformations of knot diagrams? 

One observation: $$A = I+L,$$ where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with $0$ in the diagonals. This matrix $L$ can be seen to satisfy $L^n=0$, and $L^j\ne 0,\ 1\le j\le n-1$. Thus, one can write $$A^{-1}=(I+L)^{-1}=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}(-1)^jL^j$$ 

You can try applying gradient ascent method and run it for a few iterations to get an initial guess for $\mathbf{t}$. As the function is strongly concave, the gradient ascent is sure to converge to its unique global maxima, and so running it for a few iterations will produce a good approximation for the true global maxima. Actually, by analyzing the gradient ascent steps, you can estimate how many iterations you need to run it for the approximation to meet a prespecified approximation error required for the Newton-Raphson/Halley method to succeed. See this for such a discussion. 

Stellar aberration, the change in the apparent positions of more or less most of the night sky with the seasons, directly due to the velocity of the earth in its orbit. Note - aberration, which is related to the idea that raindrops appear to fall slanted in a moving vehicle, is not the same as parallax, e.g. has no relation to the distance of the stellar source, etc. :-) See $URL$ . Predicted by Bradley in 1725. First measured > 0 by Bessel in 1838, with unpublished successful observations by Henderson 5 years earlier. See $URL$ . 

I think this limit could be found, had the target set been a commutative ring, by an application of Newton's identity, but because of the noncommutative nature here, I cannot apply that principle here. Is there any way to tackle this problem? Please make reference to any material available, as I do not have any proper background on non-commutative ring theory (nor on ergodic theory applied to rings, for that matter), apart from the basics of rings. Thanks in advance. 

How to form your own math circle or some other teaching movies, especially with kids solving problems and having fun at it. I mentioned this in a comment, but it could use elaboration and advertisement. Museums are for people, especially kids. One goal is to empower kids to feel they can think. Some sort of exhibits on what really good mathematics teaching feels like could be tremendously inspiring. The museum could be a living organizing center for this. 

Ok, I understand and am convinced by the standard solution of the Monte Hall Problem, i.e. it is better to switch doors after Monte opens one, and improve one's probability of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. If I had remaining doubts, they were removed by the many computer simulations, e.g. see $URL$ But then I came up with what I call the "three card monte problem". Assume you are playing a variant of 3 card monte against a blindingly fast but honest dealer, who will also turn over a losing card, before your once and final guess. Do you have a strategy that improves your probability to better than 1/2? Well, here's one. You choose a card, mentally, but do not reveal it. The dealer then turns over one of the other cards, which he knows is always not the "special winning card". There is prob = 1/3 that the turned over card is the card that you previously secretly mentally chose. If that happens, you still can choose again, and therefore have prob = 1/2 of choosing the winner. If the card turned over by the dealer is not the card you secretly chose mentally, then you are apparently playing the classic Monte Hall game, i.e. you should secretly mentally switch card positions to increase your prob of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. Your overall prob. of winning is (1/3)(1/2) + (2/3)(2/3) = 1/6 + 4/9 = 33/54 = 11/18 > 1/2 The paradox arises from the fact that another player, who chose the other hidden card which was not turned over also has the same 11/18 probability of winning. So you both switch? The difference between this and the classical Monte Hall paradox is that because no player has to declare any card position, you both can switch. Is this right? If this gets too argumentative, I'll put it somewhere else. 

The integral converges as it is easily seen to be upper bounded by $\sqrt{\pi/2}$. However, Laplace's method does not seem to work out as the maxima of the function $S(x) = -a\sqrt{1-e^{-x}}-x^2/2$ is located at the end point $0$. This question enquires about a similar problem, however, with the major difference that the $S(x)$ function there is given by $-a(1-e^{-x})-x^2/2$. The second answer to that problem suggests using a modified form of Laplace's method as given by V. Zorich, Mathematical Analysis II Chap. XIX, Par. 2.4, Theorem 1, to tackle the issue of maxima at an endpoint. However, for the problem at hand, this method breaks down as the function $S(x)$ is not differentiable at $0$. So, Laplace's method cannot be applied here. I tried using the transformation $1-e^{-x}\to x^2$ to obtain the integral $$\int_0^1 \frac{\exp(-a x-(\ln(1-x^2))^2/2)}{1-x^2}2xdx$$ From this, intuitively, it seems to me that, at least for large $a$, the integrand is concentrated highly around $0$, and there it seems to be approximated ``well'' by $2xe^{-ax}$, which produces a $\sim\frac{1}{a^2}$ trend. However, all this is very intuitive and I don't know how to transform this intuition into rigorous statements. Also, this intuition seems to serve well for getting asymptotics, but my true intention is to obtain tight upper bounds. As Laplace's method seems not to be a suitable choice, I do not have much idea about how to proceed to say anything about an upper bound. Please help. 

a. Euler's computation of Zeta(2), (at first with only very weak, handwaving, or no convergence arguments), as redacted in Polya or here. Obviously amazingly ingenious, and interesting for artists, connecting numbers and circles. Requires unerstanding that a polynomial is equal to the product of its first degree factors, possibly it is too well known, however. It also allows one to then revisit the convergence argument and show what mathematicians actually worry about, after the "flash of ingenuity" b. A lovely agument I heard a long time ago on sci.math relating to Sagan's book "Contact" in which a message is encoded in the bits of Pi. Someone asked whether a deity could arrange for Pi to be a different real number. Opinions went back and forth relating to spacetime, etc. Then someone asked, in light of any of the familiar series expansions, "If Pi were different, which natural number would be missing or duplicated, and how might that be?" Leads to a discussion of the Peano axioms. Everyone goes home wondering. :-)
