The first existence proof (due to Mark Pinsker, in 1973) for expanders relied on the probabilistic method. As such these expanders are (with probability one) not Cayley graphs. $URL$ 

Just to write out Ryan's answer: Let $S$ be the sphere with three closed disks removed. Let $T$ be the torus with one closed disk removed. Note that $T$ is non-planar. Thus $S$ is not homeomorphic to $T$. $\newcommand{\RR}{\mathbb{R}}$ $\newcommand{\cross}{\times}$ On the other hand, let $S' = S \cross \RR$ and let $T' = T \cross \RR$. Then $S'$ and $T'$ are both diffeomorphic to the open, genus two handlebody. Thus $S'$ and $T'$ are diffeomorphic to each other. I agree that this is homework, but it is good homework! What if $S$ and $T$ are required to be compact? 

If we allow cusps then the Whitehead link or the Borromean rings are good answers (fundamental domains have not too many sides and the gluings can be understood). If we allow orbifolds then the (4,0) filling on all components of the Borromean rings is a good answer. (This is carefully explained in the NotKnot video.) I tried to answer the original question, using SnapPea (see also SnapPy), to build a cyclic, four-fold, manifold cover of the Borromean orbifold. This was not successful. It is "obvious" that the resulting manifold has a right-angled fundamental domain, but the domain is huge (two octagons, eight hexagons, 16 pentagons) and it is hard (for me) to describe the face pairings or check that I haven't messed up in some way. More generally, I guess that one could use Andreev's theorem to build as "simple as possible" right-angled polyhedra and then look for low index torsion free subgroups of the resulting reflection groups. However I don't know how large an index we'd have to sacrifice or even if the resulting manifold will have a right-angled domain... Edit: I've accepted bb's answer below, because the first paper cited gives the required construction. However, I didn't understand this until I asked an expert off-line, who puckishly told me that this was equivalent to the four color theorem! Here is the construction: Suppose that $R$ is a right-angled three-dimensional hyperbolic polyhedron. Note that the edges of $R$ form a cubic graph in $\partial R$. Let $G_R$ be the subgroup of isometries of $H^3$ generated by reflections in the sides of $R$. Now, by the four-color theorem there is a four coloring of the faces of $R$ (so no two adjacent faces have the same color). This defines surjective homomorphism from $G_R$ to $(Z/2)^4$. Let $\delta = (1,1,1,1) \in (Z/2)^4$ and let $\Delta$ be the preimage in $G_R$ of the subgroup generated by $\delta$. Note that $\Delta$ has index eight in $G_R$ and is torsion-free. Finally, a fundamental domain for $\Delta$ is a obtained by gluing eight copies of $R$ around a vertex. Other cryptic tidbits I was fed: There is such a hyperbolic manifold in dimension four, coming from the 120-cell. This is the only example known. There are no such examples in dimensions five and higher. See Bowditch and Mess, referring to Vinberg and Nikulin. Further edit: In fact the argument using the four-color theorem can be found in the second paper of Vesnin, as cited by bb. 

There are (infinitely) many possibilities for the base. You will need to review the notion of "natural coordinates" for an abelian differential to see why there is at least one base (see, for example, page 25 of "Flat surfaces" by Zorich). Once you have one base, you can use that to construct a polygon $P$ of the kind you want. Now, add arcs to the base until you have cut $P$ into a collection of triangles. (This larger set will not be linearly independent in $H_1$, but that does not matter.) Now that you have a triangulation, you can "flip" edges of the triangulation to get new triangulations. After doing enough flips, and taking a subset of the edges, you can arrive at a new base, totally different from the old one. Exercise - do this for the square torus. 

This is false. Consider the triangle group $\Delta = \Delta(p,q,r)$ with presentation $$\langle a, b, c \mid a^p = b^q = c^r = abc = 1 \rangle.$$ So the product of $a$ and $b$ is elliptic. However, as $p, q, r \to \infty$ the fundamental domain (a triangle) has side-lengths tending to infinity. If you replace the $\delta$ in ${\rm Fix}_\delta(a)$ by a distance depending on the order of $a$, you should win. 

In particular, there is a 2-generated, torsion-free, infinite group $G$ with exactly two conjugacy classes. So, as YCor observes, every element in $G$ is conjugate to its square. Thus every cyclic subgroup of $G$ is distorted. 

You can cut a two-torus out of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and I think that a simple modification will cut a three-torus out of $\mathbb{R}^4$. So the answer to your second question is "yes". 

No, they are correct. They allow squares where the sidelength is not equal to one. If you like, we can say that the two translation surfaces $(X, \omega)$ and $(X, r\omega)$ (for $r$ positive and real) are "scalar multiples" of each other. Then under any definitions, the scalar multiples of the square-tiled surfaces are dense in the space of translation surfaces. 

Let FG be the graph of marked fat graphs. Let G be the graph of graphs obtained by forgetting the cyclic orders at the vertices. The forgetting map from FG to G is a quasi-isometry. This is because fibres are finite and the diameter of a fibre is finite. The bound on diameter holds because Out(Fn) acts co-finitely on G. Finally, the graph G is quasi-isometric to Out(Fn) as it is a coarsely dense subset of a spine for outerspace. Composing the quasi-isometries shows that FG is gi to Out(Fn). But your question is more algebraic in nature. Perhaps Matthew Horak's thesis paper $URL$ is what you are looking for. There fat-graphs (called ribbon graphs) are used to realize outer space as a union of Teichmuller spaces. 

$\newcommand{\Mod}{\mathrm{Mod}}$As with lattices in Lie groups, and in word-hyperbolic groups, the mapping class group of a surface has finitely many torsion subgroups, up to conjugacy. This means, in principle, if you fix $g$ and $b$ then you can list all finite subgroups of $\Mod(S_{g,b})$. This follows (for example) from "Nielsen realization" stating that for any finite subgroup $G$ in $\Mod(S_{g,b})$ there is a hyperbolic metric on $S$ where $G$ acts via isometries. Despite this one should note that for any finite group $H$ there is a $g > 0$ so that $H$ is a subgroup of $\Mod(S_g)$. Also, note that if you require that the surface has boundary, and require all mapping classes and isotopies to fix the boundary pointwise, then the finite order elements go away. For example, the braid group has no torision. 

It is always easier to think about the spherical case first. You can see that all round, two-dimensional spheres, regardless of radius, admit tessellations. So constant curvature $+1$ is not necessary. On the other hand, constant positive curvature should be a requirement. (In fact, it is fair to require that the metric be homogeneous and isotropic. Otherwise what does it mean for tiles of the tessellation to be identical?) The case of constant negative curvature is the same. The choice of constant doesn't really matter, so you might as well use $-1$. For an elementary discussion, with many beautiful pictures, see "Noneuclidean tesselations and their groups", by Wilhelm Magnus. A more modern treatment, also with wonderful graphics is "Indra's Pearls" by Mumford, Series, and Wright. 

A quick skim of the paper you linked to finds (on paragraph two of page two) comments by Bar-Natan suggesting that his improvement should take time $\exp({\sqrt{n}})$, beating the naive algorithm (taking time $\exp(n)$). That is, the improvement hopefully makes an exponential algorithm subexponential. He is not claiming a sublinear algorithm. 

Suppose that $S$ is your Riemannian surface and $X \subset S$ is a flat subsurface (that is, locally isometric to $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual metric). Let's suppose that $X$ has some nontrivial topology. For example, $X$ is a unit disk minus one-half of a unit disk, and the core curve of $X$ is essential in $S$. You are correct in thinking that the universal cover of $S$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{D}$ the unit disk. However, it is impossible to choose this homeomorphism so that the universal cover of $X$, call it $\bar{X}$, embeds isometrically in $\mathbb{D}$. You cannot even arrange this up to homothety. To see this, choose isometric charts for $X$ that lift to give isometric charts for $\bar{X}$. After choosing where any one chart of $\bar{X}$ goes in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (isometrically!) the positions of all others will be determined. (This is the so-called "developing map" of $\bar{X}$ and you can think of it as being similar to the process of analytic continuation of a analytic function.) The point here is that the developing map will not be injective - in fact it will have image isometric to $X$ itself. I can't think off hand of a reasonable reference (Thurston's book is perhaps an unreasonable reference). Think about it and ask any local geometers or post more questions on MO. 

With respect, this comment is confused. When SnapPea "recognizes" an unknot it only uses combinatorial algorithms. When you give SnapPea a diagram of the unknot it first uses ad hoc, but purely combinatorial, techniques to triangulate and then simplify the knot complement. After getting down to some very small number of tetrahedra (2 to 5, say) it then tries to find a finite volume hyperbolic structure on the knot complement. SnapPea uses Newton's method as applied to the Thurston gluing equations: I would not call this step combinatorial. However, that is not relevant to your question -- Snappea always fails to find such a structure because it does not exist. You then ask SnapPea "What is the fundamental group of the knot complement?" SnapPea then uses other ad hoc, but combinatorial, techniques to simplify the fundamental group. These succeed because the number of tetrahedra is small -- SnapPea reports that $\pi_1 \cong \mathbb{Z}$ and Bob's your uncle by the Disk Theorem. Edit: I was going to give a brief description of what SnapPea does in the retriangulation step. But Jeff Weeks' code and comments are very clear: the file to look at is simplify_triangulation.c in the SnapPea kernel. 

Mosher's proof is, I think, fine. You should re-read the definition of $i(\delta, \{h\})$ given on line -14 of page 38 of Mosher's paper. The sequence of flips produced by Mosher's algorithm is at most linear in the total intersection number. This worst-case bound is realized when the two triangulations differ by a power of a Dehn twist. (An average-case case bound is also possible; here the number of flips will be the log of the total intersection number.) Another algorithm can be deduced from Hatcher's paper "Triangulations of surfaces". 

As Misha says, this is false as stated. To see this: Apply the dilation $A \colon z \mapsto z/2$ to $F$. Note $i$ lies in the interior of $A(F)$. Since $i$ is fixed by a torsion element of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, deduce that $A(F)$ is not a fundamental domain. There are several different things you might be trying to ask here. I suggest you have a bit of a think, and then ask a new question. 

An ideal tetrahedron has no vertices. The zero-skeleton (of Thurston's triangulation of the figure eight knot complement) is empty. 

Recall that $S$ is the surface and $Y$ is the annular subsurface. Masur and Minsy take an annular cover $\tilde{Y}$ and work there. The cover $\tilde{Y}$ depends only on the free homotopy class of any core curve $\alpha \subset Y$. 

There are two ways to interpret your question. First -- since you are talking about braids, perhaps you are asking about the conjugacy problem for braids. This is the same as taking a braid closure, with an braid axis. In this case the ultra summit set (USS) of a braid $\sigma$ is a complete invariant for conjugacy classes. It is an open question whether or not USS($\sigma$) is polynomial sized (and hence polynomial time computable). There are other approaches to the conjugacy problem in braid groups, but none are know to be polynomial time. Second -- if you are not including the axis, then, by a result of Alexander, every link can be represented as the closure of a braid. So your question might be: is there a polynomial time solution to the isotopy problem for links? No such algorithm is known. That the isotopy question is even decidable depends on Thurston's geometrization theorem for Haken manifolds; also, a great deal of work prior to Thurston is needed. Finally -- you ask if there is an invariant that fails with only "negligible probability". This is a good question - I don't know the answer. Just to make things clear. You have the following model of random links: (a) chose a braid index, (b) choose a length, and (c) choose a random braid of that index and length in the standard generators. Now take the closure to get a link. This is a perfectly nice model of random links. I suggest you consider the multi-variable Alexander polynomial. It can be computed in polynomial time, and I believe that it fails with probability tending to zero (for fixed index, and as the length tends to infinity). EDIT: There is a problem closely related to the conjugacy problem in the braid group; this is the determination of the Nielsen-Thurston type of a braid as either reducible or pseudo-Anosov. This has a polynomial-time solution, due to Matthieu Calvez - see his paper Fast Nielsen-Thurston classification of braids. FURTHER EDIT: There have also been, very recently, claims concerning the conjugacy problem for pseudo-Anosovs (and the general conjugacy problem) in mapping class groups. Margalit, Strenner, and Yurttas have claimed a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a pseudo-Anosov, computes the veering triangulation for the associated surface bundle. This is a complete conjugacy invariant for such mapping classes. Here are some notes from a talk by Margalit. Bell and Webb are claiming a polynomial-time solution to the general conjugacy problem, based on techniques from their paper Polynomial-time algorithms for the curve graph and using some new ideas.
