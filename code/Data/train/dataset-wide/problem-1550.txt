I think what you want it for is all important? I use World Wide Telescope ($URL$ as a demonstration tool. You can use it to look at any part of the sky using a variety of catalogues and imagery. The default "background" imagery is from the digitised sky survey. The way it works is that if you zoom into an area it downloads higher and higher resolution images, but you can cache these. Thus you can scan and cache the whole of Orion so that you can pan and zoom (particularly effective with a mouse wheel) rapidly and at will at a later date. You can also supplement the DSS images with (e.g. HST images of the Orion Nebula cluster), which are overlaid and rotated correctly onto the DSS image. If you have an HD display, then of course you can take a screenshot of any view you arrange. 

Let's take an average albedo for the Earth of 0.3 (it depends, which hemisphere is visible, how much cloud cover etc.). That means the Earth reflects 30% of the light incident upon it. The flux $f$ falling on the Earth is given by $$ f_{\odot} = \frac{L_{\odot}}{4\pi d^2} = 1.369\times10^{3}\ Wm^{-2}$$ where $L_{\odot}=3.85\times10^{26}\ W$ from the Sun and $d= 1$AU. The integrated luminosity from the illuminated hemisphere will be $$L_{earth} = 0.3\pi R^2 f = 5.2\times10^{16}\ W$$ So now we can compare this with the Sun. One hemisphere of the Sun radiates $1.93\times10^{26}\ W$, and produces a flux of $1.369\times10^{3}\ Wm^{-2}$ at 1 AU. Therefore the illuminated hemisphere of the Earth results in a flux of approximately $f_E=0.056\ Wm^{-2}$, assuming the average Earth-Moon distance of 384,400 km. This calculation assumes isotropic emission, but it is quite likely that the albedo is higher for light reflected through 180 degrees. The Sun has an apparent magnitude of -26.74, so the magnitude of the "full-earth" at the moon is $$ m_{Earth} = 2.5\log_{10}\left( \frac{f_{\odot}}{f_{E}}\right) - 26.74 = \underline{-15.77}$$ The answer will of course vary with the albedo of the visible hemisphere, which in turn depends on the time of year and how much of the polar regions can be seen (e.g. $URL$ ). Variations of a few hundredths seem possible, which will lead to apparent magnitude variations in $m_{Earth}$ of $\sim \pm 0.1-0.2$ mag. The albedo may also vary in detail with the exact angle at which the sunlight hits the Earth - an "opposition surge" in brightness, when the Sun-Earth and Moon are almost aligned is possible. The Earth-Moon distance varies from 363,000 to 405,000 km. This will lead to magnitude variations of $\pm 0.12$ mag. A further way to check this is that the albedo of the Moon is 0.12 and it has a radius of 0.273 times that of the Earth. Therefore the Earth seen from the Moon ought to be $(0.3/0.12)\times(1/0.273)^2 = 33.5$ times brighter. This is 3.81 magnitudes brighter. The mean magnitude of the full Moon is -12.74 (maximum is -12.92), so the brightness of the "full Earth" should be -16.55 on average. I am not sure why these figures don't agree; I suspect it is that the albedo for reflection when the Sun's light is normally incident on the Moon is quite a bit larger than 0.12. The so-called "opposition surge". If the Earth's albedo behaves in the same way, then the latter figure may be more accurate than my first calculation. My gut instinct is that the answer is somewhere between the two. 

It would be located way off the diagram to the top and left i.e. moderately hot and very, very luminous. Of course it then changes with time as the supernova fades and cools. This paper by Faran et al. (2017) shows plots of luminosity and temperature versus time for type II supernovae. They start at 15,000K and luminosities of about a billion suns and then fade to about 5000K and by an order of magnitude in luminosity after 50 days. 

You cannot gauge the redshift of a galaxy by looking at a false colour image. The images taken through different filters are stacked and colourised to suit. You can say that the blue galaxies are indeed bluer than the red galaxies, but there is no absolute scale with which to judge redshift by eye. Secondly, there is no detail in the NASA web page, but the ACS and WFC3 cameras have near infrared capabilities. So I would think that this image is a visual false-colour image of information that extends well redward of what the eye can perceive. So even the things that look blue might have a spectrum that peaks at redder wavelengths, whilst anything that looks red might actually be infrared! However, beyond this, in order to judge what the redshifted appearance of a galaxy would be, you would need to know what the galaxy looked like with zero redshift. That is, light that is emitted in the ultraviolet could be redshifted into the visible part of the spectrum. It is entirely possible that visual colour of a redshifted galaxy would not change very much at all if the galaxy emitted lots of UV light in its frame of reference or equally, if it emitted lots of very red light that was then redshifted out of the telescope's sensitivity range. Finally, there could be some genuine astrophysics going on. Many distant galaxies are bluer than nearby galaxies because they are undergoing intense star formation. Massive star forming regions emit copious UV light that is redshifted into the optical. Finally, finally! Many of the galaxies in the picture will be quite close and will not be very redshifted. 

Gravitational lensing of background galaxies and quasars is used to probe the amount of gravitating matter in foreground objects such as clusters of galaxies. Here is an example, taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. 

The "redshift" of a distant galaxy is defined in terms of its line of sight velocity. In our model of the expanding universe, once we move away from the local group of galaxies (which have their own peculiar motions), distant galaxies follow the Hubble flow and to first order have a line of sight velocity tht is proportional to their distance way (it gets more complicated for very distant galaxies). Distant galaxies may well have a "tangential" velocity too, but for galaxies outside the local group these velocities will be be negligible compared with the redshift. i.e. The line of sight velocity due to the expansion of the universe is dominant. I guess by "parallax drift" you actually mean proper motion - which is the rate at which a star's position changes with respect to the celestial coordinate system. This proper motion depends on how far away the star is and how fast it is moving tangentially with respect to the solar system. Thus to estimate a tangential velocity you need both the proper motion and the distance to the star. I think the most distant object for which a proper motion has been determined with any accuracy is the Andromeda galaxy, which is a couple of million light years away. This was achieved by studying the position of many stars in Andromeda over a 7 year period using the Hubble Space Telescope. The details can be found in Sohn et al. (2012); but the headline numbers are that the proper motion is a mere $\sim 0.05$ milli-arcseconds per year(!) , implying a tangential velocity (with respect to the solar system) of about 150 km/s. Another candidate is measuring the velocities of material in the jet of the active galaxy M87 by Meyer et al. (2013). This galaxy is at 50 million light years, but the motion of the jet is only detectable here because it is moving relativistically. These are quite special cases. In general, the tangential velocities of stars in our Galaxy are small and large-scale susrveys of proper motions are generally inaccurate beyond a few thousand light years. The upcoming Gaia results will improve this dramatically meaning we have good proper motions for objects out to tens of thousands of light years. 

I think your question is answered by the duplicate mentioned: but here are the relevant highlights. Humphreys & Larsen (1995) suggest, using star count information, a distance of $20.5 \pm 3.5$ pc above the Galactic plane; consistent with, but more precise than the Bahcall paper referred to by Schleis. Joshi (2007) is more guarded, investigating some systematic uncertainties in the estimation techniques and ends up with distances between 13 and 20 pc above the plane. The Sun moves at about 15-20 km/s with respect to a local standard of rest defined by the general motion of stars in our vicinity around the Galaxy. In three-dimensions, this "peculiar velocity" is $U=10.00 \pm 0.36$ km/s (radially inwards), $V=5.25 \pm 0.62$ km/s (in the direction of Galactic rotation) and $W=7.17 \pm 0.38$ km/s (up and out of the plane). (Dehnen & Binney 1998). Different authors arrive at velocities that differ by $\sim 1-2$ km/s from these values and so this would probably be a more conservative estimate of the uncertainties. The Sun executes oscillations around its mean orbit in the Galaxy, periodically crossing the Galactic plane. I borrowed this illustration (not to scale!) from $URL$ to show this oscillatory motion. The oscillations will not be exactly sinusoidal because the restoring force towards the plane does not very linearly with height above the plane. As the Sun is currently above the plane and moving upwards, and each cycle takes about 70 million years with an amplitude of 100pc (Matese et al. 1995), it will be roughly 30 million years before we cross the plane again. EDIT: Actually I'm glad I revisited this question because I think the picture is not very good at all. As the Sun takes ~230 million years to go around the Gaaxy, it should only execute 3 complete vertical oscillations in our Galactic year, whereas the picture implies many more. Secondly, the Sun executes a radial oscillation with a period of around 160 million years, which is not even indicated! 

There is no general consensus on this. Different evolutionary models give different results. The factors (in addition to the initial mass of the star) that effect the final black hole mass would be the rotation rate of the progenitor, its composition (or metallicity) and whether it was in a binary system or not and whether that binary system was able to transfer mass. Rotation is thought to be important because it affects internal mixing and therefore the rate at which fuel is supplied to the core and the rat at which processed material gets to the surface, affecting the atmospheric composition. It can also enhance mass loss. The composition is important because mass loss is driven by radiation and radiative opacities are higher for high metallicity compositions. A set of calculations by Heger et al. (2003) are one of the canonical works on this subject. Below is a plot of initial mass versus remnant mass for stars with big bang primordial abundance (zero initial metallicity) and then the same again for stars of solar metallicity. The ratio of the red line to dotted "no mass loss" line gives the fraction you are after. In zero metallicity (primordial) stars it increases from 10-40% for initial masses of 25-100 solar masses and is perhaps even higher for supermassive population III stars. (I stress that these are theoretical results). For solar metallicity stars the results are a bit different. The ratio of the red line to the dotted line varies from 10-25% for 25-40 solar masses, but then it is not clear whether black holes can even form at even higher masses because of the much higher mass loss rates (see the difference between the dotted line and the blue curve).
