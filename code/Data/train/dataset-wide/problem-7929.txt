I want to know the reference for the following theorem (Theorem 5.28. in Kollar-Mori's book "Birational geometry of algebraic varieties"): Theorem Let $f:X \rightarrow S$ be a proper flat morphism of algebraic varieties such that $f^{-1}(s)$ has only canonical singularities. Then (1) $\omega_{X/S}^{[q]}$ commutes with base change. (2) $\\chi (X_s, \omega_{X_s}^{[q]}) $ is locally constant. Kollar-Mori's book refers to Kollar's Ph.D thesis. They don't seem to mention about what is $q$. Q1 Is $q$ arbitrary integer? Q2 Are there other references on this theorem? If $-K_{X_s}$ is ample and $X$ satisfies the hypothesis of the theorem, then this theorem seems to imply that $h^0(X_s, -m K_{X_s})$ is invariant under small deformations. Is it true? 

Let $p$ be a prime, and $\alpha$ a positive integer. How do you compute the space of $p$-ordinary $p$-adic modular forms (in the sense of Serre) of weight 2 on $\Gamma_0(p^\alpha)$? I'm really only concerned with the cases where $\Gamma_0(p^\alpha)$ is genus zero and $\alpha = 1, 2$. [Edit: Changed from space of $p$-adic modular forms (which is really big) to the subspace of $p$-ordinary forms (which I think should be finite dimensional)] 

Let $k = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$, where $m \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$. Let $\epsilon$ be the fundamental unit of $k$ satisfying $\epsilon > 1$. A paper I'm reading involves studying the 2-torsion fields of elliptic curves $E/k$ which have global minimal models and everywhere good reduction. The fields $k(\sqrt{\pm \epsilon})$ come up a lot, and the paper constantly considers the cases $N_{k/\mathbb{Q}}(\epsilon) = 1$ and $N_{k/\mathbb{Q}}(\epsilon) = -1$ separately. I don't really get how $N(\epsilon)$ controls the structure of $k(\sqrt{\pm \epsilon})/\mathbb{Q}$. For example, the paper states that if $N(\epsilon) = 1$, then the field extensions are Galois. Why is this true, and in general what does the sign of the norm of an element tell you? Since the sign goes away when you consider norms of ideals, I've never really thought about this. Sorry if there's just a basic Galois theory / algebraic number theory fact I'm missing! 

Let $X = (f=0) \subset \mathbb{C}^3$ be an isolated hypersurface singularity and $\mu: \tilde{X} \rightarrow X$ be a resolution of a singularity whose exceptional locus $E$ is simple normal crossing. Then Question Is $H^1(\tilde{X}, \mathcal{O}_{\tilde{X}}(- E)) =0$ ? I think it's OK if it is Du Bois. How about in general? 

Let $V, \tilde{V}$ be smooth algebraic varieties over $\mathbb{C}$ and $f \colon \tilde{V} \rightarrow V$ a projective (or proper) birational morphism. Assume that the exceptional locus $E \subset \tilde{V}$ has codimension $\ge 2$. Question Is $f$ an isomorphism? 

Let $x \in U$ be a germ of a $3$-dimensional terminal quotient singularity of type $\frac{1}{r} (1,a,r-a)$ over $\mathbb{C}$. Let $D \in |-K_U|$ be an anticanonical divisor. Assume that $D$ is normal and singular at $x$. Let $\mu: \tilde{U} \rightarrow (U,D)$ be a log resolution such that $\mu$ is isomorphism outside $x$. Question Is $H^1(\tilde{D}, \mathcal{O}_{\tilde{D}}(-\tilde{D}) =0$? It seems that $H^1(\tilde{U}, \mathcal{O}_{\tilde{U}}(-\tilde{D}))=0$. If $H^2(\tilde{U}, \mathcal{O}_{\tilde{U}}(-2\tilde{D})) =0$, the statement in the Question seems to be true. Is there a counterexample? 

I'm reading "On Ranks of Twists of Elliptic Curves and Power-Free Values of Binary Forms" by Stewart and Top, and struggling to understand the argument on pg 962 which shows that the rank of a particular elliptic curve $E_{D(t)}/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is exactly 2. Here are the relevant details: Start with the elliptic curve $$E/\mathbb{Q}: y^2 = x^3 + 1$$ and the polynomial $$D(t) = 2t(t - 1)(t + 1)(2t + 1)(t + 2) \in \mathbb{Z}[t].$$ Let $C/\mathbb{Q}$ be the curve given by $s^3 = D(t)$ and let $$E_D/\mathbb{Q}(t): y^2 = x^3 + D(t)^2.$$ For each point $P = (x(t), y(t))$ in $E_D(\mathbb{Q}(t))$, we define an element $\phi_P$ of $\text{Mor}_\mathbb{Q}(C, E)$ by $$\phi_P(t, s) = (x(t)/s^2, y(t)/s^3).$$ Then we have a map $$\lambda: E_D(\mathbb{Q}(t)) \to H^0(C, \Omega^1_{C/\mathbb{Q}})$$ given by $$\lambda(P) = \phi_P^\ast \omega_E$$ which is shown to be a homomorphism with finite kernel. We want to use this homomorphism to show that the rank of $E_D/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is exactly two. First, we can find two points, and show they are independent by looking at their images under $\lambda$. This is fine, and shows that the rank is at least 2. Next, we want to show that the rank is at most 2. We know that the image lands in $H^0(C, \Omega^1_{C/\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_3))$, the eigenspace on which the automorphism of $C$ given by $\zeta(t, s) = (t, \zeta_3 s)$ acts on differentials as multiplication by $\zeta_3$. This constrains the image to the 3-dimensional space, say spanned by $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$ (this numbering is different from the paper). All of this makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense is how the authors constrain the image to a 2-dimensional subspace. They define three involutions on $C$, called $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3$, and show that the space of $\sigma_i^\ast$-invariant holomorphic differentials is generated by $\omega_i$. Hence the quotient of $C$ by $\sigma_i$ is an elliptic curve. In two cases, the curve is isogenous to $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and in the third case it is not. From this, they somehow infer that the rank is 2. I'm very confused about this, and would appreciate some more details or a reference. Thanks! 

Let $S$ be a smooth projective surface over $\mathbb{C}$ and $L$ be an ample line bundle on $S$. Let $d$ be a positive integer such that $dL$ is very ample and $D$ a very general member of the linear system $|dL|$. Let $T_D \rightarrow S$ be the degree $d$ cyclic cover branched along $D$. Assume that the Picard number $ \rho(S) =1 $. Q.(Edited) Is the picard number $\rho(T_D)$ $1$ for a sufficiently large integer $d$? 

Let $C$ be an effective Cartier divisor on a smooth projective surface $S$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $0$. Assume that $C$ has a reduced irreducible component $C_1$ (even though $C$ may not be reduced) and assume that $h^1(C, \mathcal{O}_C) =1$.(Edited) Let $x_1 \in C_1$ be a closed point on the smooth part $C_1^0$ of $C_1$. Question (1) Is it possible to define $a \colon C_1^0 \rightarrow {\rm Pic}^0 C ; x \mapsto \mathcal{O}_C(x-x_1)$? (2) If so, is $a$ a non-constant morphism? 

Take a simple random walk $\gamma$ in the complex plane conditioned to start at point $a$ and end at point $b$. For this random walk, we can define the winding number $W_\gamma(a,b)$ around $b$ in the usual way for complex curves. If instead we have a 2D Brownian motion $Z=X+iY$, then this definition becomes more complicated. For example, if we have a Brownian motion starting at the origin, we can talk about the winding number $\theta_t$ at time $t$ around the origin by solving the stochastic differential equation $d\theta_t=\frac{X_tdY_t-Y_tdX_t}{|Z_t|^2}$ with initial condition $\theta_0=0$. The issue is that for Brownian motion, we cannot condition on the path $Z$ to hit a particular point, because this has probability zero. Moreover, by considering annuli around $b$ and the fact that planar Brownian motion moves between concentric annuli with positive probability, it seems to me the situation becomes rather singular. 

I have an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}(t)$, and I want to compute its rank. Does knowing the rank over $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ for some prime of good reduction give a bound on the rank over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$? I noticed that magma can compute 2 Selmer groups for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, so I was wondering if that would give me some info on the rank over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$. Or more generally, how would you go about computing the rank of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$? Note: I've read Stewart and Top's paper "On Ranks of Twists of Elliptic Curves and Power-Free Values of Binary Forms", but am wondering about other techniques. 

Bochner's theorem states that a positive definite function is the Fourier transform of a finite Borel measure. As well, an easy converse of this is that a Fourier transform must be positive definite. My question is: is there a high-brow explanation for why positive definiteness and Fourier transforms go hand-in-hand? As I understand it, positive definiteness imposes wonderfully strong regularity conditions on the function. We immediately deduce that the function is bounded above at its value at 0, that it is non-negative at 0 and that continuity at 0 implies continuity everywhere. A leading example I have in mind comes from probability. One can show (Levy's Theorem) that a sum of iid rv converges weakly to some probability distribution by considering the product of characteristic functions and showing that its tail converges to 1 around an interval containing 0, so by positive definiteness and by the identity $1-\mbox{Re} \phi(2t) \leq 4(1-\mbox{Re} \phi(t))$ this implies convergence to a degenerate distribution. It just seems rather mysterious to me how this kind of local regularity becomes global. Edit: To be a little more specific, I understand that the Radon Nikodym derivative is positive and $e^{ix}$ is positive definite. I am more interested in consequences of positive-definiteness on the regularity of the function. For example, if one takes the 2x2 positive definite matrix associated with the function and considers its determinant, it follows that $|f(x)|\leq |f(0)|$. If I take the 3x3 positive definite matrix, I can conclude that if $f$ is continuous at 0, it is then continuous everywhere. My issue is that these types of arguments give me no intuition at all as to what positive definiteness is. Let me thus add an additional question: what is it about positive definiteness that adds such regularity conditions? 

Given a polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $d$, consider the following three sets: $$N_1(x) = \#\{k \leq x: f(k) \text{ is square-free}\}$$ $$N_2(x) = \#\{n \leq x: n = f(k) \text{ is square-free}\}$$ $$N_3(x) = \#\{n \leq x: n \text{ is the square-free part of $f(k)$}\}$$ Generally, we should have that $N_1(x) \sim c x$ (not proven for large degrees, assumes that $f$ satisfies the necessary congruence conditions). Then $N_2(x) \sim c' x^{1/d}$. What do we know about the growth of $N_3(x)$? Do we get significantly more values by considering square-free parts and not just square-free values? Any references for this would be appreciated. Edit: Changed from big-O notation to make order of growth more precise. 

From the comments, log convexity leads one to conclude that Riemann Hypothesis implies Lindelof hypothesis. The implication of log convexity comes from Hadamard Three Circle Theorem 

I believe the common name for such graphs is rigid. In fact, most random graphs are rigid. See this reference: On the minimal order of a graphs within a semigroup. 

I was thinking that the Hillman-Grassl correspondence would be useful here: every such partition bijects to a function $f:\lambda\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$. However, there are two things that are unclear to me here. First, is there an obvious restriction on $f$ to give $k$-bounded weak reverse partitions? Second, the bijective aspect of the correspondence gives two relations: $$|\pi|=\sum_{v\in\lambda}f(v)h(v),$$ where $|\pi|=\sum_{ij}\pi_{ij}$ and $h(v)$ is the hook-number of the cell $v$. Equivalently, summing over all partitions, $$\sum_{\pi}q^{|\pi|}=\prod_{v\in\lambda}\frac{1}{[h(v)]_q},$$ where $[\cdot]$ is the $q$-analogue. In both of these equations, I fail to see how one would obtain a uniform measure on the all such partitions. Is there maybe a hook-walk-like algorithm that could generate the appropriate class of $f$'s? Or perhaps there is a direct way to generate the $\pi_{ij}$? 

If $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ is a imaginary quadratic field with discriminant $-D$, then we get Heegner points on $X_0(N)$ as long as there exists $\mathfrak{n} \subset \mathcal{O}_K$ such that $\mathcal{O}_K/\mathfrak{n} \simeq \mathbb{Z}/N$. For this to happen, we need all of the primes $p \mid N$ to either split or ramify in $\mathcal{O}_K$. Gross-Zagier was originally proved when the "Heegner hypothesis" is satisfied, i.e. all of the primes $p$ split. However, in applications, this hypothesis is not always satisfied. However, Heegner's original paper used $D \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$ and $N = 32$, so $2 \mid N$ is inert. How do you get points on $X_0(N)$ in this situation? I couldn't find an English translation or summary of Heegner's paper, and am confused as to how this works.
