Consider a Wang tiling (given a subset of $C^4$ for a finite set $C$ of colours, e.g.). It's well-known to be undecidable whether there exists a tiling, and also whether there exists a periodic tiling. It's also well-known that there exists a periodic tiling iff there exists a doubly periodic tiling. On the other hand, for any given n, then it's decidable whether there exists a periodic tiling with period $(n,0)$: construct a directed graph with vertex set $C^n$ and an edge from $v$ to $w$ if there exists a tiling of the $n\times1$ rectangle with identical left and right labels and $v,w$ at the bottom and top respectively. Then there exists such a periodic tiling iff this graph has a loop. Here is a question I can't answer: for any given $n$, is it decidable whether there exists a periodic tiling with period $(n,m)$ for some $m$? 

Let $g$ be a Lie ring (Lie algebra over $\mathbb Z$), and let $U(g)$ and $S(g)$ denote the universal enveloping and symmetric algebra of $g$. The Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem (in the form proved by Lazard, see "Sur les algebres enveloppantes universelles de certaines algebres de Lie, M Lazard - Publ. Sci. Univ. Alger. Ser. A, 1954) yields a ring isomorphism between $S(g)$ and an associated graded of $U(g)$. I can prove that $S(g)$ and $U(g)$ are isomorphic as $\mathbb Z$-modules; this essentially follows from the proof by Lazard. Is this already known? 

This is an attempt to give a family of counterexamples, somewhat following Victor Protsak's comment. The basic idea is: let $\phi:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4$ be a generic Langlands parameter. Then I think $\phi^{Sp_4}:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4\subset SO_5$ should be usually generic, while $\phi^{GL_5}:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4\subset SO_5\subset GL_5$ is always non-generic as it factors through $GL_4\subset GL_5$. How do we really find such an $\phi$? I am not familiar with the LLC for $Sp_4$ at all, but there are examples that can work. Here is one: let $p\not=2$, $T$ be a two-dimensional unramified anisotropic torus, and $\chi:T\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^{\times}$ a tamely ramified character that is "in general position." By LLC for tori we get $\phi_{\chi}:W_F'\rightarrow {}^LT$. One can embed ${}^LT\subset W_F\times SO_4\subset W_F\times SO_5$, so that $\phi_{\chi}^{Sp_4}$ is generic; it will be a Langlands parameter corresponding to the depth-zero supercuspidals of DeBacker and Reeder. 

This is an (not satisfying) attempt of myself. Say a vector $v\in V$ is semisimple if its $G$-orbit is closed. Say two vectors $v_1,v_2\in V$ commute if there exists $c\in\bar{k}^{\times}$ such that $\mathrm{Stab}_G(v_1+cv_2)=\mathrm{Stab}_G(v_1)\cap\mathrm{Stab}_G(v_2)$. Define a Cartan subspace to be a subspace $S\subset V$ of commuting semisimple elements such that the map $S\hookrightarrow V\twoheadrightarrow V/\!/G$ is finite and surjective. Such Cartan subspaces aren't all conjugate for $\mathrm{SL}_3\curvearrowright\mathrm{Sym}^2(std)\bigoplus\mathrm{Sym}^2(std)$ (though for my own purpose it's fine here). They don't exist for $\mathbb{G}_m\curvearrowright\mathbb{G}_a^{\otimes2}\bigoplus \mathbb{G}_a\bigoplus \mathbb{G}_a^{\otimes-1}$. 

May I bother asking for hint how one can show it coincides with Lusztig's action? Thanks! - Just to add a failed attempt for mine for top homology in the $SL(2)$ case (must have done something stupid...). The way I understand Lusztig's action in the $SL(2)$ case is the following: The Springer sheaf of $SL(2)$ is the direct sum of (shifted) constant sheaf on nilpotent cone and a skyscraper sheaf at zero, while the Weyl group acts trivially on the first and by $-1$ on the second. Consequently, suppose $\dot{X}_{\gamma}$ is the ASF in the affine flag variety with $\dot{X}_{\gamma}\rightarrow X_{\gamma}$ where the latter is the ASF in $Gr$. The fiber of this map is either a point or $\mathbb{P}^1$ (like the Springer resolution). The generator of the affine Weyl group that corresponds to this choice of $Gr$ (there are two choices) acts by $-1$ on the $H^2$ of this $\mathbb{P}^1$ and acts trivially otherwise, as for the Springer sheaf. In other words, for the dual action on the top homology, it acts trivially on those non-contracted components in $Gr$ and acts as $-1$ on those contracted. For another generator of the affine Weyl group, we then use the projection to the other $Gr$. This does not look like a very interesting action - the two generators of the affine Weyl group have commuting actions - and is different from the action that Goresky-Kottiwtz-MacPherson give. 

Irreducible representations of the symmetric group Sym$(n)$, and degree-$n$ algebraic representations of SL$_d(\mathbb C)$ for $d\ge n$, can both be classified by Young diagrams with $n$ boxes. Consider now a degree-$n$ irreducible representation of SL$_d(\mathbb C)$ with $d\ge n$, and restrict it to the subgroup of permutation matrices Sym$(d)$. What is its decomposition in irreducibles? Is there a nice way of listing those Young diagrams (with $d$ boxes) which occur, constructed out of the Young diagram with $n$ boxes of the original representation? 

As for question 4, the answer is well understood for the fundamental groups of surfaces, or more generally for "formal spaces" $X$. In summary: renumber your series so that $G_1=G$. Then $V_i:=G_i/G_{i+1}$ is a free $\mathbb Z$-module for all $i$, and the direct sum $L:=\bigoplus_{i\ge1}V_i$ is a graded Lie algebra over $\mathbb Z$. E.g. for surface groups, it admits as presentation the natural linearization of the group presentation: $$L=\langle A_1,B_1,\dots,A_g,B_g\mid [A_1,B_1]+\dots+[A_g,B_g]=0\rangle.$$ The enveloping algebra of $L$ is a quadratic Koszul algebra, and its Koszul dual $U(L)^!$ is isomorphic to the cohomology algebra of $X$. The ranks of the sections $V_i$ may be recovered from the Betti numbers of $X$ using Koszul duality and Möbius invertion. More precisely, if $b_i$ are the Betti numbers of $X$, and $b(t)=\sum b_i t^i$ is its Poincaré series, and $c(t)=\sum c_i t^i$ is the Poincaré series of $U(L)$, then Koszul duality gives $c(-t)b(t)=1$. Then $c(t)=\prod_{i\ge1}(1-t^i)^{-\dim V_i}$ lets you compute $\dim V_i$. 

I think the following is true, but haven't came up with a proof myself. Thanks in advance! Let $G$ be a semisimple (to avoid more words) algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$. Write $F=\mathbb{C}((t))$ and $\mathcal{O}=\mathbb{C}[[t]]$. Is it true that a maximal solvable Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}(F)$ that is also a finitely generated $\mathcal{O}$-module must be an Iwahori subalgebra? In other words, is it true that all such Lie subalgebras are conjugate? (feel free to replace $F$ by your favorite non-archimedean local field) 

In response to Anton for a uniform proof of your formula: note that $K\backslash KaK\cong(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)\backslash K$. Let $\pi:K\rightarrow G(\mathbb{F}_q)$ be the natural quotient map, $K_1:=\ker(\pi)$ and $P:=\pi(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)$. Then $P$ is the $\mathbb{F}_q$-points of the parabolic subgroup of $G$ determined by the walls that $a$ lies on. We have $$|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)\backslash K|=|P\backslash G(\mathbb{F}_q)|\cdot|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash K_1|.$$ Let $\mathfrak{K}$ be the Lie algebra of $K$ and likewise for $\mathfrak{K}_1$. Choose Haar measures for the group and Lie algebra so that $\mu(K_1)=\mu(\mathfrak{K}_1)$. Since $a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1$ and $K_1$ are open compact, we have $|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash K_1|=\mu(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash\mu(K_1)=\mu(a^{-1}\mathfrak{K}a\cap\mathfrak{K}_1)\backslash\mu(\mathfrak{K}_1)=|(a^{-1}\mathfrak{K}a\cap\mathfrak{K}_1)\backslash \mathfrak{K}_1|$. Identifying $a$ as an element in the positive Weyl chamber in the cocharacter lattice, the last term is $q$ to the power of $\sum_{\alpha\in\Phi^+}\max(\langle a,\alpha\rangle-1,0)$, while the roots of $P$ are those $\alpha\in\Phi$ with $\langle a,\alpha\rangle\le 0$. 

Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a complete discrete valuation field with perfect residue field (or just a non-arch local field). Let $\mathcal{B}$ be its reduced Bruhat-Tits building, and $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ the distance function on $\mathcal{B}$. I am wondering if the following statement is true: There exists a constant $C$ such that for any compact element $x\in G$ (i.e. $\{x^n|n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ is contained in a compact subgroup), and any $p_1, p_2\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $x.p_1=p_2$, there exists $p_0\in\mathcal{B}$ with $$x.p_0=p_0,\;d(p_0,p_1)\le C\cdot d(p_1,p_2).$$ What I actually want is have an explicit $C$ in terms of $G$. For example, I'll guess that $C$ can be bounded by a constant multiple of the rank of $G$. E.g. when the rank is $1$ the assertion is true for $C=\frac{1}{2}$. 

I'm interested in tilings of the plane by squares, with labels on the edges. It's well known that (1) the question "can one tile the plane with the following finite set of tiles?" is undecidable, and (2) there are finite sets of tiles that tile the plane, but only aperiodically. Also, (1) implies (2). Is the question "can one tile the plane periodically with the following finite set of tiles?" decidable? 

The standard definition of computability, for a sequence $s\in\{0,1\}^\omega$, is that there is a Turing machine outputting $s[i]$ on input $i$. I'm looking for strengthenings of this notion; for example, in the above definition it's not decidable whether there is a $1$ in $s$; or, given $i$, whether there is a $1$ in $s$ at position $\ge i$. I would be happy to be shown a "natural" definition of computability that makes these predicates computable. To the above: if there were an algorithm that, from the Turing machine producing $s$, tells us whether $s$ contains a $1$ then I could do the following: from any Turing machine $M$, program a Turing machine outputting $s[i]=1$ if $M$ stops after $\le i$ steps. This sequence $s$ is obviously computable --- I said how to compute it --- but an algorithm determining if the sequence contains a $1$ would solve the Halting problem. A search through the literature didn't show anything, so links and references are most welcome! 

So the question is that, over a finite field, does there exist an abelian variety $A$ for which there does not exist a generically one-to-one morphism from a hyperelliptic curve $C$ to $A$. p.s. A result of Oort and de Jong proved that a "generic" abelian variety satisfies this property. However it seems generic means outside a countable subfamily in their result. I'm interested in this question because if we assume all motives over a finite field is semisimple (or just semisimplify it), then by Weil conjecture and Honda-Tate (maybe also Tate's conjecture over finite field), such motive all live in the tensor category of that of abelian varieties, or equivalently that of curves. I am then wondering if there could be any chance that they all actually come from hyperelliptic curves. 

Let $G$ be a (connected) reductive group over some ground field $F$ and $G^*$ its unique quasi-split inner form. Denote by $\operatorname{rank}_F G$ the split rank of $G$, i.e. the dimension of a maximal $F$-split torus in $G$, and likewise for $G^*$. Is it true that $$\operatorname{rank}_F G\le \operatorname{rank}_FG^*$$ with equality holds only if $G$ is isomorphic to $G^*$? For example, this will say that among unitary group that splits over a fixed separable quadratic extension $E/F$, the quasi-split one has the largest split rank (which is $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ for $U_n$), and is the only unitary group that achieves this split rank. For split groups this result will be obvious. I am mostly wondering about the case when $F$ is a non-archimedean local field (for Local Langlands, where the same Langlands parameter can be attached representations of both $G$ and $G^*$), but any suggestion/reference will be great. Thanks! 

Consider an augmented commutative ring $R$, with augmentation ideal $\varpi$. Let $\delta$ be a derivation of $R$. The example I have in mind is $R=\mathbb F_p[x]/(x^{p^i})$ and $\delta=d/dx$, though I would like statements as general as possible. I would like to know whether $\varpi^m f=0$ implies $\varpi^{m+1}\delta(f)=0$. My intuition is that $\delta$ maps $\varpi^m$ to $\varpi^{m-1}$, so somehow "divides by $\varpi$". I have found neither proof of the above statement nor counter-example. Bonus questions: is the property true for local rings ($\varpi$ is the unique maximal ideal)? graded local rings? Many thanks in advance! 

Yves's answer explains why $BS(n,\pm n)$ is virtually (a free group) x $\mathbb Z$. In particular, it is linear over $\mathbb Z$, and so may be generated by automata. This is the statement in the article [BS]. 

In their account $URL$ of Sjogren's theorem, Cliff and Hartley refer to two articles: [9] B. Hartley, A note on a lemma of Sjogren relating to. dimension subgroups, Research Report 229, Department of Mathematics, National University of Singapore, 1985. [21] G.E. Wall, to appear. (!) I am especially interested in the second reference, but no article by G.E. Wall from that period seems to match the (somewhat terse) citation. Does someone have a scanned copy of these prepublications? Many thanks in advance 

I recall having read, some time ago, a beautiful and poetic opening of an article (or was it a book?). From memory, it was by Shigefumi Mori, and talked about the (mathematical) universe consisting of two hemispheres, a real and a p-adic; somehow meeting at the equator. We mere humans should strive to contemplate both sides and their connections. I have tried to locate the precise reference of this text, including some of Mori's papers, but failed. In fact, I'm not anymore sure it was Mori. Does some kind soul know which reference I'm trying to recall? 

Let $G$ be an connected reductive group over finite field $k$. I will assume that $\text{char}(k)$ is very good for $G$ (or even larger, if preferred). Let $B\subset G$ be a Borel subgroup defined over $k$. Let $\mathfrak{h}\subset\text{Lie }G$ be a subspace such that $\mathfrak{h}\supset\text{Lie }B$ and $\text{Ad}(B)\mathfrak{h}=\mathfrak{h}$. Take any regular semisimple $X\in(\text{Lie }G)(k)$. Consider $$\mathcal{H}_{X,\mathfrak{h}}=\{g\in B\backslash G\,|\,\text{Ad}(g)X\in\mathfrak{h}\}.$$ Over $\bar{k}$, $\mathcal{H}_{X,\mathfrak{h}}$ has a stratification by affine spaces, given by first conjugate $X$ into a maximal torus $T\subset B$, then intersect $\mathcal{H}_{X,\mathfrak{h}}$ with the Schubert cells $B\backslash BwB$ for $w\in N_G(T)/T$. However this doesn't work over $k$ if $X$ does not centralize a maximal split torus. Question: Any method to count $\mathcal{H}_{X,\mathfrak{h}}(k)$? A naive try of mine was to just look at the Frobenius action on "Schubert cells", but it seems that Frobenius can send a Schubert cell to a "non-Schubert cell," i.e. to some cell that is not a Schubert cell from any pair of $(B^*,T^*)$. The motivation is that such counting problems simply appear if one wants to count points on affine Springer fibers, or more generally, compute $p$-adic orbital integral. 

Lusztig defined (in Sec. 5, also Sage) a Springer action of the affine Weyl group on the homology of affine Springer fibers (Iwahori one, i.e. in an affine flag variety). In the regular semisimple unramified case, Goresky, Kottiwtz and MacPherson had a formula (14.4) for this action assuming the homology is pure, for example in the equal valuation case, where they said
