Mere googling leads me to find a bunch of references about elasticity of marginal utility. Here Professor Acemoglu defines the elasticity of marginal utility as the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (pagg. 17-18). Here you can find a question analogous to yours together with an answer explained in an easier way than Acemoglu's lecture. If you are interested in something more empirical, have a look here: it is a paper by David Evans about the empirical estimation of elasticity of marginal utility in OECD countries. Hope this is enough. If you have other questions, please ask 

Studying the model of Krugman, 1991: the one in which good varieties are country-specific so that there is trade because in presence of increasing returns, each good is produced in only one country, I find its conclusions a bit counter-intuitive. The model states that a country will specialize in the production of the good for which it has the larger home market, the so-called home market effect. Thus, a country will the larger home market for a given good will be a net exporter of that good. Now, here is my question: let's analyze two European countries, i.e. Germany and Spain. For a given level of transportation costs, Germany will produce more varieties than Spain because it is larger (larger home market). If the EU Commission would propose the creation of a Single Market, i.e. a reduction of trade barriers, that we can interpret as transportation costs going down, will Spain accept? 

While I was studying, I stuck into a great debate between what is called "modern macro" and Keynesian macro with a lot of interesting and actual insights. I have already read about "classical economics", I mean Smith, Ricardo and so on but I did not succeed in finding a book/paper talking about the actual debate and its roots. Can you please suggest me some references in order to better understand the evolution of economic thought in the XX century and to make my own idea about the actual debate going on? 

I am trying to study the effects of a policy on educational attainment of individuals (years of schooling, primary/secondary school completion, literacy). Since the policy starts in a specific year I decided to use an RDD using birth year as running variable. The problem is that my sample is made of 5 different countries in which the policy has been implemented in 5 different years. Am I able to pool the effect of the policy across countries? Because if I build a unique running variable as being 0 for each cutoff year I get individuals born in e.g. 1994 having running variable both 0, -2, +3 depending on the country of origin. How can I deal with this issue? Should I run a RD for each country alone? 

I am working in a New Keynesian context so that the Phillips curve is usually specified as follows \begin{gather} \pi_t=\beta E_t\pi_{t+1}+\kappa x_t \end{gather} where $\beta$ is the discount factor, $\kappa$ is the slope of the curve depending negatively on the degree of price stickiness in the economy and $x_t=y_t-y^N_t$, with $y^N_t$ is the natural (potential) level of output What is driving me crazy is if this curve, specified as above, still make sense when we assume prices are fully flexible. I would say no, because in a flexible price context, the output gap would be zero and the firms would optimize in a static fashion (no need of taking into account expectations of future inflation). But, I have no idea about how to "transform" the model in this direction. 

If you are running a regression analysis I would say you should look first at p-values to check if the explanatory variables you added make sense. I mean if you have a hypothesis about a relationship among two variables and you find the explanatory one not significant (large p-value) I would check for possible mistakes or alternative explanations. It makes sense to have a look at $R^2$ if you are comparing two different specification, it does not really make sense looking at it alone. I have seen many papers, have a look at Nunn, Wantcheckon, (2011) as an example, which have been published on top journals (AER in this case) even with $R^2$ around 16%, not really an high value. 

Four-fifths of Algeria is just desert --which leaves no room for agriculture. The Algerian economy is mostly powered just by the oil industry, which contribute about ~70% of government revenues. Oil and oil related products constitute more than 80% of Algeria's exports. For example, Turkey has twice the population of Algeria but it has more than 7.5 times the cattle Algeria has. (14.2 in Turkey vs 1.6 in Algeria). So the short answer is that Algeria isn't just suited for Agriculture. 

Recently in a test I was asked to describe the modified IS-LM framework. I assumed I was being asked the IS-LM-BP model, since it modifies the traditional IS LM model by adding a BP curve. I looked up on a couple of references (Macroeconomics by Dornbusch, and Macroeconomics by Olivier Blanchard) but they have no reference to it. Looking the term up on a search engine only throws results about papers that suggest a modification to the IS LM model. What exactly is a modified IS-LM framework? 

Can this one-off cases be extended? For instance, if I employ someone to destroy 50 buildings and rebuild them, does that contribute an increase in GDP? 

I know that the Chilean central bank intervened in 2001 twice. Has it ever intervened since then? Is the Chilean Peso a completely free float currency? 

IS moves to the right (1 to 2) At B, there is a deficit in BOP, which causes the domestic currency to depreciate. This increases exports and decreases imports, which causes net exports to increase, which then causes Y to increase, which shifts IS further up (IS 3). At B, because of increase in net exports, BOP improve and so BP also shifts to the right. The economy settles at the new equilibrium C. 

GDP = Consumption + Government Expenditure + Investment + Exports - Imports My cases are: (1) If the employee is getting paid for his extra-work, his consumption would increase. (2) This employee might take away the job of someone else --and thus his increase in spending could get nullified By definition, GDP = the total value of all goods and services produced. (1) If even after working overtime, the company produces the same amount of goods / service --by definition, GDP hasn't risen at all. 

I found a better diagram illustrating this (the diagram includes two cases: one with the BP flatter than the LM and one steeper; the points and movements marked with an asterik (*) are the ones concerned with the case of BP being steeper than the LM). (Image Courtesy of Polinomics: $URL$ 

I'm currently learning the Mundell Fleming model, and so from my textbook and other sources I've figured out the effect of increase in money supply and government expenditure increase for the following conditions: 

Move the IS curve to the right. At this point (B), there will be a BOP deficit because the point is below the BP curve. Thus, the domestic currency will depreciate. Exports will rise, imports will decrease and thus net exports will rise. This will have two effects: (a) this will shift the IS curve further to the right (because net exports have risen, and so Y has risen) and (b) this will shift the BP curve to the right (because net exports have risen, improving the current account balance). The new equilibrium is at C. 

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare answered in the upper house to a question that India has a fertility rate of 2.2 (link here). The replacement fertility level is usually given at 2.1 to 2.2. These sources suggest that India's population is projected to grow at least until 2060 (2050 in some sources): Quartz, The Hindu. The Quartz article even cits UN population projects and says: "Even under the instant-replacement fertility variant, with the country’s fertility assumed to fall immediately to 2.1 births per woman, India’s population would reach 1.9 billion by the century’s close." This source defines the replacement fertility level as: "Replacement level fertility is the level of fertility at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next. In developed countries, replacement level fertility can be taken as requiring an average of 2.1 children per woman." What I don't understand is: how can India's population be projected to grow until 2060 if it has already reached replacement fertility level in 2017? A 'generation' is usually 25 years. Even if we take it as 30 years, India's population should stop growing in a couple of decades. How does the UN project that it'll grow until 2060? 

Yes, he is referring to a movement along the demand line. If the individual purchases less than $Q_0$, than the demand line would be higher than the price for quantities for $Q_0$, this means that the individual values consumption more than its cost (its price). Graphically, you just need to show that for a quantity less than $Q_0$, the demand line is higher than the price, i.e. the individual values consumption more than its cost. 

In a New Keynesian model, under the assumption of sticky prices, we need to express the monetary policy through an equation in order to close the model made of New-Keynesian Phillips curve and dynamic IS curve. I've read that an easy choice is to use the so called Taylor rule, which express the interest rate as a function of inflation (and possibly a random component). But, I've read that it is a suboptimal choice because it is something exogenous, whereas if we endogenously compute the optimal monetary policy we can reach a better result. My question is why using a Taylor rule when we know it is not optimal to do that? 

I was reading about the debate about income inequality and I would like to know your opinion on the matter. Basically, the positions are two: the classical one, which states that inequality is good for growth because it fosters innovation and investments and the most recent one, the one of IMF and OECD, which states that inequality causes a decrease in human capital investment among lower-income households, which prevent them to become earners or consumers in the future. I read that both are supported by empirical evidence but there is skepticism about them (e.g. Chris Giles on FT). What's your idea on the topic? Do you have any suggestion about literature/articles I can read about it? 

Assuming that $W$ is wage and $L$ is labor, I would say this is a labor supply-demand graph. TD stand for demand and S for supply. The graph shows a positive shift in labor supply, i.e. labor offered by workers, leading to an increase in $L$ and a decrease of $W$ due to the excess of supply. The shift in labor supply can be caused by a variety of shocks as a preference shock which values more labor, a change in non-labor income, etc (look here for explanations) 

There is no trick in that Euler equation. In the New Keynesian model, the Euler equation for consumption is derived from the first order condition for $B_t$, the bond holding. You have to pay attention to the fact that bonds appear in the budget constraint at two moments in time $t$ and $t+1$. Thus you have to compute the foc as \begin{gather} B_t:\beta^t\lambda_tQ_t-\beta^{t+1}\lambda_{t+1}=0 \end{gather} Then substituting $\lambda$ using the foc for $C_t$ and simplifying the betas, you obtain \begin{gather} Q_t=\beta E_t\{\frac{U_{c_{t+1}}}{U_{c_t}}\frac{P_t}{P_{t+1}}\}=0 \end{gather} EDIT: In the NK model, household maximizes its utility function choosing $C_t$, $N_t$ and $B_t$. Thus, you have to compute the FOC for these three variables, i.e. \begin{align} B_t:&\beta^t\lambda_tQ_t-\beta^{t+1}E_t\{\lambda_{t+1}\}=0 \\ C_t:&\beta^tU_{c,t}-\lambda_tP_t=0 \\ N_t:&\beta^tU_{n,t}-\lambda_tW_t=0 \end{align} In order to compute the consumption Euler equation, you need to substitute $\lambda_t$ from the $C_t$ foc into the $B_t$ foc. Then rearranging and simplifying $\beta$ as $\beta^{t+1}/\beta^t=\beta$ you get the equation you wrote above. You get only one $\beta$ because it is constant over time, it is not index by $t$ as the other variables, it is a constant. Thus whatever time is $C$, you will have the same $\beta$. I think it is well explained in Gali too. 

A share or stock is part of an individual company. Unit (Trusts) are a collection of different (and usually related) shares. For example, I am currently investing in a Singapore Equity Fund. And this is known as a Unit Trust. And within the Singapore Equity Fund, my investment is made up of different company shares, e.g. the local bank shares, telecommunication company and some other companies. And these Unit Trusts are usually managed by a Fund Manager who belong to a Fund Management Company (or known as Fund House). And there are many different Fund Management Companies in Singapore with their own expertise and knowledge. Source: here
