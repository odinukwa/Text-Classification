I think you are missing the credit risk attached to any loan. You, as an individual borrower, are far more likely not to reimburse your loan than a bank. Thus the loan is far less risky. Central bank money could only be qualified as "better" (even that does not mean much) because it is issued by the Central bank, deposits are issued by commercial bank, so you bear the risk that your bank fail, but it happens that in most country individual deposits are insured by some state agency. So I cannot really see why central bank money would be better than deposits. Nowadays, the amount of reserves that a bank must hold does not actually play a big role in the economy (as opposed to what most of economic textbooks and economic professors are teaching in undergrad schools). The most important part is the interest rate that is paid on those reserve, which is fixed by the central bank and which act as an opportunity cost for the bank when it decides to lend to an individual rather than holding reserves. However I see your point, but the fact is that this way of thinking is misleading. Banks create (in theory) as many loans as they want, because there are no physical constraints, if you want, that prevent them to do so. The only constraint is a regulatory constraint that states that in order to remain solvent (in order to be able to repay the depositors) banks should invest x% of the assets in reserves. Those reserves would be held on a central bank account in central bank money, and the return on those reserves will be the fed fund rate decided by the central bank (the same way a commercial bank decide how much interest it will pay on your savings account). So it is true that one more unit of reserves gives the right to issue more than one unit of loans but this does not mean that one money is better or worse than another. It's is just a matter of regulation. It may be hard to get, but the point is really that central bank money is safer so cheaper than deposits, no matter what regulatory constraints apply to banks. You may want to read this paper which may be a bit complicated but you should get the intuition. This two docs may be simpler (with nice pictures) : doc 1, doc 2. 

First of all, fed funds rate is the rate banks borrow reserves' from each other. Interest rate on loans is the rate the bank charges to public for its loan. From one line of logic, we think of the rate bank charges to public should clearly be greater than the interest rate itself bear to borrow since banks are making a margin. And empirical data clearly support it. However, another line of logic does not quite support it. We know the banks borrow reserve money in fed funds market, which is clearly better than the money it lends to the public in the following sense: one unit of fed funds can support 10 units of additional deposit if the reserve-deposit ratio is 10%. So the banks with this addtional 1 unit of reserve, can theoretically make 10 more units of loans and therefore creating 10 more units of deposit. So reserve is better money. Hence, theoreticaly, the fed funds rate should at leastbe higher than the rate banks make loans to the public, if not 10 folds. My question being whether there is a logical fallacy in my understanding and if not, what kind of reality deviated it from theory. 

Do all financial institutions except bank keeps an account with a bank? As far as I understood, banks will settle their payments using their reserves at the Fed. And since other financial institutions do not have an account with Fed, how do they settle their payment? Do they all have accounts with the banks? 

Okay, sorry that my previous answer might involve too much extraneous materials. Anyway, one perspective you might want in thinking about the classical model is think of it as real things get produced rather than in monetary terms. In a closed economy in the long run, we assumed real output is fixed. Think of it as actual goods piling up. Now, consumption is how much people consume out of this pile, goods and services included. Government purchases is the amount of goods get and use from the pile. Now we are left with investment. Investment is simply the amount of the goods left in the pile. And since we have subtracted all the consummable goods from the pile, what must left must be investment such as machines, warehouses. Now, consider saving. One way to avoid your confusion is think of saving not in monetary terms (I understand saying saving makes you think of the money not spent, but please reframe from doing so.) Because people's totoal real income equal total actual goods and products produced that year, since people and the government only consume the Consumption and Government Purchases, the rest, the investment, is therefore defined as saving. I hope this can help a bit. 

Let $p \in \mathbb{R}_+^L$ be price vector and let $w \in \mathbb{R}_+$ be wealth of the consumer. Define the Budget correspondence $B(p,w) =\{x \in \mathbb{R}_+^L : p\cdot x\le w \}$ . How to prove that this budget correspondence is upper hemi-continuous? A correspondence $Γ:R_+^{L+1}+→R^L_+$ is upper hemi-continuous if, $(p_n,w_n)→(p,w) $ and $x_n \to x$ where for each $n$ it's true $x_n \in \Gamma(p_n,w_n)$, will ensure $x \in \Gamma(p,w)$. I've seen a possible solution using Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem by Mark Dean at the following link $URL$ But I failed to understand the last step in his approach where he claims that if every sequence $x_m \in B(p^m, w_m)$ has convergent sub-sequence converging to a point in set $B(p^*, w^*)$, then we have hemi-continuity for budget set, aren't we supposed to show that $x_m$ converge to $B(p,w)$? Am I missing any theorem? 

I have a background in Finance and have become pretty interested in Macroeconomics as a graduate student. However the time is limited and I want to focus on econometrics part of Macroeconomics. In that case, could someone please give me tell me what are the main econometrics methods I should learn in Macroeconomics？In Finance we focus on models like ARMA and GARCH, how about Macroeconomics? I've learned VAR before. I also heard about the simultaneous equations, are those for Macro? What are methods that econometricians came up to handle Lucas's Critique? What might be a good book to learn Macro econometrics? Thanks in advance! 

I'm a first year PhD student with mathematical finance background, and am not quite familiar with all the assumptions/setup for macroeconomics. During study I found the math relatively easy but I'm having hard time to grasp the often critical relation between variables. For example capital market clearing implies that the total capital that firms have equal to the total assets that households have. First of all, I didn't even know there's a market clearing until I ask my TA, secondly, there are too many such assumptions I don't know. My professor would probably think it's too dumb to tell students about these because most of my classmates have an Econ background, but I don't and it's really killing me. Is there any good reference I can read, open courses I can watch that could help me with this? Given limited amount of time, I hope it won't take as much time as a full course. Thanks in advance.
