The two statement say two completely different things. So, no, there is no contradiction. The second welfare theorem essentially says that a system of transfers that results in an efficient allocation can be supported by a competitive outcome. The statement about replacing income taxes with a consumption tax will increase peoples' incentives to save. These are two completely different statements. Your mistake is that you suppose that the second welfare theorem prescribes a system of taxation to achieve the hypothetical transfers. It doesn't. The second welfare theorem just supposes that these transfers can be made---nothing more. Importantly, the alleged social planner who makes the transfers has complete information about the agents in the model. When information about the agents is hidden from the social planner (information such as the skills and true abilities of each individual), such transfers become difficult and costly. That is, they create distortions. This was a point that was famously made by James Mirrlees in his seminal paper "An Exploration in the Theory of Optimum Income Taxation" (1971). The point of this paper is that there is a trade-off between equity and efficiency. Once we consider the fact that transfers are costly and create distortions, the question is, how do we create a tax system that minimizes the amount of distortions and still is able to make desired transfers of wealth. This serves as a motivation for why people might study the incentives created by an income tax or consumption tax, for example. 

Dynamic Asset Pricing Theory, by Darrell Duffie. This book seems to be referred to a lot. It's very thorough. In my experience, it might be a little to difficult for a introduction to the topic. However, it is a good reference. 

Once you have solved the equation $\rho V(k) = \max_c g(c) + V'(k)(z - c)$ to find the function $V(k)$ you should be able to solve for what is called the policy function. The function $V(k)$ is the value function. Knowing $V(k)$ should then give you the information that you need to solve for the policy, say $c(k,t)$. This will then tell you how $k$ will evolve over time. 

What happens when I deposit money into a bank? Now, let's first consider what happens when someone deposits money into this bank. For example, suppose someone deposits \$10. The new money goes to the vault which may then be deposited in the bank's account at the Federal Reserve (the central bank). This is a new asset. At the same time, the new deposit is a new liability. All together, this will increase the reserves of the bank by \$10 and the deposits by \$10. Both the assets and liabilities of the bank increased by \$10. What happens when a bank makes a loan? Now, what happens when a bank makes a loan? Suppose a bank makes a loan to someone for \$10. In the picture, it's clear that this will increase the amount of loans from \$500 to \$510. Now, remember that loans are considered assets. That is, the borrower has an obligation to pay the bank back. But, where will the money come from? A few things can happen. One example of what could happen is the following. The bank could use its reserves. In this case, reserves would drop from \$200 to \$190. However, in a fractional reserve system, banks have reserve requirements. The ratio of reserves to deposits must stay above a certain percentage. More realistically, loans might go up by \$11 (because of interest), reserves down by \$10, and owner's equity up by \$1. (However, I believe that often times, a bank might issue the loan but immediately sell the new asset to another party, while taking only a small cut.) The benefits of fractional reserve banking Economists typically agree that the fractional reserve system adds some instability to the economy. However, it also adds many great benefits as well. There is a big literature about the trade-offs here and the many functions of (fractional reserve) banking, in general. (One of the most important economic functions is that it allows us to better smooth out liquidity shocks. See an important paper by Diamond and Dybvig). There is simply too much to get into here. You might consider opening a new question that specifically asks for a list of the summarized benefits. Also, check out Mishkin's Money and Banking book (undergraduate level) or Microeconomics of Banking by Freixas and Rochet (graduate level, but still very accessible). 

I just want to build on @Alecos's nice answer. I'll restate some of what he said and add a few other details. tl;dr 

Note: I'm adding this simply to supplement the other answers. Also, I'm going to assume that you're talking about the $R^2$ of the time series regression of security $i$ on the market portfolio $M$ $$ R_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_i R_{Mt} + \epsilon_{it}. $$ As @london described in his answer, the $\beta_i$ is simply the sensitivity of security $i$ to the market. In the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM, as well as in other variations, systematic risk is then defined as $\beta^2 \cdot \sigma^2_{R_M}$ and idiosyncratic risk is $\sigma^2_{\epsilon_i}$. Thus, the $R^2$ (r-squared) of this regression should not be interpreted so much as "goodness of fit." Rather, it is simply a measure of the ratio of ratio of systematic risk to total risk (systematic plus idiosyncratic risk). As @london described, total risk includes all the other things that drive security $i$'s returns. To see this, note that the definition of $R^2$ in the population sense is $$ R^2 = \frac{\beta_i^2 \sigma^2_{M}}{\beta_i^2 \sigma^2_M + \sigma_\epsilon^2}. $$ 

In short, for the purposes of forecasting, it is often convenient and even beneficial to ignore economic theory. The restrictions implied by economic theory is necessary for inference when the question of interest is causal in nature (e.g., when you want to understand the underlying causal relationships). However, if the forecast you're interested is more of the variety of a sophisticated extrapolation, then something simple like ARIMA may be more helpful and more accurate. I think the following are helpful references. Why would I not be interested in the underlying causal relationship? Consider the following example from "Introduction to Econometrics" (3rd Edition), by Stock and Watson (p. 517). 

The key point is to remember that prices are determined by the equilibrium condition that quantity supplied must equal the quantity demanded. This is a fundamental proposition of price theory. The result that you speak of is a logical consequence of that condition given the standard framework. In the presence of taxes, the effective price that a buyer or seller changes. So, prices must adjust so that equilibrium is again reached. The result is that prices adjust in the same way, regardless of who remits the tax. Just think of it that way. So, given the idea that prices adjust so that an equilibrium reaches, I think the best intuition beyond what has been given is to think of a tax as a wedge between the price buyers and sellers face. It doesn't matter whether you obtain that wedge by increasing buyers effective price or by lowering sellers' effecting price. Because prices will adjust to equilibrium, the only thing that matters in the end is the size (think width) of that wedge. 

Let the $n$ states of the finite-state markov chain be denoted by $\{x_1,...,x_n\}$ and let $\vec e = [e(x_1), ..., e(x_n)]'$. Now, first note that because $X_{t+1} \mid X_t$ is independent of $W_{t+1}$, we can write \begin{align*} \exp(\eta) e(x) &= E[\exp(D'x + x' F W_{t+1})] E[ e(X_{t+1}) \mid X_t = x] \\ &= \exp(D'x + x' F F' x)\, E[ e(X_{t+1}) \mid X_t = x] . \end{align*} Then, because this must hold for all values $x= x_1, ..., x_n$, we can assemble the following vector equation, \begin{align*} \vec e \, \exp(\eta) &= \begin{bmatrix} \exp(D'x_1 + x_1' F F' x_1)\, E[ e(X_{t+1}) \mid X_t = x_1] \\ ... \\ \exp(D'x_n + x_n' F F' x_n)\, E[ e(X_{t+1}) \mid X_t = x_n] \\ \end{bmatrix}\\ &= \text{diag} \begin{bmatrix} \exp(D'x_1 + x_1' F F' x_1) \\ ... \\ \exp(D'x_n + x_n' F F' x_n) \\ \end{bmatrix} \, \mathbb P \, \vec e \\ &= \text{diag}(f)\, \mathbb P \, \vec e \\ \end{align*} where $f = [ \exp(D'x_1 + x_1' F F' x_1), ..., \exp(D'x_n + x_n' F F' x_n) ]'$ and $\text{diag}$ is the operator that takes a vector and places it on the diagonal of a matrix where the off-diagonal elements are zero. So, we can express the equation as a linear operator $\mathbb M$ on $\vec e$ with \begin{align*} \text{diag}(f)\, \mathbb P \, \vec e &= \vec e \, \exp(\eta) \\ \mathbb M \vec e &= \vec e \, \exp(\eta). \end{align*} 

My question is this. What is it about economics as a discipline that has allowed the it to extend to these "seemingly non-economics aspects of life?" Also, when did economic analysis in these so-called unrelated fields become accepted as part of mainstream economics? 

This is my attempt. As I noted in the question (see the linked question as well), I have my doubts. We want to show that \begin{align} [E(n+2) - E(n+1)] - [E(n+1) - E(n)] &> 0 \tag{1}\\ E[n+2] + E[n] &> 2 E[n+1] \notag \\ \frac 1 2 E[n+2] + \frac 1 2 E[n] &> E[1/2 (n+2) + 1/2 n] = E[n+1]. \notag \end{align} Since $$ E(n) \equiv n \int_0^\infty p (1-F)^{n-1} F' \mathrm d p, $$ we see that $E$ is a function from $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb R$. However, in the context of search, we restrict its domain to positive integers. However, if we show that the unrestricted function $E[n]$ is convex in $n$, it's easy to see that equation (1) is true by Jensen's inequality. We can see that \begin{align*} \frac{\mathrm d^2}{\mathrm d n^2} E[n] &= 2 \int_0^\infty p F' (1-F)^{n-1} \ln(1-F) \mathrm d p + \int_0^\infty p F' (1-F)^{n-1} [\ln(1-F)]^2 \mathrm d p \\ &= \int_0^\infty p F' (1-F)^{n-1} \ln(1-F)(2 + n \ln(1-F)) \mathrm d p. \end{align*} Now, for sufficiently large $n$, this is positive. Therefore, $E[n]$ is convex in $n$ and we are done. 

I've heard a lot of definitions given for structural estimation. But it's never seemed entirely clear to me. Some times I've heard that what one person might call "reduced form" estimation should actually be called structural estimation. Sorry I don't have an example to illustrate, but I was wondering if somebody could clarify, hopefully with a link to a paper or some other source. What is structural estimation compared to reduced form estimation? Does the potential outcomes framework count as a structural equation? 

I have notes that say that we can make the following calculations. I'm a little confused about some of the calculations that are being made. What assumptions would I need to get the following results? Or are there errors? Specifically, I am confused by equation (1) below. In particular, this is strange to me because if I let $\rho = -1$, then equation (1) sometimes gives negative variance. (Perhaps the calculation is undefined when $\rho = -1$?) Let $r_{t,t+n} = \sum_{i=1}^n r_{t+i}$. Suppose that $r_t$ is an AR(1) process (say with errors given by a mean zero Normal distribution with variance $\sigma^2$) where $$ \text{Cov}(r_t,r_{t+j}) = \rho^j \sigma^2 $$ and thus $$ \text{Corr}(r_t, r_{t+j}) = \rho^j. $$ The notes that I have say that $\text{Var}(r_{t,t+2}) = 2(1 + \rho) \sigma^2$ and that $$ \text{Var}(r_{t,t+n}) = \left( n + 2 \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \rho^i (n-i) \right) \sigma^2. \tag{1} $$ (FWIW, this question deals with cumulative (log) returns.) 

Problem setup An agent has initial wealth $W_0 = 0$ but receives a constant stream of wages $w$. There is a riskless asset that pays the interest rate $r$ and a risky security that follows the dynamics $$ \frac{dS}{S} = \mu_S dt + \sigma_S dB_t, $$ where $B_t$ is a standard brownian motion. Now, the agent has CRRA utility. Thus, his decision is modelled by the following program: \begin{align*} \max_{\{C_t\}_{t=0}^\infty} \quad \mathbb E\left[\int_0^\infty e^{-\rho t} \left ( \frac{C_t^{1-\gamma}}{1 - \gamma} \right ) \, \mathrm d t \right ] \\ \text{ s.t. } \mathbb E \left [ \int_0^\infty \pi_t (c_t - w) dt \right ] \leq W_0, \end{align*} where $\pi_t$ is the stochastic discount factor, which can be written as $$ \frac{d \pi_t}{\pi_t} = - \mu_{\pi} dt - \sigma_{\pi} d B_t. $$ My solution attempt Proceeding with the Martingale method, the first-order condition on the appropriate Lagrangian are $$ u_c(c_t, t) = e^{-\rho t} C_t^{-\gamma} = \lambda \pi_t, $$ where $\pi = e^{-r t} \xi_t$, $\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier, and the exponential martingale is $\xi_t = \exp\left (-\eta B_t - \frac{t}{2} \eta^2 \right )$. Note that this is based on the assumption of complete markets and is equivalent to $$ \frac{d \pi_t}{\pi_t} = - r dt - \eta d B_t, $$ where $\eta = \frac{\mu_s - r}{\sigma_s}$ is the market price of risk. The first-order condition implies that $C^*_t = \left( \lambda \pi_t e^{\rho t} \right )^{-1/\gamma}$. We can then substitute this into the budget constraint and solve for $\lambda$: \begin{align*} W_0 &= \mathbb E \int_0^\infty \pi_t (C_t^* - w) \, \mathrm d t \\ 0 &= \mathbb E \int_0^\infty \pi_t^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}} \lambda ^{\frac{-1}{\gamma}} \exp(-\rho t/\gamma) - \pi_t w \, \mathrm d t. \end{align*} Now, in order to proceed, let us make the following intermediate calculations: \begin{align*} \mathbb E_0[\pi_t] &= \exp\{-r t\} \\ &\text{and} \\ \mathbb E_0 \left [\pi_t^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}} \right ] &= \mathbb E_0 \exp \left \{ - \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} \left (r + \frac 12 \eta^2 \right ) t - \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} \eta B(t) \right \} \\ &= \exp \left \{ - \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} (r + \frac 12 \eta^2 ) t + \frac 12 \frac{(\gamma - 1)^2}{\gamma^2} \eta^2 t \right \} \\ &= \exp \left \{ -t \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} \left[ r + \frac 12 \eta^2 \frac{1}{\gamma} \right] \right \}. \end{align*} Because of the appropriate regularity conditions, we can exchange the order of integration to make the following calculations: \begin{align*} \mathbb E \int_0^\infty \pi_t w \, \mathrm d t &= w \int_0^\infty \mathbb E[\pi_t] \, \mathrm d t = w \int_0^\infty \exp(-r t) = \frac{w}{r} \\ \text{and} \\ \mathbb E \int_0^\infty \pi_t^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}} \exp \left (\frac{-\rho t}{\gamma} \right ) \, \mathrm d t &= \int_0^\infty \exp(-a t) dt = a^{-1}, \end{align*} where $a = \frac{\rho}{\gamma} +\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} \left[r + \frac 12 \eta^2 \frac{1}{\gamma} \right ] $. Then, continuing with the budget constraint, we can solve for $\lambda^{-1/\gamma}$, $$ \lambda^{-1/\gamma} = \frac{w a}{r}. $$ We can then substitute this back into our expression for the optimal path of consumption, $$ C^*_t = \frac{w a}{r} \pi_t^{-1/\gamma} \exp \left \{ -\frac{1}{\gamma} \rho t \right \}. $$
