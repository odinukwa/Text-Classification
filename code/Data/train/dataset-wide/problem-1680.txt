If you're only interested in the positions, you'll probably be best off just using a program instead of diving into celestial mechanics. Depending on what you exactly want with "planetary position", here are three different approaches to finding a planet's position at a given time: 

Stellarium is a free program to visually solve for the position of a planet, and it gives some precise data for the positions of the planets too, but it needs to be installed and run on your computer so it won't be the quickest way to find the position. If you're looking to get a planet's coordinates on ecliptic and/or equatorial planes, you can let this web app do the calculations for you for a given time. Also, a quick Google search came up with this web app meant for working with zodiacs. 

Such objects are surrounded by an accretion disk, that is a disk of gas, the gas being accreted onto the central object. However, at this stage of its life, the accretion disk around the black hole of a binary system like GRS-1915+105 is strongly depleted. Therefore, the accretion rate is not sufficient to support a coutinuous burst. Matter fills the outer disk until a critical density is reached, that triggered an outburst. Mass from the companion star is lost by a Roche lobe overflow mechanism. References: 

What is it? An IMF, $\Phi(m)$, is defined such as $\Phi(m){\rm d}m$ gives the fractions of stars with a mass between $m - {\rm d}m/2$ and $m + {\rm d}m/2$, and with a normalized distribution $$\int_{m_{\rm min}}^{m_{\rm max}}m\Phi(m){\rm d}m = 1\ M_{\odot}.$$ Note that these boundaries ($m_{\rm min}$ and $m_{\rm max}$) are ill-defined, but typically of the order of 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ and 100 $M_{\odot}$, respectively. IMFs The various IMF used are the following, with their main characteristics: 

It does indeed seem counterintuitive that $L_4$ and $L_5$ would be at the same time both high points of potential as well as stable points in the system. In fact, a quick look at an example contour plot with all five Lagrangian points demonstrated would also suggest that $L_4$ and $L_5$ would be unstable: 

The major effect of this co-rotational system is that Earth seems to "wobble" on its orbit, as mentioned in the quote from Wikipedia above. 

In the picture you can see that $L_1 - L_3$ are placed in saddle nodes, and intuitively one concludes that the smallest perturbation would set them "falling" in either direction, i.e. they need station keeping. However, $L_4$ and $L_5$ would still seem to be unstable, so what gives? What makes $L_4$ and $L_5$ stable is that each of them is located equidistant from both of the masses. This leads to the gravitational forces from each of the bodies towards $L_4$ and $L_5$ to be in the same ratio as the two bodies' masses, hence the resultant acceleration points towards the barycentre of the system (which is also the centre of rotation for a three-body system). This resultant acceleration, and by extension force, leads to the object in either $L_4$ or $L_5$ to in fact have just the correct amount of acceleration / correct force towards the system's barycentre so that it will not fall out of orbit (it "falls" towards the barycentre as the system rotates, like Earth similarly falls towards Sun throughout its orbit), as counterintuitive as it sounds at first. (Furthermore, this effect is not only limited to bodies of negligible mass, but is independent of mass, which is why you can have more massive bodies orbiting in $L_4$ and $L_5$ like Jupiter's trojans, as well as smaller, artificial satellites.)

All of the noise frames have near-perfect gaussian distributions with pretty much constant FWHM, it's just the central value that shifts around with each frame. This leads me to a couple of conclusions: firstly, this shift truely is a shift in median value and not just a result of something like cosmic rays; secondly, the fluctuation is an additive effect and so not due to a change in gain due to a difference in voltage or something like that. I also could not find any correlation with temperature or time since last readout, both of which I suspected for a moment. Perhaps it's slight changes in readout time? I couldn't find any mention of this kind of artefact in my own course notes. It's also not mentioned anywhere online that I can find. Can any of you help me to a) identify the possible sources of such a fluctuation and/or b) provide a proven strategy for dealing with this during data reduction? 

They do, but due to the ratio of masses being vastly different, they seem like they would not to do so as moon seems to rotate just around (the centre of) Earth. The ratio of Earth and Moon's masses is $\frac{M_{Earth}}{M_{Moon}} = 81.3$ whereas for Pluto and Charon the same ratio is $\frac{M_{Pluto}}{M_{Charon}} = 8.09$. Because the ratio for Pluto and Charon is relatively small, the center of the system – barycenter, around which the two bodies orbit – is somewhere on a line drawn between the two celestial bodies's mass centers. But for Earth and Moon, because Earth is proportionally much heavier, the system's barycenter does not reach outside of Earth, but instead is about 4,500 kilometers from the center of Earth (see the photo below, too): 

It is linked to the solar dynamo and the dynamical behavior of the so-called $\alpha$-effect. One way to understand easily the solar dynamo and the the $\alpha$-effect with the hand is the following: you can generate a magnetic field by differential rotation (the $\Omega$-effect, $\Omega$ being the classical notation for the angular velocity). But this sole effect, twisting the magnetic field, would fold it so much that it will reconnect and dissipate. If you don't want to lose the magnetic field, you need a process to "regenerate" it, and a good way to do it is to create a poloidal component of the magnetic field. This poloidal component can be generated by convection in the solar interior; the magnetic field is, in the same time, twisted and pulled and that explains the solar dynamo. Now, you can show that dynamo waves will propagate from the equator to the poles, and when the poles are reached, a reversal is observed. This propagation of dynamo waves is well observed by the sunspots patterns during the solar cycle. Sources:

Well, I don't think this question is entirely answerable. The true answer, I think, is that there really are no limits, as Rob Jeffries commented. However, using Wikipedia as my only source, the crab pulsar holds the current record for most energetic gamma ray emissions at 80 TeV (wavelength of about $1.5\times10^{-11}$nm). Whereas the longest detected wavelength would surely only be limited by our detector sensitivity. Any imaginable wavelength could be lengthened further by an arbitrary factor via, for example, scattering. EDIT: Source: Gamma-ray Astronomy (Wikipedia) 

[ 106. 106. 108. 108. 110. 108. 105. 106. 107. 107.] Now, during data reduction we average combine our bias frames. We also reject outliers (either minmax or sigmaclip). But if some of our frames are "shifted" higher than others, wouldn't this skew the averaging (and especially the outlier rejection) so that we might be introducing more noise during averaging? To give you an idea of the nature of this fluctuation, I did a quick analysis: read 10 bias frames, then iterated through them, subtracting each frame from the median combination of all other frames. This gives me something like "noise frames", showing only how much each frame deviates from the median of the rest. Below is the code and the distributions of two of these noise frames. 

There is no "orbital path" detected, that's why it is a "free-floating planet". There is no radial velocity mesured, but the informations given by its kinematic location show that it belongs to the beta Pictoris group, that is a stellar group. For more dirty details, have a look at the submitted paper on PSO J318.5-22: $URL$ Comment: Apart from that (the following reflects my personal opinion) the term "free-floating planet" is ill-chosen; it is clearly a very low-mass object, but since it is not orbiting around another larger object, it seems to me that the term "planet" is not pertinent. I think that it should be consider more than a "very low-mass brown-dwarf". The problem arises from IAU definition of a brown-dwarf and a exoplanet, that is probably not well-fitted for this kind of objects (and that is not really physical). You will notice, by the way, that this object is moving in a stellar group, which kind of reinforce my point. 

The camera used was the SBIG STL-6303 according to the FIT headers, which uses a Kodak KAF-6303E CCD according to the online data sheet. The CCD dimensions, these cell dimensions, and all the binning options are all perfectly divisible, so I'm assuming this artifact is due to the structure of the CCD. I plotted the mean pixel value of each row to make sure this wasn't an artifact from the image viewing software. The plot clearly shows a drop every 36 pixels. So, I'm hoping for some confirmation: is this decreased sensitivity due to the structure of the CCD? If so, what about the CCD structure actually causes this? 

The median values of the bias frames coming from our teaching telescope shift up or down with each capture. For example: 

What you could think at first, regarding the orientation of any planetary system, is that it should be roughly in the plane of the galaxy, simply by angular momentum conservation. But, when you take a look at observations, you see that protoplanetary disks orientation is not what you would expect, with no preferential orientation (protoplanetary disks are embryo of planetary systems, that makes them interesting). In the following figure, the orientation corresponds to the inclination between the line of sight and the rotation axis of the disk. 

Dark matter and dark energy are two different things, accounting for different observations. Dark matter: Dark matter is needed to explain, among other things, the rotation curve of galaxies. One could expect these rotation curves to decrease at large radii (because one should expect keplerian rotation for galaxies), and it is not the case, the rotation curves are flat, that accounts for a "hidden mass" in galaxies to sustain such a rotation pattern, that is the dark matter. Dark matter also accounts for some galaxy clusters properties, and CMB fluctuations. Dark energy: Dark energy is needed to explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe. This expansion was mostly measured using Type Ia supernovæ (thermonuclear supernovæ, that are the results of a white dwarf accreting matter and reaching Chandrasekhar mass) that are "standard candles". The absolute magnitude of these objects are thought to be well-known, so if you observe them in the Universe, you can easily deduce their distance from their redshift. These observations show an accelerated expansion of the Universe (by expansion, we mean that the relative distance between two distant galaxies is increasing, distance in the local Universe are not affected). To account for this acceleration, one needs some energy uniformly distributed in the Universe, that is the dark energy. Don't be confused: Dark energy and dark matter cannot be mistaken one for the other, because dark energy is uniformly distributed in the Universe, whereas dark matter follows some distribution (it is generally more or less distributed with the matter). Final words: Finally, "dark matter" and "dark energy" are mostly words to characterize our ignorance on these observations that cannot be explained by standard laws of physics. That is why there is such intense work on these subjects, to try to characterize these dark things better and to understand what they could be.
