I suggest you look at Mather's "Hurewicz Theorems for Pairs and Squares" in which Blakers-Massey is derived from his Cube Theorems. It works for all spaces, but the maps involved have to be $m$- and $n$-connected with $m,n \geq 2$. The basic inputs to the cube theorems are: (1) Hurewicz/Dold local-to-global criteria for fibrations (or weak fibrations) and (2) the pullback of a cofibration by a fibration is a cofibration. (Actually, (2) is not used in this proof.) ADDING ON: The proof is extremely cute and easy. Given a homotopy pushout square (spaces $A,B,C$ and $D$) pull back from the path fibration $\mathcal{P}(D) \to D$ to get another square. The Second Cube Theorem tells you it is a homotopy pushout, and comparing connectivities of maps shows that it suffices to prove the B-M theorem for the new square. But the new square is a square of simply-connected spaces (since the spaces involved are fibers of the maps involved), and the homotopy pushout is contractible. Now the comparison map to the homotopy pullback may be identified (after suspension) with the inclusion of the wedge into the product, and that connectivity is easy to determine. 

YCor points out in comments that, if we want $i-j \bmod n$ to determine $d(A_i, A_j)$, then this is the only solution. If we only want $i-j$ to determine $d(A_i, A_j)$, then I don't know if there are more solutions, but I would expect so. (To see the difference: When $n=4$, I know we are requiring $d(A_1, A_2) = d(A_2, A_3) = d(A_3, A_4)$, but I don't know whether the OP intended to impose this distance to be the same as $d(A_4, A_1)$.) The point of this comment is to spell out YCor's observation. Let the cyclic group $C_n$ of order $n$ act on the $A_i$ by shifting the indices. An isometry of a finite subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ always extends to an isometry of $\mathbb{R}^3$, and uniquely so if that set is not coplanar. So we have a $C_n$ action on $\mathbb{R}^3$ by isometries. This action must preserve the center of gravity of the $\mathbb{R}^3$, and we may translate that center to the origin, so that $C_n$ acts by orthogonal matrices. The irreducible representations of $C_n$ over $\mathbb{R}$ are all $1$ or $2$ dimensional, so either $\mathbb{R}^3$ is the sum of three one dimensional irreps, or a two dimensional irrep and a one dimensional irrep, and $\{ A_i \}$ is an orbit in the action. It is easy to check that, if $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a sum of one dimensional reps, then there aren't any $n$-point orbits (for $n>2$). If $\mathbb{R}^3 \cong W \oplus 1$ where $W$ is a two dimensional rotation representation and $1$ is the trivial representation, then every orbit lies in a plane and we lose again. The only possibility is that $n$ is even and $\mathbb{R}^3 \cong W \oplus \epsilon$ where $W$ is a rotation representation and $\epsilon$ is the representation $k \mapsto (-1)^k$. The orbits in this case give the solution above. 

If you accept the Whitehead theorem, then simple obstruction theory (without cohomology) determines the homotopy type of spaces with homotopy groups in only one dimension. That is, you can easily show that if the only nonzero homotopy group of the CW complex $Y$ is in dimension $n$, then for any $(n-1)$-connected CW complex $$ [X, Y] \cong \mathrm{Hom}( \pi_n(X), \pi_n(Y) ) . $$ Then if the homotopy groups of $X$ are also concentrated in dimension $n$, an isomorphism $\pi_n(X) \xrightarrow{\cong} \pi_n(Y)$ gives rise to a homotopy equivalence $X\xrightarrow{\simeq} Y$. But what if we don't want to use Whitehead? I think you are stuck, because basic (model category theoretic) arguments can be used to prove Whitehead (at least for CW complexes with finitely many finitely generated homotopy groups?) from the uniqueness of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. (Prove it by induction for CW complexes with at most $n$ nonzero homotopy groups; this requires us to convert maps to fibrations, and we don't want to end up with non-CW complexes, which is why I said we might need finitely generated homotopy groups.) CLARIFICATION: When I said "model-theoretic" I meant the basic facts about cofibrations, fibrations, induced maps, etc. The finite generation comes in when we convert a map to a fibration: this is done with a path space and a pullback, and these things can easily take us away from CW complexes, but my plan was to impose conditions that would guarantee we can apply Milnor's theorem (on loops of CW complexes and so on) to the CW complexes in question. 

In your question, the exponent of $x_2$ is $a_2+k$. I am assuming that is a typo, and you intended $c_a(k)$ to be the coefficient of $$x_1^{a_1+k} x_2^{a_2} x_3^{a_3} \cdots x_{n-2}^{a_{n-2}} x_{n-1}^{a_{n-1}} x_n^{a_n-k}.$$ If so, I can answer all of your questions. It will be convenient to switch the sign in your Vandermonde determinant, so I'll set $\Delta = \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} (x_j-x_i)$. Let $\rho$ be the vector $(0,1,2,\ldots, n-1)$. So $$\Delta = x^{\rho} \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} ( 1- x_i/x_j)$$ and $$\Delta^{-1} = x^{-\rho} \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} \frac{1}{1-x_i/x_j} =x^{-\rho} \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} \sum_{c_{ij}=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{x_i}{x_j} \right)^{c_{ij}}.$$ So the coefficient of $x^a$ in $\Delta^{-1}$ is the number of ways to write $a+\rho$ in the form $\sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} c_{ij} (e_i-e_j)$, where $e_k$ is the $k$-th basis vector and the $c_{ij}$ are nonnegative integers. This is called the Kostant partition function of $a+\rho$; I'll denote it by $K(a+\rho)$. If you do the same argument for $\Delta^{-d}$, you are counting the number of ways to write $$a+\rho = \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} \sum_{1 \leq k \leq d} c_{ij}^k (e_i-e_j)$$ where $c_{ij}^{k}$ are nonnegative integers. Let's call this $K^d(a+\rho)$. As I will explain below, the values of $K^d(\beta)$ are piecewise polynomial, with domains of polynomiality being convex polyhedral cones. The line $a+\rho + k (e_1-e_n)$ will, for $k$ sufficiently large, eventually lie in just one cone, so it will be polynomial for $k$ sufficiently large. I'll discuss the switch between "eventually polynomial" and "polynomial" below. The piecewise polynomiality of $K^d(\beta)$ is a special case of the following theorem of Blakley; I like the presentation of it in this paper of Sturmfels Let $v_1$, $v_2$, ..., $v_N$ be a finite list of vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^M$, all lying in an open half space. Let $\Lambda$ be the lattice generated by the $v_i$. For $\lambda \in \Lambda$, let $c(\lambda)$ be the number of ways to write $\lambda$ as $\sum c_r \lambda_r$, with $c_r \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. Then can partition $\mathbb{R} \Lambda$ into finitely many convex polyhedral cones $K_j$, so that $c$ is a quasi-polynomial on $\Lambda \cap K_j$. Here a function $\phi$ is called quasi-polynomial means that we can find a finite index sublattice $M$ of $\Lambda$ so that $\phi$ is polynomial on cosets of $\Lambda/M$. However, you don't have to worry about the word "quasi" because of a refinement of this result, also stated in Sturmfels' paper: Suppose that, whenever $v_{i_1}$, $v_{i_2}$, ..., $v_{i_D}$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-basis for $\mathbb{Q} \Lambda$, then $v_{i_1}$, $v_{i_2}$, ..., $v_{i_D}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-basis for $\Lambda$. Then we get honest polynomials instead of quasi-polynomials. In this case, we say that the $v$'s are unimodular. The $v$'s in our setting are unimodular, so we get honest polynomials. See the top of page 305 in Sturmfels' paper for more on this. For discussion of practical computation of these polynomials for the Kostant partition function, see de Loera and Sturmfels and de Loera's website. 

If $\mathcal{C}$ is a category, then surely the category of simplicial objects $s\mathcal{C}$ is not automatically a model category. What conditions must $\mathcal{C}$ satisfy in order for $s\mathcal{C}$ to have a reasonable model structure? 

Borrowing from simplicial sets/complexes, $d_i: \mathbf{n-1} \to \mathbf{n}$ is the map that skips $i$, so your sequences would be $x\circ d_i$. 

The Blakers-Massey excision theorem in algebraic topology. In its classical formulation it says that a certain map of pairs induces an isomorphism in relative homotopy groups in a certain range of dimensions. But it underlies a great many of the most important results in the subject, because it allows you to apply target-type techniques to domains and vice versa. 

Let $f:S^n\to C$ and let $K$ be its image. If $n>1$ then the Theorem implies $f\simeq *$. EDIT: Clearly this is over-simple and wrong, as Omar Antol√≠n-Camarena has pointed out. In fact, it looks like $C^N(T)$ would be a compact CW complex, and so there will be surjective continuous functions $S^n \to C^N(T)$ for any $n\geq 1$; then $K = C^N(T)$. 

I have an answer. Look at $f$-localization functors $L_f$. The restriction of $L_f$ to simply-connected spaces is rationalization if and only if the following three conditions hold: 

This is a special case of finding the longest path in a directed acyclic graph. Namely, the vertices of our graph are $1$, $2$, ..., $n$, there is an edge $i \to j$ for each $i<j$ and the length of that edge is $\log \tfrac{p_i + p_j}{2 \sqrt{p_i p_j}}$. We want the longest path from $1$ to $n$. There are a number of standard efficient algorithms for this; see for example Section 4.7 in Dasgupta, Papadimitriou and Vazirani's Algorithms. An observation: If we chose to include $z_i$, then we must have $$\frac{p_{z_{i-1}} + p_{z_i}}{2 \sqrt{p_{z_{i-1}} p_{z_i}}}\ \frac{p_{z_{i}} + p_{z_{i+1}}}{2 \sqrt{p_{z_{i}} p_{z_{i+1}}}} \geq \frac{p_{z_{i-1}} + p_{z_{i+1}}}{2 \sqrt{p_{z_{i-1}} p_{z_{i+1}}}}$$ and multiplying this out and rearranging gives $$\left( \frac{p_{z_{i+1}}}{p_{z_i}} - \frac{p_{z_{i}}}{p_{z_{i+1}}}\right) \left( \frac{p_{z_{i}}}{p_{z_{i-1}}} - \frac{p_{z_{i-1}}}{p_{z_{i}}}\right) < 0$$ so either $p_{z_{i-1}} < p_{z_i} > p_{z_{i+1}}$ or $p_{z_{i-1}} > p_{z_i} < p_{z_{i+1}}$. In other words, the sequence $p_{z_1}$, $p_{z_2}$, ..., $p_{z_k}$ is alternating. Finding the longest alternating subsequence of a sequence is a well studied problem, and good algorithms for that might be good heurisitics for this. Another thought (and I'm going to drop out of this conversation soon): Running times for longest path algorithms depends on the number of edges in the graph. If the optimal solution uses the edge $j \to \ell$, then we must have $p_k$ between $p_j$ and $p_{\ell}$ for all $j < k < \ell$. (Otherwise, inserting $p_k$ would be an improvement.) Let's call $(j, \ell)$ a good pair if this condition holds. Let's insert a preprocessing step which finds all good pairs $(j, \ell)$ and restrict the graph algorithm to them. Here is how that preprocessing step works. For each $j$, do the following. Suppose $p_{j+1} > p_j$ (if $p_{j+1} < p_j$, reverse all inequalities that follow.) Let $k_j$ be the smallest index $k_j>j$ for which $p_{k_j}<p_j$. If the $p_i$ are independently identically distributed, then $k_j-j=r$ with probability $1/2^{r-1}$ for $r \geq 2$. The good pairs are $(j,\ell)$ with $j < \ell < k_j$ where $p_{\ell}$ is the maximum of $(p_{j+1}, p_{j+2}, \dots, p_{\ell})$. So the expected search time to find $k_j$ is $\sum_{r \geq 2} r/2^{r-1} =3$ and the expected number of such $\ell$ is $\sum_{r \geq 2} 2^{-(r-1)} (1+1/2+\cdots+1/(r-1)) = 2 \log 2 \approx 1.39$. Thus, if your $p_i$ are independently identically distributed, then in $O(n)$ time you can find the good pairs, and there are only about $1.39 n$ of them. Djisktra's algorithm on a graph with $O(n)$ edges, implemented with a binary heap, runs in time $O(n \log n)$. 

Not quite an answer, but relevant: Eilenberg and Niven proved that every "polynomial" in the quaternions has a root (provided it has only one term of highest degree). The trick is familiar: they show that such a polynomial is homotopic to $q\mapsto q^n$, which induces a map of degree $n$ on the one-point compactification of $\mathbb{H}$, namely $S^4$. 

The immediate predecessor should be the largest predecessor. If I write $i-1$ for the unique immediate predecessor of $i$, then $i-1 \leq x \leq i$ forces either $x = i-1$ or $x = i$. I should have said -- and now do say -- that each element has at most one immediate predecessor. 

Paul Goerss' review of the book "Differential algebras in topology" by David Anick contains the following remark: "...the spaces $D_k$ are constructed and analyzed inductively, with surely the largest inductive hypothesis that I have ever seen." 

I think this doesn't quite work: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the category whose objects are the point of $X$, and define $$ \mathrm{mor}_\mathcal{C}(x,y) = \{ \mbox{closed sets containing both $x$ and $y$} \}. $$ Composition is union. Now (for example) a sequence $\{ x_n\}$ in $X$ defines a functor $F: \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{C}$ and a cone from $F$ to $y$ is essentially a single closed set containing the entire sequence and $y$. Since this set must contain the topological limit $x$ of the sequence, this means that the cone factors through the same closed set viewed as a morphism $x\to y$, so $x$ is the categorical colimit of $F$. And since the morphism sets are symmetrical, the sequence $\{ x_n\}$ can be viewed as a contravariant functor $G: \mathbb{N}\to \mathcal{C}$, and the topological limit $x$ is the categorical limit of $G$. PROBLEM: the factorization is not unique! 

This problem is, indeed, about searching for units. I started to write out a full answer, but it got very long, so I'll cut it short. Here are the main points: (1) There are very good tools to answer this question (2) Giving a fully correct statement would be much easier if I knew you were comfortable with using the language of algebraic number theory over function fields. (3) You are incorrect when you say that there are always finitely many solutions. (4) In almost every case where there are finitely many solutions, there is only one. To address point (3) directly, let $a=t$ and let $b=1$. So $(x,y)=(0,1)$ is a solution to this equation. Now, let $S$ be the ring $K[t][\zeta]/(\zeta^2+t \zeta+1)$. Then $N: x + y \zeta \mapsto x^2 + txy + y^2$ is a multiplicative map from $S$ to $R$, and $N(\zeta^n)=1$ for every $n$. The first few powers of $\zeta$ are $1+t \zeta$, $t+(t^2+1) \zeta$, $(t^2+1) + t^3 \zeta$, $t^3 + (t^4+t^2+1) \zeta$ ... A simple induction argument shows that the $n$th term has $\deg x_n=n-2$ and $\deg y_n=n-1$, so there is no repetition. You can have fun verifying that $(t^3, t^4+t^2+1)$ obeys $x^2+txy+y^2=1$, and computing the next few examples, if you like. 

You can think of a simplex as a finite ordered list (i.e., the vertices). The simplices of its barycentric subdivision are the lists of subsets of the first list, ordered by inclusion. 

I can imagine a map $f: X\to Y$ which is a homotopy equivalence of unpointed spaces, but which is not a homotopy equivalence of pointed spaces, no matter what basepoint is chosen. That being the case, I don't see why $f$ would have to be a weak homotopy equivalence. More detail: by choosing $x\in X$, and its image $y\in Y$ as basepoints, we get a pointed map and an induced map on homotopy groups. To be a weak homotopy equivalence, this needs to be an isomorphism (and one point is as good as any point if $X$ is path connected). But this (hypothetical) pointed map is not invertible in the homotopy category of pointed spaces, so why should it induce an isomorphism? 

$L_f(S^2)$ is nontrivial and simply-connected $L_f$ commutes with cofiber sequences of simply-connected finite complexes if $X$ is a simply-connected finite complex, then for large enough $k$, $\Sigma^k L_f(X)$ splits as a wedge of copies of $L_f(S^n)$ for various values of $n$. 

The components of the normalization $X$ are all $\mathbb{P}^1_k$'s. The nodes of $X$ are all $k$ points. Any node locally looks like $k[x,y]/(xy)$. For example, working over $\mathbb{R}$, a node of the form $\mathbb{R}[x,y]/(x^2+y^2)$ is forbidden. 

Precisely as you say, the intersection is almost always not transverse. For example, think about $G(2,4)$. It is the quadric $p_{12} p_{34} - p_{13} p_{24} + p_{14} p_{23} =0$ in $\mathbb{P}^{\binom{4}{2}-1}$. There are two codimension $2$ Schubert cells: One of them is given by $p_{12}=p_{13} = p_{23}=0$ and the other is given by $p_{12}=p_{13}=p_{14}=0$. In each case, we are using $3$ linear equations to cut out something which is codimension $2$. If we just interesect $G(2,4)$ transversely with a codimension $2$-plane, we get something whose cohomology class is the sum of these two classes; if we intersect $G(2,4)$ with $p_{12}=p_{13}=0$ then we literally get the union of these two cycles. 

I thought it might be nice to couple Terry Tao's great general answer by showing we can write down an explicit limit to the classical case for the simple harmonic oscillator. These solutions are an example of "coherent states". I learned this from an old blog post by John Baez which I can't find right now; Wikipedia has a less helpful exposition. We work with an oscillator of frequency $\omega$, so the potential energy is $(1/2) m \omega^2 x^2$ and Shrodinger's equation is $$i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2}{(\partial x)^2} \psi + \frac{m \omega^2}{2} x^2 \psi.$$ As usual, it is convenient to define $$a = \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar}}\left(x+\frac{\hbar}{m \omega} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) \quad \mbox{annihilation}$$ $$a^{\dagger} = \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar}}\left(x-\frac{\hbar}{m \omega} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) \quad \mbox{creation}.$$ The lowest energy state is the kernel of $a$, namely $\psi_0 := \exp(-m \omega x^2/(2 \hbar))$; it gives rise to the solution $e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0$. Then $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}} (a^{\dagger})^n \psi_0$ is the $n$-th energy state, so $e^{i (n+1/2) \omega t} (a^{\dagger})^n \psi_0$ is the $n$-th solution to the time dependent equation (up to normalization). I prefer to rewrite this as $(e^{i \omega t} a^{\dagger})^n (e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0)$. If $F(z)=\sum f_n z^n$ is any power series then, at least formally, $F(e^{i \omega t} a^{\dagger})(e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0)$ is a solution of Schroedinger's equation, since it is a linear combination of the pure energy states above. In particular, take $F(z) = \exp(C z)$ for some scalar $C$. So $$\exp\left( C e^{i \omega t} \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar}}\left(x-\frac{\hbar}{m \omega} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) \right) (e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0)$$ solve Schrodinger's equation. We reduce clutter by setting $C\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega}}=R$; the constant $R$ has units of distance. So our solution is $$\exp\left( e^{i \omega t} \left(\frac{R m \omega}{\hbar} x-R \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) \right) (e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0)$$ Now, the commutator of $\tfrac{R m \omega}{\hbar} x$ and $R \tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}$ is $\tfrac{m R^2 \omega}{\hbar}$, which commutes with both $x$ and $\partial/\partial x$. So, by Baker-Cambell-Hausdorff (and discarding some global constants) we can rewrite $(\ast)$ as $$\exp(e^{2 i\omega t} \tfrac{m R^2 \omega}{\hbar}) \exp(e^{i \omega t}\tfrac{R m \omega}{\hbar} x ) \exp\left( -e^{i \omega t} R \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) (e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0).$$ The exponential of differentiation is translation, so this is $$\exp(e^{2 i\omega t} \tfrac{m R^2 \omega}{\hbar}) \exp(e^{i \omega t}\tfrac{R m \omega}{\hbar} x ) (e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0(x-R e^{i \omega t})).$$ One can then do a bunch of work translating each formula into its real and complex part, which I omit. At the end of the day, one get's a solution to Schrodinger's equation which roughly looks like $$e^{i A(t)} \exp\left(\tfrac{m \omega}{\hbar} \left[-(x-R \cos(\omega t))^2/2 - i R \sin(\omega t) x \right] \right).$$ Here $A$ is a big messy function I am unwilling to work out. This is the sort of gaussian beam solution Terry was talking about -- it is localized both in position and in Fourier space. In position space, it is a Gaussian centered at $x=R \cos (\omega t)$. As $\hbar \to 0$ (with $R$ fixed), the Gaussian becomes tighter and tighter until, in the limit, it is a delta function at $R \cos (\omega t)$ -- the classical solution to the problem. Meanwhile, the momentum is a Gaussian centered at $-m R \omega \sin(\omega t)$. Again, as $\hbar \to 0$, the Gaussian becomes a delta function at $-m R \omega \sin(\omega t)$ -- the classical solution. (Of course, you could ignore all the discussion about $a$ and $a^{\dagger}$ and just directly check that this solves Schrodinger's equation. If you do, please let me know what constants I left out!) If one tries to take the $\hbar \to 0$ limit of some simpler solutions like the pure energy states, they bunch up at the origin while spreading out over all of momentum space. You need a moderately complicated solution like this to get both limits to make sense. I will close by noting a heuristic way to think about $\exp(C a^{\dagger})$. The coefficient of the $n$-th energy state is $C^n/\sqrt{n!}$ (putting in the correct normalization constant.) So, if we observe the energy of this particle, we have probability proportional to $C^{2n}/n!$ of getting the answer $(n+1/2) \hbar \omega$. In other words, the energy of this particle is a Poisson random variable with expected value $C^2 \hbar \omega+\hbar \omega/2$. Plugging in for $C^2$, this is $m R^2 \omega^2/2+\hbar \omega/2$. The $m R^2 \omega^2/2$ term is the energy of the classical solution. So this solution may be thought of as the best attempt to mimic an energy of $m R^2 \omega^2/2$ when we only have access to the discrete levels $n \hbar \omega$.
