First, $\pi_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$ has an infinite cyclic direct summand for every $k \geq 1$. As a simple example, you can think of $\pi_3(S^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, coming from the Hopf fibration. We recently wrote a paper where we solved a problem, which is closely related to your question. Namely, we give an algorithm which for a given finite simply connected simplicial complex $Y$, and a given $d \geq 2$, under some technical conditions on $Y$ the algorithm outputs for every generator $\alpha \in \pi_d(Y)$, a simplicial map $f_\alpha : \Sigma^d_\alpha \rightarrow Y $, where $\Sigma^d_\alpha$ is a simplicial complex whose geometric realisation is homeomorphic to $S^d$. In particular this works for spheres. You can find the paper on archive ($URL$ and it will soon appear in the SODA 2018 proceedings. The complexity of the algorithm is singly exponential on the number of simplices of $Y$, and we show that this is optimal. The way we prove it is by constructing an example $X$ where the necessary size of the spheres $\Sigma^n_\alpha$ is exponential on the size of $X$. That shows that any general algorithm must necessarily have at least singly exponential complexity. However, we do not work with barycentric subdivisions, but with a rather specific and non-canonical (if I might put it so) triangulations of the $d$-sphere. The construction of those was invented by Clemens Berger in his PhD dissertation ($URL$ - in French only). We believe that one could be able to fit those "non-canonical" models into an iterated barycentric subdivision of the boundary of a standard simplex. If this is true, it would mean that you need to subdivide $\partial \Delta[m+1]$ enough times to fit the exponentially large spheres produced by our algorithm, and you would be able to represent any homotopy element you wish. On the other hand, even though our algorithm is exponential in the general case, it might happen that it runs in polynomial time for some very specific spaces. For example. It is not impossible that this turn out to be true for spheres, but I cannot say much more about it. There is also another point of view. Spheres are compact Riemannian manifolds and you can rephrase your question in the language of Lipschitz constants. In this language, your question roughly translates to "what Lipschitz constants can one expect from representatives of homotopy groups of spheres". There is a connection between the Lipschitz constant of a Lipschitz function and the fineness of a triangulation required to homotope it to a simplicial map. This is somewhat expected because both notions measure some sort of geometric complexity of the function in mind. In particular, there is the following result by Gromov ($URL$ Theorem (Gromov): Let $X$ and $Y$ be compact simply connected Riemannian manifolds. Then $$\# \{ [f] \in [X,Y] \, : \, Lip(f) \leq L \} = O(L^\alpha)$$, where $\alpha$ depends only on the rational homotopy type of $X$ and $Y$. You can check also this ($URL$ paper from Weinberger and Ferry. There is a long study of similar questions from that point of view. I hope my comments are useful. In conclusion I would like to say that you question is very deep and very hard. 

Yes: a discrete group $G$ is amenable if and only if the reduced group C*-algebra $C^*_r(G)$ is nuclear, see E.C. Lance, On nuclear $C^{\ast} $-algebras. J. Functional Analysis 12 (1973), 157--176. This is then equivalent to $W^*(G) = C^*_r(G)^{**}$ being an injective von Neumann algebra: which by definition means that if $W^*(G) \subseteq B(H)$ then there is a contractive projection from $W^*(G)$ to $B(H)$. I'm pretty sure you could look at the group von Neumann algebra $VN(G)$ instead, but I cannot recall the correct reference (but it's all in Runde's book "Lectures on Amenability"). Note that all this only works because $G$ is discrete. Now, the problem is that you do need ``contractive'' projection here: it's still a conjecture if just having a bounded projection is enough. Also, I'm sure there are other answers (and perhaps some that are easier: even a streamlined approach to all this uses a lot of operator algebra theory)... 

So I don't think I'm quite interested in Radon measures (well, I am, but that doesn't completely answer my question): in particular, the original link to Wikipedia (about L^p spaces) seems to claim that any finite Borel measure on a metric space is automatically outer regular, and inner regular in the weaker sense with K being only closed. 

I am not sure what is your question. But you can construct a linear functional in this way. The limit does not exist for some $f$ in $L^\infty$. But you can use the Banach limit. Consider the bounded linear functional on $C(R)$ defined as the limit as $x\to 0$. By Hahn-Banach this has an extension to a bounded linear functioal on $L^\infty(-\infty,0)$. and also has an extension to $L^\infty(0,\infty)$. Now define your functional as you propose, using these Banach limits. But all this is a kind of trivial nonsense. Hahn Banach says you from the beginning that you have (very many) linear functionals on $L^\infty$ which are zero on $C$. This is a pure existence theorem. But your "construction" really adds nothing to it, because the existence of a Banach limit is again a pure existence theorem. 

Your "caricature" is trivially true without any condition of positivity. (That is when you remove the second sentence it becomes true). Just take the interolation polynomial. Polynomials are evidently in $H^2$. And also in $H^\infty$. The main condition in the Pick theorem for which positivity is needed is the condition that $\| f\|_\infty\leq 1$. 

Another perspective of the question is from the point of view of computational complexity. According to the this paper ($URL$ for a simply connected finite simplicial complex $X$, computing $\pi_n (X)$ is a computationally very hard problem with respect to the parameter $n$ ($W[1]$-hard to be concrete). It has been known for a long time that higher homotopy groups are algorithmically computable (the first results go back to Brown), and later it was shown ($URL$ that there is an algorithm which for a finite simply connected simplicial complex $X$ and $n \geq 2$ computes $\pi_n (X)$ in time, polynomial in the size of $X$. However, in this polynomial result $n$ is taken as part of the input. The result I stated above is that if you vary $n$, then the complexity of the problem explodes. I find this point of view particularly nice because it gives some concrete feeling for how complicated the computation of higher homotopy groups is (including the homotopy groups of spheres). On the other hand, one may point out that many results have been obtained regardless of the complexity but the sophistication of the tools required to obtain those results is yet another instance of this complexity. Hope that is useful. 

To start with, we use the Eberlein-Smulian Theorem to observe that a Banach space $F$ is reflexive if and only if every separable subspace of $F$ is reflexive. [Question: Do we need Eberlein-Smulian to show this?] Recall also that $\mc U$ being countably incomplete means that there is a nested sequence of sets $A_1 \supseteq A_2 \supseteq \cdots$ in $\mc U$ with $\cap_i A_i = \emptyset$. I think of this property as allowing us to embed sequential convergence into convergence along $\mc U$. Finally, let us recall Theorem 6.3 in Heinrich's paper: 

I should say that I'm not a category theorist or an abstract algebraist, so maybe this will be very pedestrian. I have the following, somewhat vague question: 

which sends $T:V\rightarrow U(M)$ to $a\otimes x\mapsto a\cdot T(x)$. Then a module of the form $A\otimes V$ is "free", and this leads to consideration of projective modules etc. In my situation (dealing with topological algebras etc.) I can parallel all of this. Similarly, we have a right adjoint $\text{Hom}_{k{\sf -vect}}(A,\underline{\ \ })$. This gives a natural bijection $$ \text{Hom}_{A{\sf -mod}}(M,\text{Hom}_{k{\sf -vect}}(A,V)) \cong \text{Hom}_{k{\sf -vect}}(U(M),V), $$ which identifies $T:U(M)\rightarrow V$ with $x \mapsto (a\mapsto T(a\cdot x))$. Then one might call a module of the form $\text{Hom}_{k{\sf -vect}}(A,V)$ "cofree", and this leads to injective modules, etc. In my situation, my category of modules is not a "closed category"; if cofree modules existed, the naturality of the above bijection would force them to $\text{Hom}(A,V)$ (for a suitable meaning of $\text{Hom}$), but this object is not in my category. I'm hence missing a good notion of "cofree"; but really I'm interested in injectives. Are there situations (say, in algebra) where something similar occurs? Edit: People demand a more explicit example. Suppose $A$ is a von Neumann algebra, and my category is those modules which are dual Banach spaces $E$, with a bounded left action of $A$, and such that for each $x\in E$, the orbit map $A\rightarrow E; x\mapsto a\cdot x$ is weak$^*$-continuous. The forgetful functor is to the category of dual Banach spaces with weak$^*$-continuous bounded linear maps as morphisms. The right adjoint "should be" $B^\sigma(A,\underline{\ \ })$, the weak$^*$-cts bounded linear maps. But this is rarely itself even a dual Banach space. 

Orthogonalize your powers on your interval using the Gram-Schmidt algorithm, and then apply the usual Fourier formulas for expansions in an orthogonal system. 

Goluzin, Geometric theory of functions of a complex variable, contains a very comprehensive discussion of transfinite diameter, Fekete points etc. Ransford's book mentioned above is also very nice. 

Exponential solutions are easy to find. Just plug $\exp(ax+by+ct)$, and you will see that every $(a,b,c)$ that satisfies $c=a^2-b^2$ gives you a solution. This polynomial is called the symbol of the differential operator. For the general theory of linear PDE with constant coefficients, the best source is the first two volumes of Hormander, Analysis of Linear Differential Operators. 

$i=\sqrt{-1}$ has no apparent relation with any distance. Also $\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}dx=\sqrt{\pi}.$ 

Let $Q$ be a square with side $T$ which contains the support. Extend your function to a doubly periodic one with periods $(0,T)$ and $(T,0)$. Then expand into the double Fourier series: $$f(x,y)=\sum a_{m,n}e^{2\pi inx/T}e^{2\pi im/T}.$$ This series can be differentiated term-by-term. As $f\in C^\infty$ this converges uniformly, so you have the approximation. Fourier coefficients are evidently bounded. Differentiating in $x$ you obtain a Fourier series of $f_x$ whose coefficients are also bounded. Same for $f_y$. 

Thus $x = \alpha_0(x) \Phi$, in particular, as $x$ is non-zero, $\alpha_0(x)\not=0$, and so $\Phi = \alpha_0(x)^{-1} x$. Thus, if $X$ is not reflexive, I can choose $\Phi\in X''\setminus X$, and then I have found a suitable set $A$ which is not dense. So your condition is equivalent to reflexivity. 

Then 2 and 3 show that $A,B\in\mathcal R \implies A\setminus B\in\mathcal R$. Then 2 shows that $\mathcal R$ is closed under disjoint unions, so combined with 3, we see that $A,B\in\mathcal R \implies A\cup B = (A\setminus B) \cup (B\setminus A) \cup (A\cap B) \in \mathcal R$. So actually your axioms describe a "$\delta$-ring" (see $URL$ ) and not a $\sigma$-ring. Here then is a counter-example to your question. Let $X=\mathbb N$ with $\mathcal R$ being the collection of all finite subsets of $X$. Define $\phi$ by 

Proof: That $S$ is compact if and only if $T$ is compact is Schauder's theorem. Set $X:=\{S(\omega):\omega\in E, \|\omega\|\leq 1\}$ and notice that (1) is equivalent to: 

Something is wrong with the question, as here's a counter-example. Let $V=c_0$ with the pointwise involution (so this is a commutative C*-algebra). Let C be the obvious cone: the collection of vectors all of whose coordinates are positive. Let $x=(i,0,0,\cdots)$. Then $V^* = \ell^1$, so if $s=(s_n)\in\ell^1$ satisfies $s(C)\subseteq[0,\infty)$, we need that $s_n\geq 0$ for all $n$. But then $s(x)$ is purely imaginary! So, maybe you also need $x^*=x$. Under this assumption, here's a proof, but it has nothing to do with "Krein-Milman"... As C is closed, $V\setminus C$ is open, so let A be an open ball about x which doesn't intersect C. Then A and C are disjoint, non-empty, convex, so by Hahn-Banach, as A is open, we can find a bounded linear map $\phi:V\rightarrow\mathbb C$ and $t\in\mathbb R$ with $$ \Re \phi(a) < t \leq \Re \phi(c) $$ for $a\in A$ and $c\in C$. This is e.g. from Rudin's book. As $0\in C$, we see that $t\leq 0$. Now, we can lift the involution * from V to the dual of V. In particular, define $$ \phi^*(x) = \overline{ \phi(x^*) } \qquad (x\in V)$$ So let $\psi = (\phi+\phi^*)/2$. For $c\in C$, as $c^*=c$, notice that $\psi(c) = \Re \phi(c)$. Hence $0 \leq \psi(c)$ for all $c\in C$. Similarly, as $x^*=x$, we have that $\psi(x) = \Re\phi(x)<t\leq 0$, as $x\in A$. 

Your coefficients are piecewise constant, which allows you to write the general solution of your differential equation. First write the general solutions on each interval where they are constant. This will give you 4 arbitrary constants in your two solutions. Then use the matching conditions for $X$, $X'$ at the point of discontinuity ($X$ and $\kappa X'$ must be continuous on the whole interval.) This will eliminate two of the 4 arbitrary constants. This gives you an explicit general solution, depending on the two arbitrary constants. Plug the boundary conditions to it to obtain an equation for eigenvalue. 

$$\| Ax\|^2=(Ax,Ax)=(A^*Ax,x),\quad \| A^*x\|^2=(A^*x,A^*x)=(AA^*x,x).$$ Now $AA^*$ and $A^*A$ are symmetric. Two symmetric matrices define the same quadratic form if and only if they are equal.

Borchers defines $\pi$ to be covariant extendible if $\pi$ is (unitarily) equivalent to a subrepresentation of a covariant representation (as it happens, this is enough for my application). Then we have 

Books reviews More problematic is the case of certain authors and journals who are, shall we say, excessively "prolific"-- sometimes one sees papers which are clearly "new mathematics" (or least, claim to be) but which do not get a review. For obvious reasons I won't give an example, but it's not hard to find using the MathSciNet search tool. 

The answer for Question 1 is "yes". I believe this to be a little subtle. Firstly, as $j:H\rightarrow G$ is proper and injective, $j(H)$ is closed in $G$, and $j:H\rightarrow j(H)$ is a homeomorphism. So wlog $H$ can be identified with a closed subgroup of $G$, with $j$ the inclusion. You sort of hint at this in the statement of your question. Then, what is your map $J$? Well, if $\varphi\in C_c(H)$ then $f=\varphi\mu_H$ is a member of $L^1(H)$ (and such elements are dense). So $J\lambda_H(f) = \lambda_G(j^*(f))$ where $j^*$ is the pushforward $M(H)\rightarrow M(G)$. A more functional analytic way to think of this is to note that as $j$ is proper, it defines a map $\theta:C_0(G)\rightarrow C_0(H); g\mapsto g\circ j$ (as $H$ is closed, actually this map is a surjection). Then the Banach space adjoint is $j^*:M(H)=C_0(H)^* \rightarrow C_0(G)^*=M(G)$. Now, when does $J$ extend to a normal $*$-homomorphism $W^*_\lambda(H) \rightarrow W^*_\lambda(G)$? I like to think of this in an abstract harmonic analysis framework-- the predual of $W^*_\lambda(G)$, denoted $A(G)$, can be given the structure of a commutative Banach algebra: the "Fourier Algebra" as defined by Eymard. If we regard $\lambda_G$ as a map $L^1(G)\rightarrow W^*_\lambda(G)$ then we can regard $\lambda_G^*$ as a map $A(G)\rightarrow L^1(G)^*=L^\infty(G)$, and then this actually maps into $C_0(G)$ densely (this "is" the Gelfand map of the commutative Banach algebra $A(G)$, suitably interpreted-- if $G$ is abelian, it is the Fourier transform, hence the name). As $J$ is normal, it has a preadjoint $A(G)\rightarrow A(H)$, and if you regard these as non-closed subalgerbas of $C_0(G)$ and $C_0(H)$ respectively, we just get the map $\theta$ described above. So the question becomes equivalent to: does the map $a\mapsto a\circ j$ map $A(G)$ to $A(H)$ boundedly (hence automatically contractively). It turns out that the answer is: "yes". It's even a quotient map-- every $A(H)$ function arises as the restriction of an $A(G)$ function (identifying $H$ as a closed subgroup of $G$). This theorem is known as "Herz restriction", and the nicest writeup I know is an MSc thesis: Cameron Zwarich's thesis, see Section 4.2. Once we know $J$ exists, we know that $J\lambda_H(f)=\lambda_G(j^*(f))$ for all $f\in L^1(H)$, and as $j^*(f)\in M(G)$, it follows that $J\lambda_H(f)\in MC^*_\lambda(G)$, so indeed $J$ does restrict to a map $C^*_\lambda(H) \rightarrow MC^*_\lambda(G)$. The example of $\mathbb Z\subseteq\mathbb R$ shows we can't hope to get into $C^*_\lambda(G)$. Surely the same techniques give a positive answer of Q2. I think $\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R/\mathbb Z=\mathbb T$ shows that Q3 does not have a positive answer in general; I think the Fourier transform shows that $W^*_\lambda(\mathbb R)=L^\infty(\mathbb R), W^*_\lambda(\mathbb T)=\ell^\infty(\mathbb Z)$ and the map $J$ should send $(e^{2\pi ixt})_{x\in\mathbb R}\in L^\infty(\mathbb R)$ to $(e^{2\pi int})_{n\in\mathbb Z}\in\ell^\infty(\mathbb Z)$. This doesn't exist at the $L^\infty$ level. You always have a map at the level of full $C^*$-algebras, $C^*(G)\rightarrow C^*(K)$ (surjective even, and no multiplier algebra) but amenability issues might becomes a problem trying to drop to $C^*_\lambda(K)$.
