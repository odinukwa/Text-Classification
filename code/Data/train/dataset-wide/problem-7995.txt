I have been learning some representation theory and have some questions about the following pattern: Instance 1: If we have a finite group $G$ and a field $k$, a representation of $G$ over $k$ consists of a finite dimensional $k$-vector space $V$ and a homomorphism $G \to GL(V)$. We have a Hopf algebra $kG$ and an equivalence between representations of $G$ over $k$ and finite dimensional $kG$-modules. Instance 2: If we have a Lie group $G$, a representation of $G$ consists of a finite dimensional $\mathbb{R}$-vector space $V$ and a smooth homomorphism $ G \to GL(V) $. Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the lie algebra of $G$. Then we have a Hopf algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$ and an equivalence between representations of $G$ and finite dimensional $U(\mathfrak{g})$-modules. 

Assume $X$ is a measure space and $f : X \to [0,\infty]$ is an absolutely integrable function (that is $\int_X f \; d \mu < \infty$). This question is about the asymptotic behaviour of the function $$E(\delta) = \int _{f \leq \delta} f \; d \mu.$$ Since $f$ is absolutely integrable, it follows from the downward monotone convergence theorem that $E(\delta) \to 0$ as $\delta \to 0$. What I want to understand is how fast $E(\delta)$ converges to 0. What I know is that if $\mu(X) < \infty$ then we have $E(\delta) \leq \delta \mu(X)$, so $E(\delta)$ converges to $0$ at a linear rate or faster. 

I remember seeing an expression of the type $\omega(z)=\frac{1}{z}+\sum_{k=1} a_k z^k$, but I am not sure the context corresponded to mine. Moreover there was no mention of how to fix the coefficients $a_k$ in terms of the positions of the branch points or informations on $Q$. Thanks a lot! Stefano 

I have a question for you. BACKGROUND Consider an immersion $F\,:\;\mathscr S\;\longrightarrow\;\mathbb E^3$ of a surface $\mathscr S$ in the $3$-D euclidean plane $\mathbb E^3$ with canonical scalar product $\langle\cdot ,\cdot \rangle$. It is possible to find a metric structure such that the first fundamental form is diagonal $$\langle dF,dF\rangle=4e^udzd\bar z\;,\qquad dF=F_zdz+F_{\bar z}d\bar z\;.$$ It is well known that, in the case $\mathscr S$ is a Constant Mean Curvature surface, the field $u$ is constrained by the modified sinh-Gordon equation $$u_{z\bar z}+\frac{1}{2}\left(e^{u}+A\bar Ae^{-u}\right)=0\;,\qquad A_{\bar z}=\bar A_z=0\;,$$ which are simply the Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equation. If, on the other hand, we choose $\mathscr S$ to be a minimal surface we would get the Liouville equation $$u_{z\bar z}+\frac{\kappa}{2}e^{-u}=0\;,\qquad \kappa=\textrm{const.}\;.$$ QUESTION I would like to know if there exists a geometric interpretation for the Lagrangian $L$ and the Energy-Momentum tensor $T$ associated to the nonlinear field equation for $u$ (for example the sinh-Gordon equation above). I could not find a clear reference and would be glad if someone can suggest some. Thanks a lot! Stefano 

It is very possible that there is not a nice way to think about this construction which would make me sad because it is so fundamental. I hope that there are some good responses which help me fix my ignorance! EDIT: I just went through the proof again and wrote up the details. Let $ G$ be a graded ring. The first order of business is to explain why we have a homeomorphism $ D_+(f) \cong {\rm Spec} G_{(f)} $ when $ f \in G $ is homogeneous with degree $d \geq 1 $. Fix $ \mathfrak{p} \in D_+(f)$. Then $ \mathfrak{p}$ is the generic point of some irreducible closed subset $Z$ in $ {\rm Spec} G$. Since $ f \not\in \mathfrak{p}$ it follows that $ G_f \mathfrak{p}$ is the generic point of the irreducible closed subset $ Z \cap {\rm Spec} G_f$ in $ {\rm spec} G_f$. Assume that $g \in G $ is homogeneous. Then $ g $ vanishes at $ \mathfrak{p} $ iff $ g / 1 $ vanishes at $ G_f \mathfrak{p}$ iff $g^{\deg f} / f^{\deg g}$ vanishes at $ G_f \mathfrak{p}$ iff $g^{\deg f} / f^{\deg g} \in G_f \mathfrak{p} \cap G_{(f)} $. This proves that the map $D_+(f) \to {\rm Spec} G_{(f)}$ is injective. We need to prove that the map is surjective. Let $ \mathfrak{q}$ be a prime ideal in $G_{(f)}$. Motivated by the above argument, we define $$ \mathfrak{p}_n = \{ g \in G_n : g^{\deg f} / f^{\deg g} \in \mathfrak{q} \} $$ Then $ \mathfrak{p} = \oplus_{n \geq 0} \mathfrak{p}_n \in D_+(f)$ maps to $ \mathfrak{q} $. Since $ g $ vanishes at $ \mathfrak{p} $ iff $g^{\deg f} / f^{\deg g} \in G_f \mathfrak{p} \cap G_{(f)} $ the map is a homeomorphism which sends $D_+(fg)$ to $D(g^{\deg f} / f^{\deg g})$. All that remains is to prove that the map $ G_{(f)} \to G_{(fg)}$ defined by $ a / f^n \mapsto a g^n / (fg)^n$ is the localization map. From the affine case we know that $ G_{f} \to G_{fg}$ is the localization map at $ g / 1 $, therefore the only non units which $ G_{(f)} \to G_{(fg)}$ sends to units are powers of $ g^{\deg f} / f^{\deg g}$. I suspect that this last bit can be made rigorous. 

Hello everyone, I'm currently working over a certain class of ODE of the form $D_N \; \phi(x) = \lambda^N \phi(x) \quad, \quad N>1$ where $D_N = \delta_N \delta_{N-1} \cdots \delta_1$ and $\delta_k = (\frac{d}{dx}-A_k(x)), \quad 1 \leq k \leq N$. For various reasons my interest at the moment is focused on a class of objects, that I call $m$-order Wronskians defined as $ \quad w_m = \det[W^{(m)}] \quad $ with the entries of the $m \times m$ matrix $W^{(m)}$ being $ W^{(m)}_{ij} = \frac{d^{i-1}}{dx^{i-1}}\phi_j(x) \qquad 1 \leq i \leq m\ , \quad 1\leq j \leq m $ where $\left\lbrace \phi_j(x) \right\rbrace_{j=1}^N$ is a set of $N$ independent solutions of the ODE. WHAT I KNOW: 1 - The $N$-order Wronskian $w_N$ is a nonzero constant, given I set $\sum_{i=1}^NA_i=0$ (which means that the coefficient of the $(N-1)$-order derivative in the ODE vanishes). This obviously reflect the independence of the solutions $\phi_j$ . 2- The $(N-1)$-order Wronskian $z(x) = w_{N-1}$ is a solution of the adjoint equation $ D_N^{\dagger} \; z(x) = \lambda^N z(x) \quad $ where $\quad D_N^{\dagger} = \delta^{\dagger}_1 \delta^{\dagger}_2 \cdots \delta^{\dagger}_N \quad$ and $\quad \delta^{\dagger}_k = (\frac{d}{dx}+A_k(x))$ WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW: some argument led me to argue that $m$-order Wronskians ($\forall m\ ,\ 1\leq m \leq N-1$) should satisfy some kind of ODE or pseudo-ODE (with which I mean equations that might contain both differential and integral operators). Sadly I could neither demonstrate this nor find any reference concerning this subject Does someone know some reference to this subject? Thank you very much for your time. Stefano 

I am vaguely aware of the notion of turing completeness, so I don't expect this hypothetical programing language to be anymore powerful than any other programing language. 

By direct computation, if $ \Omega = 0$, then the horizontal subbundle is integrable, so the connection is flat. A slightly more concrete question than question 1 is 

Ok, I know I should have done this before I asked the question, but I had a dig through the stacks project. It seems like $URL$ is exactly what I am looking for. 

Consider the language generated by the following context free grammar: $$ S \to SS \quad S \to () \quad S \to (S) \quad S \to [] \quad S \to [S] $$ There is a one-to-one correspondence between this language and rooted planar trees where each edge is either dashed or solid ([] corresponds to a dashed edge and () corresponds to a solid edge). Call a tree $T$ good if when you remove all the solid edges, the remaining dashed forest is a connected tree where all the vertices have valence $ \leq 2 $ (i.e a path). Let $L$ be the sublanguage consisting of all good trees.
