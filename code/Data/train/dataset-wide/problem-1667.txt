So if the Earth were suddenly plunging into the Sun as you describe, there would be no discernible difference in weight, barring fairly minor tidal effects when one gets closer to the Sun. Conceptually, it would be a different orbit, rather than a lack of orbiting. 

No. First, both particles and anti-particles have "normal" mass (should they have mass in the first place) and "normal" (positive) energy. The distinction between them is either a matter of convention or a question of which type is more common in the universe. Furthermore, for typical-massed blacked holes, the bulk of Hawking radiation would be made of photons, which properly speaking do not even have anti-particles, though one could also say that they are their own anti-particle. 

The curvature around a rotating black hole is more complicated, but the moral of the story is basically the same. 

There are different words for different aspects of space. For example, consider: length, width, and height. Other words include depth and breadth. We can speak of them as different things if we choose to, but we generally consider them to be part of unified concept of space. Why? It's because we understand that these words just pick out measurements along specific directions in space set by context or the speaker's viewpoint, and that there is no intrinsic difference between those directions. Depending on which way they are facing, what's length to one person is width to another. More formally, there is a symmetry between directions in space. We can rotate freely and the intrinsic properties of space look just the same, e.g. the Euclidean metric (infinitesimal distance formula) $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = \mathrm{d}x^2 + \mathrm{d}y^2 + \mathrm{d}z^2$$ is invariant under the orthogonal group of rotations, $\mathrm{O}(3)$. Together with spatial translations (which are like rotations about a point at infinity), this forms the Euclidean group of isometries, $\mathrm{ISO}(3)$. Because of this symmetry that "intermixes" directions of space, we think of those different directions as being unified one into one thing: space. In special relativity, spacetime has a Minkowski metric (in units of $c=1$) $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\mathrm{d}t^2 + \mathrm{d}x^2 + \mathrm{d}y^2 + \mathrm{d}z^2\text{,}$$ and it is invariant under the Lorentz group $\mathrm{O}(1,3)$ that act like rotations in spacetime; together with the translations (in space and in time), the full isometry group is the Poincaré group. In fact, the usual Lorentz transformation (say, boosting along the $x$-axis) is exactly a rotation with by a hyperbolic angle in the $tx$ plane. That's why people began to think of spacetime as one unified whole. The reasons are essentially the same as why people think of space as one unified whole despite it having different directions: there is a symmetry that "intermixes" those directions, albeit slightly differently in spacetime because of the different sign of the temporal and spatial directions in the metric. In general relativity, this is generalized further, but the details aren't immediately relevant here. 

Light rays run diagonally at ±45° on the diagram. Note that there is a region from which outgoing light rays (running diagonally lower-left to upper-right) don't escape and instead meet the $r = 0$ singularity (the bolded, undashed horizontal line). The horizon itself is the the $r = 2m$ line marked on the diagram and its extension into the star: it should actually go from the (dashed, vertical) $r = 0$ line on the left, rather than extending from the star's collapsing surface. That's because some of the (idealized, noninteracting) light rays from inside the star will also fail to escape to infinity. Now suppose that on this diagram you draw timelike curves that stubbornly stay away from the horizon, and you insist on using a parameter along them as a time coordinate. Does the fact that you've chosen coordinates that exclude the horizon needs to be made consistent with whether or not the event horizon actually exist? The resolution is simple: if you want to talk about the horizon, stop using coordinates that exclude it. 

To talk about 'the rate of time', we essentially need at least two different time coordinates. For example, this happens in special-relativistic time dilation, which is equivalent to $\mathrm{d}t'/\mathrm{d}t$ across two different inertial frames. Fortunately, we can do something similar here. 

The concept of 'relativistic mass' is largely depreciated in modern physics. Mass is more properly related to energy and momentum via $(mc^2)^2 = E^2 - (pc)^2$. 

If you try to consider some hypothetical state of all particles, that state is almost certainly entangled. However, that does not mean that you can't (say) treat two particles at random as very probably independent of each other--effectively unentangled. The standard definition of an entangled state is a state that is not fully separable, i.e. one that is not probability mixture of product states. This is just the quantum version of the notion of "independent random variables" in more ordinary probability theory. Thus, for any compound system, almost all states are entangled, as the non-entangled ones are vanishly small (measure zero) subset of all possible states. For example, any time you measure a particle with apparatus, after measurement the apparatus indicates something about the measured system. Thus, the joint state of the compound "apparatus + particle" system is not separable because its parts are not independent of one another. Measurement produces a particular case of entanglement between the measuring and the measured. As a macroscopic system interacts with its environment, information about it diffuses into the environment, producing entanglement between parts of the system and parts of its environment. Overall, this leakage of information is responsible for quantum decoherence and the second law of thermodynamics. But its chaotic nature means that for all practical purposes, that information is lost, and we can think of entropy increase as 'missing information'. However, if you just pick particles at random, chances overwhelming are that you can treat them as essentially independent--unentangled. Intuitively, one can think information about something becoming so mixed up in its environement in the large that any particular microscopic parts of it and its environment are going to tell you next to nothing about each other. In other words, they'd be almost entirely independent from each other--unentangled. 

If the black hole has no surrounding matter, so that there is no violent radiation generated by accretion or the like, then it still depends on the mass of the black hole. If it is in the thousands of solar masses or more, it is possible for a realistic camera to survive free-fall to the horizon. This is essentially a non-issue for supermassive black holes. On the other hand, smaller black holes are quite a bit more punishing. For Newtonian gravity with potential $\Phi$, in a free-falling frame, a particle at $x^k$ near the origin of the frame will be accelerated at $$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2x^j}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = -\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial x^j} = -\frac{\partial^2\Phi}{\partial x^j\partial x^k}x^k\text{,}$$ where the the second derivatives of the potential, $\Phi_{,jk}$, form the so-called tidal gravitational field. Since $\Phi = -GM/r$ for a point-source, you should expect the tidal forces on a free-falling object to be proportional to $GM/r^3$ times the size of the object. Thus, at the Schwarzschild radius, this is on the order of $c^6/(GM)^2$. Of course, black holes are not Newtonian. However, it turns out that for the non-rotating, uncharged (Schwarzschild) black hole, radial free-fall of a test particle has the same form as in Newtonian theory, except in Schwarzschild radial coordinate (not radial distance) and proper time of the particle (not universal time), so the above is essentially correct even for Schwarzschild black holes. To be relativistically correct, the tidal forces on an free-falling object are described by the equation of geodesic deviation, in which the gravitoelectric part of the Riemann curvature provides forms the tidal tensor: $$\frac{\mathrm{D}^2x^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\tau^2} = -R^\alpha{}_{\mu\beta\nu} u^\mu u^\nu x^\beta\text{.}$$ In Schwarzschild spacetime, this turns out to be $+2GM/r^3$ in the radial direction, stretching the free-falling object, and $-GM/r^3$ in the orthogonal directions, squeezing it. This stretching-and-squeezing due to gravitational tidal forces is sometimes called spaghettification. Some example numbers: say the camera size is on the order of $0.1\,\mathrm{m}$. The the following are the approximate tidal accelerations near the horizon for black holes of different multiples of solar masses: 

Since the zodiac partitions the celestial longitude into twelve $30^\circ$ divisions, this makes sense, and seems to work out fairly straightforwardly though a bit cryptically, because the calculation mixes degrees and minutes: e.g., the minuend (first part) of Step 8 is in degrees, which is only implicitly converted to minutes of arc to be compatible with the subtrahend ($3'$). 

The Schwarzschild black hole is the simplest, being just an isolated, nonrotated, uncharged black hole. If $\tau$ is the proper time measured by a clock moving along an arbitrary path in this spacetime, then in Schwarzschild coordinates $$-\mathrm{d}\tau^2 = -\left(1-\frac{R}{r}\right)\mathrm{d}t^2 + \left(1-\frac{R}{r}\right)^{-1}\mathrm{d}r^2 + r^2\left(\mathrm{d}\theta^2+\sin^2\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi^2\right)\text{,}$$ where $R = 2GM/c^2$ is the Schwarzschild radius. If the observer is stationary, then neither the radial nor angular coordinates change ($\mathrm{d}r = \mathrm{d}\theta = \mathrm{d}\varphi = 0$). So, for example, relative the rate of time of stationary observers at some radial coordinates $r_1$ and $r_2$ is just $$\frac{\mathrm{d}\tau_1}{\mathrm{d}\tau_2} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\tau_1/\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}\tau_2/\mathrm{d}t} = \sqrt{\frac{1-R/r_1}{1-R/r_2}}\text{.}$$ 

A three-dimensional sphere, actually. Probably the most important intuitive leap here is that any particular embedding, or even whether there exists any embedding, is completely irrelevant. The surface of an ordinary beach-ball is actually a two-dimensional sphere, and as a manifold it makes sense whether or not we think of it a surface of some three-dimensional object. When we're talking about the universe, an embedding is a tool for visualization, not reality. The universe could be a $3$-sphere, which we could think of as the surface of a ball in flat four-dimensional space, but there is no need to. That four-dimensional space wouldn't be part of our universe (not in general relativity, anyway), and such embeddings aren't unique. Actually, for completely general spacetime manifolds (i.e. if we try to embed spacetime in flat higher-dimensional spacetime), they're not even guaranteed to exist, which is a good thing because we don't need them--all our measurements are within the universe. 

The standard cosmological model is that dark energy is a cosmological constant. Thus, its energy density does not change. It then becomes straightforward that at some point, cosmological expansion makes matter too dilute to compete with dark energy, which is when dark energy starts dominating. It was there all along, but before then, matter was dense enough to be dominant instead. 

But it already is "negative gravity". In general relativity, the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ describes the energy, momentum, and stress of matter in spacetime. Through the Einstein field equation, it is connected with Ricci curvature $R_{\mu\nu}$, which consists of half of the twenty independent degrees of freedom of spacetime curvature. The intuitive geometrical meaning of Ricci curvature is as follows: suppose you have a small ball of test particles, initially all at the same velocity with respect to one another, and allow them to fall freely under gravity. Then the Ricci curvature (contracted with their intitial velocity) measures the initial acceleration of the volume of the ball of test particles divided by the initial volume. Thus, this is a good way to tell if something is locally "attractive" or "repulsive", based on whether a ball of test particles around it starts shrinking or expanding. Through the Einstein field equation, stress-energy is connected to Ricci curvature. As a result, the volume of the small ball of test particles shrinks proportionally to $\rho+3p$, where $\rho$ is the energy density and $p$ is the average of the principal stresses--for a perfect fluid, the pressure. Naturally, if $\rho+3p < 0$, this is "negative gravity" in the sense that the test ball will start expanding instead. This quantity is also what's seen in the cosmological Friedmann equations. Since the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker family of solutions assume that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on the large scale, it's sensible that treat the large-scale the same as the above local condition. Dark energy has $\rho+3p<0$, and in particular (for cosmological constant), $\rho = -p > 0$. To recap: (1) in general relativity, gravity depends on the stress-energy tensor, which has more than just the mass-energy density, and numerically pressure is more important because there are three spatial dimensions while only one time dimension, (2) we can characterize locally "negative gravity" as $\rho+3p < 0$, or, more generally, as any the violation of the strong energy condition, because this characterizes whether a small ball of test particles is attracted or repulsed by the local stress-energy content.
