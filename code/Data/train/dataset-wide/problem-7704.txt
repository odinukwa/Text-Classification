This is more of a long comment than an answer, but I hope you find it useful. I will first explain one way to construct the Weil restriction of a quasi-projective variety $X$ over $L$, when $L/K$ is a finite separable extension of degree $n$. One first considers the finite product $$\prod_{\sigma: L \to K^s} X^{\sigma},$$ where the product is over all embeddings of $L$ into a separable closure $K^s$ of $K$, and $X^{\sigma}$ denotes the conjugate of $X$ with respect to $\sigma$ (when $L/K$ is Galois the picture is simpler as one can work with Galois groups instead of embeddings). This admits a natural action of $\mbox{Gal}(K^s/K)$, and on taking the quotient by this action we obtain $\mbox{Res}_{L/K} X$. So for example, the Weil restriction of the projective line $\mathbb{P}_L^1$ is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{P}_{K^s}^1)^n$ over $K^s$, but is not isomorphic to $(\mathbb{P}_{K}^1)^n$. In particular one sees that your approach (1) does not work even in this case. Indeed, whilst the Weil restriction respects open immersions, it does not respect open coverings. Here we have $\mbox{Res}_{L/K} \mathbb{A}_L^1 = \mathbb{A}_K^n$, however two copies of this are clearly not enough to cover $\mbox{Res}_{L/K} \mathbb{P}_L^1$. Your approach (2) seems more likely to work, and perhaps after translating the problem you should recover the construction I just gave above. I would personally approach the problem by trying to mimic the construction I just gave for the case of infinite field extensions, by taking limits of appropriate products and then quotienting out by suitable Galois actions. Good luck. 

Yes this is true. It can be proved using the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence plus Hilbert's theorem 90 (it is true more generally for any geometrically connected projective variety $X$). The Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence yields the exact sequence: $$0 \to H^1(K, \bar{K}[X_\bar{K}]^*) \to \mbox{Pic} X \to \mbox{Pic} X_\bar{K}.$$ See for instance Lemma 6.3 of 

Problems of this type are considered by Serre in the paper: Serre - Spécialisation des éléments de $\mathrm{Br}_2(\mathbb{Q}(T_1,\ldots, T_n))$ The case relevant to you is Exemple 4. Here Serre shows that \begin{align*} &\#\{|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F| \leq N : \\ & Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+Dx+Ey+F=0 \text{ has a rational point} \} \ll \frac{N^6}{(\log N)^{1/2}}. \end{align*} This gives a more precise quantitative version of "probability $0$" mentioned by Michael Stoll. Hooley has in fact shown that Serre's bound is sharp. This result is the object of the paper: Hooley - On ternary quadratic forms that represent zero II. 

The corresponding projective surface $$S: xyz + (x + y + z)w^2=0 \subset \mathbb{P}^3,$$ is a singular cubic surface - singular cubic surfaces are special. It has three singularities, each of which has singularity type $A_1$ (this means that locally each has the shape $xy + w^2 =0$). These are the points $(1:0:0:0),(0:1:0:0)$ and $(0:0:1:0)$ (note that these all lie at the "plane at infinity", $w=0$). The surface $S$ contains $12$ lines ($6$ of these are easy to find, the other $6$ take more work). A concrete reason why such surfaces are special is that the collection of projective cubic surfaces over $\mathbb{C}$ with singularity type $3A_1$ forms a one dimensional family. These facts (and more) can be found in the article: Bruce and Wall - On the classification of cubic surfaces. 

This is a partial answer. There are many papers on nets of quadrics (see e.g. work of Debarre and Beauville). Here the discriminant locus is a plane curve. If the base-locus of the net is non-singular, then this curve is stable, but need not be non-singular in general (e.g. singular discriminant curves arise from a net generated by sufficiently general diagonal quadrics). I don't know whether the base-locus being stable implies that the discriminant locus is stable, or conversely. People are certainly interested in the case where the base-locus is singular however, again I would recommend the papers by the above authors as a good starting place. For higher-dimensional linear systems of quadrics, things get increasingly more complicated and much less is known. I would be surprised if the results you wanted were known in such cases. Certainly the case of nets is the best place to look first. 

These are called Dirichlet polynomials. They arise in many places in analytic number theory. For example, in approximate functional equations of $L$-functions. 

Explicit expressions for such lower order terms can be found in Chapter II.5 (Selberg-Delange method) of the book Tenenbaum - Introduction to analytic and probabilistic number theory. See in particular Theorem 3. The expression contains things like the coefficients of the higher order terms of the Taylor expansion of your function at the singularity. I agree Alexey however that they are usually quite ugly. 

Here is the kind of method I had in mind. We have the elliptic curve Kummer sequence $$0 \to E[n] \to E \to E \to 0,$$ Here I denote by $E[n]$ the $n$-torsion group scheme of $E$. Applying Galois cohomology we obtain $$0 \to E(\mathbb{Q})/nE(\mathbb{Q}) \to H^1(\mathbb{Q}, E[n]) \to H^1(\mathbb{Q}, E)[n] \to 0.$$ By the Mordell-Weil theorem, the group $E(\mathbb{Q})/nE(\mathbb{Q})$ is finite (its cardinality grows roughly like $n^{\mathrm{rank}(E)}$). Thus it suffices to show that $H^1(\mathbb{Q}, E[n])$ is infinite. I think that this should be some general property of Galois cohomology for non-trivial finite abelian group schemes over number fields, which probably you already know about. Anyway, the argument should go as follows: Choose a splitting field $k/\mathbb{Q}$ for $E[n]$. We then apply inflation-restriction to obtain $$0 \to H^1(\mathrm{Gal}(k/\mathbb{Q}), E[n]) \to H^1(\mathbb{Q}, E[n]) \to H^1(k, (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^2)^{\mathrm{Gal}(k/\mathbb{Q})} \to H^2(\mathrm{Gal}(k/\mathbb{Q}), E[n]).$$ The first and the latter group are finite. The group $H^1(k, (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^2)$ is clearly infinite, and I think that it is still infinite after taking Galois invariants. Though this last step is the part I did not fully check. Is it clear to you? 

For which $h$ does this equation have a solution in the integers? Is there any $h$, which is not a cube, for which the equation has infinitely many solutions in the integers? 

If the answer to this is yes, then an obvious next question is whether this is equivalent to finiteness of $Ш(E)$, i.e. 

For a variety over a non-algebraically closed field, "geometrically connected" means connected over the algebraic closure. As an example where this fails, note that the curve $x^2+1=0$ in $\mathbb{A}^2$ is connected over $\mathbb{Q}$, but not over $\mathbb{Q}[i]$, where is becomes $(x+i)(x-i)=0$, which is a union of two lines. Hence this curve is connected but not geometrically connected. You can also use the same adjective for many other properties, so that you can talk about something being geoemtrically integral, geometrically rational, etc... 

Let $k$ be a number field and denote by $J_k$ the idele group of $k$. Recall that the finite-index open subgroups of $J_k$ which contain $k^*$ are very important in class field theory. My question concerns non-open finite index subgroups. 

In the case where $S = \mathrm{Spec}(k)$ for some field $k$ and $X$ is reduced, it is possible to construct such a scheme by hand. One takes $I_{X/k}$ to be the product of the spectrum of the algebraic closure of $k$ in the function field of each irreducible component of $X$. This has the property that for any field extension $k \subset K$, the points $I_{X/k}(K)$ are in bijection with those irreducible components of $X$ over $\bar{k}$ which are actually defined over $K$. I am looking for such a construction which works in greater generality. I'm naively hoping that this might be buried in EGA somewhere... As a closely related example, note that it is quite easy to construct a scheme of connected components, at least when $X/S$ is proper. Namely, one simply takes the Stein factorisation of $\pi$ to obtain a finite scheme $S'/S$, whose fibres parametrise the connected components of the fibres of $\pi$ in a natural way. 

Let $S$ be a finite set of places of a number field $k$ and let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $k$. Define the ''$S$-Tate-Shafarevich group" of $E$ to be $$Ш(E,S) = \ker\left(H^1(k,E) \to \prod_{v \not \in S}H^1(k_v,E_v)\right).$$ Note that the normal Tate-Shafarevich group is $Ш(E) = Ш(E,\emptyset)$. Recall that the Tate-Shafarevich conjecture states that $Ш(E)$ is finite. My question concerns the corresponding problem for $Ш(E,S)$. 

I think there is some confusion in your question; I agree with René that probably the correct analogue of rational point in general is something like a geometrically integral subscheme. I will however address the question about blow-ups, as this is completely unrelated to the first part of your question. First, any closed subscheme $Z$ of $X$ is defined over $k$, simply by definition. To be completely explicit, assume for simplicity that $X = \mathbb{A}_k^n$. Then the coordinate ring of $X$ is $A=k[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$. A closed subscheme $Z$ of $X$ is given by the zero locus of some ideal $I$ of $A$. By definition, this ideal is generated by some polynomials defined over $k$, hence $Z$ is defined over $k$, in whatever sense you would care about. This whole picture of course generalises by considering instead the relationship between closed subschemes and sheaves of ideals, and looking at affine patches. Now for the question about blow-ups: if $Z$ is a closed subscheme of $X$ then the blow-up $\mathrm{Bl}_Z X$ is also defined over $k$. This can be seen quite easily by using the explicit construction (given in Hartshorne, say), in terms of sheaves of ideals. 

This problem is closely related to Hilbert's irreducibility theorem. Serre has proven an effective version of this in his book "Lectures on the Mordell-Weil theorem". See in particular sections 9 and 13. This implies that $100\%$ of polynomials of degree $d$ are irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, for fixed $d > 1$. In particular $0\%$ of such polynomials have a rational root, hence $0\%$ have an integer root. Serre's result gives stronger quantitative information, for example this quantity decays like $c_{max}^{\varepsilon - 1/2}$ as $c_{max} \to \infty$. 

Note that the answer to my question is yes when $V$ is projective; in this case it is well-known that such a $V$ is a principal homogeneous space for its Albanese variety. So I am really interested in the case where $V$ is affine. Here I am not aware of an analogue of the Albanese variety for linear algebraic groups. Even if the answer is no in general, I would still be interested in some positive results for special cases, e.g. for reductive groups or semisimple groups. 

I hope it is clear, but just to clarify that I want a reduced normal crossings divisor $\Delta \subset \mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{Z}}$ which satisfies the appropriate analogues of conditions (a), (b), (c) and (d). 

A well-known application of the Chebotarev density theorem (Neukirch Cor. 13.10) says that this is true when $K/\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois (note that here a prime splits if and only if it splits completely). So I am really interested in what happens in the non-Galois case. Note also that the answer to the analogous question for completely split primes is no; indeed a prime is completely split in $K$ if and only if it is completely split in the Galois closure of $K$. 

I consider only smooth curves for simplicity. In which case this is expected to be true, but certainly not known in general. In fact, it is even expected that the Brauer-Manin obstruction is already enough. For curves of genus $1$ this would follow from the finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group. See Section 6.2 of the book Skorobogatov - Torsors and rational points. 

Let $X \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ be a non-singular complete intersection of $s$ hypersurfaces of degrees $d_1,\dots,d_s$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero. Let $d=d_1 + \dots + d_s$. Suppose that $X$ is Fano, i.e. $d < n + 1$. Denote by $F_1(X)$ the Fano variety of lines in $X$. Then it is known that if $X$ is general, then one has $$\dim F_1(X) = 2n - d - s - 2 \quad (*),$$ if this number is non-negative. Moreover, a conjecture of Debarre and de Jong states that $(*)$ holds for all such $X$ (not necessarily general) if $s=1$, i.e. if $X$ is a hypersurface. I have only seen this conjecture stated for hypersurfaces. My question is what happens for complete intersections. 

No: Consider the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 + x$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. Then the isogeny $y \mapsto iy$ and $x \mapsto -x$ is defined over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ but obviously not over $\mathbb{Q}$. In general if $K \subset L$ is Galois, then a morphism defined over $L$ comes from one over $K$ if and only if it is invariant under the action of $Gal(L/K)$. This follows from the so-called "theory of descent". See for example Bjorn Poonen's notes Rational points on varieties. 

Problems of this type are studied in the article Colliot-Thélène, Wittenberg - Groupe de Brauer et points entiers de deux familles de surfaces cubiques affines. Here, in remark 5.7, they give an explanation of Cassels' result in terms of a Brauer-Manin obstruction to strong approximation. Other examples of Brauer-Manin obstruction to strong approximation are also included, which in general imply the existence of other "non-obvious impossible congruences". One has to work very hard to make these congruences explicit. In the Cassels example, they prove it using the fact that $3$ is the only prime of bad reduction. However in your case of $996$, there are other primes of bad reduction, namely $2$ and $83$. So the same method does not apply. Moreover, your ''evidence'' in the $996$ case is very sparse, and I would see no reason why the same Cassels congruence should hold in this case. One would need to carefully work out the Brauer-Manin obstruction in this case and see what one gets. 

A proof/disproof or a reference for this would be much appreciated. By "up to isomorphism" I mean up to isomorphism as an algebraic variety. 

Here is a counter-example for $k$ not algebraically closed (for simplicitly I assume that $k$ is perfect). Recall that there is an anti-equivalence of categories between the category of algebraic tori over $k$ and the category of free $\mathbb{Z}$-modules with a continuous action of $Gal(\overline{k}/k)$ (given by the character group $\widehat{T}$). Choose an algebraic torus $T$ of dimension larger than one, whose character group $\widehat{T}$ is simple as a Galois module (these exist if e.g. $k=\mathbb{Q}$). Suppose that $T$ contains a one dimensional irreducible algebraic subgroup $C$. Then it is well known that such a group is isomorphic to either $\mathbb{G}_a,\mathbb{G}_m$ or an elliptic curve over $\overline{k}$. As $T$ is affine and every element is semi-simple, we see that $C$ is itself an algebraic torus. The inclusion $C \subset T$ therefore induces a non-trivial homorphism $\widehat{T} \to \widehat{C}$. The kernel of this homorphism is a Galois sub-module of $\widehat{T}$. However by assumption $\widehat{T}$ was simple, thus we deduce that $\widehat{C} = 0$ or $\widehat{T}$, which is a contradiction. Conclusion: Such a torus $T$ cannot contain a one dimensional algebraic subgroup. Edit: As Marguax points out I do in fact need $\widehat{T} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Q}$ to be simple as a Galois module. I believe that such examples may also be given be given by the norm one torus $$R^1_{K/k} \mathbb{G}_m : N_{K/k}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 1.$$ Here $k \subset K$ is a cyclic Galois field extension of prime degree $n > 2$ and $N_{K/k}$ denotes the norm form for $K/k$. This may be defined by choosing an isomorphism $K \cong k^n$ and considering the usual field norm as a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ on $k^n$.
