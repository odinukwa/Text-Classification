As remarked the non-trivial direction is to show $L_\sigma\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_\gamma$ implies $J_\sigma\prec_{\sigma_1}J_\gamma$. Let's take the extreme case that $\gamma=\sigma+1$. Suppose $J_{\sigma+1}\models \exists u \varphi(u,x)$ where $\varphi\in\Sigma_0$ and $x\in J_\sigma = L_\sigma$. The short answer is to copy everything onto subsets of $\sigma$ and use $\mathcal{P}(L_\sigma)\cap J_{\sigma+1}= L_{\sigma+1}$. But in more detail: as $J_{\sigma+1}=\bigcup_{n\in\omega} S_{\omega\sigma+n}$ (see Jensen's original Fine Structure paper, or Devlin's "Constructibility" for the definition of the $S_\nu$-hierarchy, and these and other assertions) we have for some $n$ that $S_{\omega\sigma+n}\models \exists u \varphi(u,x)$. (Here we have $\omega\sigma=\sigma$ as well as the fact that the Goedel pairing function $Q$ is $\Delta_1^{L_\sigma}$). By adding some extra `Basic Functions' to the usual list, we can assume each $S_{\omega\sigma+n}$ is transitive. Now use the fact that there is an onto function $F:\omega\sigma \rightarrow S_{\omega\sigma+n}$ in $J_{\sigma+1}$. Use this to get a subset $f\subseteq \omega\sigma$ with $$\langle \sigma, Q \mbox{''}f \rangle \cong \langle S_{\omega\sigma+n},\in \rangle $$ and $f\in J_{\sigma+1} $ and so also in $L_{\sigma+1} $. We now have an existential statement of the form $L_{\sigma+1} \models \mbox{''}\exists \sigma\exists f \subseteq \sigma \ldots $''. So reflect this to some $\tau<\sigma$ and obtain: $$\langle \tau, Q \mbox{''} \bar f \rangle \models \exists u \varphi(u,Q(\xi)_1) $$ where we ensure for some $\xi \in \bar f$, $ Q(\xi)_1 $ represents $x$ in the structure say. Taking the transitive collapse of $\langle \tau, Q \mbox{''}\bar f\rangle $ then yields a transitive model $U\in J_\sigma$ of $\exists u \varphi(u,x)$ as needed. [Edit: added to address comment. Now use this argument repeatedly to prove by induction on $\delta$ for $\sigma+1\leq\delta<\gamma$ that $L_\sigma\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_\gamma$ implies $J_\sigma\prec_{\sigma_1}J_\gamma$. The successor case of a $\delta+1$ is just a variant of the one given and the case of a limit $\delta$ is of course trivial.] For the Bonus Q just note that for $n>1$, if $L_\sigma\prec_{\Sigma_n}L_\gamma$, then both $L_\sigma$ and $L_\gamma$ are limits of admissible ordinals, so then $L_\sigma=J_\sigma$ and $L_\gamma=J_\gamma$ and there is nothing to do! 

The answer to the "More precisely ..." question is that yes, it may be the case that $L$ has a single inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$ and that for no larger $\beta >\kappa$ is there any $\alpha$ with $L_\alpha\models$``$\beta$ is inaccessible.'' For example if $\kappa$ is the first inaccessible in $L$ (if such exists) and there is a least $\delta$ with $L_\delta\models ZFC$ (if such exists) then $L_\delta$ is a model for this property: namely for every $\alpha \in (\kappa,\delta)$ we have $L_\alpha\models \kappa $ is the largest inaccessible. The restrictive assumption to put on $V$ to ensure that $L$ has this property is just to rule it out by fiat: that `There is no transitive model of $ZFC + \exists \kappa(\kappa $ is inaccessible)''. 

The short answer is that all finite sequences are representable. Suppose you want the general constellation you gave. We work inside $L$. For $X=\langle X,\in \rangle$ a model of V=L (not necessarily transitive) define $S^X_n(Y)$ to be the $\Sigma_n$-Skolem Hull in $X$ of the set $Y$. Let $\tau$ be the least ordinal $> \omega_{m-1}$ with $L_\tau$ a model of $\Sigma_{x_1}$-Separation scheme. (This ensures that $\rho(x_1,\tau)=\tau$.) Set $H_0= L_\tau$. Now define by recursion on $j$ for $1\leq j\leq m-1$: $$H_j = S^{H_{j-1}}_{x_j +1}(\omega_{m-1-j}). $$ Let $L_\alpha \simeq H_m$. This is admittedly easier to see with an example: say $(x_1,x_2,x_3) = (2,4,6)$ with $m=3$ "drops". Let $\tau$ be the least above $\omega_{m-1} =\omega_2$ with $L_\tau$ a model of $\Sigma_2$-Separation. Then $\tau = \rho(\tau,2)> \omega_2 =\rho(\tau,3) \ldots$. Then $$H_1 = S^{L_\tau}_5(\omega_1).$$ (If we were to transitivise this hull it would be an $L_{\alpha'}$ with $\rho(\alpha',k)=\omega_1$ for $k\geq 5$. One should check, e.g., that $\rho(\alpha',4)\neq \omega_1$: but if this failed then there would be a $\Sigma_4(L_{\alpha'})$ map of $\omega_1$ cofinally into $\alpha'$; but this is a $\Pi_5$ statement, and would then be true in $L_\tau$ which is absurd.) Then take $$H_2 =S^{H_1}_7(\omega).$$ Let $L_\alpha \simeq H_2$. Similar checks reveal that $\rho(\alpha,6)=\omega_1> \rho(\alpha,7) \ldots$ etc. and we have the correct pattern. I do not know of any references for this. 

I am getting the feeling there is some slight miss-match of terminology, or perhaps application of terminology is a better way of putting it? It is true that the (lightface) $\Pi^1_1-CA_0$ sets of integers correspond to the meta-r.e. sets of integers, but as you say, the old meta-recursion theory lies on $\omega_1^{ck}$. So it should really be about sets of ordinals rather than integers. However then one is really talking about $\Delta_1$-recursions over $(L_{\omega_1^{ck}},\in)$, and then the $\omega^{ck}_1$-r.e. sets are those $\Sigma_1(L_{\omega_1^{ck}},\in)$. Using a theorem of Kleene the restriction of the latter to sets of integers are indeed precisely the (lightface) $\Pi^1_1-CA_0$ sets of integers. I think the link with descriptive set theory comes through Kleene Recursion - not much studied these days but arises as a higher type recursion theory on $\omega$ and $\omega^\omega$. Restricting it to integers, yields that the Kleene-r.e. sets are the $\Pi^1_1$ sets of integers (so again those defined in a $\Sigma_1(L_{\omega_1^{ck}},\in)$ way). Kleene recursive sets of integers correspond to those in $HYP$. Including the reals, and working at the higher type, then Kleene rec. sets corresponds to Borel and Kleene-r.e. to (boldface) co-analytic. The `axioms', $T$, for Kleene recursion are his rules for an equational calculus for recursion on integers and reals, extending his equational calculus for the ordinary general recursive functions. (See, I think P. Hinman, Recursion Theoretic Hierarchies, Springer Omega Series, 1978, but also the chapter about higher type recursions in general by Dag Normann in Turing's Legacy, Ed. R. Downey, ASL Series in Math.Logic,vol 42, May 2104); in my chapter Transfinite Machine Models, in the same volume some particular facts about Kleene Recursion are summarized.) This does not say anything about "reverse mathematics" in this context, and indeed I don't see anything resembling it here. I don't know whether Richard Shore's set-up can be made to work here. 

Yes: an assumption like the one you quote for inaccessibles in L, namely $0^\sharp$. Instead you take a "mouse" i.e. an iterable structure, which has a measure of Mitchell order 1 as the topmost final measure. It is thus a structure N that has two measures with the same critical point, $\kappa$ say. As the second measure gives measure 1 to a set of smaller cardinals below $\kappa$ which are themselves measurable, if one takes a countable such N and iterates the second measure out $On$ many times, then this leaves behind an inner model M, which contains a class of measurable cardinals. Externally this class is cub beneath (and hence contains) all uncountable cardinals. The mouse N is then a $\sharp$ for the model M; the least such mouse with a measure of order 1 (in the canonical ordering of mice) is indeed countable and is known as ``$0^{sword}$'' in the literature. The assumption of its existence thus ensures the $\sharp$ of a model of the kind you ask for. (I have just noticed the ``even more'': if one wants higher Mitchell order measures on all uncountable cardinals, then one must assume the existence of mice themselves that have higher Mitchell order and the argument does the same. If one wants a model with uncountable $V-cardinals strong in the model, again this can be effected with the appropriate mouse where the topmost measures concentrates on strong cardinals. And so on and so forth.) 

There is no way to compute explicitly $\rho(\bigcup x)$ in terms of $\rho(x)$, in any meaningful fashion: e.g. (working in $L$) for arbitrarily large countable $\alpha$ there are reals $x\subseteq \omega$ with $\rho(x)$ a limit or successor greater than $\alpha$ but with $\rho(\bigcup x) =\omega$ of course. (Because for arbitrarily large such $\alpha$ there is a new real $x$ definable over $L_\alpha$. If $\alpha$ is not a successor, then there will always be a new real definable over $L_{\alpha +1 } $ too; for example the real that codes $L_\alpha$; similarly if $\alpha$ is not a limit there will in any case be a new real definable over $L_{\alpha + \omega}$.) Thus the gap between the two ranks under either assumption can be as wide as it could conceivably be. If $\rho(x)=\gamma+1$ then $\rho(\bigcup x)= \rho(x)$ can happen. Work in $L$: Suppose $x\subseteq \omega$ has $\rho(x)=\gamma +1$. Let $y = \{ \{u\} \mid u \in x \}$. Then $\rho(y)\leq\gamma +1 $; $\rho(\bigcup y) =\rho(x)$, but $\rho(y)\leq\gamma$ would imply that $\rho(x)\leq\gamma$.
