Pre-Sarbanes-Oxley it was common for CEOs to nominate the members of the board of directors of their firms. A sub-committee of the board would determine the CEO's compensation, so a CEO could choose people loyal to him (even employees working under the CEO) for the board and those people could boost his compensation. And if they did not do so, he might also ensure that board members that failed to boost his pay did not serve renewed terms. In addition, they could potentially ensure that even when performance was poor that the compensation was high. Sarbanes-Oxley, along with changes from the major US stock exchanges, required independent nominating and compensation committees for boards of directors. It is generally seen in the literature that these rule changes curtailed this practice. However, some dispute that this was ever an economically important channel for self-dealing. 

This is an example of what statistician Andrew Gelman calls "the fallacy of controlling for an intermediate outcome". Here is his description of this fallacy popping up when researchers ask if having more daughters changes your politics. The decision to have a second child is necessarily conditional on the previous decision to have the first child, and so seems like a clear example of controlling for decision variable that was endogenous. 

I agree with @AlecosPapadopoulos we want something like: $$ \Pr(p_{(1)} \leq p^*) = 1- \big [1-p^*\big]^K$$ But I don't see how $n$ and $M$ couldn't enter into the proper test statistic. For example, if the underlying data is normally distributed i.i.d. data then $N$ and $M$ do matter. Consider that noise mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$, which, by assumption is the same for the control and "treated" group. The mean of the treated group with size N will be distributed $N(\mu, \sigma^2 / n)$ and $N(\mu, \sigma^2 / M)$ for the control. So the difference in means will be distributed $$N(0, \sigma^2 / n + \sigma^2 / m)$$ But you won't know $\sigma$ or $\mu$, so we'll have to estimate it with $X_1$, $X_2$, and $s_{X_1X_2}$, and use a t-test. This setup gives a t-tatistic like this: $$t = \frac{\bar {X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{s_{X_1 X_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{m}}}$$ where $$s_{X_1X_2} = \sqrt{\frac{(n-1)s_{X_1}^2+(m-1)s_{X_2}^2}{n+m}}.$$ SRC: Student's t-test on Wikipedia The unpaired sample t-test for this difference in means has degrees of freedom $N-M-2$. Therefore the rejection region should depend on both n and m, both in what critical value of the test to use through the degrees of freedom of that test and the test statistic calculation itself. 

I recently read an excellent paper on the causes of high urban real estate prices in the United States, Why is Manhattan so expensive? Regulation and the rise in house prices (GLAESER, GYOURKO, and SAKS (2005)). In trying to understand if Manhattan’s regulatory tax can be justified they lay out three potential justifications for such a regulatory tax. 

US law restricts the Government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase only those residential mortgages smaller (by origination balance) than a limit, the "conforming loan limit". This limit is generally speaking fixed by the number of units in the residence and the year of origination (or purchase by the GSE). For example in 2015: 

Is that first claim right? I guess it depends what you mean by an income effect. Say your quasi-linear utility form is: $$U(x,v) = x + \ln(v)$$ Say $P_v = P_x=1$ and so for wealth $w = P_v\cdot v + P_x \cdot x = x + v$. If $0<w\leq 1$ the household strictly prefers to buy $v$ to $x$ and buys no $x$ but $w>1$ is then exclusively $x$ is purchased beyond that. So demand for $x$ looks like this: $$w<1: x^* = 0$$ $$w<1: v^* = w$$ $$w\geq1: x^* = w-1$$ $$w\geq1: v^* = 1$$ So the marginal demand for $x/v$ depends on $w$. 

Why Labor’s Share of Income Is Falling By Jared Bernstein Therefore, if the economy $Y$ grows at a rate $g$ and the capital income is roughly $Y/3$ then it too must be growing at rate $g$. If discount rates $r$ are also constant this implies that wealth is $\frac{Y}{3(g-r)}$ which also grows at rate $g$. Now it turns out that discounts rates are not constant and have been in long term decline, and as long as this is the case the value of the capital and land assets of the economy can indeed grow faster than output does. The following figure, which depicts financial assets relative to GDP, doesn't fully capture this issue (it omits non-financial assets like much of real estate) but it is a decent approximation. 

Macroeconomic Uncertainty and Expected Stock Returns is a recent paper (Bali, Brown, and Tang (2015)) finds an economically important effect on uncertainty on returns. 

The Returns to English-Language Skills in India Here is a natural experiment that provides an example of the negative effect of the opening of labor markets on the existing population the new workers will compete with (in this case, the arrival of Russian mathematicians on Western mathematicians' wages and job prospects). 

Walrasian auction While Walrasian auctions are helpful for theoretical models and do exist in the real world(see for example the Tokyo's Grain Exchange), they are not the dominant mechanism for setting price changes. Competition among intermediaries seems vastly more common. In oranges, it might be the actions of wholesalers that attempting to pay the best price for farmer's inventories or supermarkets attempting to pay the best price for wholesaler inventories. If someone grows oranges for private consumption and never buys or sells any oranges then that production never gets detected and is not reflected in the price of oranges. With money it is more complex but fundamentally similar. Banks bid for money by setting the interest rate to attract funds. Firms bid for capital by offering to pay an interest rate to banks. Households decide how much money to hold and how much to invest or spend instead. If a miser has a billion in cash and burns it without telling anyone the market may indeed never find out. 

This will typically depend on if people can switch between the two markets. If switching is possible then the marginal worker has to be indifferent between working in market A and market B and this equalizes the wages in the two markets. This also assumes you mean wage rates and not wage bills. Wage bills also depend on hours worked per worker, and that decision need not be equal across industries because of sorting and other reasons. If people can't switch between markets it can, but doesn't have, to be that wages do not equalize. Consider two workers on two different islands with residents that don't trade or even meet. Even if labor markets on both islands were perfectly competitive, it needn't be that their wage rates were equalized. 

Pro Publica keeps an ongoing list of bailout recipients in the United States. Here is a report on the UK bailouts during the crisis: The Comptroller and Auditor General’s Report on Accounts to the House of Commons: The financial stability interventions The SoFFin Wikipedia page has a list of participating German institutions. FACTBOX - Bank bailouts around the world covers a few additional countries's bailouts between September 2008 and February 2009. A further update came in April of 2009 but it doesn't seem exhaustive. Page 28 of Stability Programme of the Netherlands April 2011 Update contains information on their biggest bailouts but I am unsure if it is exhaustive. The Spanish Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring appears to be the key Spanish bailout program. The FROB FAQ lists entities receiving FROB support but again, this may not be exhaustive. 

Faced with these issues, most well run countries, most of the time, would take functioning currency markets with the warts and wrinkles of speculators, volatility, and the like, over the downsides of trying to control the price of their own currency. 

Zerbe and Bellas (page 117-118): I say in general, because there are some evidence that "jobs are good for you", and if increasing jobs diminishes the number of long term unemployed, that might be considered a benefit, even though it diminishes the quantity of leisure and home production they consume. 

Another CBO paper, The Fiscal Multiplier and Economic Policy Analysis in the United States (Whalen and Reichling (2015), discusses an economic parameter at the heart of these estimates, the fiscal multiplier. 

From Euro To Neuro? But are there any modern examples of currency unions breaking up in an orderly manner with minimal economic disruption? I can think of some currency pegs that ended without major harm but I can't think of any actual unions that ended without doing so. The rubble union dissolving might not have been a huge deal but only because the other changes to the affected countries were enormous. Maybe the dissolution of the Scandinavian Monetary Union in 1914 would qualify but WWI loomed large in that decision. War, financial crises, and depression do see to be the most frequent fellow travelers with dissolution of currency unions. Perhaps that's not because dissolution is horrendous so much as it is a high risk, relatively low reward strategy that is only worth trying when things are already terrible. 

What about assuming a multiplicative error process and then using logs? Say the data generating process were a little different: $Y_i = \beta_0 \cdot X_i^{\beta_1}\cdot E_i$ If $Y_i = Z_i / P_i$ in truth but all we could really observe was: $\hat{P}_i = P_i \cdot \Gamma_i$, where $P_i$ was the true value and $\Gamma_i$ was a strictly positive measurement error. We' be estimating the following equation in practice: $\hat{Y}_i = Z_i / \hat{P}_i = \beta_0 \cdot X_i^{\beta_1}\cdot E_i$ take the logs of both sides (lower case letters are logs of individual variables): $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_i + \epsilon_i - \gamma_i$ If we define a variable $\xi_i = \epsilon_i - \gamma_i$ then we can have an equation $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_i + \xi_i$ that looks very much like the one you wrote above. If $\xi_i$ satisfies the same relationships with the log variables that $\epsilon_i$ does with the level variables it seems like everything should still work. 

In this paper, the first order conditions for capital and labor of the CES production function under cost minimization imply: $$ log(rk/wl) = -(1-\sigma)log(w/r) + (1-\sigma)log B + \sigma log (\alpha / (1-\alpha))$$ This doesn't seem to require any special non-linear estimation technique. 

The easiest generalization, of envy free sharing of a heterogeneous cake between two cake eaters is quite common. My family growing up frequently used the you divide and I choose method for sharing a lone piece of dessert. Depending on what you'd accept for "concrete example", Abraham and Lot use this method to divide the land of Canaan. A two-stage fair division problem was used in the partitioning of Germany after World War II. The Talmud has examples of fair division rules, which though are only thought experiments, are thought to have been applied in the Jewish diaspora over inheritance matters. I would also argue that the marriage / matching problems of Lloyd Shapley and Alvin Roth are a form of fair division, and one that scales to very large numbers of players and applies only to multiple, indivisible "cakes. Their methods have been used extensively in real world problems of school, job, and kidney assignment. 

There were plenty of relatively large purchases that were regular enough to buy with large amounts of cash. If you wanted to buy a Model T in 1909 you'd need \$825-\$1000. A typical house could easily cost a few thousand dollars in an age when mortgage finance was much less common. So there were plenty of expensive things to need significant cash for, at least occasionally. But why cash? The most important part of the answer is bounced checks. If you need to pay someone a lot of money by check you have problem. If Abby gives Betty a check and Abby walks off with the goods and the check bounces, Betty will have a problem. If Abby pays Betty but doesn't give Abby the goods until the check clears, Abby may have a problem if Betty never shows up with the goods after the check clears. You can do escrow, but that's expensive and complicated. Cash allows instantaneous settlement. Other options existing in this era have other problems. Cashier's and certified checks, as well as money orders may serve in some cases, but don't easily allow negotiation because they denomination is fixed at the time of issuance. Wire transfers have existed since the age of the telegraph but like today remain an expensive technology for everyday use. Hundred dollar bills are the (update: second) most common denomination today, which may surprise you: 

The Stata documentation for the vector error-correction models also seems to roughly follow this approach but it looks like it is automated under the varsoc function and additionally the AIC, HQIC, and SBIC are all generated programmatically. 

Hedonic regression on Wikipedia The BLS has a nice fully worked example about using this method to price changes in the quality of camcorders. They explore how brand, storage format, image stabilization, weight, and other features influence the price in order to capture how changes in the value of camcorders influences substitution in consumption decisions. 

The reserve requirement on deposits ensures that (for a given $reserve\ requirement(\%)$ and $deposits(\$)$): $$loans(\$) \leq deposits(\$) \cdot (1 - reserve\ requirement(\%))$$ Fully loaned up means that this holds with equality: $$ loans(\$) = deposits(\$) \cdot (1 - reserve\ requirement(\%)) $$ 

Question 1: Why are we taking the logarithm? (mathematically and economically) The log function is a concave function so that an agent would prefer to get the utility of the average payoff to the average of the utilities of the actual payoff. Linear utility is not concave and so they are indifferent between these two offers. 

The Flow of Funds (Financial Accounts of the United States) should have what you need. For example, table B.1 Net National Wealth Table Description Table (Billions of dollars; amounts outstanding end of period, not seasonally adjusted) might be very close to what you want. 

Risk aversion interacting with the tax code I've heard it argued (but not empirically substantiated) that because government positions generally offer very low risk of job loss they attract risk adverse people. All other things equal, relatively risk adverse people like relatively generous insurance and have a greater precautionary savings motive against negative shocks. Because retirement savings, health insurance, and to a lesser extent, life insurance have tax advantages when purchased through the employer, this risk aversion would interact with the tax advantage to induce a high level of retirement savings, health, and life insurance. Disability insurance is not tax advantaged, but employer-run plans do help solve some of the adverse selection problems associated with stand alone disability plans and so they too have an incentive to be employer provided and more generous in government positions for similar reasons. Is this true when we control for worker attributes? That all said, I'll echo @rocinante's point that among some sub-populations of workers, it isn't clear that government benefits are particularly extensive. My reading of the Are government employees overpaid? literature is that highly educated or skilled government workers do not typically appear overpaid (in a Mincer regression residual sense) relative to their private sector counterparts, and this includes measures of income and benefits. And elite financial and IT firms are often famous for their lavish benefits of meals, profit sharing, and low cost health care. However, part of the story there is that wages are higher in those fields and benefits are generally increasing in wages (if only because so are the tax advantages). It may be surprising to hear this but the average education and age of a public sector worker is substantially higher than in the private sector, explaining some of the higher wages and higher benefits. Lack of incentives for cost control So while it may well be true that, as @kbelder says, public sector employers have less of an incentive to hold down benefits, they have less of an incentive to hold down wages too, at least in conventional wisdom government employee benefits are more different from private sector benefits than the wages are, so that leaves us with a remaining puzzle beyond poor cost containment incentives. Solving turnover, training and other HR problems @rocinante's point about turnover is also a good one. We can think of the employee-employer relation as a sort of investment that pays returns while employment persists. Any situation where the initial employer investment (e.g., in training, background checks, customized equipment) is large relative to the immediate payout is one in which the employer is going to want to incentivise the employee to stick around until that investment is repaid. Pensions, which back-load compensation have a powerful incentivizing effect towards retaining staff under these circumstances. Similarly, when positions require idiosyncratic human capital (extensive expertise and training not useful for other employers), this makes the employee strongly value continuing the employee relationship, and if government employers particularly require this sort of expertise (say maintaining ICBMs) then employment protection benefits may be another efficient way to attract staff without paying higher wages. Political economy: unions and politicians Finally, two more reasons from a political economy angle. First, unions may not just get better benefits because they have more power and influence but also because the people who run unions wish greater power and influence. To those ends, higher wages give them less than retirement and benefits programs which require wealth and staffing to be run by the union. Second, benefits, particularly defined benefit pensions, can be opaque in their true costs. Since politicians have to answer in elections to the public, HR strategies that please government employees (like high defined benefit pensions) but appear to be low cost to the public (again like high defined benefit pensions) therefore are relatively attractive to the politicians that administer the government.
