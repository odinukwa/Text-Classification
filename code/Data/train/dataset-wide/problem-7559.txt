In response to Anton for a uniform proof of your formula: note that $K\backslash KaK\cong(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)\backslash K$. Let $\pi:K\rightarrow G(\mathbb{F}_q)$ be the natural quotient map, $K_1:=\ker(\pi)$ and $P:=\pi(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)$. Then $P$ is the $\mathbb{F}_q$-points of the parabolic subgroup of $G$ determined by the walls that $a$ lies on. We have $$|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)\backslash K|=|P\backslash G(\mathbb{F}_q)|\cdot|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash K_1|.$$ Let $\mathfrak{K}$ be the Lie algebra of $K$ and likewise for $\mathfrak{K}_1$. Choose Haar measures for the group and Lie algebra so that $\mu(K_1)=\mu(\mathfrak{K}_1)$. Since $a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1$ and $K_1$ are open compact, we have $|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash K_1|=\mu(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash\mu(K_1)=\mu(a^{-1}\mathfrak{K}a\cap\mathfrak{K}_1)\backslash\mu(\mathfrak{K}_1)=|(a^{-1}\mathfrak{K}a\cap\mathfrak{K}_1)\backslash \mathfrak{K}_1|$. Identifying $a$ as an element in the positive Weyl chamber in the cocharacter lattice, the last term is $q$ to the power of $\sum_{\alpha\in\Phi^+}\max(\langle a,\alpha\rangle-1,0)$, while the roots of $P$ are those $\alpha\in\Phi$ with $\langle a,\alpha\rangle\le 0$. 

Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a complete discrete valuation field with perfect residue field (or just a non-arch local field). Let $\mathcal{B}$ be its reduced Bruhat-Tits building, and $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ the distance function on $\mathcal{B}$. I am wondering if the following statement is true: There exists a constant $C$ such that for any compact element $x\in G$ (i.e. $\{x^n|n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ is contained in a compact subgroup), and any $p_1, p_2\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $x.p_1=p_2$, there exists $p_0\in\mathcal{B}$ with $$x.p_0=p_0,\;d(p_0,p_1)\le C\cdot d(p_1,p_2).$$ What I actually want is have an explicit $C$ in terms of $G$. For example, I'll guess that $C$ can be bounded by a constant multiple of the rank of $G$. E.g. when the rank is $1$ the assertion is true for $C=\frac{1}{2}$. 

(Editted: a "weaker" example about $GL_3$ at the end) If I didn't make a mistake in my computation, then the second question doesn't hold for $G=Sp_4$, as it doesn't hold for any $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Allow me to use $F$ as my p-adic field and $k$ its residue field. Let $V/_F$ be spanned by $e_2,e_1,f_1,f_2$ with the symplectic form $(e_i,f_j)=\delta_{ij}$, $(e_i,e_j)=(f_i,f_j)=0$, so that we identify $G(F)=Sp(V)$. The hyperspecial vertices on the building correspond to self-dual lattices of $V$. Let $T$ be the diagonal torus which acts on $V$ by $(c_1,c_2):e_i\mapsto c_ie_i, f_i\mapsto c_i^{-1}f_i$. Let $\pi\in\mathcal{O}_F$ be a fixed uniformizer. Consider the lattices $$\Lambda_{a,b}=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_2+\pi^{-1} e_1+\pi^{-2}af_1+\pi^{-3}bf_2, e_1+\pi^{-1}f_1+\pi^{-2}(a-1)f_2,f_1-\pi^{-1}f_2,f_2\rangle,$$ where we let $a,b$ runs over a fixed set of representatives of $k$ in $\mathcal{O}_F$. One checks that all $\Lambda_{a,b}$ are in different $T(F)$-orbits by essentially showing that they are in different $T(\mathcal{O}_F)$-orbits. Next one compute the stabilizer of $\Lambda_{a,b}$. What's necessary then is to check the following: Claim. (1) $\text{Stab}_{T(\mathcal{O}_F)}(\Lambda_{a,b})\supset T_3=T(1+\pi^3\mathcal{O}_F)$. (2) If $ab+b-a+1\not\in\pi\mathcal{O}_F$, then $\text{Stab}_{T(\mathcal{O}_F)}(\Lambda_{a,b})\subset T_2=T(1+\pi^2\mathcal{O}_F)$. However, there are only $q+3$ ($q=\#k$) subgroups between $T_2$ and $T_3$. In other words, we have $q^2-q+1$ such lattices, but only $q+3$ possible choices for stabilizers for them; an open compact subgroup of $T(F)$ have to correspond to about $O(q)$ orbits. Note. I did some brute force (using Iwasawa decomp.) and it seems that such an assertion holds for $GL_3$ in most or all cases of $GL_3$. However it also seems to me that if one fix a (semisimple) split rank, then it will be difficult for similar assertion to holds for larger $\dim(G)$; in other words, I'd say such an assertion probably only holds for $GL_n$ (and not for any other classical groups or non-split groups), if it does. -- Editted: Here is an example about $GL_3$ where things fail. Let $T$ again be the diagonal torus. Let $a>0$ be any integer. Consider the two lattices in $F^3$ $$\Lambda_a=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_1+\pi^{-a}e_2+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_2,e_3\rangle$$ $$\Lambda_a'=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_1+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_2+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_3\rangle$$ These two lattices correspond to two hyperspecial vertices which are not in the same $T(\mathcal{O}_F)$-orbit and thus $T(F)$-orbit. But they have the same stabilizer $Z(F)\cdot T(1+\pi^a\mathcal{O}_F)$. This is however a weaker example because in this case a stabilizer correspond to $2$ orbits. It's probably the case that for $GL_3$ every possible stabilizer corresponds to at most $2$ orbits, but I have no good intuition about why it should be true. (Note that the number of orbits with distant $r$ from the apartment no longer have a uniform bound independent of $p$.) 

Using some basic facts about Euler products it follows that $S(x)\in O(x^{1/2+\epsilon})$, $\epsilon>0$, but can $\epsilon$ be replaced by something explicit? 

It seems to be that the simplicity of all the zeros is quite widely accepted as a working hypotheses, and it is known that a positive proportion are as such. Titchmarsh explains in the last chapter on RH that the weak Mertens hypothesis, $M(x)=O(x^{1/2})$, implies that all zeros are simple. Though I think this is conjectured to be false by many authors. Is there a weaker bound whose optimality is known to imply that not all zeros are simple? Given the classical estimate $N(\sigma, T)=O(T^{4\sigma(1-\sigma)+\epsilon})$ combined with the fact that the number of solutions to $\zeta(s)=z$ in any rectangle of height $T$ contained in $1/2\leq \sigma\leq 1$ is proportional to $T$, for any $z\neq 0$, simplicity of the zeros suggests that the derivative must vanish vastly more frequently in each such rectangle else one could presumably tie the number of such solutions to the number of zeros up to height $T$, for all sufficiently small $|z|$, by Rouche's theorem. One might therefore conjecture that $ \inf|\rho_{\zeta}-\rho_{\zeta'}|=0$ (is this known perhaps?). An old theorem of MacDonald (Whittaker and Watson, p131) says that the number of zeros of an analytic function on the interior of a simple closed curve on which the modulus of $f$ is constant exceeds that of it's derivative by one. It can also be seen that the derivative necessarily vanishes on the largest such curve by the open and inverse mapping theorems. In the case of $\zeta(s)$ I'd expect that the largest of such curves around each zero would become small for large $T$, so I wonder if something in this direction is known? Anyway, as Titchmarsh points out, $\Omega$-theorems for $M(x)$ seem to be more difficult to obtain than those for the prime counting functions and, since a significant distinction between the problems is that of the order of the zeros, I would like to enquire specifically about anything that is known in either direction, on any other hypotheses. 

So the question is that, over a finite field, does there exist an abelian variety $A$ for which there does not exist a generically one-to-one morphism from a hyperelliptic curve $C$ to $A$. p.s. A result of Oort and de Jong proved that a "generic" abelian variety satisfies this property. However it seems generic means outside a countable subfamily in their result. I'm interested in this question because if we assume all motives over a finite field is semisimple (or just semisimplify it), then by Weil conjecture and Honda-Tate (maybe also Tate's conjecture over finite field), such motive all live in the tensor category of that of abelian varieties, or equivalently that of curves. I am then wondering if there could be any chance that they all actually come from hyperelliptic curves. 

Let $G$ be a (connected) reductive group over some ground field $F$ and $G^*$ its unique quasi-split inner form. Denote by $\operatorname{rank}_F G$ the split rank of $G$, i.e. the dimension of a maximal $F$-split torus in $G$, and likewise for $G^*$. Is it true that $$\operatorname{rank}_F G\le \operatorname{rank}_FG^*$$ with equality holds only if $G$ is isomorphic to $G^*$? For example, this will say that among unitary group that splits over a fixed separable quadratic extension $E/F$, the quasi-split one has the largest split rank (which is $\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ for $U_n$), and is the only unitary group that achieves this split rank. For split groups this result will be obvious. I am mostly wondering about the case when $F$ is a non-archimedean local field (for Local Langlands, where the same Langlands parameter can be attached representations of both $G$ and $G^*$), but any suggestion/reference will be great. Thanks! 

Lusztig defined (in Sec. 5, also Sage) a Springer action of the affine Weyl group on the homology of affine Springer fibers (Iwahori one, i.e. in an affine flag variety). In the regular semisimple unramified case, Goresky, Kottiwtz and MacPherson had a formula (14.4) for this action assuming the homology is pure, for example in the equal valuation case, where they said 

Continued from my earlier post: I would therefore suggest approaching it in the ``counting domain'' as follows: from the explicit definition of the coefficients given by GH above, you can easily see that your Dirichlet series in the case $n=1$ is $$\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{n=n_i^{k_i}(n)}\log n_i(n)\right)\frac{1}{n^s\log n}=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{\log\prod_{i}n_i(n)}{n^s\log n}.$$ From here you get $$I(x)=\sum_{n\leq x}\frac{\log\prod_{i}n_i(n)}{\log n}.$$ 

If you've investigated the error in Perron's formula in general, you've probably noticed that Cesaro summation $$\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{n\leq x} \left(1-\frac{\log n}{\log x}\right)\frac{a_n}{n^s}$$ sometimes works on the abscissa of convergence of the ordinary Dirichlet series. Let $\rho=\beta+i\gamma$ denote non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$. By truncating the integral representation and estimating the tail, one can prove that for $\sigma\geq \sup \beta $ we have $$\sum_{n\leq x} \left(1-\frac{\log n}{\log x}\right)\frac{\Lambda(n)-1}{n^s}=-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}-\zeta(s)+O\left(\frac{1}{\log x}\right)$$ except when $s=\rho$, at which points the sum diverges like $\log x$. I have seen some graphs of the partial sums when $s=1/2+it$ compared with $$-\frac{\zeta'(1/2+it)}{\zeta(1/2+it)}-\zeta(1/2+it)$$ and the results are quite compelling. However, if the Riemann hypothesis is false, divergent terms of modulus $$\frac{x^{\beta-1/2}}{\log x |\gamma-t|}$$ must be added for every zero with $\beta>1/2$, and these will only show up on a graph with sufficiently many terms, or for sufficiently large $t$. Worse still, if there is a conspiracy between the imaginary ordinates of zeros not on the line, these terms may not show up until later. My question is as follows: 

Specifically, if $\rho$ is such that $\zeta(\rho)=0$ and $\max_{\rho}\Re(\rho)= \Theta$, can anything interesting be said about the number/distribution of zeros on the vertical line $\sigma=\Theta$? Clearly this question is almost as hypothetical as they get, so I welcome conditional answers (though not on RH please), consequences of the Bohr-Landau theorem, consequences of the known behavior of $\zeta(s)$ in the critical strip, etc. Maybe you know something along the lines of ``If there are finitely/ infinitely many, then...''? I am also interested in why your answer may simply be ``No.'' 

Let $Li_s(z)$ denote the usual polylogarithm. The elementary functional equation $$Li_{-n}(z)=(-1)^{n-1}Li_{-n}(1/z)$$ holds for $n\geq 1$. I remember only that the proof used some reproducing property of the Stirling numbers of the second kind. This functional equation is rather useful because, taking linear combinations, it amounts to saying that a meromorphic function having a power series on the open unit disc whose coefficients are the values of a polynomial $f$ of degree $d$ evaluated at integer arguments: $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}f(k)z^k=\frac{1}{(1-z)^{d+1}}\sum_{k=0}^{d}\left(\sum_{j=0}^k{d+1\choose j}(-1)^jf(k-j)\right)z^k$$ is defined for $|z|>1$ by the series $$-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f(-k)z^{-k}.$$ 

I think the following is true, but haven't came up with a proof myself. Thanks in advance! Let $G$ be a semisimple (to avoid more words) algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$. Write $F=\mathbb{C}((t))$ and $\mathcal{O}=\mathbb{C}[[t]]$. Is it true that a maximal solvable Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}(F)$ that is also a finitely generated $\mathcal{O}$-module must be an Iwahori subalgebra? In other words, is it true that all such Lie subalgebras are conjugate? (feel free to replace $F$ by your favorite non-archimedean local field) 

This could well be a question for reading suggestion. Hope it's not too bad and thanks a lot. So the question is as in the title. What are the relations between the notion of unipotent cuspidal representations of $G(\mathbb{F}_q)$, and that of cuspidal local systems as in generalized Springer theory, if any? For example, I notice that for classical groups of type $\mathbf{C}$, there exists a cuspidal local system for $\mathbf{C}_n$ iff there exists a unipotent cuspidal representations for $\mathbf{C}_{2n}$. Same for type $\mathbf{D}$. (For type $\mathbf{B}$, while there exist cuspidal local systems for $\mathrm{SO}_{n^2}$ and $\mathrm{SO}_{(n+1)^2}$, there exists a unipotent cuspidal representations for $SO_{n^2+(n+1)^2}$.) This doesn't look like coincidence to me. Though by the time of the 1977 paper of Lusztig on representations of finite classical groups, he hasn't invented generalized Springer theory yet... 

This is an (not satisfying) attempt of myself. Say a vector $v\in V$ is semisimple if its $G$-orbit is closed. Say two vectors $v_1,v_2\in V$ commute if there exists $c\in\bar{k}^{\times}$ such that $\mathrm{Stab}_G(v_1+cv_2)=\mathrm{Stab}_G(v_1)\cap\mathrm{Stab}_G(v_2)$. Define a Cartan subspace to be a subspace $S\subset V$ of commuting semisimple elements such that the map $S\hookrightarrow V\twoheadrightarrow V/\!/G$ is finite and surjective. Such Cartan subspaces aren't all conjugate for $\mathrm{SL}_3\curvearrowright\mathrm{Sym}^2(std)\bigoplus\mathrm{Sym}^2(std)$ (though for my own purpose it's fine here). They don't exist for $\mathbb{G}_m\curvearrowright\mathbb{G}_a^{\otimes2}\bigoplus \mathbb{G}_a\bigoplus \mathbb{G}_a^{\otimes-1}$. 

This is an attempt to give a family of counterexamples, somewhat following Victor Protsak's comment. The basic idea is: let $\phi:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4$ be a generic Langlands parameter. Then I think $\phi^{Sp_4}:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4\subset SO_5$ should be usually generic, while $\phi^{GL_5}:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4\subset SO_5\subset GL_5$ is always non-generic as it factors through $GL_4\subset GL_5$. How do we really find such an $\phi$? I am not familiar with the LLC for $Sp_4$ at all, but there are examples that can work. Here is one: let $p\not=2$, $T$ be a two-dimensional unramified anisotropic torus, and $\chi:T\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^{\times}$ a tamely ramified character that is "in general position." By LLC for tori we get $\phi_{\chi}:W_F'\rightarrow {}^LT$. One can embed ${}^LT\subset W_F\times SO_4\subset W_F\times SO_5$, so that $\phi_{\chi}^{Sp_4}$ is generic; it will be a Langlands parameter corresponding to the depth-zero supercuspidals of DeBacker and Reeder. 

I am interested in those $s\in S$ which also have a particular property $P$ say, and it turns out that for this subset one also has: 

It is claimed on it's Wikipedia page that Euler's function, defined by the infinite product $\prod_1^\infty(1-q^n)$ for $|q|<1$, cannot be analytically continued outside the unit disc, that is, the unit disc is a natural boundary of the function. Unfortunately no proof is referred to. I would like to know how this claim is proved, as it appears to me that it is defined uniquely for $|q|>1$. 

The answer is that $l=0$, so the power series does not converge. This is not necessarily because there are poles arbitrarily close to the critical line yet not on it; it is because there are, somewhere on the critical line, poles that are arbitrarily close together. Indeed, Littlewood has shown that the sequence of differences of the imaginary parts $(\gamma_n)$ of the zeros of $\zeta(s)$, that is, the sequence $|\gamma_{n+1}-\gamma_{n}|\rightarrow 0$. Thus, since there are infinitely many zeros, there are infinitely many $\rho$ such that $$\limsup\sqrt[n]{|l_n(\rho)|}>C$$ for any positive constant $C$, so the sequence $s(n)$ is unbounded. I should add that my statement that the radius of convergence of the power series measures only horizontal distance was clearly incorrect. 

There are several recent results on non-trivial bounded functions $f$ that are orthogonal, i.e. $$\sum_{n\leq x} \mu(n)f(n)=o(x),$$ to the Mobius function $\mu(n)$. These include the results of Green and Tao on Nilsequences (which includes information on the history of the problem) and Green on bounded depth circuits. The lecture notes by Peter Sarnak on Mobius randomness is an interesting overview of the subject. Sarnak mentions there that it is easy to construct counter examples, or examples which decay very slowly. Of course, its easy to do so if $f$ is sparsely supported or has partial sums that are the inverse Mellin transform of a function having positive powers of $\zeta(s)$ as factors.
