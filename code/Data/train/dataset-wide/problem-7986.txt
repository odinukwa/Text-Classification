Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a countable transitive model of set theory, and consider HOD (the hereditarily ordinal definable elements of $\mathfrak{M}$). Let $x$ be an object $x \in HOD$. So $x$ is hereditarily definable from ordinals. Can we find a defining formula $\psi(x)$ of $x$ such that $\psi(x)$ contain only quantifiers ranging over the ordinals? PS: by "ranging over ordinals" I mean a quantifier $Qy$ where either we have the restriction $Qy$($y$ is an ordinal ...) or that $Qy \in \alpha$ where $\alpha$ is an ordinal. Edit: After Emil's comment, I am going to allow quantification over elements $y$ such that $y \in x$. The reason for this change is that in the application I have in mind we can allow this. And, yes, we can allow also arbitrary bounded quantifiers. 

$\mathcal{M}$ contains $\omega_1$ and $\omega_1^\mathcal{M}=\omega_1$, so in particular it contains all countable sequences of integers; $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies the theory $T$; $\mathcal{M}$ is well-founded and transitive. 

Consider the full Solovay model $N=M[G]$ of set theory. Let HOD be the set of hereditarily ordinal definable elements of $M[G]$. It is known that in $N$ every set of reals definable from ordinals and reals is Baire measurable. My question is: In HOD, is every set definable from ordinals and reals (in HOD) Baire measurable? (i.e. is the property that a definable set is Baire measurable preserved by passage from $N$ to HOD?). If we consider also HOD(HOD) does the same remain true? Edit: I rephrase my question to be: is there a model of set theory $M$ such that in HOD$^{M[G]}$ every set of reals definable from ordinals and reals is Baire measurable? Can we find a model of set theory in which HOD, HOD(HOD) etc.. all satisfy the same property above? 

Suppose that the family $\mathrm{RO}(X)$ of regular open subsets of $(X,\mathscr{O})$ is a basis of $X$. Let the density of $\mathrm{RO}(X)$ (considered as boolean algebra) be $\aleph_0$. Does $X$ have to be second-countable? If not, what if we add regularity of $X$ (both $T_1$ and $T_3$ separation axioms)? If answers to both questions are negative, what is the maximal cardinality (relative to $|X|$) of the set of points not covered by dense countable $D\subseteq\mathrm{RO}(X)$? 

Yet another example may be some systems of modal logic with the rule of necessitation: $$\frac{\varphi}{\square\varphi}$$ $\varphi\rightarrow\square\varphi$ usually is NOT a thesis of such systems. 

A frame is a complete lattice $\langle L,\mathord{\leqslant}\rangle$ which satisfies the following distributivity law: $$a\wedge\bigvee_{i\in I}b_i=\bigvee_{i\in I}a\wedge b_i\,.$$ A frame homomorphism is a mapping $h\colon L_1\rightarrow L_2$ which preserves finite operations and such that $h(\bigvee_{i\in I}b_i)=\bigvee_{i\in I}h(b_i)$. Every frame is a complete Heyting algebra, yet frame homomorphisms do not generally preserve Heyting implication. Could you please give me an example of such homomorphism? 

I think that an example much in the spirit of the original question is one of proofs of the fact that Tychonnoff Theorem for compact spaces entails existence of choice functions. To show this for an arbitrary family of non-empty sets $(R_i)_{i\in I}$ we consider an object $x\notin\bigcup_{i\in I}R_i$ and the family of compact spaces $\mathscr{O}_i=\{\emptyset,\{x\},R_i^x\}$ with $R_i^x=R_i\cup\{x\}$. Each of the spaces is compact, so $\prod_{i\in I}R^x_i$ is compact by TT. Thus to show that some $f\colon I\rightarrow\bigcup_{i\in I}R_i$ exists it is enough to show that the family of closed sets $\{\pi^{-1}_i[R_i]\mid i\in I\}$ has finite intersection property. Taking $R_{i_1},\ldots,R_{i_k}$ we define $g\colon I\rightarrow \bigcup_{i\in I}R_i^x$ by: $g(i)\in R_i$ in case $i_1\leqslant i\leqslant i_k$, and $g(i)=x$ otherwise. It follows that $g\in\pi^{-1}_{i_1}[R_{i_1}]\cap\ldots\cap\pi^{-1}_{i_k}[R_{i_k}]$. So there is $f\in\prod_{i\in I}R_i$. So, it is a bit like adding a camel to ensure that given any finite collection of flocks of camels we can find its respective representatives, and afterwards taking the camel away and conclude that any flock of camels from a given family of flocks can be represented by exactly one camel. 

Assume we have a countable transitive model of set theory which satisfies some set of first-order axioms $T$. Is it possible to get from this a model $\mathcal{M}$ of set theory which satisfies the following: 

The meager sets are sets which are union of $\lambda$ nowhere dense sets where $\lambda < \kappa$ and $\kappa$ is the cardinality of the space. If we consider a model of ZFC $\mathfrak{M}$ in which every (suitably definable) set of reals have the property of Baire, then every (suitably definable) set of a suitably defined toplogical space have the "generalized" Baire property. 

I read somewhere about the hyperuniverse of countable transitive models of ZFC ($URL$ It states an assumption, namely that every real is a member of some countable transitive model of ZFC. Is there some way to prove this assumption (assuming the hyperuniverse is not empty), or rather the (seemingly stronger) one: Every finite set of reals is a member of a ctm? 

In Solovay paper, "A model of set theory in which every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable", he cites in the end a theorem 4.1 (generalization of results), which says, roughly that in $\mathfrak{N}_1$ (the Solovay model), for $X$ a complete separable metric space, then every set $A \subset X$ has the property of Baire and other properties. Is it possible to deduce a theorem which would be like: in $\mathfrak{N}=\mathfrak{M}[G]$(the full Solovay model) every set $A \subset X$ definable from a countable sequence of ordinals has the property of Baire? Edit: This question remains unanswered, but I would like to add one detail to it: $X$ the complete separable metric space may not have a "definable" topology, so the basic open sets may not be definable from a countable sequence of ordinals. Does the same remark in the comments below still hold though? Further Edit: What happens in the case where the topology and the metric of $X$ are definable from ordinals and $X$, in the sense that the metric is definable by a formula whose parameters are ordinals and $X$? 

Call a topological space $\langle X,\mathscr{O}\rangle$ regular iff it is both $T_0$ and $T_3$: for every point $x\notin A$, where $A$ is a closed subsets of $X$, there are open and disjoint sets $V$ and $U$ such that $x\in V$ and $A\subseteq U$. A $\langle X,\mathscr{O}\rangle$ space is linear-based iff in every its point there is a local basis which is linearly ordered by $\subseteq$ relation. Could you give me an example of a regular space which is not linear-based? 

Consider first-order theory (with identity) of Peano Artithmetic built in the language $\{S,+,\times,0\}$ and with the following set of axioms: \begin{align} \neg Sx&=0\tag{1}\\\ Sx=Sy&\rightarrow x=y\tag{2}\\\ x+0&=x\tag{3}\\\ x+S(y)&=S(x+y)\tag{4}\\\ x\times 0&=0\tag{5}\\\ x\times S(y)&=(x\times y)+x\tag{6} \end{align} plus the full induction schema. Let $PA^{(-1)}$ be the subtheory of $PA$ (first-order Peano Arithmetic) which has all other axioms except for (1), similarly $PA^{(-2)}$ let be the subtheory without (2). It is rather easy, but nevertheless interesting, result that both this theories have finite models, $PA^{(-1)}$ even has the degenerate one-element model. My question is: has any research been made towards characterization of class of models of the theories above? If yes, could please someone provide me with suitable information? I am particularly interested in finite models. EDIT: Following J.D. Hamkins advice I explicitly stated the language and the axiomatization I am interested in. 

I consider an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero $F$ as a vector space over a real closed field $R \subset F$. I would like to define a norm on $F$ in an invariant fashion, i.e. if we consider another real closed subfield $R' \subset F$ then the norm would still be equivalent to the norm defined taking $R$. More precisely, for instance for $\mathbb{C}$ we have the norm $N(z)=a^2 +b^2$ where $z=a+ib$, $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$. If we consider $R' \subset \mathbb{C}$ then the same $z \in \mathbb{C}$ will be written as $z=a'+jb'$, $a', b' \in R'$ and $R'$ is a real closed field of index 2 in $\mathbb{C}$. Is the norm $N'(z)=a'^2+b'^2$ equivalent to $N$? 

Given two real closed fields $R_1$ and $R_2$ such that both have cardinality continuum, archimedean, but not necessarily complete. Assume further that they are back and forth equivalent (in the language of rings). Under which conditions can we get that they are isomorphic? Isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$? 

Let $M$ be a saturated model of a theory $T$ in a first-order language $\mathcal{L}$, and let $N$ be a submodel of $M$. Is it possible to have a substructure $A\neq N$ of $M$ such that $N \subset A \subset M$ and every element of $A$ is definable by a formula in $L$ with parameters from $N$? 

I am looking for an example of topological spaces $\langle X_1,\mathscr{O}_1\rangle$ and $\langle X_2,\mathscr{O}_2\rangle$ such that there is a homomorphism $h\colon\mathrm{r}\mathscr{O}_1\longrightarrow\mathrm{r}\mathscr{O}_2$ between the algebras of regular open sets of respective spaces which fails to preserve the information about nearness of sets, in the sense that there are $x,y\in\mathrm{r}\mathscr{O}_1$ such that: $$ \mathrm{Cl}\,x\cap \mathrm{Cl}\,y\neq\emptyset\qquad\text{yet}\qquad \mathrm{Cl}\,h(x)\cap \mathrm{Cl}\,h(y)=\emptyset\,. $$ By regular open I mean a set $x$ which is equal to the interior of its closure: $x=\mathrm{Int\,Cl\,}x$. Similalrly, I am also interested in the dual example in which: $$ \mathrm{Cl}\,x\cap \mathrm{Cl}\,y=\emptyset\qquad\text{yet}\qquad \mathrm{Cl}\,h(x)\cap \mathrm{Cl}\,h(y)\neq\emptyset. $$ I will be grateful for help. 

Edit After Andreas Blass answer below and comments below the original post I have changed it to accommodate posters' remarks. I hope it is clear and makes more sense now. Let $\mathrm{PA}$ be the first-order Peano Arithmetic with full induction schema. Let $\mathrm{Con(PA)}$ be the standard $\Pi_1$ consistency statement for $\mathrm{PA}$. By the 2nd Incompleteness Theorem we know that $\mathrm{PA}\nvdash \mathrm{Con(PA)}$, if only $\mathrm{PA}$ is consistent. Therefore (assuming consistency of $\mathrm{PA}$) the theory $\mathrm{PA^+}=\mathrm{PA}+\neg\mathrm{Con(PA)}$ is consistent and has a model. This theory is $\omega$-inconsistent, since we know that no natural number codes a proof of, say, '$0=1$', therefore for every number $n$ we have that $\mathrm{PA}\vdash\neg\mathrm{Proof}(\overline{\ulcorner0=1\urcorner},\overline{n})$, where $\mathrm{Proof}(x,y)$ represents in $\mathrm{PA}$ recursive relation: $y$ codes a proof of a formula whose number is $x$; yet $\mathrm{PA^+}\vdash\exists y\,\mathrm{Proof}(\overline{\ulcorner0=1\urcorner},y)$. Thus in a model $\mathfrak{M}$ of $\mathrm{PA^+}$ there is a non-standard number which codes a proof of '$0=1$'. I have the following questions: 

Let $T$ be a countable first-order theory, and assume that $T$ has exactly one atomic model up to isomorphism in every uncountable cardinality. (By "atomic" I mean a model which omits the non-principal types). Now let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a countable transitive model of set theory, and assume that $T$ is also (countable) in $\mathfrak{M}$. Is the above property preserved in $\mathfrak{M}$? i.e. does it hold in $\mathfrak{M}$ that there exists only one atomic model of $T$ in every uncountable cardinality in $\mathfrak{M}$? 

In exercise 4 page 456 of Hodges "Model Theory" it is required to show that if an ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ is not $\omega_1$-complete, then every ultraproduct $\prod_I A_i/ \mathcal{U}$ has cardinality $< \omega$ or $\geq 2^\omega$. Does this suggest there can be ultraproducts $\prod_I A_i/ \mathcal{U}$ which have cardinality $\omega$ if we assume that the ultrafilter is (non-principal) $\omega_1$-complete? Is this possible? 

Shoenfield absoluteness is well known for $\Pi_2^1$-statements, but it does not hold between a countable transitive model of ZFC and the universe. But it is also known that $\Pi_1^1$ statements are absolute between a countable transitive model of set theory and the universe. My question is: Where can I find a good reference for the last fact?
