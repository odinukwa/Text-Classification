Alternatively there is a morphism from $\Delta$ to $\square_c$ that sends $[n]$ to $[n+1]$, degeneracies to connections $\Gamma^+$ and faces to faces $\partial^+$. This is just a way to say that in $\square_c$, $[1]$ is a monoid object. General considerations on Kahn extensions tell you that it induces a left-adjoin from simplicial sets to cubical sets with connections. I believe that is the same as teh construction given by @KarolSzumilo. There is also a dual construction obtained by considering the other monoidal structure on $[1]$, using $\Gamma^-$ and $\partial^-$. Finally this construction can be adapted if you work between augmented simplicial sets and cubical sets with connections. 

If $T$ is a monad on a category $\mathcal C$ and $T'$ is a monad on $T$-algebras, then (if I understand the answers of this question correctly) the adjunction between $\mathcal C$ and $T'$-algebras is not necessarily monadic. My question is: what happens if we make some additional assumption on $T'$? More precisely: let $\mathcal O$ be a (set-theoretic, non-symmetric) operad (typically, the "free monoid" operad), and assume that $T$-algebras come equipped with a biclosed monoidal structure. Is it always true that the adjunction between $\mathcal C$ and $\mathcal O$-algebras in $T$-algebras is monadic? 

The proof of Mac Lane's coherence theorem is fairly ad hoc. However, higher dimensional rewriting provides some general methods to prove coherence-like theorems. Using this, it is very easy to prove the coherence of "semigroup categories". See for example "Coherence in monoidal track categories", by Y. Guiraud and P. Malbos. 

I can think of two good examples. The first is rather straight forward. The hyper-operators. Namely, $$a \uparrow^n b : \mathbb{N}^3 \to \mathbb{N}$$ $$a \uparrow^0 b = a \cdot b$$ $$a \uparrow^n 1 = a$$ $$a \uparrow^{n} (a \uparrow^{n+1} b) = a \uparrow^{n+1} (b+1)$$ $$a \uparrow^{n+1} b = a \uparrow^n a \uparrow^n ...(b\,times)... \uparrow^n a$$ It is a rather interesting open problem to construct the same object in analysis. Namely, replace the $\mathbb{N}$'s with some domain in $\mathbb{C}$. Pivotally, tetration, or $e \uparrow^2 z$, is somewhat solved (though controversy exists as to which solution is the right solution). You can perceive the problem better with tetration. It's very easy to get $$e \uparrow^2 k = e^{e^{...k\,times...^e}}$$ which satisfies $$e^{e \uparrow^2 k} = e \uparrow^2 (k+1)$$ but how do we get holomorphic $e \uparrow^2 z$? Surely in this scenario the discrete instance inspired the continuous instance. Another one would be indefinite summation. Everyone knows that $$\sum_{j=1}^n f(j) = a(n)$$ is well defined, and satisfies $a(n) + f(n+1) = a(n+1)$, but how do we get holomorphic $$\sum_{j=1}^z f(j) = a(z)$$ where $a(z) + f(z+1) = a(z+1)$. Surely the discrete instance inspired the continuous instance, again. In fact, the whole field of study dedicating itself to extending recursive relationships defined on the naturals to the complex plane fits the bill of discrete before continuous very well. 

I thought of this in a more general setting though. I wondered if it happened for $e^{-y^2}$, does it work for other functions? It may be useful to explain the ad hoc arguments I had when I was younger. These arguments were a summation of identities which are satisfied by both expressions, which seems implausible if they weren't equal in some sense. I'll explain them in the obtuse language I used when I was a first year, as it is the best way I can think of framing it. Let $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ denote the following operators, $$\mathcal{I} \{f\} (x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(y)\frac{x^y}{\Gamma(y+1)}\,dy$$ $$\mathcal{S} \{f\} (x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f(n) \frac{x^n}{n!}$$ Also, let $Qf(x) = xf(x)$ and $Tf(x) = f(x+1)$. Then $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{I}$ behave identically under actions of the two operators. The following similar identities present evidence as to why these two operators may be equivalent in a good enough scenario. $$\mathcal{I}\{Tf\}(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\mathcal{I} \{f\} (x)$$ $$\mathcal{S} \{Tf\} (x) = \frac{d}{dx}\mathcal{S} \{f\} (x)$$ $$\mathcal{I}\{Qf\}(x) = Q\mathcal{I}\{Tf\}(x) = Q\frac{d}{dx}\mathcal{I} \{f\} (x)$$ $$\mathcal{S} \{Qf\} (x) = Q\mathcal{S} \{Tf\} (x) = Q\frac{d}{dx}\mathcal{S} \{f\} (x)$$ From these we also get $$Q \mathcal{I}\{f\}(x) = \mathcal{I}\{QT^{-1}f\}(x)$$ $$Q \mathcal{S}\{f\}(x) = \mathcal{S}\{QT^{-1}f\}(x)$$ From all this the question is simple, 

Let $p$ be a prime and let $C = \mathbb{F}_p^\times$. Then Gal$(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)/\mathbb{Q})$, where $\zeta_p$ is a primitive $p$th root of unity, may be identified with $C$ in the obvious way. Let $\theta_p$ and $J_p$ denote the Stickelberger element and the Stickelberger ideal in $\mathbb{Z}C$, respectively. The integral group ring $\mathbb{Z}C$ acts on the class group Cl$(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p))$ in the obvious way, and the classical Stickelberger's theorem says that $J_p$ annihilates Cl$(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p))$. Now say $K\neq \mathbb{Q}$ is an arbitrary number field such that $[K(\zeta_p):K]=p-1$. Then the discussion above still makes sense, but in general Cl$(K(\zeta_p))$ is not annihilated by $J_p$. Question: For a fixed $K\neq\mathbb{Q}$, is there always at least one prime $p$ such at Cl$(K(\zeta_p))$ is not annihilated by $J_p$? I think this is a difficult question. But any thoughts or references related to this would be appreciated. As a side note, this question came up as I was thinking about a problem on Galois module structure of rings of integers; they are related by the work of L.R. McCulloh. ADDED: For a fixed prime $p$, I think it is sufficient to show that there is a prime $\ell$ that divides the order of the minus class group of $K(\zeta_p)$ but not that of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$. Does anyone know anything about this? 

Let $K$ be a number field with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ and let $G$ be a finite abelian group. Elements in $KG$ may be regarded as maps on the character group $\widehat{G}$ of $G$ via $$\sum_{s\in G} \gamma_s s^{-1}\mapsto\left(\chi\mapsto \sum_{s\in G} \gamma_s \chi(s)^{-1}\right),$$ and this induces an isomorphism $$ KG \simeq \prod_{\psi} K(\psi)$$ of algebras. Here $\psi$ ranges over a set of representatives of $\widehat{G}$ under the action of the absolute Galois group of $K$, and $K(\psi)$ is the field $K$ ajoint with $\psi(s)$ for $s\in G$. Let $M$ denote the maximal $\mathcal{O}_K$-order in $KG$. Then $$ M \simeq \prod_{\psi} \mathcal{O}(\psi), $$ where $\mathcal{O}(\psi)$ is the ring of integers in $K(\psi)$, and so its locally free class group $$(*)\hspace{1em}\mbox{Cl}(M) \simeq \prod_{\psi}\mbox{Cl}(\mathcal{O}(\psi)).$$ Now, we have an idelic description for $\mbox{Cl}(M)$ given by $$\mbox{Cl}(M)\simeq \frac{J(KG)}{(KG)^\times U(M)},$$ where $J(KG)$ is the restricted direct product of $(K_vG)^\times$ with respect $(\mathcal{O}_{K_v}G)^\times$ as $v$ ranges over the (finite) primes in $K$, and $U(M) = \prod_v M_v^\times$. Regarding elements in $K_vG$ as maps on $\widehat{G}$, elements in $M_v$ are precisely whose images are algebraic units. There is a similar description for $\mbox{Cl}(\mathcal{O}(\psi))$ for each $\psi$. Question: How does one describe the isomorphism $(*)$ in terms of these idelic/Hom-descriptions of the class groups? If $K$ contains all $\exp(G)$th roots of unity, then this is easy. We can just map $(K_vG)^\times$ to $K_v^\times$ componentwise for each $v$. But otherwise, there are more primes involved idelic description of $\mbox{Cl}(\mathcal{O}_K)$ (one needs to range over all primes in $K(\psi)$). How does one take this into account? 

So I think I found a way of proving $F \neq G$ using distribution theory. I'm not the best at distribution theory, it's definitely not my field, but I think I'm doing something right. This is as much rigor as I can produce in distribution theory, but I think I'm on the right track. I don't have a referential brain for distribution theory, I'm going off what I can remember, I apologize if I'm not explicitly stating the theorems I'm using. This idea works generally as to why the continuous Taylor series can never equal the discrete Taylor series, but I'll be a bit cavalier. Maybe this argument works in more general cases, but one would need to know more about distribution theory to produce such a result, sadly I don't. Let's just use $e^{-y^2}$ to be explanatory. If we take $$F(a,x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-y^2} e^{-2\pi a y i} \frac{x^y}{\Gamma(y+1)}\,dy$$ Then we can look at the equivalency in a Fourier sense. Take the Poisson summation $$\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty F(n,x) = \sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-n^2} \frac{x^n}{n!} = \sum _{n=0}^\infty e^{-n^2} \frac{x^n}{n!}$$ which follows because $\frac{1}{n!} = 0$ for $n<0$. Now I'm not certain about the following interchange, but I'm fairly certain it should be allowed in good enough scenarios (especially with $e^{-y^2}$). $$\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty F(n,x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-y^2} e^{-2\pi i n y} \frac{x^y}{\Gamma(y+1)}\,dy = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \chi(y)e^{-y^2} \frac{x^y}{\Gamma(y+1)}\,dy$$ where $\chi$ is the dirac comb. This is kind of nothing new to what Christian Remling said, except I'm phrasing it distributionally, which is to our advantage as we add the Fourier transform. As least, if I've not mistaken myself. The above expression can be thought of as an inner product. If the discrete and continuous Taylor series equal each other, then $(\chi, h) = (1,h)$ or $(\chi -1, h) =0$, where $$h(y) = e^{-y^2}\frac{x^y}{\Gamma(y+1)}$$ I'm kind of out of my element right here, if I'm wrong, definitely correct me. Let $\mathcal{F}$ denote the Fourier Transform. Let $\delta$ denote the dirac $\delta$ function $$\mathcal{F}\{\chi -1\} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{2\pi i n y} - \delta = \chi - \delta$$ satisfies $$(\mathcal{F}\{\chi-1\},h) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-n^2}\frac{x^n}{n!} \neq 0$$ Notice we remove the $n=0$ term. This produces the final result. It is straight forward from here! We just use the unitary properties of $\mathcal{F}$ under this inner product. $$(\chi-1,\mathcal{F}^{-1}h) \neq 0$$ Apply $\mathcal{F}$ again, using the unitary property again, and through the exact same argument $$(\chi-1,h) = (\mathcal{F}\{\chi -1\}, \mathcal{F}^{-1}h) = (\chi - \delta, \mathcal{F}^{-1} h)\neq 0 $$ therefore $$(\chi-1,h) \neq 0$$ The continuous Taylor series cannot equal the discrete Taylor series. Personally, I'm ashamed to ask, but for what functions does this actually work. I know this argument must work in a distributional sense, but for what functions does this actually work when written in a more classical sense?
