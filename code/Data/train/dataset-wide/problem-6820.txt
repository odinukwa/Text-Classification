(These sources are not entirely independent, since the application of new technology often requires new types of capital equipment and new skills.) The absence of population growth does not prevent any of the above, since it does not limit the proportion of current output a country chooses to devote to capital investment, education and technological innovation. 

Because they have low interest rates and growing tax revenue. As long as your income is growing faster than your debt, you can keep borrowing. 

Back in the 1980s leveraged buyouts were a common event. Financiers like T. Boone Pickens would borrow money, buy a controlling interest in a publicly traded stock and then re-engineer the company, for example, by selling it off in pieces. This activity seems to be a thing of the past. I assume some law was passed to prevent leveraged buyouts. What was the cause of the demise of leveraged buyouts? 

facilitate trade and specialisation, both within countries and internationally, by lowering transactions costs between people in circumstances where the informal constraints of village life do not apply; facilitate mobility of capital, by developing a legal framework for financial instruments and removing legal obstacles (eg usury laws); facilitate the spreading of risk, reducing the consequences of bad luck for individuals and firms. 

Short answer: whether a firm's maximum 'profit' at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost is positive or negative depends on whether average revenue exceeds average cost at that point. To give a simple numerical example, suppose for a firm in a perfectly competitive market: $$MR = AR = 1$$ $$TC = 2 + 0.4Q + 0.1Q^2$$ where $MR$ is marginal revenue, $AR$ is average revenue, $TC$ is total cost and $Q$ is quantity produced and sold (for a defined period). Then marginal cost $MC$ is: $$MC = 0.4 + 0.2Q$$ and $MC = MR$ when: $$0.4+0.2Q=1$$ implying $Q = 3$. At that point, however, average cost $AC$ is: $$AC = \frac{TC}{Q} = \frac{2 + 0.4(3)+ 0.1(3^2)}{3} = \frac{4.1}{3} \approx 1.37 > 1 = AR$$ So the firm would make a loss of $4.1 - 3 = 1.1$ by producing at $Q=3$. In this case 'profit' at the point identified by equating $MC$ and $MR$ is only a local maximum within the range $Q > 0$. Note for example that the loss at $Q=2$ is $3.2-2=1.2$ and that at $Q=4$ is $5.2-4=1.2$. The global maximum 'profit' within the range $Q\geq0$ is zero at $Q=0$, so (considering the period in isolation), the firm would do better not to produce at all. 

In some cases I see otherwise stable stocks or commodities having wild swings in price on exchanges. Even though the underlying company or commodity is going along normally and there is no news that the item is anything but stable, traders might be wildly buying or selling causing the market price to fluctuate. This seems to happen more often when an item or stock is the subject of public interest, so there might be an element of "mob psychology" involved. Are there any standardized models that have attempted to capture the psychological elements of trading? 

can be understood in more than one way. There is the pure accounting question which could be formulated more precisely (albeit in terms of a rather unrealistic scenario) as follows: 

The inconvenience of having to find another party who both offers what you want and wants what you offer. Even if such a party can be found, the possible complexity of negotiating a "fair" transaction (eg I'll do your electrical job if you'll clean my windows monthly for the next 3 months). I don't want to encourage it, but for those seeking to evade tax, the comparative ease in many circumstances of doing so via a normal monetary transaction, but with payment in cash. 

I notice that US exports doubled between 2000 and 2011, imports also increasing greatly, but GDP only grew by 20%. Thus, trade in the United States seems to have grown substantially faster than production. Why is this? 

You have some incorrect ideas about wealth. First of all, inheriting money does not concentrate wealth, it disperses it. Usually the recipients of inheritances, both organizations and wayward children spend the money the receive so the inheritance is dispersed completely. Most people who are wealthy got that way not by earning a lot of money, but by saving the money they did earn. How much a person saves and invests is a much bigger indicator of wealth than income. A plumber that saves and invests will eventually become much richer than a doctor who spends all his money. Also, most people who wealthy are not manufacturers who "make a great product," they are ordinary professionals and businessmen: doctors, lawyers, business executives, electricians, plumbers, and builders. You can even find many blue collar workers who have become rich by saving and investing: policeman, firemen, teachers. Where I live there are two teachers, a husband and wife couple, who started out as ordinary high school teachers and now they are quite wealthy and own their own private school. There are probably more millionaire garbage men, than there are millionaire manufacturers. Owning a bunch of garbage trucks is enough to make you a millionaire. Now think how many garbage trucks there are. Here is an article about typical characteristics of wealthy people: $URL$ 

Suppose that instead we were to specify the second state variable as the stock of the single good, say $G_t$. Would this result in any essential changes to 1-3 above, which would change the solution of the problem? It would of course if we allow for stocks of the good destined for consumption but not yet consumed, eg being packaged, transported or on shelves awaiting purchase. But in a simple model such as this we will probably want to ignore such complications. Suppose therefore we also assume that, for the part of output that is consumed, consumption is immediate. Then the stock of the good would consist entirely of capital, and we could re-write 1-3 substituting $K$ by $G$ throughout. This substitution would not affect the substance of the problem, so the same optimal solution would be obtained whether we make the substitution or not. In particular, the time path of $\omega_t$ consistent with the optimal solution would be the same, whether $\omega_t$ is regarded as the shadow price of capital or the shadow price of the good. Hence along an optimal path $\omega_t$ is also the value of a unit of output of the good. 

There seems to exist a rarely-stated assumption that somehow corporations are an essential element of a free-market economy, and that they benefit a nation's economy. However, I wonder if this is really true. Here, I am speaking of the US form of a corporation which allows a small number of people to control capital contributed by a large number and also allows those same people to disavow responsibility for the debts and liabilities of the corporation. In the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith deprecated any kind of joint stock companies, writing that a man would be much more careless with other people's money than his own. By this logic one might see corporate law as a way for elites to exploit society parasitically and corporate law as a damage to the economy instead of a benefit. Is there any theoretical validity to this kind of view? 

The combination of the two policies could work and would have some advantages over either alone, and for a given reduction in emissions the overall cost burden on industry and consumers would not be doubled. However, the cap on emissions would weaken the effect of gradual escalation of the tax rate. The model represented in the following diagram is a simplification in several respects (which will be considered below) but is a helpful starting-point. It assumes a single homogeneous fossil fuel, with emissions depending solely on the quantity of fossil fuel consumed. Hence the horizontal axis represents quantity of fossil fuel and quantity of emissions. 

National currencies increase or decrease in price relative to other national currencies due to the demand for those currencies and their supply. The supply and demand for currency is dependent on many different factors. The main factors are the needs of trade, the policies of the authority that issues the currency, and the perceived stability and predictability of that authority. For example, if a merchant wants to buy a good that comes from the country in question, then they might need to acquire the currency of the country. This will increase the demand for the currency and consequently its price. On the other hand, if the country had a revolution or the authority that issues the currency began to act in an erratic way, then that could undermine confidence in the currency, decreasing the demand and the price. 

You are right: both the price-elasticity of demand and the price-elasticity of supply affect the respective proportions for producers and consumers of the burden of a per unit tax imposed on sales by producers. The proportions depend on the relative slopes, which reflect price-elasticities, of the demand and supply curves. Considering the elastic supply case in your diagram, the slope of the demand curve between points AE is much steeper than that of the supply curve between CE. Hence E is much closer, in the vertical (price) dimension, to C than to A. Thus the post-tax price to consumers (p2 corresponding to A) is much further from the pre-tax price (p1 corresponding to E) than is the post-tax price to producers (p3 corresponding to C),and so most of the burden falls on consumers. For the inelastic supply case the position is reversed. A detailed explanation may be found in this NTRC paper (see section III).
