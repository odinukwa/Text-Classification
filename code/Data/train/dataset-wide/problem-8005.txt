On the other hand, there exists permutative LD-systems $(M,*)$ along with $x,y\in M$ such that $\textrm{crit}((x*x)*y)>\textrm{crit}(x*y)$ (such algebras $(M,*)$ were discovered using computer calculations). Therefore, the algebra $(M,*)$ cannot arise from the algebras of elementary embeddings. One possible explanation between this discrepancy is that may be possible to show that $(M,*)$ is actually a subalgebra of some $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}/\equiv^{\gamma}$ in some model and thus obtain an inconsistency. The algebras $M$ where $\textrm{crit}((x*x)*y)>\textrm{crit}(x*y)$ for some $x,y\in M$ together with the great consistency strength of rank-into-rank cardinals has given me some doubts about the existence and consistency of rank-into-rank cardinals. After all, the rank-into-rank cardinals are very close to the Kunen inconsistency, and they are far above the cardinals for which there exists a good inner model theory. Furthermore, the mere fact that rank-into-rank cardinals may be used to prove purely algebraic results is a reason to believe that rank-into-rank cardinals are the most vulnerable spot of the large cardinal hierarchy to an inconsistency. With everything being said, there is likely a better explanation for the existence of reduced permutative LD-systems $(M,*)$ with $\textrm{crit}((x*x)*y)>\textrm{crit}(x*y)$. It is likely that the only reason there seems to be a discrepancy between algebra and set theory is that the algebras of rank-into-rank embeddings are very poorly understood. When the algebras of rank-into-rank embeddings become better understood, I will likely recant my doubts about the existence and consistency of rank-into-rank cardinals. Lastly, the near inconsistency of rank-into-rank cardinals seems to imply that algebras of rank-into-rank embeddings may be used to continue to prove new good results about algebraic structures which do not have proofs in ZFC. I therefore think it would be wise to search for a possible inconsistency of rank-into-rank cardinals so that when no inconsistency arises, plenty of algebraic results remain. If there is an inconsistency arising from the algebras of elementary embeddings, then one can probably show that $n$-huge cardinals are inconsistent as well for fairly small $n$. On the other hand, the huge cardinals are probably safe from such an inconsistency. I should mention that others in the set theory community have not expressed these doubts since the algebras with $\textrm{crit}((x*x)*y)>\textrm{crit}(x*y)$ are very new and no one else is working on them.

J. Bismut proved the asymptotic formula for the heat kernel of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ on a manifold $M$ in one of his well-known books. Later, in his paper on the index theorem, Bismut said that the result can be extended immediately to the heat equation semi-group for Hodge-Kodaira Laplacian or the Dirac Laplacian, since these (operators) are subordinated to the heat equation semi-group for $\Delta$. My question is: what is subordination or the subordination process in probability? If there is such subordination, how can one see that the result can be extended immediately? The proof of the asymptotic formula by Bismut in his book on Large Deviation is not easy to follow. Also Bismut mentioned that Malliavin has already used the subordination in his paper on vanishing theorem. 

This characterization of cozero sets which does not refer to continuous functions is very useful in point-free topology since this characterization can easily be generalized to a point-free setting, and in point-free topology it is usually more convenient to work with open sets than it is to work with the pointfree analogue continuous real-valued functions. Hence, in point-free topology it is more convenient to define the cozero sets in terms of $\prec$ and $\ll$ than it is to define the cozero sets in terms of frame homomorphisms from the frame of real numbers $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{T})$ to your original frame $L$. If $X$ is a completely regular space, then the complete containment relation $\ll$ is completely below relation for the finest proximity compatible with the topology on $X$. 1Short proof of an internal characterization of complete regularity.

In the paper Morse-Bott theory and equivariant cohomology, Austin and Braam built the Morse-Bott (geometric) complex which computes the de Rham cohomology of the manifold $M$ (this paper can be found in the Floer Memorial Volume). This is a generalization of the Morse complex in the case of a Morse-Bott function $f$ on $M$. However, unlike the Morse complex, the Morse-Bott complex is an infinite dimensional complex. The chains of the Morse-Bott complex are differential forms on the critical submanifolds of $f$ and the boundary map is defined in terms of the flow lines of the gradient vector fields. Only when $f$ is Morse is the complex finite dimensional. I have three related questions: 

We shall give a complete characterization of all the maximal ideals in $\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{N}$ in terms of ultrafilters. For simplicity, we shall classify all maximal ideals in $\mathcal{M}$ since the maximal ideals in $\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{N}$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with all maximal ideals in $\mathcal{M}$ extending $\mathcal{N}$. Let $\mathcal{B}$ denote the Boolean algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets in $S$. Let $S(\mathcal{B})$ be the set of all ultrafilters on the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{B}$, and let $Max(\mathcal{M})$ denote the collection of all maximal ideals in $\mathcal{M}$. We shall give a one-to-one correspondence between $Max(\mathcal{M})$ and $S(\mathcal{B})$ as follows. For this problem, let $Z(f)=\{x\in S|f(x)=0\}$ denote the zero set of $f$. If $\mathcal{U}\in S(\mathcal{B})$, then let $V(\mathcal{U})=\{f\in\mathcal{M}|Z(f)\in\mathcal{U}\}$. Then clearly $V(\mathcal{U})$ is an ideal on $\mathcal{M}$. Furthermore, if $f+V(\mathcal{U})\neq 0$, then $Z(f)^{c}\in\mathcal{U}$, so let $g$ be a function where $g=\frac{1}{f}$ on $Z(f)^{c}$. Then the elements $f+V(\mathcal{U})$ and $g+V(\mathcal{U})$ are inverses, so $\mathcal{M}/V(\mathcal{U})$ is a field. Hence $V(\mathcal{U})$ is a maximal ideal. Therefore we may consider $V$ as a function from $S(\mathcal{B})$ to $Max(\mathcal{M})$. Going the other direction, assume $I$ is a maximal ideal in $\mathcal{M}$. Consider the set $\{Z(f)|f\in I\}$. Then 

The above paper also gave a chain map from the Morse-Bott complex to a certain Morse complex pertaining to a Morse function $f_\epsilon$ obtained from a small perturbation of $f$. The chain map also induces isomorphism on cohomology (see p.147). The method is as follows: Let $C_i$ be all the critical submanifolds of $f$, $i=1, ...n$. Let $f_i$ be a Morse function on $C_i$. $f_i$ will have critical points on $C_i$. Let $\rho_i$ be some bump function that has support and value $1$ in some small neighbourhood of $C_i$. Define for $\epsilon$ small enough, $$f_\epsilon=f+\epsilon\sum\rho_i{{\pi_i}^{-1}}(f_i)$$ Then $f_\epsilon$ is a Morse function on $M$. (Here $\pi_i$ is projection of the normal bundle to $C_i$.) Here is my second question: 

I want to know if scalar multiplication over a finite field of characteristic 2 is generally easier to compute than a linear transformation over a vector space over $F_{2}$. Suppose that $p(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial over $F_{2}$ of degree $n$. Then $F_{2}[x]/\langle p(x)\rangle$ is a finite field of cardinality $2^{n}$. Define an operation $*$ on $\{0,1\}^{n}$ where $$(a_{0},...,a_{n-1})*(b_{0},...,b_{n-1})=(c_{0},...,c_{n-1})$$ precisely when $$(a_{0}+...+a_{n-1}x^{n-1})\cdot(b_{0}+...+b_{n-1}x^{n-1})/\langle p(x)\rangle=c_{0}+...+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}/\langle p(x)\rangle.$$ Let $C_{i,j}:\{0,1\}^{n-1}\rightarrow\{0,1\}^{n-1}$ be the mapping defined by $$C_{i,j}(x_{1},...,x_{n})=(x_{1},...,x_{i},...,x_{i}\oplus x_{j},...,x_{n}).$$ In other words, $C_{i,j}$ corresponds to the matrix $A$ with $1$'s along the diagonal, a $1$ in the $(j,i)$-th entry and $0$'s elsewhere ($A\mathbf{x}=C_{i,j}\mathbf{x}$). Each $C_{i,j}$ is an elementary linear transformation and each $C_{i,j}$ is a CNOT gate $(x,y)\mapsto(x,x\oplus y)$. Suppose that $\mathbf{r}=(r_{0},...,r_{n-1}),\mathbf{r}\neq 0$ and $t_{p(x),\mathbf{r}}$ is the least number $m$ such that there are $C_{i_{m},j_{m}},...,C_{i_{1},j_{1}}$ where $(r_{0},...,r_{n-1})*(x_{0},...,x_{n-1})=C_{i_{m},j_{m}}\circ...\circ C_{i_{1},j_{1}}(x_{0},...,x_{n-1})$ whenever $x_{0},...,x_{n-1}\in\{0,1\}$. What are some bounds for the number $t_{p(x),\mathbf{r}}$? 

Is there a finite dimensional subcomplex of the Morse-Bott complex that also computes the cohomology of $M$? 

The (finite dimensional) Morse complex obtained from $f_\epsilon$ clearly is not a subcomplex of the Morse-Bott complex. If there is in question one no finite dimensional subcomplex of the Morse-Bott complex that computes the cohomology of $M$, then the Morse complex of $f_\epsilon$ may be viewed as a finite dimensional substitute. However, it maybe rather arbitrary, since it depends on the choice of $f_i$. Also, the dimensions of this complex maybe quite large, for instance, $f_i$ may have more critical points than the sum of the Betti numbers of $C_i$. That is, $f_i$ may not be a perfect Morse function. If the Morse complex of $f_\epsilon$ is a substitute, then how to choose a good one? Or are there other ways to construct a finite dimensional "Morse-Bott" complex that computes the cohomology of $M$? 

If $j$ is a function with $V_{\lambda+1}\subseteq\mathrm{Dom}(f)$, then define a mapping $j\upharpoonright_{\lambda+1}:V_{\lambda+1}\rightarrow V_{\lambda+1}$ by letting $j\upharpoonright_{\lambda+1}(A)=j(A)\cap V_{\lambda}$ for each $A\subseteq V_{\lambda}$. Suppose that $\lambda$ is an inaccessible cardinal. Then we shall say that a function $f:V_{\lambda+1}\rightarrow V_{\lambda+1}$ is an extendibility mapping if for all $\alpha>\lambda$ there is some elementary embedding $j:V_{\alpha}\rightarrow V_{\beta}$ where $f=j\upharpoonright_{\lambda+1}$. If $\kappa<\lambda$ and $\lambda$ is inaccessible, then $\kappa$ is extendible if and only if there is some extendibility mapping $f:V_{\lambda+1}\rightarrow V_{\lambda+1}$ with $\mathrm{crit}(f)=\kappa.$ Let $\Phi(f_{1},...,f_{n},\lambda)$ denote the following formula. i. $f_{1},...,f_{n}:V_{\lambda+1}\rightarrow V_{\lambda+1}$ are non-trivial extendibility mappings with $\mathrm{crit}(f_{1})<...<\mathrm{crit}(f_{n})<\lambda$ and $\lambda$ inaccessible, and ii. whenever $1\leq i<j\leq n$ and $\alpha>\lambda$ and $j:V_{\alpha}\rightarrow V_{\beta}$ is an elementary embedding with $j\upharpoonright_{\lambda+1}=f_{j}$ then $(j(f_{i}))\upharpoonright_{\lambda+1}=f_{i}$. Is the existence of $n$ extendible cardinals equiconsistent with the existence of extendibility mappings $f_{1},...,f_{n}:V_{\lambda+1}\rightarrow V_{\lambda+1}$ where $\Phi(f_{1},...,f_{n},\lambda)$ is false? The motivation behind asking this question is that the extendible cardinals begin to have some aspects of the algebras of elementary embeddings and these algebraic properties of the extendible cardinals may be easier to investigate than the algebraic properties at the level around $n$-hugeness and rank-into-rank. I will probably ask more questions like this one in the near future. 

Novikov complex is an extension of Morse theory to (closed) Morse 1-form $\omega$, which is not necessarily exact. Suppose for simplicity, $\omega$ is in the integer cohomology class and the universal covering is infinite cyclic. Then $\omega$ can be lifted to the universal cover $\hat M$, i.e., $\pi^\star \omega=d\hat f$, for some Morse function $\hat f$ on $\hat M$. The Morse 1-form $\omega$ generalizes the Morse function and the zeros of $\omega$ take the place of the critical points of a Morse function. Indices of the zeros (or critical points) of $\omega$ can be defined similarly and we have the stable and unstable manifolds of a critical point. The incidence number between a pair of critical points respectively of index $k$ and $k-1$ of $\omega$ can be defined for a Morse-Smale pair $(\omega, g)$, where $g$ is a Riemann metric on $M$. One can lift the stable and unstable manifolds to $\hat M$ and define the corresponding incidence number in $\hat M$ similarly. One can also define the Novikov complex. My question is: $\hat M$ is not compact and the unstable manifold (or the descending disc) of a critical point in $\hat M$ in general goes infinitely downwards. Also, for fixed $x$ in $\hat M$, it is possible that the incidence numbers between the critical points $x$ of index $k$ and $y$ of index $k-1$ in $\hat M$ are non-zero for infinitely many $y$. These are different from Morse theory on compact manifolds. Can someone give a (simple) example of an unstable manifold in $\hat M$ going infinitely downwards for some Morse 1-form? Maybe also an example of infinite number of non-zero incidence numbers? I am sorry that I pose the question rather imprecisely. 

Every $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a quotient $\mathcal{M}/I$ where $(X,\mathcal{M})$ is a $\sigma$-algebra and $I$ is a $\sigma$-complete ideal (See the Handbook of Boolean Algebras for a proof or look here). Here by a $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra, we mean a Boolean algebra where every countable subset has a least upper bound. A $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra $B$ is isomorphic to an algebra of sets if and only if each element in $B\setminus\{0\}$ is contained in some $\sigma$-complete ultrafilter. $\textbf{Proposition}$ Suppose that $B$ is an atomless $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra that satisfies the countable chain condition. Then $B$ has no $\sigma$-complete ultrafilters. In particular, $B$ is not representable as an algebra of sets. $\textbf{Proof}$ Suppose to the contrary that $\mathcal{U}$ is a $\sigma$-complete ultrafilter. Then since $B$ is atomless, $\mathcal{U}$ is non-principal. Let $c\subseteq B$ be a maximal family under inclusion such that $c\cap\mathcal{U}=\emptyset$ and $a\wedge b=0$ for each $a,b\in c,a\neq b$. Such a set $c$ exists by Zorn's lemma. By maximality, $c$ is in fact a partition of $B$. By the countable chain condition, the set $c$ must be countable, so since $c\cap\mathcal{U}=\emptyset$, we have $1=\bigvee c\not\in\mathcal{U}$ since $\mathcal{U}$ is $\sigma$-complete. $\mathbf{QED}$
