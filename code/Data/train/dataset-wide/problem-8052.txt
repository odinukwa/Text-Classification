Fuchsian groups are residually finite, so they have many finite index normal subgroups. (Even better, surface groups are residually free!) Torsion free fuchsian groups (aka surface groups) are even nicer - you can use homology arguments to produce normal subgroups of various kinds. Surface groups also have a wild variety of infinitely generated infinite index normal subgroups. If you can say a bit more about what kind of normal subgroups you need, perhaps somebody could give a more useful answer. Finally - since you ask for a reference - here is a pleasantly short discussion of surface groups, with a pointer to Stillwell's lovely introductory book "Classical topology and combinatorial group theory". 

Suppose that $L = L(p,q)$ is a lens space. Let $T$ be the standard genus one Heegaard splitting. Then $T$ is unique up to isotopy. It follows that every self-homeomorphism of $L$ preserves $T$ up to isotopy. The uniqueness result was first proved by Bonahon and Otal in their paper "Scindements de Heegaard des espaces lenticulaires". A proof can also be found in Theorem 2.5 of Hatcher's three-manifold notes, available here: $URL$ 

A pair of optimal pants decompositions $A, B$ need not have disjoint shortest curves. Here is an example. Let $S$ be the genus two hyperbolic surface built from four equilateral right-angled hexagons by "doubling". That is, let $H$ be such a hexagon. Let $a = 2 \cosh^{-1}(\sqrt{3/2}) = 1.31695\ldots$ denote the side-length of $H$. (See Beardon.) Let $\alpha$ be the union of three non-adjacent sides of $H$ and let $\beta$ be the other three non-adjacent sides. Doubling $H$ across $\alpha$ gives a pants $P$. So $\alpha$ gives the seams of $P$ and $\beta$ doubles to give $\partial P$, each component having length $2a$. Now double across $\beta$ to get $S$. Let $B = \partial P$ be the double of $\beta$ in $S$. So $B$ is a pants decomposition of $S$, each curve having length $2a$. Likewise $A$, the double of $\alpha$, is a pants decomposition. Claim: All curves of $A$ and $B$ are systoles of $S$. Proof: Any geodesic in a genus two surface is preserved by the hyperelliptic and so double covers an arc or a loop in the orbifold $O = S^2(2,2,2,2,2,2)$. In our situation $O$ is the double of $H$ across $\partial H$. The shortest arc is an edge of $H$. The shortest loop divides $O$ in half and has length $4\cosh^{-1}(\sqrt{2}) = 3.525494\ldots$. QED Thus both $A$ and $B$ are optimal, yet every curve of $A$ crosses every curve of $B$. 

There are proofs that do not use homology, but I don't know that they are more elementary... For example: Lemma: If S is an embedded compact surface without boundary in an orientable three manifold M then S is orientable if and only if S separates a regular neighborhood. Thus if K is an embedded Klein bottle in R^3 then K does not separate R^3. Now we have: Lemma: If S is an embedded compact surface without boundary in R^3 then S separates R^3 into two pieces, one compact and one not compact. Proof: A cut and paste argument, inducting on the number of saddle points of S with respect to height.// This is very similar to Alexander's Theorem that spheres in R^3 separate. 

Both of these results follow from Matt Grayson's curve-shortening flow (Annals, 1989). If $S$ is the torus or Klein bottle, then first bullet still holds, but the second does not. Instead $X$ is homotopy equivalent to (a cover of) $S$. Finally, if $S$ is the sphere or projective plane, then I believe that $X$ has nontrivial higher homotopy groups. If the embeddings are only continuous, well, that seems tricky. 

There are integral homology spheres in the following Thurston geometries: $S^3$, $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, and $H^3$. No manifold of the latter two types (when equipped with any metric) can have all of its geodesics being closed. This follows from observing that the fundamental group contains a non-trivial free group, and then a Gromov-Hausdorff limiting argument. 

Suppose that $f$ is a pseudo-Anosov and let $\lambda^\pm$ be its stable and unstable laminations. Suppose that $g$ is any mapping class with the following property: $g(\lambda^+) \neq \lambda^-$. Then, for all sufficiently large $n$, the composition $f^n g$ is also pseudo-Anosov. This is proved using the north-south dynamics of $f$. Now, as in Mosher's answer, choose $f$ in Torelli and let $g$ be a lift of the desired element of $Sp$. If needed, compose $g$ with a bounding pair map to arrange the side-condition. We are done. Added later: Here are some of the details of the dynamical argument. I've edited this several times to try and make it correct. Full disclosure - I first heard this from Yair Minsky. Pick $U$, a small neighborhood of $\lambda^+$, chosen so that $\lambda^-$ is not contained in $g(U)$. I'll also want $f|U$ to be strictly contracting. Using north-south dynamics, there is an $m^+ > 0$ so that for all $n > m^+$ we have $f^{m^+} g(U) \subset U$. The contracting property implies that the map $f^n g$ has a unique fixed point in $U$. On the other hand, pick a small neighborhood $V$ of $g^{-1}(\lambda^-)$, so that $\lambda^+$ is not in $V$. Also, we require $f^{-1}|g(V)$ to be strictly contracting There is a power $m^- > 0$ so that for all $n > m^-$ we have $V \subset f^n g(V)$. Deduce that the map $f^n g$ has a unique fixed point in $V$. We place one more restriction on $n$. We need $f^n g(V^c)$ to be contained in $U$. I now claim that $h = f^n g$ has no other fixed points, and so is pseudo-Anosov. 

Here are some pretty examples of self covering manifolds: Suppose that $F$ is a manifold and $f \colon F \to F$ is a periodic homeomorphism of period $k$. We define $M_f = F \times I \,/\, f$ to be the mapping torus with monodromy $f$. That is, form the product $F \times I$ and identify the two ends via $f$. Note that $M_f$ is an $F$-bundle over the circle. Now, the $(k+1)$-fold cover of $M_f$, obtained by "unwrapping the circle direction" is the mapping torus for $f^{k+1} = f$. Thus the $(k+1)$-fold cover is homeomorphic to $M_f$. As a concrete example, the trefoil knot complement $X_T$ is a once-punctured torus bundle over the circle, with monodromy of order six. Thus $X_T$ seven-fold covers itself. (And also five-fold covers itself.) This trick works for any torus knot complement. 

In principle, normal surface theory answers your question - it can detect if a link is split and can decide if a knot is unknotted. In practice, just draw your link in SnapPea. But neither if these could be called a "simple rule." You might look at Purcell's thesis work/early papers (eg "Volumes of highly twisted knots and links"), using hyperbolic geometry, to give a simple rule implying that a link is non-trivial. 

Here is a Stallings-style argument. Suppose that $S$ is a closed connected surface. Let $G = \pi_1(S)$. Suppose $T$ is a graph and $v \in T$ a vertex. Let $F = \pi_1(T,v)$ and suppose that $\phi \colon G \to F$ is any homomorphism. 

See the paper "Brunnian links" by Gartside and Greenwood, published in Fundamenta Mathematicae. Theorems 8 and 7 imply that iterated commutators are optimal and the sequence you suggest gives the minimal length. 

Ian Agol, in the last sentence of this paper $URL$ suggests the possibility of a hyperbolic fibered three-manifold where the fiber is the only incompressible surface. Such an example would be a very pleasing answer to your second question. This would be an excellent project for a graduate student! 

This is a very nice question! There is a well-known question "if $G$ is qi to $Z^n$ then $G$ is virtually $Z^n$." I've been told that Yehuda Shalom has a proof that avoids using Gromov's theorem - I couldn't find a reference on-line for this. Here is an idea for an answer to your question. A finitely generated group $G$ has either 0, 1, 2 or infinitely many ends, in the sense of Stallings. Assuming linear growth for $G$ rules out zero and infinity. If $G$ has two ends then Stallings proves that $G$ is virtually cyclic. So we may assume, for a contradiction, that $G$ is one-ended. Choose a geodesic ray $R \subset G$ that starts at the identity and exits the unique end of the Cayley graph of $G$. (Note that $R$ exists because the Cayley graph is proper - metric balls are compact.) Here is the vague bit; deduce somehow that $G$ is quasi-isometric to $R$. This gives a quasi-action of $G$ on the positive reals. Thus there are group elements $g_n \in G$ act on $R$ essentially via positive translation by $n$. (This is a lie, of course; they may also expand/contract, but only a uniformly bounded amount.) However, for sufficiently large $n$ the element $g_n$ cannot have an inverse in $G$, and we are done. 

An incompressible and boundary incompressible connected surface is isotopic to either (a) a vertical annulus or (b) a horizontal surface. A vertical annulus is of the form $\alpha \times I$ where $\alpha$ is an essential simple closed curve. A horizontal surface is of the form $\Sigma \times \{t\}$. Here is a sketch of the proof. Let $F$ be the given incompressible, boundary incompressible, connected surface. Suppose that $\beta \subset \Sigma$ is essential simple closed curve. Let $B = \beta \times I$ be the corresponding vertical annulus. An innermost disk/outermost bigon argument simplifies the intersection between $F$ and $B$ until it is a disjoint union of either vertical arcs or horizontal curves (ie, copies of $\beta \times \{t\}$). Now cut $\Sigma \times I$ along $B$ to get a handlebody with a product structure. Repeat the above argument, replacing the vertical annulus with a sequence of vertical rectangles. I believe that you can find all of the tools you need for this kind of thing in Gordon's lecture notes on normal surfaces. $URL$ There is also a proof of a similar fact by Scharlemann and Thompson in their paper "Heegaard splittings of (surface)×I are standard." Allowing boundary compressible surfaces makes the classification more annoying. I haven't thought that through. 

Nice problem! After googling "hyperbolic triangles of equal area on a fixed base" I found the paper "Extremal properties of the principal Dirichlet eigenvalue for regular polygons in the hyperbolic plane" by Karp and Peyerimhoff. Their Theorem 7 looks like the result you ask for. In a footnote KP refer to a 1965 book of Fejes Toth, "Regulare Figuren", as containing the same result. There appears to be an English version "Regular Figures" published in 1964. This question seems very interesting in spherical geometry, as well. 

That is, there is no unique way to do what you want, even for the factorial function. There is not even a universally agreed upon best way, or agreement upon what "best" might mean. To add content to your question, I think a few examples are called for, and perhaps a sensible restriction on the allowed extensions. 

$\newcommand{\from}{\colon}\newcommand{\Aut}{\rm{Aut}}\newcommand{\bdy}{\partial}$Here is a fairly hands-on proof. I'll use the following notation: $H = H_g$, $S = S_g = \bdy H$, and $F = F_g$. I'll write $g(S) = g(H) = g$. Also, $i \from S \to H$ is the inclusion map. 

I believe that your question is answered by section (3e) at this page at the Geometry Center. Note that b+ and bo are equivalent as are b- and bn (o and n stand for orientation preserving and reversing, respectively). You can check a few examples using the is_isometric method of Manifold. 

Even better, there are hyperbolic surface bundles with Heegaard genus two. These are all described in Jesse Johnson's paper, titled Surface bundles with genus two Heegaard splittings. You will need to use some criterion to recognize pseudo-Anosov maps, however. 

There is not a single isotopy class of (doubly orientation-preserving) homeomorphism that does this. Instead, there is a $\mathbb{Z}$-family of homeomorphisms, generated by a Dehn twist along a leaf of the foliation. For one of these you get the three-torus, but the others give Nil manifolds. But if you do get the three-torus, then the foliation is indeed standard. To explain the comment "doubly orientation-preserving": A homeomorphism preserving the standard foliation of the two-torus by circles can 

Robert Myers, in his paper "Simple knots in compact, orientable 3-manifolds", proved that every compact, orientable three-manifold (without sphere boundary components) contains a hyperbolic knot. It follows that every link $L$ in the three-sphere is a sublink of a hyperbolic link $L'$. This answers your first question. It is also possible to arrange that the components of $L' - L$ are unknots in $S^3$, but I do not have a reference at hand. 

In any dimension the thin part of a hyperbolic manifold $M$ is the union of regular neigborhoods of short geodesics and of cusps. This follows from the Margulis lemma. Since removing cusps is the same as removing collars of the boundary of a compact manifold, the only way for the thin part to disconnect $M$ is if the neighborhood of a geodesic (or collection of geodesics) separates $M$. This only happens when the geodesic is codimension one, that is, when M has dimension two. 

To answer your second question "if anyone had ever built a nice program to compute formally this morphism": Looking at $URL$ it seems the answer is probably "no". However, you may be interested in the game Teruaki, written by Kazushi Ahara. To answer your first question "how does one compute efficiently the induced morphism": Allow me to fix a bit of notation. Let $\gamma$ be the given curve. Let $\delta_i$ be a collection of standard curves -- that is, the Dehn twists $T_i$ about the curves $\delta_i$ generate the (orientation preserving) mapping class group and the action of $T_i$ on $\pi_1(S,p)$ is known. I will assume that $\delta_0$ and $\gamma$ have the same topological type: there is a mapping class $g$ so that $g(\delta_0) = \gamma$. We will also need the following fact. If $c$ is a curve and $f$ is a orientation preserving surface homeomorphism then \[ f \circ T_c \circ f^{-1} = T_{f(c)}. \] where $T_c$ is the Dehn twist about $c$. Now to answer the question: realize $g$, the mapping class sending $\delta_0$ to $\gamma$, as a composition of standard twists. Thus $T_\gamma = g \circ T_0 \circ g^{-1}$. The right-hand side is a product of standard twists, and we are done. There are two remarks needed at this point. First, the choice of $g$ is not unique and its expression as a product of twists is not unique. In fact there are several different algorithms here - one of the earlier and nicest is given by Lickorish in his foundational paper "A representation of orientable combinatorial 3-manifolds": see the first several pages, leading up to Theorem 1 on page 536. (This part of his paper was partly anticipated by Dehn.) Second, all of these choices makes one slightly uneasy. The action of $T_\gamma$ on $\pi_1(S,p)$ is some unique thing, written in terms of the given generators, so why can't we just "write it down"? However, I think that this is not possible. That is, there is no simple expression of $T_\gamma(a_1)$, in terms of $\gamma$ written as an element of $\pi_1$. If the intersection pattern between $a_1$ and $\gamma$ is sufficiently complicated, and "transverse", then $T_\gamma(a_1)$ will contain many subwords that look basically like $\gamma$, separated by shortish words representing the pieces of $a_1$. These short pieces of $a_1$ are very sensitive to the intersection pattern. This can all be rephrased in terms of the graph of groups structure induced on $\pi_1$ by $\gamma$ (and the resulting expressions for the $a_i$ and $b_i$) but I'll leave that to an expert. 

$a^2 = b^2$ says to me "two Mobius bands glued along their boundaries" which then says "the fundamental group of the Klein bottle." You can hear similar sounds from the presentations $\langle a, b \mid a^p = b^q \rangle$ which give rise to fundamental groups of torus knot complements. (Hmm. As long as $p, q$ are relatively prime.) 

$N_k$ is the connect sum of $k$ copies of the real projective plane, so it has Euler characteristic $2 - k$. For $k$ even $N_k$ bounds a connect sum of $k/2$ copies of the solid Klein bottle, as in Henry's comment. When $k$ is odd the rank of $H_1$ (with $Z/2Z$ coefficients) is odd. Because of "half lives, half dies" the boundary of a three-manifold must have even rank in $H_1$. So $N_k$, for $k$ odd, does not bound. Half lives, half dies can be found in Hatcher's three-manifold notes as Lemma 3.5, but you'll need to use $Z/2Z$ coefficients. My copy of the universal coefficient theorem is all rusty, so if I've made a mistake, it is here. 

The proper reference is Lemma 2.4 of the paper "Geometry of the complex of curves I: Hyperbolicity" by Masur and Minsky. They use extremal length to determine the systole set. They remark on the same page that hyperbolic length would also work. I haven't found an explicit reference for the latter. You can prove it following the proof in Masur and Minsky. You will need: 

You should look at the papers of Yair Minsky. Perhaps the right place to start is "End invariants and the classification of hyperbolic 3-manifolds". 

I am informed that you are "counting lattice points inside of a polyhedron." Here is a lecture on the subject - the picture on page six looks like the version of the problem you are interested in. To be honest, I found these notes by doing a google search. I am told that this is a huge field! It might help if you could narrow your problem even further. For example, you say that the $x_i$ are bounded real numbers. Do you know these to some high precision? Or can you give some information on how the $x_i$ are given? And can you say the same for $S$? EDIT: Here is a survey paper by the same author, Jesús De Loera, covering the same material in greater detail.
