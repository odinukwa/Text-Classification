I don't think your diagram is coming from a skew-symmetrizable matrix. Let $B$ be a skew-symmetrizable matrix and assume $Q = \Gamma(B)$ so your quiver is the diagram of $B$ as defined in Definition 7.3 of the linked paper. Then we must have $$B = \begin{bmatrix}0 & x & y \\ \frac{-1}{x} &0 & z \\ \frac{-1}{y} & \frac{-2}{z} &0 \end{bmatrix}$$ with $x,y,z > 0$. There also must exist a diagonal matrix $D = \mathrm{diag}(r,s,t)$ with $r,s,t > 0$ so that $$DB = \begin{bmatrix}0 & rx & ry \\ \frac{-s}{x} &0 & sz \\ \frac{-t}{y} & \frac{-2t}{z} &0 \end{bmatrix}$$ is skew-symmetric. So, $rx = \frac{s}{x}$, $ry = \frac{t}{y}$, and $sz = \frac{2t}{z}$ or equivalently $x^2 = \frac{s}{r}$, $y^2 = \frac{t}{r}$, and $z^2 = \frac{2t}{s}$. But this leads to a contradiction since $\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^2 = \frac{y^2}{x^2} = \frac{t}{s}$, but also $z^2 = 2\left(\frac{t}{s}\right)$. All the variables above aren't completely necessary. Since all entries of $B$ are integers we see $x = y = 1$ and $z = 1$ or $z = 2$. Then then follows $r = s = t$ and the contradiction is $z^2 = 2$. 

At the beginning of the section in the paper they let $G$ be a hypergraph. The size of a (hyper)edge is the number of vertices it contains. 

This problem was posed on Math StackExchange some time ago, but it did not garner any solutions there. I think that it is interesting enough to be posed here on Math Overflow, so here it goes. Let $ \mathcal{A} $ be a unital Banach algebra over $ \mathbb{C} $, with $ \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{A}} $ denoting the identity of $ \mathcal{A} $. For each $ a \in \mathcal{A} $, define the spectrum of $ a $ to be the following subset of $ \mathbb{C} $: $$ {\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}}(a) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \lbrace \lambda \in \mathbb{C} ~|~ \text{$ a - \lambda \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{A}} $ is not invertible} \rbrace. $$ With the aid of the Hahn-Banach Theorem and Liouville's Theorem from complex analysis, one can prove the well-known result that $ {\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}}(a) \neq \varnothing $ for every $ a \in \mathcal{A} $. All proofs that I have seen of this result use the Hahn-Banach Theorem in one way or another (a typical proof may be found in Walter Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis). Hence, a natural question to ask would be: Can we remove the dependence of this result on the Hahn-Banach Theorem? Is it a consequence of ZF only? Otherwise, if it is equivalent to some weak variant of the Axiom of Choice (possibly weaker than the Hahn-Banach Theorem itself), has anyone managed to construct a model of ZF containing a Banach algebra that has an element with empty spectrum? 

In his thesis Ira Gessel provides a method which gives a combinatorial interpretation of the inverse of a counting series of a linked set. A counting series is a generalization of a generating function. Some applications on the technique in the thesis are to things like symmetric functions and formal power series in countably many variables. For the single variable case, see Theorem 4.5 on page 45 which computes the inverse of a single variable generating function for some lattice paths. I will breifly summarize and give some simple examples below to make this answer a little more self-contained. Let $P$ be a set and $S \subseteq P^*$ be a subset of the free monoid (we actually want $S$ be a linear system which is defined in the thesis). For any $V \subseteq S$ we define its conuting series to be $\Gamma(V) = \sum_{\alpha \in V} \alpha$ which is a formal sum. We also define the alternating counting series $\bar{\Gamma}(V) = \sum_{\alpha \in V} (-1)^{r(\alpha)} \alpha$ where $r(\alpha)$ is the number of prime factors in $\alpha$ (i.e. length of the word). For any $\alpha = a_1a_2 \cdots a_n$ the links of $\alpha$ are $a_i a_{i+1}$. Take some set a links $L \subseteq P^2$ and define $C$ to be the set of $\alpha \in S$ such that all links of $\alpha$ are in $L$. Also let $\bar{C}$ be the set of $\alpha \in S$ such that all links of $\alpha$ are not in $L$. On page 37 we have Theorem 4.1 (The Inversion Theorem) we states $\Gamma(C) \bar{\Gamma}(\bar{C}) = 1$. Now let's use this for some single variable generating functions. For a trivial example let $S = P^*$ where $P$ is a set of size $k$. Then let $L = P^2$. In this case $\Gamma(C) = \sum_{w \in P^*} w$ is the sum of all $k$-ary words and $\bar{\Gamma}(\bar{C}) = 1 - \sum_{a \in P} a$. If we subsitute $a = x$ for all $a \in P$ we get the $\Gamma(C)$ becomes $\sum_{n \geq 0} k^n x^n$ and $\bar{\Gamma}({\bar{C}})$ becomes $1 - kx$. For a less trivial example let $S = P^* = \{a,b\}^*$ and let $L = \{aa,ab,ba\}$. Then $\Gamma(C)$ is the sum of all binary words which have no consecutive $b$'s and $\bar{\Gamma}(\bar{C}) = 1 - a - b + b^2 - b^3 + \cdots$. Again substituting $a = b = x$ we have $$1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 5x^3 + \cdots = \frac{1}{1 - 2x + x^2 - x^3 + \cdots}$$ the inverse of an "almost" Fibonacci generating function. 

Here is the set up : I consider the unitary tangent bundle of a surface $(S,g)$ endowed with the Sasakian metric ; $(T^1S, g_s)$, in fact we have the following fibration : \begin{equation*} \mathbb{S}^1 \to T^1 S \underset{p}{\to} S \end{equation*} where $p$ is Riemannian submersion. We also have a natural action, the rotation in the fiber, which give a structure of $\mathbb{S}^1$-principal bundle. I am interested in the eigen one-form of the Laplacian associated to the Sasakian metric, differential forms defined on $T^1S$ verifying $\Delta \omega = \lambda \omega$, with $\Delta$ the Hodge laplacian. My question is : Given all the eigenfunctions and eingenforms, let say $\eta$, associated to the Hodge Laplacian on the basis (and there pull back in $T^1S$ ,$p^*(\eta)$ ) and all the $\mathbb{S}^1$-invariant function (like the euler class for instance) does it possible to give a kind of formula which gives all the eingenforms of the Hodge Laplacian for the Sasakian metric ? Any references would be appreciated. 

Let $X$ be a Cartan-Hadamard manifold, meaning a complete, connected, simply connected Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature and $\Gamma < Isom(X)$ a discrete group of isometries of $X$. On can define the orbital function as follows $$ N_{\Gamma}(x,\rho) := \sharp \{ \gamma \in \Gamma \ , \ d(x, \gamma \cdot x) \le \rho \} $$ where $d$ is the distance on $X$ induced by the metric. We will denote by $V(x, \rho)$ the volume of a ball centered at $x$ of radius $\rho$. All the examples of orbital functions I have in mind (action of $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}^2$ on the plane, fundamental groups of finite volume hyperbolic manifolds and their abelian covers, convex-cocompact group actions...) satisfy that the following function $$ \frac{N_{\Gamma}(x, \rho)}{V(x, \rho)} $$ is equivalent when $\rho \to \infty$ to a decreasing function. So that I wondered if this property may be more general. Here is then my question, does the previous property always occur ? One can relax a bit the previous property as follow. There exists $\rho_0 \in \mathbb{R}_+$ such that there exists a constant $C>0$ such that for all $\rho_2 \ge \rho_1 \ge \rho_0$ we have : $$ \frac{N_{\Gamma}(x, \rho_2)}{V(x, \rho_2)} \le C \hspace{0.3cm} \frac{N_{\Gamma}(x, \rho_1)}{V(x, \rho_1)} \ .$$ From the homogeneity that enjoys the orbit $\Gamma \cdot x$, it seems quite natural to me that it actually holds, at least when the group is finitely generated, but I don't know how to get into it. Does someone has either a reference/an idea toward a proof or a counter example to this ? Thank you for your reading. 

The mathematical economist Kenneth Arrow showed in a landmark paper (stemming from his PhD thesis) that one obtains a contradiction if all five assumptions are assumed to hold. In fact, Assumptions (1) - (4) imply the existence of a dictator. However, these assumptions seem fairly reasonable and consistent, so the fact that they are contradictory is why Arrow named his paper “A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare”. His result is known nowadays as Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. 

On the first page of Chapter 1 of Rieffel's Deformation Quantization for Actions of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $, Rieffel defines a family of seminorms on the space $ A^{\infty} $ of smooth vectors of a Fréchet space $ A $, for some action $ \alpha $ of the Lie group $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $ on $ A $, as follows. Suppose we already have a family $ (\| \cdot \|_{i})_{i \in \mathbb{N}} $ of seminorms on $ A $ that determine its topology. Choose a basis $ \lbrace X_{1},\ldots,X_{d} \rbrace $ of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $. Then for each $ k \in \lbrace 1,\ldots,d \rbrace $, let $ \alpha_{X_{k}} $ denote the operator of partial differentiation on $ A^{\infty} $ in the direction of $ X_{k} $; we thus identify $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $ with its Lie algebra in the usual way. For convenience, denote $ \alpha_{X_{k}} $ simply by $ \partial_{k} $. Next, for any multi-index $ \mu = (\mu_{1},\ldots,\mu_{d}) \in \mathbb{N}_{0}^{d} $, let $ \partial^{\mu} $ denote the higher-order partial derivative $ \partial_{1}^{\mu_{1}} \cdots \partial_{d}^{\mu_{d}} $. Then equip $ A^{\infty} $ with the seminorms $$ \forall (j,k) \in \mathbb{N} \times \lbrace 1,\ldots,d \rbrace ~~ \& ~~ \forall a \in A^{\infty}: \quad \| a \|_{j,k} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \sup_{1 \leq i \leq j} \sum_{|\mu| \leq k} \frac{\| \partial^{\mu} a \|_{i}}{\mu!}, $$ where $ |\mu| \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \mu_{1} + \cdots + \mu_{d} $ and $ \mu! \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \mu_{1}! \cdots \mu_{d}! $. My question is: As we are applying partial derivatives to $ a \in A^{\infty} $, are we identifying $ a $ with the function $ f_{a}: \mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow A $ defined by $ {f_{a}}(\mathbf{x}) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \alpha(\mathbf{x},a) $? Thank you very much in advance! 

Let $M$ a compact manifold with surfaces $S_1,...,S_p$ as boundaries. Let us suppose that $M$ admits a complete hyperbolic structure. Then, from the ending lamination theorem, given either laminations or conformal structures (the end invariants) on $S_1...S_n$ one is able to find a unique complete hyperbolic structure on $M$ with ends $E_1,...E_N$ admitting exactly these end invariants. My question is, are these invariants localized in the ends ? More precisely, given $f$ a pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism of the surface $S_1$ and its associated lamination when $f$ is iterated in positive time. Then, one can consider the hyperbolic structure given by the ending lamination theorem associated to this lamination for the surface $S_1$ and with whatever end invariants you want for the rest of the surfaces ($S_2...S_N$). Does the resulting hyperbolic structure satisfies that the end associated to $S_1$ is asymptotically isometric to a $\mathbb{Z}$-cover of a hyperbolic compact 3-fold which fibers over the circle with fiber $S_1$ and monodromy $f$ ? I know from McMullen's book (theorem 3.12) $URL$ that this is true for one degenerated end quasi-Fuchsian manifolds or, more obviously, for $\mathbb{Z}$-cover of compact manifold I wondered whether this result may be generalised. A very first question is what happens if we consider two pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms $(\Phi_1, \Phi_2)$ for which the laminations given by iterating these in positive time are in transversal position. So that the sequence of quasi-Fuchsian manifolds given in Bers coordinates by $(\Phi_1^n, \Phi_2^n)$ converges by Thurston's theorem. Can I say that the end $E_1$ (resp $E_2$) of the limit representation are asymptotically isometric to the $Z$-covering of the compact manifold which fibres over the circle of monodromy $\Phi_1$ (resp $\Phi_2)$ ? Thank you for your reading. 

Let $ |A \rangle $ and $ |B \rangle $ be two non-zero vectors of a Hilbert space $ \mathcal{H} $ that belong to two different one-dimensional subspaces of $ \mathcal{H} $. According to Dirac, $ |A \rangle $ and $ |B \rangle $ represent two different quantum states. Now, consider two non-trivial superpositions of $ |A \rangle $ and $ |B \rangle $: $$ |R_{1} \rangle := a_{1} |A \rangle + b_{1} |B \rangle \quad \& \quad |R_{2} \rangle := a_{2} |A \rangle + b_{2} |B \rangle, $$ where non-trivial means that $ (a_{1},b_{1}),(a_{2},b_{2}) \in \mathbb{C}^{2} \setminus \lbrace (0,0) \rbrace $. If $ |R_{1} \rangle $ and $ |R_{2} \rangle $ are to represent the same quantum state, then they must lie in the same one-dimensional subspace of $ \mathcal{H} $, i.e., they must be non-zero scalar multiples of each other. Knowing this, write $ |R_{2} \rangle = \lambda |R_{1} \rangle $, where $ \lambda \in \mathbb{C}^{\times} $. As $ \lbrace |A \rangle,|B \rangle \rbrace $ is a linearly independent subset of $ \mathcal{H} $, it follows that the condition $ (a_{2},b_{2}) = \lambda (a_{1},b_{1}) $ must be met. This condition does not hold for all choices of $ (a_{1},b_{1}) $ and $ (a_{2},b_{2}) $ in $ \mathbb{C}^{2} \setminus \lbrace (0,0) \rbrace $. Therefore, in general, $ |R_{1} \rangle $ does not represent the same quantum state as $ |R_{2} \rangle $. 

Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemannian three-fold such that $H_2(M,\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}$ and $S$ any surface representing 1. By Hodge theory there exist a harmonic differential one-form $\eta$ dual to the surface $S$, meaning for all closed 2-form $\alpha$ we have : \begin{equation} \int_M \eta \wedge \alpha = \int_S \alpha \end{equation} and \begin{equation} \Delta \eta = 0 \end{equation} where $\Delta$ is the Hodge De Rham Laplacian acting on one-forms. My question is : does it possible to control the $L^1$ and the $L^2$ norm of $\eta$ with geometric quantities ? I was thinking about the following : any such $\eta$ gives an application $M \to \mathbb{S}^1$ by integrating $\eta$ on any path and takes the result modulo $\mathbb{Z}$ (it does not depend of the path by the assumptions on $\eta$ to be an integer class and being closed). Therefore, by the co-area formula, I expect the $L^1$ norm to be related to the area of surfaces representing $S$, the minimal one for instance. 

Let $M_{\Gamma}$ a Riemannian covering of a closed compact manifold $(M,g)$ with deck transformation $\Gamma$ (its neutral element will be denoted by $e$). If we denote by $p_t^{\Gamma}(x,y)$ the heat kernel associated to $M_{\Gamma}$ does the following proposition occurs : There exist a probability measure $\mu$ on $\Gamma$ such that the associated random walk on $\Gamma$ of law $\mu^{*n}$ satisfies that there exists two constants $C_1, C_2 > 0$ and a point $x \in M_{\Gamma}$ such that : $$ C_2 \mu^{*n}(e,e) \le p_n^{\Gamma}(x,x) \le C_1 \mu^{*n}(e,e) $$ 

Each voter can have any set of rational preferences. This requirement is called “universal admissibility”. If a voter prefers Candidate A to Candidate B, and Candidate B to Candidate C, then he/she prefers A to C. This requirement is called “transitivity”. If every voter prefers A to B, then the group prefers A to B. This is sometimes called the “unanimity” condition. If every voter prefers A to B, then any change in preferences that does not affect this relationship must not affect the group preference for A over B. For example, if a set of historians unanimously decides that Abraham Lincoln was a better president than Chester A. Arthur, a changing opinion of Bill Clinton should not affect this decision. This more subtle requirement is called “independence from irrelevant alternatives”. There are no dictators. In other words, no voter exists whose preferences determine the preferences of the whole group. 

In the mathematical theory of social welfare, it is possible to create a list of axioms that lead to a contradiction. For example, in voting theory, the following axioms for a voting system are considered reasonable in order for the system to qualify as being fair:
