Agent 1 must receive more than $(n-1)/n$ of the cake, so he must receive something from each of his $n$ desired slices. Each of the other $n-1$ agents must still receive a positive slice. Hence, we must use two cuts for each agent $i\geq 2$, and the total number of required cuts is $2(n-1)$. We saw above that this lower bound is tight for $n=2$, since there always exists a weighted-proportional division with 2 cuts. So the following question is interesting for $n\geq 3$ agents: Does there always exist a weighted-proportional partition with $2n-2$ cuts? 

Intuitively, the 3-clique seems to be the worst case, since when there are many vertices, the expected number of good edges is $3/4$. So my conjecture is that the real value is 2/3. In other words: Conjecture. For every finite graph $G$, $p(G,2/3)>1/2$. Is this true? Alternatively, can you prove tighter bounds? 

When $r=2$ a cage is just a cycle with $g$ nodes, so cages usually become interesting only for $r\geq 3$. I am interested in a "directed cage": a smallest directed graph with the following properties: 

We already know that the procedure for 2 agents uses 2 additional cuts, so all in all we need 4 cuts. In the above cake, there is indeed a good piece, for example, the second slice. It is worth 1.1 for Agent #2 and 0.3 for Agent #1, which is well within the purple region (the sum of adjusted weights is 0.97). Indeed, if this slice is given to Agent #3, then the remainder can be easily divided between Agents #1 and #2 using two cuts. MY CONJECTURE IS that, if Way 1 and Way 2 are impossible, then there must be a good piece. Moreover, I conjecture it may be possible to simplify the definition of a "good piece" as follows: \begin{align*} (p_1+p_3)\cdot x + p_2\cdot y \leq Q \\ \text{ and } \\ p_1\cdot x + (p_2+p_3)\cdot y \leq Q \end{align*} 

In a cover problem, there is a complex shape (e.g. a polygon), and we have to find a set of simpler shapes (e.g. squares or rectangles), such that their union is exactly equal to the complex shape. A partition problem is similar, but the simpler shapes must be disjoint. I am looking into a intermediate problem: there is a complex shape, and we have to partition it into k disjoint pieces (where k is a given constant), and then cover each of the pieces with simple shapes (not necessarily disjoint). For lack of a better name, I call it: a k-part-cover problem. In this terminology, the 1-part-cover problem is the usual cover problem. I am mainly interesting in covering an axis-aligned polygon with axis-aligned squares, but other scenarios are also welcome. The interesting questions are: 

The family of rectangles has the cover property, i.e.: For every $R\geq 1$, $k\geq 1$: every rectangle with aspect ratio $kR$ can be exactly covered by $\lceil k\rceil$ (possibly overlapping) rectangles of aspect ratio at most $R$. I am trying to generalize this property to arbitrary convex shapes, using the following natural generalization of the aspect ratio concept: (side length of smallest containing square) / (side length of largest contained square) This factor can be termed slimness factor, as many papers define an "$R$-fat shape" as a shape for which this factor is at most $R$. So, for example, the slimness factor of a square is 1, the slimness factor of a circle is $\sqrt 2$, etc. The slimness factor of a rectangle is identical to its aspect ratio, so this is indeed a proper generalization of the aspect ratio concept. However, the cover property is not true when the slimness factor is used instead of the aspect ratio. For example, taking $R=1$, the only shape with slimness factor 1 is a square, but obviously most convex shapes cannot be exactly covered by a finite number of squares. So, my question is: Does there exist an $R$ such that every convex shape with slimness factor $kR$ can be exactly covered by $\lceil k\rceil$ convex shapes of slimness factor at most $R$? 

First, consider only the 4 points near the x axis (blue). We can consider only squares between adjacent points, because squares between non-adjacent points can be shrinked to touch only adjacent points. Between each of the 3 pairs of adjacent points, there are 2 options to draw a square: either above the x axis, or below it. There is a small overlap between these 2 squares, so only one square per pair is possible: Second, consdier the point at the top of the y axis (red). Any square that uses this point must have a side-length of at least 6 in order to approach the x axis. Any such square necessarily blocks at least two of the cyan squares above the x axis. Additionally, the leftmost square is slightly larger than 6 and thus also blocks the middle cyan square below the x axis. The two extreme options are plotted below in magenta: 

Two points $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are called antipodal if $x = -y$. Stated differently, $x,y$ are antipodal if: 

So what is the correct expression? Can Alice always force Bob to get at most $O(m^{1/k})$? Or can Bob always get at least $\Omega(k\cdot m^{1/k})$? 

These conditions are obviously not necessary. For example, the following set-family is simple: $$ H = \{ \{1,2\}, \{2,3\}, \{3,1\} \}$$ since for every $g=\{x,y\}$, if $H\cap g$ contains the set $\{x,y\}$, then it does not contain the empty set. What is a simple combinatorial characterization of the simple set-families? cross-posted from math.SE 

In this case, the middle $R$ corner is contained in exactly one maximal rectangle (the red one) and we are done. Case B: The eastern side is between two adjacent $L$ corners: 

They leave open the case in which $w$ is a fraction whose denominator is less than $n$. The smallest such case is: $Ints(4,1/3)$. There, the lower bound is 2 and the upper bound is 3. Has there been any advancement in this question since 1985? In particular: is it possible to cut 2 intervals of a circle, such that all 4 measures value it as exactly $1/3$? EDIT: I asked Prof. Stromquist and he said he is not aware of new results since 1985. So the question is still open. 

I am mainly interested in questions such as: how to characterize / identify $d$-dimensional families; what other interesting $d$-dimensional families exist? EDIT: The motivation to this definition comes from probability. Let $X$ be a random variable whose possible values are sets from the family $S$. I would like to prove claims such as "If the size of $X$ is at least $j$, then it must contain one of the (deterministic) subsets $W_{j,t}$". EDIT 2: I now found out that what I called "1-dimensional family" is actually called: Filtration. So, my question becomes: is there a natural extension of filtration to two or more dimensions (as explained above)? 

Many important results in Fair cake-cutting were published in the American Mathematical Monthly. An early example is: Dubins and Spanier, 1961. A more recent example is: Su, 1999. 

If $f_1$ and $f_2$ are concavifiable, then the answer is "yes", since we can choose $g_1,g_2$ such that $g_1\circ f_1$ and $g_2\circ f_2$ are concave, which makes their sum concave too, and concavity implies quasic If $f_1$ and $f_2$ are are only weakly quasiconcave, then the answer is "not always", as shown by the example of Taneli Huuskonen below 

Given an integer $k$, we would like a family of $k$-sized sets such that, in any coloring of the items with two colors, at least one set is single-colored. What is the smallest number of sets we need? Obviously $s(1)=1$, and it is easy to prove that $s(2)=3$. What about $k\geq 3$? As a side-question: I often run into similar questions regarding set-families, and I feel I am missing some background to approach them. What is a good textbook to study about such problems? 

The cake-cutting game is usually played between individuals. What if we try to play it between groups? 

Let $f_1,f_2$ be two smooth quasiconcave functions defined on a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. It is known that $f_1+f_2$ is not necessarily quasiconcave. Does there always exist monotonically increasing functions $g_1,g_2$ such that the sum $g_1\circ f_1 + g_2\circ f_2$ is quasiconcave? The motiavation to this question is economic. In economics, it is often assumed that people have quasiconcave utilities: if they are indifferent between $x$ and $y$, then they prefer $(x+y)/2$ to $x$ and to $y$, which is (approximately) the definition of quasiconcavity. Given two or more people, we would like to create a social welfare function by taking the sum of the utility functions of the agents. In general, such a sum is not guaranteed to be quasiconcave. However, a utility function is only a numeric representation of a preference-relation, so we are allowed to transform it using arbitrary monotone transformations and it will still represent the same preference. The question is: can we always transform the utility functions of the agents such that the resulting social-welfare function be quasiconcave? There are two cases for which I know the answer. 

The case for the point at the bottom of the y axis (red) is the same. All in all, a maximum set of disjoint squares can be drawn in only the following ways (ordered in an increasing order fo the number of magenta squares): 

Two sub-problems in which the lower bound can be attained In both sub-problems, assume that the cake is a circle and all agents value it as $Q = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$. Sub-problem A: three agents, two equal weights there are $n=3$ agents, two of whom have the same entitlement, e.g. $p_1=p_2$. The lower bound is $2n-2=4$ cuts. The following protocol matches this bound: 

This construction can be duplicated and translated a long distance to the left and bottom (for example). For every duplication, we get more 6 points and more 4 squares, but an additional square can be added between two adjacent duplicates. This gives a bound of: $p(6k)\leq 5k-1$ for every integer $k$, i.e. $p(n)/n \lesssim 5/6$. A further improvement can probably be achieved by creating 6 copies of the construction, arranged in just the same way as the original construction. This can be continued recursively like a fractal, and gives $p(6^k)\leq 4\cdot(6^{k-1}+...+1) = 4\cdot\frac{6^k}{5}$ for every integer $k$, i.e., $p(n)/n \lesssim 4/5$. 

The practical problem is probably NP-hard in the general case (it is known to be NP-hard even when k=1), but there may be approximations or solutions for specific cases, such as simply-connected or convex polygons. 

In "Consensus-halving via theorems of Borsuk-Ulam and Tucker", Su and Simmons describe a way to divide a cake to two parts such that each of $n-1$ people believe the parts have the same value. This can be done with $n-1$ cuts ($n$ pieces), which is optimal. Once we have such a division, we can let the $n$-th person choose which half is better. Now, regardless of how the groups are divided, all people in each group believe that the value of their group is at least $1/2$. So we have a group division in which the number of pieces is equal to the total number of people, which is optimal. So for 2 groups, the problem is solved. The case of $k>2$ groups is mentioned as a conjecture in their Open Problems section. 

I am are interested in an intermediate case, in which $T$ may depend on the coloring but only in a restricted way. As an example, suppose all the subjects in $O$ are placed on the real line, and $T$ must be an interval. $T$ may depend on the coloring, so it is a random variable and the standard concentration inequalities do not apply. However, the restriction to an interval means that an adversary cannot always select $T$ to contain $t$ red subjects. Therefore we may hope to have a non-trivial upper bound on the imbalance $\abs{|T^R|-|T^G|}$. In this draft, I developed some high-probability concentration inequalities for some families of random-sets (including the interval case and some generalizations). I thought of submitting it for publication in some letters journal, but then I had a feeling that this might be a known result. So, my question is: what are some known concentration inequalities for random sets? 

Sub-problem B: $n$ agents, $n-1$ equal weights there are $n$ agents, $n-1$ of them have an entitlement of 1, and the $n$-th agent has an entitlement of $Q-(n-1)$, for some integer $Q$. The following protocol matches the lower bound of $2n-2$ cuts: 

The following paper apparently addresses exactly the question that you are interested in: A General Elicitation-free Protocol for Allocating Indivisible Goods, by: Sylvain Bouveret and Jérôme Lang, International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2011). 

There is no arc of length 3 that is worth at least 3 for Agent 1 and at most 3 for Agent 2; no arc that is worth 2 for Agent 2 and at most 2 for Agent 1; and no arc of length 1 that is worth at most 1 for both Agent 2 and Agent 1; But all is not lost. It is possible to relax the requirement of Way 3. For each arc of length $p_3$, let $x\cdot p_3$ be its value to Agent 1 and $y\cdot p_3$ its value to Agent 2. So the value of the remaining cake to Agent 1 is $Q-x\cdot p_3$ and to Agent 2 is $Q-y\cdot p_3$. If we want to divide the remaining cake fairly between Agent 1 and Agent 2, we must give the former at least ${p_1 \over Q-x\cdot p_3}$ of the remaining value and the latter at least ${p_2 \over Q-y\cdot p_3}$ of the remaining value. Motivated by this observation, let's call a piece "good" if: $$ {p_1 \over Q-x\cdot p_3} + {p_2 \over Q-y\cdot p_3} < 1$$ otherwise call it "bad". In the linked graph, the purple region represents the good pieces and the white region to its top-right represents the bad pieces. If there exists a good piece (in the purple region), then we can cut this piece (using 2 cuts) and give it to Agent 3. The remaining cake can be divided between Agent 1 and Agent 2 using the procedure for two agents, with modified weights. The new weights are determined such that: 

A 2-rep-tile is a geometric shape that can be partitioned into exactly 2 smaller (dilated) copies of itself. Although there are many rep-tiles of higher orders, the only 2-rep-tiles I could find are: A. A right-angled isosceles triangle: 

This is inefficient since it makes $Q-1$ cuts on the cake, giving each agent a large number of "crumbs" (when $Q$ is large). When there are $n=2$ agents, there is a solution that requires only 2 cuts, regardless of $Q$. To simplify the presentation, assume that the entire cake is worth exactly $Q$ to both agents. Also, assume that the two endpoints of the cake are identified, so that it is topologically a circle. 

Prof. Werner Gueth, an economist known for inventing of the Ultimatum game, recently wrote a poem summarizing his research work. It is called "Poem with Endnotes and References", published in Homo Oeconomicus 30(1): 113-118: $URL$ 

I "invented" a concept and it feels like it has already been invented before. I would like to know whether such a concept exists and if so, what is its name? 

Every pair of antipodal points is a multipodal set of size 2. Here are some multipodal sets of size 3: 

Let $g: S^n \to R^n$ be a continuous odd function (i.e. $g(-x)=-g(x)$ for all $x$). The Borsuk-Ulam theorem implies that $g$ has a zero, i.e. there is an $x$ such that $g(x)=(0,0,...,0)$. Suppose $g$ is (1,1,...,1) on the positive orthant (i.e. when all its $n$ arguments are non-negative) and (-1,-1,...,-1) on the negative orthant. Is this true that for every constant $r\in [-1,1]$, there is an $x$ such that $g(x)=(r,r,...,r)$? For $n=1$, this is obviously true by the intermediate value theorem. Under what conditions is it true for $n>1$? The question seems closely related to the Poincare-Miranda theorem, which is a generalization of the IVT to multi-dimensional cubes, but so far I haven't found the connection.
