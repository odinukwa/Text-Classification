(I am looking for bounds that are much better that what you get when $G$ is replaced by the free group in two generators) ? Other kind of question: 

I kind of get lost in the immense literature on the subject. As is well-known, there are four types of proper maximal subgroups of $Gl_2(\mathbb F_\ell)$, which are (1) Borel subgroups, (2) (resp. (3)) Normalizer of split (resp. non-split) Cartan subgroups, (4) exceptional ones (icsoahedral, dodecahedral, etc), so if $\rho_{E,\ell}$ fails to be surjective, it lands in a subgroup of one of those type, and we can define four integers $M^i(E)$ for $i=1,..,4$ ,as the smallest integer such that for $\ell$ larger that $M^i(E)$, $\rho_{E,\ell}$ does not fall into a subgroup of type (i). Please tell me if I am not correct (I am troubled by Lemma 17 page 197 of this paper of Serre) , but it is known that $M^4(E)$,$M^1(E)$,$M^2(E)$ are bounded by an absolute constant (independent of $E$) due to results of Serre, Mazur, and Bilu-Parent (respectively and in chronological order, the last one being very recent). So the only problem that remains for Serre's uniformity conjecture would be to bound $M^3(E)$ uniformly, and for my question to bound it at least in terms of $N(E)$. 

The answer is yes, I think, $S(G)$ is Frobenian. (Edited: actually, as noticed by Rabelais and the OP, there is a gap if the representation $r_i$ below are not all irreducible. I leave the argument as it still gives a positive answer in the case where all faithful rep. of $G$ of dim $n$ are irreducible -- for instance, when $G$ is non-abelian and $n=2$). Let $(r_i)$ for $i=1,\dots,a$ the list of all faithful complex representations of $G$ of dimension $n$. Let $(\rho_{i,j})_{i,j=1,\dots,b_i}$ the set of irreducible representations appearing as a component of $r_i$. Let $K_{i,j}$ be the field of rationality of $\rho_{i,j}$. There is a unique (up to $\mathbb K_{i,j}$-isomorphism) central simple algebra $D_{i,j}$ together with a map $\tilde \rho_{i,j}: G \rightarrow D_{i,j}$ which after tenderization by $\mathbb C$ gives back $\rho_{i,j}$. 

Let $T$ be a torus over a non-necessary perfect field $k$. Let $\bar k$ an algebraic closure of $k$. Is there a smallest extension $k'$ of $k$ in $\bar k$ such that $T \times_{{\rm spec}\, k} {\rm spec}\, k'$ is split over $k'$? (I have asked this on stack exchange, but did not receive a satisfactory answer) 

I am reading Bjorn Poonen's very nice survey on Hilbert's Tenth problem ($URL$ and while I believe I understand the mathematics well, I have widespread difficulties with the meta-mathematics of these questions. To illustrate them, and to ask a question that is answerable and whose answer might be helpful for me, let me focus on one little passage of this paper, that concerns not directly Matthiasevich's theorem that the tenth problem has a negative solution but an older, weaker version : "[...] the work of K. Godel, A. Church, and A. Turing in the 1930s made it clear that there was no algorithm for solving the [...] problem of deciding the truth of first-order sentences over $\mathbb{Z}$". (page 6) 

I agree with David: I think that my job as a referee consists mainly in checking that the proofs are correct. However, checking that the proof is correct can in practice not be done by line-by-line checking. Referees are not computers, nor are the writers of the articles. Rather I have a kind of critical, "falsificationist" approach. I try to see what are the principal steps of the proof. If the article is well-written, this work has been done by the authors. Each of those stepsis an assertion, and I try to disporve it. Is it in contradiction with something I know? Can I find a counter-example? If I can't I begin to believe a little in this one step, so I try to prove it myself. If it's too hard, I read the proof of the argument (if there is one!) and apply th same method th understand and check it. 

For example, with sage I have computed approximation of the values of $M_{8,a}$ for $a=1,3,5,7$, and I find numbers close to $-0.28,0.16,0.00,-0.11$ making the "team 3" the clear winner. 

(Remark:the answer to the question of Serre is a natural integer, not yes or no, but since this integer is less than the degree of $P$, obviously it can be transformed into a finite set of "yes or no" questions). I am an absolute beginner in complexity theory. I made some research on the web this morning and yesterday, but I didn't find an answer or anything close. My question may be very basic and a reference to a text discussing this kind of questions would be a perfectly nice answer. 

Now I claim that the answer to the second question is also negative. Here is a counter-example: take $f=\Delta^3$, $\mathcal O=\mathbb Z$, $\mathfrak P = 2\mathbb Z$. Then for all odd prime $p$, one has $T_p f \equiv 0$ or $T_p f \equiv \Delta$, but never $T_p f \equiv \alpha f$ for $\alpha \in \mathbb F_2$. Thus any $(a,b)$ gives a counter-example. 

I have made some computations which seem to corroborate the OP's conjecture, namely that for any $n$ there exists a $N$, such that for every polynomial $P$ of degree $n$, with positive integral coefficients and content 1, the quantity $$g(P):= g.c.d(\phi(P(x)),x \geq 1)$$ divides $N$. For $n=1$, as the OP says, one can take $N=8$ as proved by Serre. For $n=2$, it seems that one can take $N=2^4 3^2 = 144$. It seems even more that one cannot do better, because for $P(x)=16x^2+32x+17$, I get experimentally $g(P)=16$ (this must not be hard to prove but I haven't tried), and for $P(x)=27 x^2 + 9x+1$, I get $g(P)=18$. So $144 | N$. On the other hand I have need been able to find any $P$ such that $g(P)$ was not a divisor of $144$. For $n=3$ or $n=4$, I have failed to find any $P$ with $g(P)\geq 2$. This suggests $N=2$ in these cases. 

Let me first note that there is a slight ambiguity when one says "ramified only at 2". Strictly speaking, that means that the extension is unramified at every place of $\mathbb Q$ except 2, including infinity. The latter mean that the extension is totally real. Often, however, "ramified only at 2" means "ramified only possibly at 2 and $\infty$", and it is probably what you mean. Here, to remove ambiguity, for $S$ a finite set of places of $\mathbb Q$, I will use "ramified only at $S$" in the strict sense. That being said, the short answer is that whatever the finite set $S$, there are strong restrictions on the finite groups $G$ that can appear as the Galois group of an extension of $\mathbb Q$ unramified outside at $S$, but that in general, to "describe" all these restrictions (we may mean different things by that) is in general an open problem. To see what kind of restrictions can appear, let us consider several situation, from the very particular to the general. If $S=\emptyset$ or $S=\{\infty\}$, then Minkowski's theorem tell that there is no nontrivial extension unramified outside $S$, so the only possible Galois group $G$ is the trivial one. A very strong restriction indeed. If $S$ is any set, but you try to determine what abelian $G$ may appear, then the answer is given by class field theory. Precisely, if $S=\{\ell_1,\dots,\ell_k,\infty\}$, then the abelian group which appear are the ones that are quotient of $\mathbb Z_{ell_1}^\ast \times \dots \mathbb Z_{\ell_k}^\ast$, and it is obvious that many abelian groups are not of this type (e.g. $\mathbb Z/\ell \mathbb Z$ for $\ell > \ell_1,\dots,\ell_k$). If $S=\{\ell_1,\dots,\ell_k\}$, replace $\mathbb Z_{ell_1}^\ast \times \dots \mathbb Z_{\ell_k}^\ast$ by its quotient by the diagonal subgroup $\{1,-1\}$. If $S$ is any set, and you're interested in groups $G$ that are $p$-groups (for a $p$ that may or may nor be in $S$), then again, class field theory can help you because of Frattini's argument saying that a $p$-group is generated by any set that maps subjectively to the maximal abelian $p$-torsion quotient of $G$. So by the above, the $p$-groups $G$ appearing this way have a system of generators with less elements than the dimension over $\mathbb F_p$ of the maximal $p$-torsion quotient of $\mathbb Z_{ell_1}^\ast \times \dots \mathbb Z_{\ell_k}^\ast$. Is that all? No. We can describe in some cases all the $p$-group $G$ appearing, but not in all. For instance, with $S=\{2,\infty\}$, and $p=2$, the groups $G$ appearing are exactly the $2$-groups having a system of two generators, one of them being of square 1. For $S=\{2\}$, the only $2$-groups appearing are the cyclic groups. In general, the case $p \in S$ is better understood than the case $p \not \in S$. In the latter case, it is a folklore conjecture, on which not much is known, that only finitely many $p$-groups $G$ appearing (one can check readily that the conjecture is true for abelian $p$-groups, by the above paragraph). If now we consider general finite groups $G$, well, the above shows that there are restrictions, but determining them all is largely open. For instance, a conjecture of Shafarevich states that there is an $n=n(S)$ such that every group $G$ which is the Galois group of an extension unramified outside $S$ has a system of generators with less than $n$ elements. But this is open in every non-trivial case. Let me also mention a simple but too little known result of Serre, even if it is not strictly speaking part of your question: [Edit: Sorry, I messed up the statement of the result. Here is the right version]. If every finite group is a Galois group over $\mathbb Q$ (if the inverse galois problem has a positive solution) then every finite group is the Galois group of an extension of $\mathbb Q$ unramified at infinity -- that is, a real extension. In other words, according to the inverse Galois problem, there should need no restriction of $G$ in the case where $S$ is the set containing all finite places, but not the place at infinity. 

Fix $0 < \alpha < 1$ a real. Let $S_\alpha$ the set of integers $n \geq 1$ such that be $\phi(n)>\alpha n$. For $x>0$, let $S_\alpha(x)$ be the number of positive integers $n$ less han $x$ such that $n \in S_\alpha$. 

It is clear that $d$ is finite, more precisely $d(q,n) \leq n(q-1)$. Indeed, for $f = \prod_{i=1}^n \prod_{\alpha \in \mathbb F_q^\ast} (X_i-\alpha)$, $Z(f)$ is the complement of the origin. It is also easy to see that $d(q,n) \geq q$, because if $f$ is a polynomial of degree $d<q$, the cardinality of $Z(f)$ is divisible by the characteristic $p$ of $\mathbb F_q$ (Chevalley-Warning), and $\leq d q^{n-1}$ (Schwartz-Zippel), which gives two independent proofs that it cannot be $q^n-1$. One has $d(2,2)=2$ (e.g. $f(x,y)=xy$ has three zeros) and $d(2,3)=3$ (the zeros of the degree 3 polynomial $f(x,y,z)=1+x+y+z+xy+xz+yz+xyz$ are everything but the origin, and it is not hard to see that you can't do that with a degree 2 polynomial). But what is the value of $d$ in general? 

I have given a 3-hour course trying to help mathematical students with an English background to read papers in French. You can find notes here. 

There are several ways to normalize the Galois representation attached to a modular eigenform, which differ by a Tate twist, but when you choose one normalization, no Tate twist of a Galois representation attached to a modular form can ever be attached to another modular form. One way to see this is the following: the Galois representation attached to a form of weight $k$ has, for my preferred normalization, a determinant $\omega^{k-1} \epsilon$, where $\omega$ is the cyclotomic character and $\epsilon$ a finite-order character (the nebentypus). It has also Hodge-Tate weights at $p$ equal to $0$ and $k-1$. If you twist by a power of the cyclotomic, you will change the power of $\omega$ in the determinant, but not the difference between the Hodge-Tate weights, so something will not be right. Hence the answer to your second question is negative. For the first, it is positive, in the sense that if $V$ is attached to a modular form $f$, $V^\ast(1)$ is also up to a twist (or no twist, depending on the way you normalize $V$) attached to a modular form (which is $f$ itself in the case of trivial nebentypus). That simply because dual of representations of dimension 2 are isomorphic to themselves, up to a twist by the inverse of their determinant. But it seems that your real question has to do with Galois cohomology. I am surprised that you need to know that your representation is associated to a modular form, because I know of no theorem in Galois cohomology which applies only to Galois rep. attached to modular forms. What do you have in mind? 

I would already be interested in the case where $G$ is abelian. In this case the question takes a more classical form, which I explicit in case some readers are uncomfortable with Chebotarev. We can assume that $G=(\mathbb Z/a\mathbb Z)^\ast$. Then $D$ is a subset of $G^k$ invariant by permutation of the coordinates. The set $A$ is then the set of integers $n=p_1\dots p_k$ such that $(p_1 \pmod{a},\dots,p_k \pmod{a})$ is in $D$, and the question is still to find an equivalent for the number $A(x)$ of such integers $n$ which are $\leq x$. Edit: I have made some computations in the simplest non trivial abelian case. This is the case $k=2$, and $L=Q(i)$ so that $G={1,-1}$ and $Frob_p$ for an odd $p$ is just $p \mod{4}$. You have $3$ basic subsets $D$ of $G^2$ invariant by $S_2$ which are $D_1 = \{(1,1)\}$, $D_0=\{(1,-1),(-1,1)\}$, $D_{-1}=\{(-1,-1)\}$. The corresponding sets of integers are the sets $$A_1=\{2-\text{almost primes } n=pq,\ \ p\equiv q \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\}$$ $$A_0 =\{2-\text{almost primes } n,\ \ n\equiv -1 \pmod{4}\}$$ $$A_{-1}=\{2-\text{almost primes } n=pq,\ \ p\equiv q \equiv -1 \pmod{4} \}.$$ I strongly expect in this case that the $A_{-1},A_1,A_0$ take respectively a proportion $1/4,1/4,1/2$ (or $|D|/|G|^2$) of all $2$-almost primes. If true, this is probably not to hard to prove by the method indicated by Lucia in comment. However, I have not been able to "see this" in the computation. For $x=10^7$, for instance, those proportions are $0.300,0.200,0.500$; for $x=5 \cdot 10^7$, they are $0.292,0.500,0.208$. I think the domination of products of two primes congruent to $-1$ above the products of two primes congruent to $1$ is well explained by the "primes race": the advantage of primes congruent to $-1$ among small primes is felt even more for the product of two primes. But this has discouraged me of making more computations to guess the correct value of the constant $c$... 

Of course, there are already an enormous amount, still growing fast, of arithmetic informations obtained from the local pieces of eigenvarieties. But what for the global structure? Let me mention the only one I know: the global existence of the eigencurve (say) is necessary to be able to attached to any overconvergent finite slope modular form a Galois representation. With Coleman's families alone, we could construct those representations only for these forms having a weight sufficiently close p-adically to a non-negative integer (for example the one with negative weights). Yet I find this application not very convincing, as why do we care about overconvergent form with weight far away from integers except for their being the "flesh" of the eigencurve? So what other applications do you have in mind? (edited for one typo) 

I would also be interested to know the answer in special cases (of $K$, $\chi$, $p$) where Leopoldt's conjecture is not known. 

Of course, $n \in S_\alpha$ if and only if $\prod_{p \mid n} (1-1/p) > \alpha$, where the product is over prime factors of $n$. But I am not sure where to go from here. 

The question is a little too vague to have a really satisfactory answer, but obviously descent is omnipresent in (modular) representation theory. For example, the basic result that two representations of a group $G$ on some $k$-vector spaces are isomorphic iff they become isomorphic on some extension $L$ of $k$ is an instance of faithfully flat descent. Or to take a less trivial example, let $R$ be a d.v.r with residual field $k$ algebraically closed (or just separably closed, or finite, or...) and of field of fraction $K$. Let $\rho$ be a representation of a group $G$ on some extension $L$ of $K$, whose characteristic polynomials of element of $g$ are in $R[x]$. (In characteristic zero, you can replace that condition by "character takes values in $R$"). A natural question in this context is if you can "descend" $\rho$ to a representation over $R$. For example, the answer is yes when there exists a representation of $G$ over $k$ which is absolutely irreducible and whose characteristic polynomial agree with the reduction of those of $\rho$. The proof uses a lot of faithfully flat descent via the theory of Azumaya algebras. Edit: to answer Martin's comment, I precise how the faithful flatness plays a role in the first example. Lemma: Let $G$ be a group. Let $k$ be a commutative noetherian ring, $k'$ a flat $k$-algebra. Let $M$, $N$, be $k[G]$-module, finitely generated as $k$-modules. let $M'=M \otimes_k k'$ and $N'=N\otimes_k k'$. Then $Hom_{k[G]}(M,N) \otimes_k k' = Hom_{k'[G]}(M',N')$. Moreover if $k'$ is a faithfully flat $k$-algebra, $Hom_{k[G]}(M,N)$ is non-zero if and only if $Hom_{k'[G]}(M',N')$ is non-zero. Pf: Let $g_1,\dots,g_n$ be a finite family of elements of $g$ generating the image of $k[G]$ in $End_{k}(N)$. Let $t_i$ be the linear endomorphism of $H:=Hom_{k}(M,N)$ given by $\phi \mapsto \phi g_i - g_i \phi$. Consider the map $H \rightarrow H^n$ given by the $t_i$. The kernel of this map is $Hom_{k[G]}(M,N)$. the kernel of the same map tensorized by $k'$ is $Hom_{k'[G]}(M',N')$. Hence the first result by flatness. The second is clear by faithful flatness. So for example, if $k$, $k'$ are field, $M$, $N$ simple $k[G]$-modules, one retrieve the classical assertion that $M \simeq N$ off $M' \simeq N'$. But I hope I have shown that the essence of this assertion is faithfully flat descent.
