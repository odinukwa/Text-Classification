Stars are far from perfect blackbodies due to scattering/reflection. This is especially true for hotter stars, because of all the free electrons, but even cooler stars can reflect a significant amount. For example, in aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/19/aa1009.pdf you will see that they use a reflection albedo of 0.30 for the K star and 1.00 for the F star, but the latter number is not meant to be taken seriously, they simply don't care if the light is reflected or absorbed and re-emitted because it isn't an important term. But the value of 0.30 for the K star might be meant more seriously, though it is still not regarded as a critical parameter because it only affects the color of the light that is reflected, not the total amount of light (given that stars are in radiative equilibrium, so must ultimately return all the incident light, whether it happens by reflection or heating). Indeed, stellar emissions are often characterized by "effective temperature," to connect the surface flux of a star to the Stefan-Boltzmann formula for the emission of a blackbody by using a T parameter that is not necessarily the actual temperature. When using this notion, as is quite common for dealing with stars, there is no essential difference between heating of and reflection from the surface of the star in question. The details of the difference have to do with the shape of the spectrum, but that shape is generally not a Planck function anyway, so as soon as one is using the "effective temperature" concept one has already parted company from a detailed understanding of the shape of the spectrum. (When you do want the details of the spectrum, you will have to model the situation with some care.) You are right that the albedo depends on the type of star (hotter stars having high scattering albedo due to all those free electrons), and many stars do show a lot of scattering from their surfaces. Scattering/reflection elevates the effective temperature above the actual temperature of the layers being looked at, but again, if you stick to effective temperature, it makes no difference if there is scattering or heating of a blackbody, because effective temperature explicitly refers to the outgoing flux with no claims on the actual temperature. It is quite common for this distinction to be swept under the rug, and most stellar temperatures are effective temperatures, not actual temperatures. Another consequence of radiative equilibrium is that the "reflection effect" cannot alter the total luminosity of the binary system seen from all angles, so if the effective temperature of the surface of the stars is elevated by reflection and/or heating, as seen from some directions, this must be exactly compensated by the reduced brightness due to eclipses seen from other directions. So the reflection effect is part of the study of eclipse light curves, which are quite useful for understanding things like the sizes of the stars. 

I'm in doubt whether I should put this in the astronomy or rather the coding exchange, but since my interest goes out to the former I will try my luck here. Suppose I have an image with a certain pixel scale $x$. I would like to rebin this to a larger pixel scale, $y$, but this is not an integer multiple - so I can't say, for instance, that every group of 4 pixels in the original grid will now be one big pixel in the new grid, and average their flux. Rather, I'd like something like i.e. $y=2.3\cdot x$. Is this routinely done in the astronomical community -- and if so, how? 

This should be a straightforward exercise, but I'm struggling. Help is much appreciated I would like to parameterize a Navarro-Frenk-White profile with one parameter, using the correlation between total mass and the concentration. As a starting point, I have the density in terms of two parameters: the total dark matter mass inside the virial radius $r_{vir}$, and the concentration parameter $c=r_{vir}/r_{s}$: $\rho_{DM}(r) = \frac{M_{DM}}{4\pi A(c)}\frac{1}{r(r_{s}+r)^{2}}$ where the function $A(c)$ is given by $A(c) = \ln{(1+c)} - \frac{c}{1+c} $ Using the correlation between $M_{DM}$ and $c$ (from e.g. Napolitano et al. 2005) $c(M_{DM}) \approx 9.195 \left(\frac{M_{DM}}{h^{-1}10^{12} M_{\odot}} \right)^{-0.094}$ it should then in principle be possible to parameterize $\rho_{DM}$ as a function of $M_{DM}$ only. This is how they do it in e.g. Williams et al. 2009. However, I'm not managing to reproduce that. Sure, given the correlation above, $M_{DM}$ determines $A(c)$, but won't $\rho_{DM}$ still depend on $r_{s}$? 

The Sun is white, in the sense that you can hold up a white piece of paper to it and see no color, it's what our eyes have adapted to. And it is a dwarf, in the sense that it is a main-sequence star, and all such stars are called dwarfs. But it is definitely not a white dwarf, that's a much smaller (size of Earth) and much older star. The names are not always very clear! 

One should distinguish the "Roche limit" from the "Roche lobe," as the latter is what you need when you have two objects of similar mass, like a binary star. The Roche lobe is an effective equipotential in a frame that cororates with the orbit of the binary (assumed circular). The equipotential is "effective" because it includes both stellar gravities, and also the centrifugal force from the rotating frame. The Roche lobe is not only an effective equipotential, it is the last one that is closed-- any equipotential further out connects to infinity and cannot correspond to material in equilibrium that is corotating with the orbit. From the side, this last equipotential looks like a kind of infinity sign. Material outside that "infinity sign" has to start moving in the rotating frame, bringing in coriolis forces and in generally leading to complicated motion. However, if close to the Roche lobe, the gas tends to flow through the nodal point at the center of the "infinity", so tends to be transferred from the domain of gravitational attraction of one star to the other. That's "mass transfer." Setting up the calculation of the Roche lobe is fairly easy because you only need the two gravities and the centrifugal force at the orbital period. But it is a difficult set of equations to solve, and even at the research frontier, is usually approximated rather than calculated exactly. No doubt this is the source of your difficulty. Why one star fills its Roche lobe is a consequence of stellar evolution, often as one star attempts to evolve into a red giant or asymptotic giant. Before it can reach its giant radius, its outer layers encounter the Roche lobe, and pass along it through the central node (the "Roche point") and may ultimately end up attracted to the other star. This is what is thought to have happened in Algol, for example, which is a binary where the star with the greater mass now started out as the star with the lesser mass (because it gained from its companion). The rate of mass transfer is also difficult to compute, because it depends on how fast the mass-loser is evolving. It is only its evolutionary rate that causes the "Roche overflow," so the mass transfer rate is pegged to the evolutionary rate, which is largely due to rate of fusion that adds mass to its core. 

It's not that oxygen should not be in this state, but rather we had not discovered it (e.g. on other comets). One of the reasons for this is that interstellar O2 is very reactive and quickly reacts to form e.g. H20 and O3. Current models also favoured O2-less comets. Interestingly, the paper you're referring to also mentions the O2 abundance was rather constant over the half year of observation, which hints to the O2 actually being primordial, i.e. from when the solar system condensed. To reconcile these observations with models, a couple of possible solutions are offered: a slightly warmer primordial cloud (from which the solar system formed), or reactions with ices. 

This is typically a bit tricky to show because (1) some phases (e.g. the main sequence) are much, much longer lived than other phases and (2) a number of phases are spaced very close together in HR-space. Be that as it may: any elementary text book on stellar structure will guide you through the path of a star through the HR diagram, usually accompanied by pictures. The book by Prialnik on this subject matter, or Ostlie & Carroll, are both excellent. Here is a very crude version of the temporal path through the HR diagram I made some time ago. Numbers show the different phases (2 is MS), colorcoding shows the ages. 

There are two separate issues when you talk about a star's age. Are you talking about its absolute age, in years, or its age in terms of how far along is it within its own evolution? The difference is, massive stars go through their evolutionary phases very quickly, and low-mass stars very slowly, so essentially all very low-mass stars are older in years than essentially every very high-mass star. Also, you can know more than the "spectral type" from a spectrum, you can also know the "luminosity class"-- that's the roman numeral that tells you if the star is, for example, a main-sequence dwarf or not. So if you pick an M spectral type main-sequence star, and an O spectral type main-sequence star, as two stars at random, it is extremely likely that the M star is much older than the O star, and you can know that purely from the spectral type and luminosity class. But if you want to know the age of the M star, or the O star, in years within their evolutionary stages, then it gets more difficult because there is rather little main-sequence evolution in the spectrum. There is some evolution though, especially late in the main sequence, so you could tell its age if there is evidence of main-sequence evolution in the spectrum (for one thing, the luminosity rises with age, within a spectral type, but that's pretty hard to tell from the spectrum). If the star is both low-mass and early in its main-sequence evolution, the best way to tell its age is to look at the rotational broadening of its lines, as low-mass stars spin down rapidly as they age (due to strong magnetic fields and weak winds). Another good way to tell the age of stars is if they are in clusters that all formed together, you can look at what is called the "main sequence turnoff", which basically means you look for the lowest mass star that has gone supernova, and you know how long that takes for that mass of star. You tell this from the spectrum because the turnoff is in the "Hertsprung-Russell" diagram, which you make from the spectra, but it requires a lot of stars in the cluster, so it's not really a property of a single spectrum. So the bottom line is, you need a suite of different techniques for assessing the ages of stars, it is not always easy or straightforward but you can take each case individually and look for ways to infer age. Much easier is determining which evolutionary class a star is in, because stars change dramatically in one phase or another, and the spectrum alone can tell you if you have a dwarf or a giant, etc. (Basically, the lines get much narrower as a star puffs out in radius, because the pressure drops.) 

I'm playing around with Sérsic profiles, and would like to retrieve the effective (half-light) radius that I put in by integration of the profile. I'm not managing to, so perhaps someone can help me out. I create the profile using astropy: 

is there a way to infer the luminosity in X (or Y)? I'm think not because any information on units has fallen out through this definition, but I could be wrong. I'm just not sure how to compute the luminosity straightforwardly otherwise, as this color index is the only output (along with the distance modulus) from an interpolation scheme of stellar templates. Help would be much appreciated. 

However, this does not give me the desired result -- the input radius of 1. Why not? Is this a conceptual error or a numerical one - or both? 

A comet is usually characterized by its tail. A dead comet has lost all its ices and gases (responsible for producing this tail), leaving just a rocky core. The Halloween comet is such a dead comet, in that it has no tail, but furthermore it resembles a skull, making it particularly relevant for Halloween. 

You are right that what you must use as a referent is different-- for parallax, your referent will be a much more distant object, because it shows little parallax. In aberration, it happens to the whole visual field. But what is shifted is the angle relative to the ground at which the light arrives, so if you set your telescope to see a given star, in principle you would need to correct for both parallax and aberration as the Earth orbits. But aberration is usually much larger than parallax because it scales with v/c rather than D/d (where D is 1 AU and d is the distance to the star). For the Earth's orbit, v/c is about $10^{-4}$, but stars are much farther than $10^4$ AU. As for Bradley's observation, a good version is given at $URL$ He was looking for the parallax effect, and stumbled into the much larger aberration effect. He could tell it was something different because the sign was opposite and it did not depend on distance to the source. This was 50 years after Romer, so the speed of light was already known. 

In general, better refrain from using 'inflation' unless you're talking about the early Universe-inflation. Rather, the Universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. The crux of this question seems to be in what you call 'the' time. There is no such thing as 'the' time, and I'm not sure what definition of time you're expecting to stop. Time is perfectly well defined in any restframe and will not be affected by the overall expansion of the Universe, at whatever rate. 

Angular momentum, and in particular the conservation of angular momentum, is of course very relevant in many processes in astrophysics, such as e.g. star- and planet formation, and disk formation in galaxies. The concept of objects spinning up upon collapse is straightforward enough to understand, but this begs the question: where does the primordial angular momentum come from? Tidal interactions between haloes, I suppose? 

Are you familiar with Hubble's Law? Because this is just it, in a slightly less familiar form. Note that the distance in this formula is the proper distance, the distance between us and some source, not the distance travelled. Other than that, the speed of light in a sense defines our conception of time and space, so it is mentioned in the formula. ;)
