The outer layers of the star will fall onto the white dwarf, forming an accretion disk as the star stuff spirals in. Like this image shows. 

Our best guess is that if Venus had an ocean, it did 4 billion years ago. Then it had the runaway greenhouse effect due to its thick atmosphere. The runaway greenhouse effect would have boiled away the oceans if the planet ever had oceans. There are several guesses about why its surface is so young (300 million to 600 million years old). One is that the planet get so hot the entire surface melts. It has no plate tectonics and it has a super thick atmosphere to trap the heat. All that heat melts the surface every half billion years or so. Another reason is that it has many very large volcanoes. (167 volcanoes over 100 km across.) That's far more very large volcanoes than Earth has. Those volcanoes resurface the planet and keep it young. 

Many, many moons throughout our solar system are tidally locked. $URL$ This wikipedia page lists 34 moons throughout our solar system that are known to be tidally locked, and another 26 that are suspected. It is very common for moons within a certain distance of their planets to be tidally locked. If they are too far away, they won't be tidally locked. Astronomers have even deduced that some exoplanets are tidally locked, but I have no idea how they know that. This leads to some interesting questions: 

Mars definitely has far less Iron than Earth. Mars has 10.7% of Earth's mass. On the other hand, Iron comprises 32% of Earth since there is so much Iron in its inner core, outer core, and the mantle. That means if Mars was made entirely of Iron (which it is not), Earth would still have more than 3 times as much Iron. You are right that Mars has more Iron at its surface than Earth so it looks very red. Earth has many other metals on its surface (not to mention water to make it look blue and plants to make it look green). 

The term for when the sun is at its highest is "solar noon". $URL$ It is the moment the sun crosses the meridian. The meridian is an imaginary half-circle that goes from the northernmost point on the horizon to the highest point directly above you and then to the southernmost point on the horizon. The sun is always at its highest point in its daily path when it crosses the merdian. You're right that in earlier centuries, each town would set its clocks at noon for when the sun was at its highest point. Those of us who are familiar with astronomy and history would call that type of timekeeping "apparent solar time". You can't guarantee an exact 24 hour day with "apparent solar time", so some people used "mean solar time" instead. (Historical note: Having each town choose its local noon became a nightmare for railway companies that wanted to set train schedules. So the railway companies urged the creation of 4 time zones in America and encouraged each small town to use "standard time" instead of "apparent solar time". And as rgettman already mentioned, the term for the sun's height above the horizon is "altitude". Astronomers use the term "elevation" for a person's distance above sea level. 

This diagram can show us many things, for example, how black holes don't have a gravitational pull which goes across the whole universe. On a final note, we can work out the area where even light cannot escape by using the Schwarzschild radius. Seen as you said this answer shouldn't include relativity, I won't include any maths either. The Schwarzschild radius, in summary, is where the event horizon is in a black hole. Summary Sorry for providing a awkwardly long answer, I was having trouble understanding what you didn't understand, and I thought that if I explained a singularity - then I'd surely help you, sorry if I've just said things you already know. I've provided some Wikipedia links if you want to have a look at some of the terms I left in italics. You might also want to look at black hole thermodynamics 

To answer this question, we need to understand what dark matter and a Higgs Boson are. Higgs Boson A Higgs Boson is an elementary particle in the standard field of quantum physics. It was theorised by a few people, namely Peter Higgs. The Higgs Field is a field which we can now believe exists, as we can detect it through its excitations, which become Higgs Bosons. The quantum excitations of the Higgs Field create Higgs Bosons. A Higgs Boson is a particle with no spin, infact, it is the only particle with no spin, electric charge or colour charge. It's also extremely unstable and decays into other particles almost instantly. Dark matter Dark matter is a heavily researched topic in physics at the moment. Out of all matter in the universe, dark matter makes up about 80% of it! One example of a theorised candidate for a dark matter particle is a WIMP. These are abbreviations of 'Weakly Interacting Massive Particles'. These particles are not normal matter, therefor we can't detect them. Our efforts to detect them include trying to look at the annihilation of WIMP particles. The main characteristics of WIMPS are that they only interact through the weak nuclear force or gravity. They also larger than standard particles (a dark matter particle with mass less than a electronvolt is classified as light dark matter) Wimps move slowly and are therefor cold, making them one of the main candidates for cold dark matter. Think of dark matter as a 'skeleton' for normal matter. Conclusion From looking at both types of particles, we can clearly tell that Higgs Bosons are completely different from dark matter. We are still trying to find out about them both, as both of them can answer fundamental questions in physics. 

Gravitational waves travel at the same speed as the speed of light in a vacuum, in general relativity. In special relativity, this is the maximum speed for any interaction in nature. 

Nasa are sending humans to mars because it has a background of evolution very similar to earth, meaning we can discover more about the past and future of our planet. Mars had the capability to have life in the past, and if we can work this out we can answer the fundamental question: Does life exist anywhere else? Now, about humans leaving earth. Humanity will have to leave earth at some point - due to issues like overpopulation, resource shortages and NASA as well as many other scientists are planning things like human missions to asteroids, and eventually developing technology for a human mission into deep space. Astronauts on the ISS are helping us understand how the body changes in space (for example, fluids inside your body aren't pulled down by gravity). Furthermore, these astronauts are helping us prove the technologies needed for exploration into deep space. I found a site about stephen hawking talking about how we need to leave earth $URL$ $URL$ However, another thing about the matter of exploration further into space, and why we haven't encountered aliens is that some scientists believe that there a many, many, many sentient civilisations out there, but they wipe themselves out so quickly they never cross paths. Furthermore, there are so many things we need to think about if we will travel and colonise other planets. Like how the planet's gravity will most likely be different, the atmosphere will be at a different density. This is why we need to expand our presence in the solar system, and one day send a long term manned mission to mars. 

I doubt two black holes could form within a single star, but they might form from a contact binary. That's a pair of stars so close that they touch and share a single atmosphere. For the stars that made the black holes for the LIGO gravitational wave discovery, just consider two very massive stars that are touching or nearly touching. They would share a single gaseous envelope for an atmosphere. Each one separately formed a black hole when it died, and then their two black holes merged. 

Assuming you mean the Cosmic Microwave Background ... The CMB is entirely in a very narrow range of the microwave part of the spectrum. Galaxy emissions are all over the spectrum. The CMB comes uniformly from all over the sky. It's like looking at painting that is all one color. Galaxy light looks like pinpoints on a dark background. (Nearby galaxies are not pinpoints, but those at cosmological distances look that way.) The CMB matches the exact wavelength we expect for light that is heavily redshifted from the moment of last scattering. That moment was hundreds of millions of years before galaxies ever formed. Light from oldest galaxies are at a redshifted wavelength from 500 million years after the last scattering. If the CMB was due to early starlight reflecting off dark objects, you would see a very different spectrum. It would contain many absorption lines as the dark objects absorbed some wavelengths better than others. Also the reflected starlight would be across a wide range of frequencies, unlike the CMB which has a very narrow range. 

When the white dwarf steals enough material to get bigger than 1.4 solar masses, the dwarf will become a Type Ia supernova. This is probably why we never (rarely?) see Thorne–Żytkow objects made from a white dwarf instead. If the white dwarf actually collides with its companion star before it explodes as a supernova, I could imagine it would fall into the center as the stellar material drags down the orbit of the white dwarf. Maybe then it will form something like a Thorne–Żytkow object. Or maybe it will accumulate enough material as it falls in to create a neutron star, at which point it blows itself apart in Type II supernova. 

There was only one time in recorded history when a star was visible to the naked eye and not within our galaxy. That was Supernova 1987A. When the astronomer, Ian Shelton, first saw it through a telescope, he was amazed at how bright it looked. Thinking it might be naked-eye visible, he stepped out of the observatory and saw it within his own eye. Since then, all the stars you see are nearby stars within our galaxy. All naked-eye visible stars are within a 17 thousand light years. Most are actually within a few hundred light years, but there are some bright stars within the 47 Tucanae globular cluster that are 17 thousand light years away. 

Every pixel value $S_i$ on the detector at $\vec x_i$ has some error $N_i$: CCDs for example have a background noise $N_\text{bkg}$ from read-out electronics, thermal noise, and sky background, plus a Poissonian photon noise $N_S=\sqrt{S}$. In many cases this noise follows a Gaussian distribution reasonably well. After subtracting the background, a position measurement $$ \vec x = \frac{\sum{S_i \vec x_i}}{\sum{S_i}} $$ has the uncertainty $$ \operatorname{std} \vec x = \left[\sum_i \left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial S_i} N_i\right)^2 \right]^{1/2} = \frac{\left[\sum_i \left( \sum_j\frac{(x_i - x_j) S_j}{\sum_k S_k} N_i \right)^2 \right]^{1/2}}{\sum_k S_k} $$ $$ N_i^2 = N_\text{bkg}^2 + N_{S_i}^2 $$ using Gaussian error propagation ... I hope I have run the math correctly. The way I've written it is a bit weird, but shows one important property of this method: If you look at the sum over $j$, you can see how the noise of a pixel is basically weighted by the pixel's distance to the centroid result. The same error on a pixel value has more impact if the pixel is farther away from the centroid. Better methods account for the uncertainty $N_i$ on pixel values in the first equation already. You can do this by introducing additional weights in your centroid or go to fitting models, which is the “usual” method in astrometry, as far as I have seen. This more involved approach to measuring positions uses the point spread function $P(\vec x_i - \vec x_\text{obj})$ of the instrument under given observing conditions. The model can be an approximation, e.g. a Moffat function, or an empirical model build from unconfused bright stars in the image, e.g. a spline interpolation. For point sources, the typical least-squares fit of position and flux of the model to an image easily produces results close to the statistical optimum of parameter estimation in terms of uncertainty. With our modern computing power the easiest way to get the uncertainty for a given model and data noise is often a bootstrapping algorithm. Of course extended objects require a bit more work in the model, for example assumptions on their shape, as you have given in your question. 

Additionally, you could only see the gas shell forever, if never again any other matter would fall in and conceal it. The hailstone analogy in the answer by John Duffield illustrates this behavior of the event horizon growing by passing through the accreting matter quite nicely. 

Utterly unknown. So Hawking proposed radiation, that reduces the mass of the black hole (BH) by black body radiation. The effective temperature is antiproportional to the mass of the BH. In the linked paper, Hawking concludes that BHs end in "fairly small explosions by astronomical standards." There are different solutions to the equations of general relativity that produce black holes, not only the common Schwarzschild metric. Whether the curvature singularity or the event horizon vanish before the BH completely evaporates, depends on the internal structure of the BH. As any mass, even very small ones, can become BHs if you compress them enough, there might be a singularity until the very end (not taking into account quantum mechanics). On the other hand a "vanishing event horizon" is not something we should be strictly speaking about, because then it wasn't an event horizon in the first place. You may see the looming problems with black hole remnants. Also: according to the no-hair theorem, BHs are completely characterized by mass, electric charge and angular momentum. If you can see a remnant, e.g. a clump of matter, could you derive its complete properties from the previous three only? In research, a remnant seems to be generally undesired but possible. This fresh and unreviewed paper jumps on the bandwagon and proposes white holes as remnants. So the debate about the end of BHs and their information theoretical implications is still a hot topic. Disclaimer: I'm not a BH specialist. (And I'm waiting for the time where "black hole specialist" is a craft job designation.)
