The answer is given by the volume of the ellipsoid (of order $Z^{3/2}$) plus an error term, and I am interested in the strongest possible error term, which I hope would be $O(Z^{3/4})$ or better. The error term should also depend on $Q$ in some fashion which is explicitly described. It seems like this question must have been extensively studied by now. But I was unable to find a suitable reference. Two references that approach what I'm looking for are: 

Greetings all, I have often heard that it would be good if we as a community did more in the way of mathematics outreach: more to explain what it is we do to the community at large, more to expose children and adults to all the fun we are having. What are some particular ways that people have found to do this? A couple come to mind. There are Math Circles in a number of cities, which welcome volunteers, and these are a fantastic resource. There are also clubs built around preparing middle and high school students for competitions, which are wonderful for many people. What are some other ways people have found to reach out to the community at large? I would be particularly interested to hear ideas that "anyone can do" -- that don't require special knowledge or connections, or too much commitment (at least at first), and that I could try when I begin my first permanent job. I would also be very interested in any outreach that targeted adults, including faculty outside the math department. Thank you! 

I saw the following nice formula in an unpublished paper of H. Cohen. Let $L$ be a quartic field, whose Galois closure $\widetilde{L}$ has Galois group $S_4$. Denote the cubic resolvent field of $L$ by $K_3$, and let $K_6$ be the Galois closure of $K_3$. Then, we have the following relation among Dedekind zeta functions: $$\zeta_L(s) = \frac{ \zeta(s) \zeta_{K_6}(s) }{\zeta_{K_3} (s)}.$$ This is proved using the formalism of Artin $L$-functions, and reflects the relation $$ Ind_{G_L} 1 = 1 + Ind_{G_{K_6}} 1 - Ind_{G_{K_3}} 1$$ between the characters of $S_4$ induced from the trivial characters of the subgroups of $\mathrm{Gal}(\widetilde{L}/\mathbb{Q})$ fixing $G_L$, $G_{K_6}$, $G_{K_3}$ respectively. So essentially this is a calculation in group representation theory. One nice consequence is the simple relation $D_L = D_{K_6} / D_{K_3}$ between the discriminants of these number fields. (This may be proved by comparing the conductors in the functional equation.) I imagine this is old hat, but this formula really struck me. Two questions: (1) Are there other similarly nice relations between other families of Dedekind zeta functions? (2) Have this or related formulas seen other interesting applications in number theory? 

I really like the exposition in these notes of Soundararajan (start on page 18). His proof is conditional on GRH, which strips the method down to a very easily understood core. I think it would be extremely instructive to follow Sound's approach and attempt to prove binary Goldbach on GRH. You will fail, of course, but that's the point! In addition, I really like the chapter on the circle method in Iwaniec and Kowalski. This is a more challenging read, but it very nicely illustrates the scope and applications of the method. 

In my edition of Neukirch, Chapter I.9, Exercise 2: If $L|K$ is a Galois extension of algebraic number fields, and $\mathfrak{P}$ a prime ideal which is unramified over $K$ (i.e. $\mathfrak{p} = \mathfrak{P} \cap K$ is unramified in $L$), then there is one and only one automorphism $\phi_{\mathfrak{P}} \in G(L|K)$ such that $\phi_{\mathfrak{P}}a \simeq a^q \ mod \ \mathfrak{P}$ for all $a \in \mathcal{O}$, where $q = [\kappa(\mathfrak{P}) : \kappa(\mathfrak{p})]$. It is called the Frobenius automorphism. The decomposition group $G_{\mathfrak{P}}$ is cyclic and $\phi_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a generator of $G_{\mathfrak{P}}$. Typo: That should be $q = |\kappa(\mathfrak{p})|.$ 

I am reading an outstanding paper by Bateman and Katz, improving the best known bounds on the cap set problem (Roth's theorem over $\mathbb{F}_3^N$). The paper contains some technical lemmas for which I believe there must be an excellent geometric intuition -- which I am afraid I am missing. Excerpting from, and simplifying, Section 8 of their paper, let $A \subset Y := \mathbb{F}_3^n$ be some subset, and also write $A(x)$ for the characteristic function of $A$. Let $H$ be a subspace of $Y$ and let $H^{\perp}$ be its annihilator. For $h \in H$, write $A_{H, h} := A \cap (H^{\perp} + h)$. Then we have a version of Plancherel $$\sum_{h \in H} |\widehat{A}(h)|^2 = |H| 3^{-2N} \sum_{h \in H} |A_{H, h}|^2,$$ and further, if $K$ is a subspace of $Y$ containing $H$, $$\sum_{0 \neq k \in K} |\widehat{A}(k)|^2 = \sum_{0 \neq h \in H} |\widehat{A}(h)|^2 + \frac{1}{|H|} \sum_{h \in H} \sum_{0 \neq k \in K/H} |\widehat{A}_{H, h}(k)|^2.$$ There are other interesting related formulas as well. The authors remark that the latter equality "can simply be thought of as Plancherel for a 'local Fourier transform' of $A$. Here, we localize to the translates of $H^{\perp}$." I can verify the identities readily enough, but I feel like there should be some excellent geometric intuition to be had here, with which all of these equalities are obvious. Is there anything that can be said which will render these equalities transparent? Perhaps some elaboration of the authors' remark? Thank you! 

Here's a "trick" answer: $[0, 1]$ is connected. But I consider this a trick answer because the real difficulty is turning this into a completely rigorous statement. Understanding the rigorous definition of connectedness (and understanding the point of making definitions like this) can be a substantial hurdle, but once this hurdle is crossed, the proof is not difficult. 

If $f$ and $g$ are functions $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, it is common to write $f(x) = O(g(x))$, or $f(x) \ll g(x)$, to mean that $|f(x)| \leq A g(x)$ for sufficiently large $x$. For example, one might see $$\pi(x; q, a) \gg \frac{x}{\phi(q) \log(x)},$$ where the left hand side is the number of primes $\leq x$ congruent to $a$ modulo $q$. I don't think any analytic number theorist would hesitate to write this (if $(a, q) = 1$), even though the left side is zero for $x < a$. In other words, at least in the part of mathematics I'm familiar with, the claim you make is true, even if the functions are not continuous, if you implicitly assume that you are allowed to choose $D$ to avoid any trouble spots. 

Consider the Dirichlet series counting discriminants of real quadratic fields. Quadratic field discriminants are "basically" squarefree integers, so the associated Dirichlet series $\sum D^{-s}$ is "basically" $\zeta(s)/\zeta(2s)$. However, there is the funny business at 2, and one derives the formula $\sum D^{-s} = \frac{1}{2} \big( 4^{-s} - 1 \big) \frac{\zeta(s)}{\zeta(2s)} + \frac{1}{2} \big(1 - 4^{-s} \big) \frac{L(s, \chi_4)}{L(2s, \chi_4)},$ which is a wee bit messy. (This formula, and all the subsequent ones, include 1 as a "quadratic field discriminant" for convenience.) However, I was reading a fantastic paper by David Wright, where he considers positive and negative discriminants together, in which case you have the much nicer formula $\sum |D|^{-s} = \big(1 - 2^{-s} + 2 \cdot 4^{-s} \big) \frac{\zeta(s)}{\zeta(2s)}.$ This formula is easy to derive from scratch, but he derives it as a consequence of the beautiful formula $\sum |D|^{-s} = \prod_p \Big( \frac{1}{2} \sum_{[K_v : \mathbb{Q}_p] \leq 2} |\text{Disc}(K_v)|^s_p \Big).$ He uses the parameterization of quadratic fields by $\mathbb{Q}^{\times} / (\mathbb{Q}^{\times})^2$, which may be thought of as $\text{GL}_1$-orbits on a one-dimensional prehomogeneous vector space, where $\text{GL}_1$ acts by $t(x) = t^2 x$ rather than the usual $t(x) = tx$. He then analyzes these orbits by means of an adelic zeta function; note that with the usual action you recover Tate's thesis. These formulas generalize quite a bit, with some complications, to $n$th-root extensions of any global field (with some restrictions on the characteristic). They also allow for twisting by characters, allowing (for example) a nice formula for $\sum \text{sgn}(D) |D|^{-s}.$ Note that the first formula considered looks nicer when viewed as a linear combination of $\sum |D|^{-s}$ and $\sum \text{sgn}(D) |D|^{-s}$. The MathSciNet review says that "similar results, however, can be obtained by class field theory", and this is also hinted at in Wright's paper, but the details aren't worked out. My first question is the following. Is there an elegant algebraic proof of the above identity for $\sum |D|^{-s}$ and its generalizations? And my second question, which is essentially a vaguer version of the first one, is: What is the best way to think of these formulas? I quite like the prehomogeneous vector space approach, but I imagine there might be a nice algebraic proof as well, and in particular some kind of ``local-to-global'' principle for quadratic discriminants. I am no expert in class field theory, and I am curious if any of these identities look simple and natural when viewed in the correct light. Thank you! 

I'm an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina. Although we are not Harvard or Princeton, we are a good research department with a solid Ph.D. program, and many of our graduates are successful both within and outside academia. Several of our graduate students are older than I am, which I think is great! The graduate admissions committee will look for firm evidence that you are prepared to succeed in graduate school. In particular, you will need evidence that you currently have mathematical ability and motivation comparable to other entering grad students. To this end, I don't really see any way around getting recommendation letters. I strongly second Suvrit's advice -- I was out of school for a couple of years before grad school, and I did the same thing. I would also encourage you to do the homework, take the exams (if any), and ask the professor to take at least a brief look at your work. Although the professor is not obligated to grade it, I think many would be willing to do this. If you do a good job, your professor will be able to write you a good letter (and also give you useful advice). I might add that you will want to demonstrate knowledge of foundational topics, in particular algebra and analysis. If the courses you sit in on aren't in these topics, or don't have them as prerequisites, you might ask your letter writers to spend a half hour vetting your background knowledge so they can address it in their letters. Good luck!
