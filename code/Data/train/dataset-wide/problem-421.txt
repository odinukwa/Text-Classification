Or you could go the low-tech way and simply work out for a while. It would take quite some time, but it would work. 

I read through the discovery paper (Adriani et al. (2011)) about antimatter in Earth's Van Allen belts, and I just want to lay out a few points before we begin: 

Gravitational lensing Possibly the coolest prediction of general relativity, gravitational lensing is the bending of light from distant objects by a massive object in front of the source. Typically, the massive object is a foreground galaxy, a massive star, or - in this case - a black hole. The angle of the light bent can be calculated as $$\theta=\frac{4GM}{rc^2}$$ where $M$ is the mass of the black hole, $r$ is the distance of the light ray from the black hole, and $G$ and $c$ (and $4$, of course) are the familiar constants. A typical black hole mass might be $10_{\odot}$, which comes out to $1.98855 \times 10^{31} \text{ kg}$. Since $G=6.673 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N} \cdot \text{ m}^2/\text{ kg}^2$, for a typical black hole, $$\theta=\frac{4 \times 6.673 \times 10^{-11} \times 1.98855 \times 10^{31}}{r \times (300,000,000)^2}=\frac{58975.974}{r}$$ if my calculations are correct. 

3 In reality, I suppose the emission would be isotropic, and the photons wouldn't have to hit the planets, or even hit head-on. However, note that we've severely underestimated the number of photons produced so far, by ignoring protons and neutrons. 

I've chosen three books which, I see, are somewhat similar to an undergraduate or graduate physics curriculum - the last is a stretch, but that's fine. There is an intentional progression from one to the next. The last two are truly textbooks; the first is not, and so is perhaps not as accessible to a student, but I've chosen it for its breadth and its style (which is, yes, a bit dense). They should give this civilization the tools and inspiration to fill in many of the gaps. 1. Newton's Principia Actually, the full name of the book is Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, as you know, but most people like to be concise. The Principia, in a sense, kick-started a revolution in classical mechanics. It is a treatise on a variety of topics in mechanics, including 

Earth's magnetic field is caused by movements in its core. Its outer core is roughly $2,890,000 \text{ meters}$ below Earth's surface. Therefore, to directly interfere with Earth's magnetic field, this thing is going to have to make a crater $2,890,000 \text{ meters}$ deep. Issac Newton figured out how to calculate this. The depth $D$ actually doesn't (at least for high-velocity approximations) depend on the velocity of the incoming object, but on the densities of the object ($\rho_o$) and the target ($\rho_t$), and on the length $l$ of the projectile. They are related by $$D=l\frac{\rho_o}{\rho t}$$ Given that the density of an asteroid is about $2 \text{ g/cm}^3$, and the density of Earth is about $5.514 \text{g/cm}^3$, the asteroid would have to have a diameter (assuming a sphere) of $$l=D\frac{\rho_t}{\rho_o}=2,890,000 \frac{2}{5.514}=1,048,240 \text{ meters}$$ By comparison, the object that caused the Chicxulub crater was only about $10,000 \text{ meters}$ in diameter. Oh, and with a diameter that big, the mass of the object would be $$\frac{4}{3}\pi (1,048,240/2)^3 \times 2,000,000 = \text{something really large}^1$$ Most likely enough to destroy the Earth. So either we're screwed, or we keep our magnetic field. I'd choose the latter. There are only a few asteroids over $500,000 \text{ meters}$ in diameter, so this thing is probably non-existent in the solar system - unless you count moons and planets. However, they have pretty stable orbits, so I'd say we're okay. 

Try radiometric dating. Accuracy: $\pm0.11\%$. Radiometric dating - see also the excellent USGS page - uses the decay of radioactive isotopes of elements to determine the age of a sample. It works as follows: 

Let's imagine that tomorrow we (well, only those 18 or older, so not me) all wake up and find a nuclear bomb next to our bedsides1. The bombs are about the sizes of hand grenades2 and are easy to transport3. Each person can only set off their own nuclear bomb. Once society adjusts to this fact, things will change, and change quickly. For example, wars will suddenly be much different, given that each side can blow up quite a lot of things. How will wars be fought if everyone gets such a hand grenade? We have to ignore the obvious, which is that some madman will set off his/her nuclear weapon rather quickly. Let's assume that something like that doesn't happen. The yield of each weapon is about 10 tons of TNT.4 

Cushing (2010) analyzed and published images of possible cave entrances based on the Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions. Here are some possible entrances by a lava flow near Arsia Mons: 

The two go hand-in-hand, but neither can be said to cause the other. Let's take the example of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels as a whole provide a source of energy that has been harnessed to an extent never before seen on Earth. As of 2009, they provide about two thirds of all the world's power, at roughly 20,000 TWh/year; that figure has been steadily growing, especially over the past few decades (see also Wikipedia). Generating more energy from fossil fuels requires better technology. Efficiency is always important when it comes to energy generation, so new methods are constantly being explored to save energy. With newer oil rigs, better methods of natural gas extraction, and other techniques, more fuels can be gathered, and so energy production can increase. On the other hand, finding new sources of electricity can and will lead to better technology. The internal combustion engine, for example, would not have been possible without fossil fuels. Actually, let's go back even further, to the first steam engines. Coal was incredibly important there. This then led in part to the Industrial Revolution, which transformed the world. In short, I would say that both technology and new sources of energy go hand in hand. New technology generally leads to the ability to produce more power, which civilizations almost certainly need; therefore, they will use some of that technology to find more fuels. At the same time, finding more sources of energy will make it possible to develop new technology that demands more and more power. 

Neurons are a little bit odd, because they don't divide and therefore can't reproduce quite like most other cells.1 They can only be produced by neural stem cells, which are active largely in the early stages of an organism's life. In some adult animals, however, neural stem cells are active in the hippocampus, where they may be instrumental in forming new memories. Without the generation of new neurons here, there could be negative implications for memory storage. You could argue, then, that immortality with a continuously functioning brain would require the presence of a large number of neural stem cells. However, it's not quite so simple. While therapeutic use of neural stem cells has been tried - and has, to some degree, succeeded - replacing large sections of the human brain over time would require extremely delicate procedures, which might have to be developed naturally. In other words, the brain might have to be designed such that this replacement is possible. Without such replacement, then, immortality wouldn't be possible. A person would gradually lose neurons over time - even if they weren't stricken early with a neurodegenerative disease. Their brain cells would quite simply die. It might be like a slow-motion version of Parkinson's disease. Memory would begin to fade, as would other brain functions. I've seen many estimates for how fast neurons die, and how fast certain types are made in the hippocampus. For the former, figures vary from a bit under 10,000 per day to several hundred thousand per day. For the latter, it seems that less than 1,000 neurons are produced by the hippocampus each day - and those usually for memory-related functions. Now, there are tens of billions of neurons to maybe one hundred billion neurons in the human brain, meaning at the current rate of replication, it would take millions of days to recreate that many neurons at adult production levels. Neurons die at a much greater rate than that. So you'd need one of two solutions:
