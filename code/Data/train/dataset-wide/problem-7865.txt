I am reading a paper and there is some computation of RHom of sheaves that I don't understand. I hope this is the right place to ask. It is this paper, example 3.10 , page 25 arxiv.org/pdf/1005.1517v4.pdf In the first RHom equality there, They claim that: $R\mathcal{Hom}(k_{\Delta\times\{0\}}, k_{M\times M\times \mathbb R}) \simeq k_{\Delta\times\{0\}}[-n-1]$ Where, for a closed immersion $j: N\to M$ of manifolds we denote by $k_N := j_*j^{-1}k_M$ where $k_M$ is the constant sheaf on $M$, and the diagonal of $M\times M$ is denoted by $\Delta$. Why does the result come shifted by the codimension? How does one begin to compute RHoms of such sheaves in general? will deRahm resolution work? Thanks ! 

I am reading Abouzaid's paper "A geometric criterion for generating the Fukaya category" ($URL$ and it is claimed there, without proof, in section C.4 in the appendix (pp.34) that the compactificaiton of the moduli space of holomorphic annuli is given by two discs meeting in an interior node at $R\to\infty$ and by two discs meeting at two boundary nodes at $R\to0$, where $e^R$ is the conformal parameter (i.e. annuli is given by $\{1\le|z|\le e^R\}$. I tried searching the literature for a proof, but other than finding the same claim in other papers I have found none. 1) Could someone please suggest a proof, or refer me to one? 2) Is there an explicit way to "calculate" the DM-compactification of a space of Riemann surfaces with boundary (and maybe marked points).? 3) While I can imagine the limit as $R\to\infty$ as a thin neck being developed, I am especially curious about the limit as $R\to 0$ as it seems somewhat arbitrary, why do only 2 chords shrink to a point? why not 1 or 3? Thank you! 

$\mathbb Z$ acts on the lattice $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ by adding an element to itself n times. I am studying some function arising from symplectic geometry which happens in my case to be naturally defined on $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ and is constant on each orbit of the $\mathbb Z$-action, thus it lives ob the orbit space. I am curious what kinds of algebraic/geometric/arithmetic structures does this set or orbits has, to compare with the behaviour of my function. Thanks 

For every $m\in\mathbb{N}_+$, $k=0,\dots,m-1$, denote $I_{m,k}:=(\frac{k}{m},\frac{k+1}{m})$. Denote $W = H^1(S^1,\mathbb R^{2n})$ = The Hilbert space of $C^1$ maps maps $v(t)$ from the circle to $\mathbb R^{2n}$ with $v$ and $\dot v$ in $L^2$. We will think of those maps as maps $v\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb R^{2n}$ with $v(0)=v(1)$. Consider the spaces: \begin{eqnarray*} W_m &:=& W\cap\{v\in H^1([0,1],\mathbb R^{2n}):\text{$v|_{I_{m,k}}$ is linear}\} \end{eqnarray*} Consider the projection $P$ from $W$ to $W_m$. Does $P$ have a kernel in the sense of convolution operator or Hilbert-Schmidt operator? Is there a closed formula? (This is reminiscent of the situation in Fourier series, where the projection onto the space of truncated Fourier sums is a convolution with Dirichlet Kernel) Thanks 

When defining the $A_\infty$ algebra of a Lagrangian (as done in the book by FOOO) it is done by "counting" (integrating over the moduli space or over the fiber of evaluation map) pseudoholomorphic discs with incidence conditions. To acheive a virtual fundemental class, a Kuranishi structure is built on these moduli spaces and then a virtual class is obtained by a (multi) section perturbation. I understand that each Kuranishi chart corresponds do the picture of the del-bar operator as a section in the corresponding banach bundle. But now (multi)section perturbations don't necessarily correspond to perturbing J or adding a Hamiltonian term. So in concrete terms what actually happens? It seems to me that after the perturbation what I am counting are no longer solutions to the $\bar\partial_J$ but something else. Can the equation they satisfy be described in some concrete way? Which propeties of J-holomorphic curves these solutions still satisfy? Thanks 

Given an n-dimensional polytope $P$ in $\mathbb R^n$, Given as a convex hull of a finite set of points, $S$ I would like to construct an expliict formula for a function $f\colon \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ such that $P=\left\{x\in\mathbb R^n \Big|\ f(x) \le 1\right\}$ Is there any nice known closed formula? It seems that there should be one in existance, as everything is piecewise linear. Moreover, I would like to ask the same question in the case P is given as intersections of half planes (hence, the data I have are normal vectors to the plane and distance from the origin) Thanks 

Hello, I am looking for a source that discusses and teaches hyperbolic geometry from a synthetic approach (As opposed to the common analytinc approach in the poincare disk). I am looking for something more in spirit with eucld's elements or hilbert's geometry book. Thank you 

I will present my question in the specifics I encountered it, so maybe some of the details are irrelevant for the desired conclusion. Consider $(S^2\times S^2,\omega_{std})$ the product of two spheres with standard product symplectic structure. $L\subset M$ is a Lagrangian torus in M. Given a family $\omega_s$ of forms, such that $\omega_0=\omega_{std}$ Choose $J_s$ an almost complex structure compatible with $\omega_s$. (which we are allowed to choose generically). Let $u_s$ be a family of Maslov 2 discs with boundary on $L$, converging to some bubbled curve $v$. Is there something I can say about the shape of the limit curve? The best case scenario would be a statement "If $J_s$ is generic, then the limit consists of two discs, one of Maslov 2 and the other of Maslov 0" I think I can rule out sphere bubbles by area considerations (A sphere in $S^2\times S^2$ has more area than the original disc), But as for discs I don't know how this works. Can I get in the limit discs with negative Maslov? Discs with Maslov $\ge 4$? a lot of Maslov 0 discs? Thank you very much 

I am learning about Quantum Homology which I have to use in my research, and I see that in many papers (For example in FOOO, "Spectral invariants with bulk, Quasimorphisms and Lagrangian Floer theory", $URL$ the homology ring being computed is given in terms of a Superpotential function. I understand that the relations in the homology ring are somehow encoded in its derivatives, and that it's critical point somehow correspond to Toric fibers with non vanishing homology, but nothing more than that and I have no clue about the details. What I am looking for is some exposition on the subject, some lecture notes, or somewhere where I can see a simple example being calculated completely from scratch. Can anyone please refer me so such sources? Thank you 

We start with two disjoint compact sets A and B with positive capacities. Then, we translate B s.t. $B+rv$ is disjoint from A and B and ,more importantly, $dist(x,y)<dist(x,y+rv)$ for all $x\in A$ and $y\in B$. Does this imply $$Cap(A\sqcup B)<Cap(A\sqcup (B+rv))?$$ We have $\leq $ because contraction maps decrease capacity (Landkoff in chapter "metric properties of capacities"). The map that sents $A\sqcup B+rv$ to $A\sqcup B$ decreases distances. I will post as I find things. We have $Cap(A)=[inf_{\mu(A)=1}\int_{A}\int_{A}\frac{1}{|x-y|^{d-2}}d\mu(x) d\mu(y)]^{-1}$. Call the infimum measure $\mu_{A}$ (equilibrium measure). So the diffulty is in showing that $\mu_{A\sqcup B}\geq \mu_{A\sqcup (B+rv)}$. Why does there exist measure $\mu'_{A\cup B+rv}$ s.t. $\int\int_{A\cup B} \frac{1}{|x-y|} d\mu_{A\cup B}>\int\int_{A\cup B+rv} \frac{1}{|x-y|} d\mu'_{A\cup B+rv}$? If we take any measure supported on $A$ and $B+rv$, it is not obvious to me that that the above inequality is true. If we set $\mu'_{A\cup B+rv}(A):=\mu_{A\cup B}(A)$, how can we shift the measure while keeping the integral lower or equal? Maybe just define $\mu'_{A\cup B+rv}(B+rv):=\mu_{A\cup B}(B)$ 

I know the basics of C++ by taking a few courses and going through "C++ Primer" by Lippman. As a math graduate student, I would love to get my hands on some programming-math exercises geared towards research. My gear is more towards probability and PDEs. The only interesting one I found so far is "The Nonlinear Workbook: Chaos, Fractals, Cellular Automata, Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Gene Expression Programming, Support Vector M " $URL$ Just by going through the contents it looks like it gives a solid survey (and it also has 150 run programs). Any suggested workbooks combining C++ and math problems geared towards research? More specifically,any book in the similar spirit and content as the one I posted. To prevent this from growing too big, please refrain from posting online resources and books on basic math-programming problems. I am interested in topics such as solving PDEs and simulating Hamiltonian systems, I am not interested in number theory and Euclidean geometry type problems. Also, let's close it after 5-10 answers. Thanks Update I posted it here because I wanted to get input from active researchers. Instead of closing this please put it somewhere (eg. community wiki) where researchers can comment. 

Do we have $Cap_{N}(S(0,r))=P_{x}(T_{S(0,r)}<\infty)$ for $x\in [B(0,r)]^{c}$, where $B(0,r)$ is a ball centered at the origin ? I know for $x=0$, they are both equal to 1. How can I go about proving or disproving the above equality? Thanks 

I suppose the larger surface area plane will have a great hitting probability. But what would be a rigorous way of proving that? Thanks that is answered below. Question 2) Also, given the exact coordinates of one of the bounded planes A above, can we compute $P(T_{A}<\infty)$? How can I go about it? $\{T_{A} <\infty\}=\{B_{1}(t)=a, |B_{2}(t)|\geq b,|B_{3}(t)|<c$ for some $t>0\}$. Here by a,b,c I mean the distance from origin, length and width of the square $A$. So I have to compute: $P_{0}\{(B_{1}(t)=a)\cap (|B_{2}(t)|\geq b)\cap (|B_{3}(t)|<c)$ for some $t>0\}$= Also, can you provide some books/papers that expose Brownian motion and surface area for more general sets? Thnx 

I want to compute the hitting probability of a bounded plane by a Brownian motion starting at the origin. In other words, given the coordinates of a quadrilateral A , can we compute $P(T_{A}<\infty)$? How can I go about it? First I try the specific case where A is centered at the x-axis and is parallel to the zx plane. Also, let A be a rectangle. Then, $\{T_{A} <\infty\}=\{B_{1}(t)=a, |B_{2}(t)|\leq b,|B_{3}(t)|\leq c$ for some $t>0\}$. Here by a,b,c I mean the distance from origin, length and width of the rectangle $A$. So I have to compute: $P_{0}\{(B_{1}(t)=a)\cap (|B_{2}(t)|\leq b)\cap (|B_{3}(t)|\leq c)$ for some $t>0\}$ Can I use the independence of the coordinates of a Brownian motion? I claim no, because the above events require a common t. 

I am studying BM on Riemannian manifolds and I am curious how this theory started. In the references below (esp. in Hsu's exposition), you will find many applications of that theory such as a probabilistic proof of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. I am also curious about the industrial applications (if any yet) given that Riemannian geometry is used in Machine learning and statistics. Thanks anyhow In case you are interested [1]$URL$ [2]$URL$ (proof of Atiyah Singer index thm) 

Update Can I someone solve for the above A. My friend advised me to use Fourier transforms. $$\nabla^2\Phi(\vec{r})=-\delta(\vec{r}),\;\;\Phi(\vec{r})=0\;\;\text{for}\;\;\vec{r}\in A,$$ $$P_A=\int_A \frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial\vec{r}}\cdot\hat{n}\;dS,$$ with $\hat{n}$ a unit vector normal to $A$ and pointing outward. 

The problem is: Given compact set A with positive finite volume (eg. ball,cube), what happens to $P_{x}(T_{A}>t)$ as $t\to \infty$, where $T_{A}=inf_{t>0}(B_{t}\in A)$ and x is in the "exterior" of A (consider A to be a solid object, then x is in the complement). More specifically, do we have for all finite t: $P_{x}(\infty>T_{A}>t)>0$ for $d\geq 3$? Also, do we have decay estimates of $P_{x}(\infty>T_{A}>t)$? In d=1,2, Brownian motion is recurrent and so $P_{x}(T_{A}>t)=0$ as $t\to \infty$. I want to know the behavior of $P_{x}(T_{A}>t)$ for $d\geq 3$ as $t\to \infty$. For example does it decay exponentially? Is it always positive? What are the methods I can use to study this problem (eg. Wiener Sausage asymptotics, Feyman-Kac etc)? I am also curious, how far we've gone in finding densities of stopping times for various shapes. For $T_{a}=inf_{t>0}(B_{t}=a)$, we have $P(T_{a}>t)=\int_{t}^{\infty}\frac{a}{\sqrt{2\pi(s-t)^{3}}}e^{\frac{-a^{2}}{2(s-t)}}ds$ and for the sphere $P_{x}[t<T_{B_{0,r}}<\infty]=\int_{t}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{4\pi s^{3}})^{1/2}\frac{r(|x|-r)}{|x|}e^{-\frac{(|x|-r)^{2}}{4s}}ds$ Any help will be appreciated. Thanks 

The hitting probability for spheres centered at origin is $P_{x}(T_{B_{r}(0)}<\infty)=\frac{r^{d-2}}{|x|^{d-2}}>0$, where $|x|>r$. 1)So I was wondering how can one compute $P_{x}(T_{B_{r}(0)}<\infty \cap T_{B_{r}(y)}<\infty)$ where the spheres are disjoint and x is "outside" (eg. for $|y|>2r$ and $|x|>|y|+2r$)? The Strong Markov property doesn't apply because the probability of hitting one sphere increases the probability of hitting the other and so one can't separate their laws. To make the problem more symmetric, let the starting point x be equidistant to 0 and y. How about the average hitting probability i.e. $\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}P_{x}(T_{B_{r}(0)}<\infty \cap T_{B_{r}(y)}<\infty)dx$? Is that any easier to compute? 2)Is there a PDE whose solution are those paths? 3)How about $P_{x}(T_{B_{r}(0)}<\infty \cap T_{B_{r}(y)}<t)$ (*), where I replaced $\infty$ by time $t>0?$ My research problem is about getting estimates of probabilities like (*) as $t\to \infty$; thus any references and interesting papers are welcomed. Thanks
