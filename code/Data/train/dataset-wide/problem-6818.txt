The immediate effect of increasing the minimum wage is obviously more disposable income for minimum wage workers, increased expense for employers, possibly higher prices, and an increase in the amount of taxes collected. But this leads to a chain of economic events that will resolve in a possibly new equilibrium that may or may not be any more beneficial. Higher wages enables higher paid workers to choose a different bundle of goods that they consume. If some of the new purchasing options are outside the area that they work, the money may be lost from the community or microeconomy. The money may not return until the economy adjusts and inflation reestablishes a new equilibrium price level at which point the basket of goods to choose from may become local again. Also, consider that minimum wage workers may have debt and so additional money earned might not go toward purchasing anything new or local; and may also flow away from local circulation. Firms requiring certain numbers of employees won't necessarily go out of business but will have to lessen other costs in other ways. This could lower the quality of goods & services and affect people's consumption from the firm given their preferences. Within the local economy, given wage earners' new indifference curves, some firms may lose additional business to other firms while dealing with additional wage costs. Firms may raise prices to compensate, reestablishing the wage vs price equilibrium, BUT if the rate of money flow out of the local economy increases, local residents including the firms and wage earners may find themselves with higher prices but less money in their own local economy to afford those higher prices. Income taxes and payroll tax collections would increase. Depending on the government's discretion, the tax revenue may either be effectively or ineffectively applied. This could make the government look good or not so good. 

When I took a course in consumer theory, the economy always had a single consumer, represented by a monotone positive utility function $u(x,y)$ and an income $I$. Given prices $p_x$ and $p_y$, it is possible to calculate the demands of the consumer for products $x$ and $y$. Now, I deal with a different type of economy: there are many consumers, each of them wants only a single unit of each product. Each consumer is represented by three positive values: $u_x$ (utility for having $x$), $u_y$ (utility for having $y$) and $u_{xy} \geq \max(u_x,u_y)$ (utility for having both $x$ and $y$). Given prices $p_x$ and $p_y$, each consumer buys either $x$ or $y$ or both, whichever gives the highest net utility (utility of product/s minus price). So it is possible to calculate the aggregate demands for $x$ and $y$. MY QUESTION IS: Is there a natural/standard way to convert between these two types of economies? I.e, given a utility function $u(x,y)$ and income $I$ for a single consumer, is it possible to construct a set of consumers with different $u_x$, $u_y$ and $u_{xy}$, such that the demand curves in both economies are the same? 

The textbook I am currently reading claims that, in an infinitely-repeated game with discount, there might be a payoff vector which is feasible and individually-rational, but it is not an equilibrium payoff vector in the repeated game. The example is the following basic game for three players: 

The motivation to this question is the Biblical commandment of Sabbatical year, in which the land should be allowed to rest and should not be cultivated. I am trying to estimate how much would it cost to actually implement this commandment in an industrial economy. For concreteness, I use data about the Israeli agricultural product; my main problem is the interpretation of the data, which is probably applicable in other countries. Here are the relevant data for 2013 (rounded and in billions of ILS): 

It's the total credit market, not only US government bonds, but also debt of other countries, also corporate debt etc. See here: $URL$ and here: $URL$ Maybe this chart (not recent though) clarifies it a bit also: $URL$ 

Every central bank creates money, it's the reason why these institutions are created. The central bank is "the lender of last resort", which means that it is responsible for providing its economy with funds when commercial banks cannot cover a supply shortage. In other words, the central bank prevents the country's banking system from failing. However, the primary goal of central banks is to provide their countries' currencies with price stability by controlling inflation (There is however lots of discussion about this purpose and whether central banks are actually creating stability or disrupting it). see: $URL$ for more info. Not all central banks are creating money at the same pace though... The FED stopped it's QE-program, while the ECB for example is out in full force QE atm. Central banks used to be constrained because their printed notes were convertible to gold, so they could only print so much notes as there was gold in their vaults. However, these constraints were totally taken away when Nixon closed the gold window in 1971. Actually the United States defaulted on their obligations then, they already printed way much more notes than were covered by their gold reserves. If Nixon didn't close the gold window, the gold reserves of the US would have been totally drained... more information: $URL$ hope this helps, best regards 

I'll try to fit this in an answer. I think you are confusing nominal and relative value. Inflation means that the 'value' of your money depreciates relative to other things. For example, in the year 2000 I could buy a bread for 1 USD. In the year 2015 I can buy a bread for 2 USD. This means that the dollar lost half of it's value relative to bread. But nominal 1 USD is still 1 USD and 1 bread is still 1 bread. So in your example: today 1 BTC = 578.25 USD. If there is inflation of the USD (the value depreciates), then all else being equal BTC should appreciate against the USD (go up in nominal USD-value). So to work further with the bread-example. If in the year 2000 1 BTC would buy 500 USD then in 2015 1 BTC should buy 1000 USD. So the USD went down in value relative to BTC. for more information: $URL$ $URL$ 

This question is about Pareto optimality (PO) in cake-cutting. The basic definition is: an allocation is PO if there does not exist another allocation in which all players are weakly better off and at least one player is strictly better off. For example, consider the following cake (where "C" means Chocolate and "V" means Vanilla): 

Suppose the Net Domestic Product in a certain sector (e.g. agriculture) is 10 billion. Who enjoys this 10 billion? Initially, I thought that this 10 billion is the gross income of the farmers. So some of it is paid as taxes while the rest remains with the farmers as net income. But, I did the math with some real-life data, and found out that the net income of the farmers is much smaller. So, where does the difference go to? My conjecture is that the NDP include the income of other workers related to agriculture, e.g. truck drivers, traders and sellers in farmer markets. Is this correct? Or are they counted in a different sector? 

Divide the family income $I$ among the family members, such that each member $i\in F$ receives an income $I/|F|$. Then, let each member select a bundle $(x_i',y_i')$ that maximizes his utility function $u_i$ in given his fraction of the income. Then, calculate the family bundle as a sum of the members' bundles: 

The virtual valuation of a buyer in an auctin is a function used to calculate the expeced revenue of a seller from that buyer. When the buyer's value comes from a continuous distribution with pdf $f$ and cdf $F$, the virtual valuation is: $$ r(v) := v - \frac{1-F(v)}{f(v)} $$ How exactly should the virtual valuation be calculated when the distribution is discrete? For example, suppose the valuation of a buyer can take three values: 1 USD - with probability 0.3, 2 USD - with probability 0.3, 3 USD - with probability 0.4. What exactly are $F$ and $f$ in this case?
