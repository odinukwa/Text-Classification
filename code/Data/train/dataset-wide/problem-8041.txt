Very famous one is the Feit-Thompson theorem: if n is odd, then G is solvable. Though I suppose this is stated (but not proved) in most modern algebra texts. 

Yes. Start with a model of GCH and add $\aleph_{\omega+1}$ Cohen reals. Then $2^{\aleph_n}=\aleph_{\omega+1}$ for all $n<\omega$. You can get the bound $\gamma$ arbitrarily high within the ordinal hierarchy by adding $\kappa$ Cohen reals instead, where $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal greater than $\aleph_\gamma$. (I think that's all correct.) 

Suppose you've got your polygon P, embedded in the Euclidean plane with some standard coordinate system. Then there's some rectangle R with horizontal and vertical sides which encloses P and is as small as possible among all such rectangles (just take horizontal lines through the topmost and bottommost points, and vertical lines through the rightmost and leftmost points). Translating the coordinate system doesn't change the rectangle or its area, but rotating it through an angle θ will; so the rectangle Rθ and its area Aθ are really functions of θ (and (π/2)-periodic functions at that). As such, A definitely has a minimum at some angle θmin. The meat of the theorem is that, for any angle φ where Rφ does not meet the conclusion, the function A does not even have a local minimum. To see this, note that Rφ intersects P at a finite set of points S — usually |S| = 4, but 3 or 2 are also possible. Now consider the rectangle R'θ which is the smallest rectangle with sides parallel to the θ-axes and which contains S, and let A'θ be its area. Note two things: 

It is entirely reasonable to ask for a continuous and computable equality-test function on~$\mathbb R$. The unreasonable thing is to expect it to take values in the discrete two-element space $\mathbf 2$. The truth-value space that we need to use is the Sierpinski space, for which I write $\Sigma$. It has (in the classical interpretation) two elements, 

Strengthening the hypotheses on $P$ and $Q$ from a fixed point property (every endofunction has some fixed point) to the existence of a fixed point operator $\mathsf{fix}$ with $$ \text{for any } f:P\to P, \qquad f({\mathsf{fix}}(f)) = {\mathsf{fix}}(f), $$ there is a standard theorem in domain theory or lambda calculus (theoretical computer science) due to Hans Beki&cacute;. We are given $h:P\times Q\to P\times Q$. Define $$ f = \lambda x.{\mathsf{fix}}_P(\lambda y.\pi_1(h(x,y))) : P\to Q $$ $$ g = \lambda y.{\mathsf{fix}}_Q(\lambda x.\pi_0(h(x,y))) : Q\to P $$ which have the properties that $$ f x = \pi_1(h(x,f x)) \quad\text{and}\quad g y = \pi_0(h(g y,y)). $$ Now let $x_0 = {\mathsf{fix}}_P(\lambda x.g(f x))$ and $y_0=f(x_0)$, so $x_0=g(y_0)$. Then $$ \pi_0(h(x_0,y_0)) = \pi_0(h(g y_0,y_0)) = g(y_0) = x_0 $$ $$ \pi_1(h(x_0,y_0)) = \pi_1(h(x_0,f x_0)) = f(x_0) = y_0 $$ so $(x_0,y_0)$ is a fixed point of $h$. In fact $f$ and $g$ are variables in this, so the argument provides a fixed point operator for $P\times Q$. Hans Beki&cacute; was a member of the IBM Vienna Laboratory but died in a mountain accident in 1982, leaving a lot of his work unpublished. It was edited and published by Cliff Jones and is available here. The result above is on pages 38-9 of Bekic2.pdf in this directory. Google seems to think that this surname has an acute rather than a hachek. 

Under our assumption, φ can't possibly be a local minimum of A, let alone a global one; so wherever the global minimum is, it must have a side coincident with one of the sides of P. 

The Axiom of Determinacy (AD) fails. What that means: Partition the set ωω into two sets S and T, and think of this partition as a game (S, T) with two players. To play, player 1 picks a natural number a0, then player 2 picks b0 (as a function of a0), then player 1 picks a1 (as a function of b0), then player 2 picks b1 (as a function of a0 and a1), and so on until an and bn are selected for all n ∈ ω. Then the sequence a0, b0, a1, b1, … is either in S (in which case player 1 wins), or in T (in which case player 2 wins). The game (S, T) is determined if either player 1 or player 2 has a winning strategy, i.e., if there are functions fn: nω → ω where choosing an = fn( b0, …, bn–1 ) guaranteed player 1 victory, or similarly for player 2. (We can't have both.) AD is just the statement that every such game is determined, which is false in ZFC. As with most of the weird examples, the undetermined game is constructed with a well-ordering of R. What makes this so unintuitive to me is that both AC and AD are generalizations of statements that are easily seen for finite objects. (Any finite game, or even any game with finite depth, is determined, by an easy induction on the depth.) There are apparently many set theorists that agree with this assessment, since they try to rescue AD as relativized to L(R). That the relative consistency strength of this statement is equivalent to that of large cardinals is considered good evidence that those large cardinals are, in fact, consistent. More precisely, ZF + AD is consistent iff ZFC + "there are infinitely many Woodin cardinals" is consistent, and ADL(R) is outright provable in ZFC + "there is a measurable cardinal which is greater than infinitely many Woodin cardinals". 

The article on Heyting algebras and frames is one of many that are truly awful in Wikipedia. Frames and complete Heyting algebras are completely different things. They are algebras for different theories and (so) their homomophisms are different. Johnstone's convention, which Tom has described and to which there are now few dissenters, allows one to use the algebraic machinery to speak in topological language, but without mentioning points. For example, in Johnstone's book you will find definitions of locally compact locales and of open (continous) maps. 

Yes. First note that Galois connections are far more common than field theorists would have you believe: any binary relation gives rise to one and the two fixed sets a closed under any appropriate algebraic structure. Write 

Let $z$ be a word, and let $M=FM(a,b)/z^{-1}$. If we wish $a$ and $b$ to be invertible in $M$, then $z$ must contain both $a$ and $b$ at least once. (For example, $FM_2[a^{-n}]=FM_2[a^{-1}]\cong F(a)\ast FM(b)$ by the canonical maps.) Suppose $z = a^nwa^m$ with $n, m>0$. If $z^{-1}$ exists, then $a$ has a right inverse $r = a^{n-1}wa^mz^{-1}$ and a left inverse $l = z^{-1}a^nwa^{m-1}$, and in fact these two are equal by the standard argument ($l = lar = r$); so just say $l=r=a^{-1}$. Then $z^{-1}a^nwa^m = e$ implies $z^{-1}a^nw = a^{-m}$ implies $a^mz^{-1}a^nw = e$ ($w$ has a left inverse), and similarly $w$ has a right inverse which is the same. If $z$ contains any occurrences of $b$, then we choose $w$ to begin and end with $b$; by the earlier argument applied to $w$, $b$ is invertible. Symmetrically, if $z$ begins and ends with $b$ but contains an occurrence of $a$, then $z^{-1}$ exists implies $a^{-1}$, $b^{-1}$ exists. I suspect these are the only cases which work (i.e., inverting a word of the form $awb$ or $bwa$ would not invert $a$ or $b$) but cannot yet prove it. (EDIT: This is false, see Mark's comment below.) EDIT: Partial result! Consider the structure $M$ whose underlying set is $\{(m,e) \in \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{Z} : m\ge e\}$ with binary operation $(m,e)\ast(m',e') = (\max(m,e+m'), e+e')$. It is routine to check that this is a monoid. Let $z=awb$ contain $i$ copies of $a$ and $j$ copies of $b$, and consider the morphism $f\colon FM(a,b)\to M$ with $f(a) = (0,-j)$ and $f(b) = (i,i)$. From counting it is clear that $f(z) = (m,0)$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$. If $m=0$ (as it will be for any word of the form $a^ib^j$, and many other words besides), then $f$ extends to a morphism $FM(a,b)[z^{-1}]\to M$. But $f(a)$ has no left inverse; if $(m,e)\ast (0,-j) = (0,0)$, then $e=j$ and $\max(m,j)=0$, which is impossible ($j>0$ by assumption). Thus $a^{-1}$ cannot be a member of $FM(a,b)[z^{-1}]$, i.e., inverting $z$ does not invert $a$. (Intuition: For each word in $FM(a,b)$, start at zero and read the word from left to right. For each $a$, descend $j$ steps; for each $b$, ascend $i$ steps; and track both your peak and your current position. If reading $z$ never gets you to the positive numbers, then adjoining $z^{-1}$ does not get you $a^{-1}$ (or similarly $b^{-1}$).) 

In order to have any hope of getting a universal property you have to think in terms of order-preserving functions (ie categorically) and not picking elements one at a time (graph theoretically). The subject that would have results like this is called domain theory. It assumes that the poset already has (honest) joins of directed subsets. The most likely kind of universal property is that $E$ is the image of the least co-closure. A co-closure is an order-preserving function $f:X\to X$ such that $f(x)=f(f(x))\leq x$ for each $x\in X$. In the example where you construction arose, can you construct such a function? If so, that's your universal property. If not, you're at sea. Edit in response to Werner's: Look up SFP or bifinite domains, on whom the main authors are Gordon Plotkin, Mike Smyth and Achim Jung (though the word bifinite was mine). However, you still haven't told us where the question came from. 

This question may be better answered by going to the intuition. Let X be a set with some sort of "local structure"; a metric space will do, but any reasonable sort of "closeness" is fine. We want to say a set U ⊆ X is open if, whenever U contains a point p, it also contains all those points q ∈ X which are "near p". Given this, U = X is clearly open. If p ∈ U, we want all the points of X "near p" to be in U; but every point of X is in U, so this is trivially true. ∅ is also clearly open. For this to be false, ∅ would have to contain a point p but not all the points near p; but as ∅ contains no points, this is impossible. Also consider the following: Let f : X → {0,1} be the constant function sending every p ∈ X to 0. We want constant functions to be continuous, no matter how fine the topology on {0,1}. So f -1[{0}] = X and f -1[{1}] = ∅ both must be open (and both must be closed). 

Zhen Lin states one direction of the Yoneda Lemma: given $x\in F A$, the natural transformation $\theta_x:H_A\to F$ on $f:A\to B$ is $\theta(f)=F f\cdot x$. The other direction is that every $\theta:H_A\to F$ is of this form, where $x=\theta(\mathsf{id}_A)$. I leave it as an exercise to show that $\theta_x$ is natural and that this correspondence is bijective. What I have just stated is the natural mathematical argument for the central idea of the Yoneda Lemma, albeit without the calculations required for the proofs. None of it has anything to do with Set Theory, whether that be ZFC, NBG or even NF. This argument makes sense in a world in which objects and morphisms are things of a different sort from one another. Functors and natural transformations, on the other hand, are schemes or recipes that transform objects and morphisms into objects and morphisms. Functors and natural transformations are not themselves things. We are quite used to this many-sorted language in algebra or first order logic. Even when the algebra itself has only one sort (if you don't know what I mean by that, I mean exactly the situation that you know), elements of the algebra, homomorphisms, predicates, ideals etc. belong to different sorts of the language in which we discuss them. It was the innovation of Set Theory to reify schemes, i.e. turn them into things. In its unrestricted form, this innovation led to the famous antinomies or paradoxes, such as Russell's. The outcome of this was to develop restricted reification, such as Zermelo Set Theory. Unfortunately, the mathematical community became addicted to Cantor's "paradise". So, even in disciplines such as Category Theory where we should have known better, we continue to find attempts at unrestricted reification such as Grothendieck Universes. The disciplined alternative is the type-theoretic style, in which we nominate certain forms of reification, for example that of functions ($\lambda$-abstraction), and stick to just those (in the context of a particular discourse). Now to reply to Michal Przybylek. I have just said and he agrees that "If people think that they need any kind of Set Theory to speak about Yoneda lemma, then they are wrong." However, far from being "philosophical" or "waving my hands", I have explained quite precisely what is the methodological set-up ("foundations" if you wish) behind the argument. At least, I discussed the ordinary form of the argument. Of course, as mathematicians have always done extremely profitably with pre-existing arguments, one may re-interpret it in more exotic settings. Enriched, internal and locally cartesian closed categories are examples of such settings. Moreover they are also examples of desciplined restricted reification operations. 

There is a stronger result: Every r.e. set is primitive r.e. in your sense. Short proof: Kleene's Normal Form Theorem. Longer proof: Let S be an r.e. set, assumed WLOG nonempty; fix a ∈ S, and fix an algorithm e where S is precisely the range of the function computed by e. Consider the following algorithm: Given the input pair (n, M), run e on input n for M steps. If it gives an output by then, output whatever e outputs; otherwise output a. The functions which set up the initial state of computation, advance a state by one step, and extract the output from a final state, are all p.r. Thus the above algorithm defines a p.r. function, and it is easy to check that its range is S. Edit: Cutland's Computability is a decent resource for these questions. 

This is like the subobject classifier $\Omega$ in a topos, where "open subspace" becomes "subobject". Indeed, both in set theory and topology the classification properties are rather trivial in the classical case, but become powerful definitions when read constructively. In particular, a space $X$ is Hausdorff iff the diagonal $X\subset X\times X$ is closed. This happens iff there is a continuous function $$ (\neq):X\times X\to\Sigma $$ for which $$ (\neq)(x,y) = \bot \iff x=y. $$ In the discrete space $\mathbf 2$ both points are both open and closed and there is a negation function $\lnot:\mathbf 2\to\mathbf 2$ that swaps them. All of this is meaningful in both general topology and recursion theory, replacing - continuous function by computable function and - open subspace by recursively enumerable subspace. In particular, a computable function $f:X\to\Sigma$ is one that may or may not terminate but otherwise has no return value, so it is like $\mathtt{void}$ in $C$ or $\mathtt{unit}$ in ML. Then $\top$ denotes termination and $\bot$ divergence. There is no negation function on this $\Sigma$ because if there were it would be exactly a solution of the Halting Problem. In particular, slimton is right in saying that a positive solution to the question as originally posed would be equivalent to the Halting Problem. The interpretation of computation in general topology was pioneered by Dana Scott in the 1970s. Conversely, my research programme Abstract Stone Duality is about reformulating topology to make it equivalent to computation. The best introduction to this programme for the general mathematician is my paper A Lambda Calculus for Real Analysis.
