The answer is "never" (except in the obvious case $d=2$, $n\ge 4$). $C(n,d)$ is neighborly, meaning that every $d/2$ or less vertices define a simplex. In particular, for $d\ge 4$ its graph is complete and the boundary complex cannot be flag. For $d=3$, the boundary complex contains the three edges $1i$, $in$ and $1n$ but not the triangle $1in$, for every $i\in \{3,...,n-2\}$. 

The answer is YES in the following stronger form: Lemma 1: Let $d>n$ and let $p\in dP\cap \mathbb{Z}^n$. Then there is an $i\in\{1,\dots, n\}$ and points $p'\in iP\cap \mathbb{Z}^n$, $p_1,\dots, p_{d-i}\in P\cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $$ p = p' + p_1 + \cdots + p_{d-i}. $$ For the proof I will (as is customary in this type of problems) work on the cone over $P$, defined as follows: $$ C_P := \operatorname{pos}(P\times \{1\}) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}. $$ Observe that $dP$ can be identified with $C_P \cap \{x_{n+1}=d\}$. I call height of a point in $C_P$ the value of its last coordinate, so that integer points at height $d$ are identified with integer points in $dP$. Lemma 1 is equivalent to: Lemma 2: Let $p\in C_P\cap \mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$ be an integer point at height $d> n$. Then, there is a point $p'\in C_P$ at a certain height $i\in \{1,\dots,n\}$ and integer points points $p_1,\dots, p_{d-i}$ such that $p=p' + p_1 + \cdots + p_{d-i}$. Proof of Lemma 2: There is no loss of generality in assuming that $P$ is a simplex (if not, consider an integer triangulation of $P$ and apply the result to each individual simplex). So, let $v_1,\dots,v_{n+1}$ be the vertices of $P$, considered as points in $C_P$ at height one, and let $Z$ be the unit parallelepiped obtained as the Minkowski sum of the segments $Ov_i$. The cone $C_P$ can be tiled by integer translations of $Z$; more precisely, it is tiled by all translations $v+Z$ where $v$ runs over the integer non-negative combinations of the $v_i$'s. Thus, $p$ can be decomposed as $p'+v$, where $p'$ is an integer point in $Z$ and $v$ is an integer non-negative combination of the $v_i$'s. Except in the trivial cases where $p'=O$ or $p'$ is the sum of all the $v_i$'s, the integer point $p'$ in $Z$ has height between $1$ and $n$, which finishes the proof. QED 

I am not an algebraic geometer, but I am a topologist who uses sheaves. I have studied some algebraic geometry and am interested in what happens as I reduce the amount of rigidity in the structure sheaves on a space. Specifically I want to know what the cohomology of the following structure sheaves tell you. Please do things over characteristic zero. If $X$ is a topological space then the natural structure sheaf of continuous functions has no interesting cohomology because of the existence of partitions of unity. Consequently, $C^k$, smooth and topological manifolds have structure sheaves with no interesting cohomology. To contrast, schemes ($X,\mathcal{O}_X$) with their structure sheaves of regular functions have lots of interesting information. In particular, there is non-trivial higher cohomology. However, I am still unsure what these groups tell you (aside from what all sheaf cohomology means - obstructions to extending sections). For example Hartshorne exercise 4.3 tells you that $H^1(U,\mathcal{O}_U)$ is infinite dimensional (spanned by $x^iy^j|i,j<0$) where $U=\mathbb{A}^2_k-(0,0)$. For $X$ a curve then the dimension of $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ tells you the genus. For affine pieces this cohomology is trivial, so the cohomology of the structure sheaf detects "non-triviality" of a space. Are there any other characterizations of the higher cohomology groups of the structure sheaf? I am actually interested in the definable/o-minimal/constructible setting. So I want to consider a constructible space $X$ along with it's structure sheaf of ($\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$-valued) constructible functions as a ringed space. Since one implementation of definable spaces is the semi-algebraic (or semi-analytic) setting, I would like to know that the cohomology of the structure sheaf here tells you. So if someone could address any of the following: 

You can learn more about both aspects in my book on Triangulations (Section 9.2 for the Cayley Trick, Sections 4.1 and 5.4, among others, for Gale transforms and their relation to triangulations. 

Let me point out a very significant difference between dimensions 2 and 3. In dimension 2 ANY triangulation (Delaunay or not, random or not) has average degree strictly smaller than six (and going to six as the ratio "boundary points / interior points" goes to zero). This is a consequence of Euler's formula. In dimension three, however, there are triangulations (even Delaunay triangulations) with arbitrarily many points and a complete graph, that is, with average degree $n-1$ where $n$ is the number of points. What this means, in particular, is that the answer to the question may depend in how you sample. Going to a very degenerate situation, Amenta et al studied what happens when you sample uniformly on a (perhaps lower dimensional) polyhedron. 

I learned Quantum Mechanics and Linear Algebra in tandem, so Schrodinger's linear time-independent equation has always had a special place in my heart. It shows that eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental to our description of atomic physics. Also treating observables as operators was a great conceptual revolution. 

I sympathize with your case. A 2.1 is really not bad. You shouldn't denigrate yourself and view your peripatetic interests as requiring redemption. Taking on a big unsolved problem without guidance or the background of a PhD student seems doomed to fail. Locking yourself in a library with all the world's books is unlikely to produce anything of merit. I have never heard of a case of a student producing something of "intriguing/charming/advanced" and using that to gain graduate admission. The romantic, amateur heroic view of math is largely bunk as pointed out by Terry Tao. There is still hope. I know that undergraduate research is less common in the UK, but I would expect that if you email lots of professors in areas of interest to you and basically offer yourself as cheap or free labor (undergrad student level), there is a good chance that you'll be taken on as an unofficial research student by someone. I know many cases of people in math and science using this sort of informal contact to start research projects that eventually develop into PhD positions. Making yourself known to a tenured professor who can write you a strong recommendation is probably enough to get you a PhD position somewhere (in the US, UK or Europe). It is unlikely that claiming to solve a big problem or do research on your own is going to be trusted by graduate committees. You need recommendations from people trusted in the academic community. There are MO users who have taken a decade or more off from education and successfully started PhD positions at Princeton and other top research institues. Good luck. 

The polyhedron inside the triangle is the Minkowski sum of the three vertices or, equivalently, the Minkowski sum of a vertex and the opposite edge. This gives: 

You need to check that all possibilities do indeed extend to triangulations of the cube (so far we have only described the "star" of the diameter used) and that no possibility extends in two ways. Once you check this (there are 5 combinatorially different cases to understand) you will have proved that there are 18 triangulations using that diameter, and 72 in total. 

Unless you have some additional structure on the points $A_1$,...,$A_n$ your problem is as hard (and as easy) as computing the convex hull of $2n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and triangulating this convex hull. EDIT: Neither the fact that you have zeroes nor the value of the determinant simplify the problem, as far as I can see. The way I think about your problem is as follows. Using projective coordinates, you have $2n$ vectors $(A_1,1),\dots, (A_n,1), (e_1,0),\dots, (e_n,0)$ in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ and want to compute its positive hull and a triangulation (in the sense of vector configurations) of it. If you prefer to live in the affine world, you can multiply the last $n$ vectors by $d+1$ so that all your vectors (now points) lie in the affine space $\sum x_i = d+1$. In this sense, as I said in my original answer, your problem becomes that of computing a convex hull (Q1) and a triangulation (Q2) of $2n$ points in $\mathbb R^n$. If you are interested in arbitrary $n$ I think there is not much more I can say other than "use the general machinery". But if you are interested in small $n$ there are two things you can do to get a lower dimensional "picture" of your problem: 

I agree with Scott firmly here. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics is a beautiful subject with immediate doorways to symplectic geometry, but unnecessary for the appreciation of the basic postulates of QM ("The Universe is a vector space..."). Honestly, if Qiaochu wants to appreciate this clean formulation and not worry about "perturbative expansions of blah blah blah," this is sufficient. I am also a huge fan of Griffith's "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics" as a first book. It can be read without serious knowledge of electromagnetism and classical mechanics. I know that the MIT physics undergraduate curriculum does not require Lagrangian/Hamiltonian Classical Mechanics before their 3 term QM sequence. This means for Qiaochu that 8.01 and 8.02 is sufficient, 18.03 is more important, and I have heard of many a MIT student taking 8.05 without 8.04, but don't expect a physics professor to say that to you. (My apologies for the MIT-speak) The problem with learning "grown-up" mechanics (at MIT 8.07 or Sussman's 6.946J, which I recommend highly) before QM is that this path leads more naturally to understanding more differential-geometric concepts and consequently takes serious time. This is fine for a physicist and is probably a wise move before taking GR, but for a growing mathematician, I would advise understanding smooth manifold theory before trying to learn the more sophisticated and elegant approach to mechanics. This inevitably entails a much more firm grounding in ODE theory and I recommend V.I. Arnold's ODEs book for that. Once you have these two perspectives in hand you can then sit back and wonder how the QM Universe-as-a-Hilbert-space viewpoint and the GR Universe-as-a-C^2-manifold description can ever be reconciled. 

A positive answer to this question has just appeared in the arXiv: Tiling with arbitrary tiles; Vytautas Gruslys, Imre Leader, Ta Sheng Tan; $URL$ 

Let me point out that this also admits a purely combinatorial proof. Consider your triangulated $S^n$ as the boundary of a triangulated ball $B^{n+1}$ (for example, but not necessarily, cone your triangulated sphere to a vertex in the interior of the ball) and extend your labeling of the vertices to the interior arbitrarily (in the example, simply choose a label in $\{1,\dots,n+1\}$ for the interior point). Now, each $(n+1)$-simplex $\sigma$ in your triangulated ball that uses all $n+1$ labels has exactly two $n$-dimensional faces $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ that use all labels, and $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ have opposite orientations when seen from $\sigma$. If you now count the pairs $(\sigma,\tau)$ that arise this way (with their orientations), the $\tau$'s intersecting the interior of the ball cancel out (they belong to two $\sigma$'s, with opposite orientations) so that in the boundary there must be the same number of them with one and the other orientation. (This proof is very much inspired in "Sperner's Lemma", which Sperner used to give a purely combinatorial proof of Brower's fixed point theorem) 

Is there a useful criterion for when an H-space is actually a topological group? Seeing that $S^1$,$S^3$, and $S^7$ are the only spheres that support group structures, it doesn't seem coincidental that $S^1$ is a loop space, because it is in fact an H-space. Since $CP^{\infty}$ is the loop space of $K(Z,3)$ it too is an H-space, but is it known if it is a topological group? Even if not, is there a way (other than concatenation of loops) to "see" this structure on $CP^{\infty}$? 

Cosheaves are indeed mysterious gadgets. On the one hand, cosheaves are everywhere, but on the other hand, someone used to thinking sheaf-theoretically may have some problems. I am very close to finishing an exposition on cosheaves, but need another week or so to put it on the arxiv. Bredon's book on sheaf theory has the most complete reference on cosheaves, so you might look there if you like. AS you may know, pre-cosheaves are just covariant functors $\hat{F}:\mathrm{Open}(X)\to\mathcal{D}$ where $\mathcal{D}$ is some "data category" like Vect, Ab, or what have you. Cosheaves send covers (closed under intersection) to colimits and different covers of the same open set get sent to isomorphic colimits. The Mayer-Vietoris axiom is a good way of thinking about cosheaves and since homology commutes with direct limits, one can see that $H_0(-,k)$ is always a cosheaf. In particular, $H_0(-,\mathcal{L})$ is a cosheaf whenever $\mathcal{L}$ is a local system. As you observed, since cosheaves are fundamentally colimit-y, they have left-derived functors rather than right-derived ones. Thus the answer to (1) is yes. In regards to (2), one must be careful. I believe the answer is yes, but allow me to pontificate on the problem. Filtered limits and finite colimits do not commute in most categories like Ab, Vect, or Set. This has serious ramifications through the theory of cosheaves. For example, it is not necessarily true that a sequence of cosheaves is exact iff it is exact on costalks. Here costalks are defined using (filtered) inverse limits rather than direct ones. Another very serious consequence is that Grothendieck's sheafification procedure cannot be dualized to give cosheafification. Thus the usual phrase "let blah by the cosheaf associated to the pre-cosheaf blah" is not necessarily well-founded because it is unclear how to cosheafify! People have solved this problem in the past by working with pro-objects (which corrects for this "filtered limits not commuting with finite colimits" asymmetry) and then they use Grothendieck's construction. However, for abstract categorical reasons one can check that cosheafification does exist for data categories like Vect (i have worked out a proof and haven't found in the literature anyone who claims to have proved this), we just don't have an explicit construction. That said, the usual description of the left-derived functor of the push-forward should still hold. On the other hand, if one works in the constructible setting, one can get the statements you would like. In particular, it is true that cosheaves constructible with respect to a cell structure are derived equivalent to sheaves constructible with respect to the same cell structure. I discovered independently my own proof, only to find that at least two other people have proved this before. However, in my opinion, the equivalence is the "correct" form of Verdier duality. A larger and updated exposition should be available soon. 

I think the whole list of Gjiergji (and lightly more, see below) follows from Wythoffian operations. For the cube-octahedron family, for example, consider the following diagram: The polyhedron along an edge of the triangle is the Minkowski sum of the two vertices of that edge, which gives: 

Finding the exact number of unimodular triangulations of a cube in higher dimension is, I would say, out of reach. In fact, I would say the number is doubly exponential in n (that is, exponential in the number of vertices). [Update: see my other answer for a doubly exponential lower bound] For dimension 3 I can reproduce David's count of 72 in a different fashion: Every unimodular triangulation of the 3-cube uses one (and only one) of the four diameters of the cube. So, it suffices to count the triangulations that use one particular diameter. For this do the following: if you project the cube along the direction of the diameter used, you see a hexagon. The vertices to which the diameter is joined in your triangulation must form a sub polygon of this hexagon with the center inside. There are 18 possibilities: 

I keep running across papers that refer to a set of lecture notes by Robert MacPherson at MIT during the fall of 1993 on Perverse Sheaves. There might also be a set of notes from lectures in Utrecht in 1994 taken by Goresky. For references to these elusive, unpublished notes see the work of Maxim Vybornov and A. Polishchuk. Does anyone have a copy or know how I could obtain a copy? Thanks! 

Suppose I have two (constructible) sheaves of vector spaces $F$ and $G$ over the same base space that have isomorphic cohomology (degree by degree), but no sheaf map inducing this isomorphism (i.e. they are not quasi-isomorphic). Now imagine I apply any of Grothendieck's 6 operations (or other functors) to $F$ and $G$, will the resulting sheaves, say $\Psi(F)$ and $\Psi(G)$, have isomorphic cohomology as well? Thanks! EDIT: I suppose the answer in general is no. Consider an injective (acyclic) sheaf and any functor that doesn't preserve injectives. A concrete example would be nice though. EDIT 2: Thanks to Algori's comments I need to substantially limit the sheaves of interest. Assume additionally that the sheaves have identical support and furthermore that when we take the function that assigns to a point the euler characteristic of the stalk over that point (thereby producing a constructible function) to these two sheaves, these functions are identical. If we are using real sub-analytic partitions then a theorem of Kashiwara's says that the Grothendieck group of the bounded derived category of real constructible sheaves is isomorphic to the group of constructible functions. If I understand things correctly this would mean that these two sheaves are equivalent in the Grothendieck group (which seems weird since this function ignores gluing data). I am dealing with particular examples of two constructible (cellular) sheaves over a simplicial complex, which are not isomorphic yet produce identical constructible functions. 

(The second or the fourth coordinate can be deleted in the example, to get an example with only five coordinates. I am not sure whether that is smallest possible). 

Here is a counter-example: let $A=(1,0,0,0,0,1)$, $B=(1,1,1,0,0,0)$, $C=(0,0,1,1,0,0)$ and $D=(0,0,0,1,1,1)$. Take $Y=\{A,B,C,D\}$. Then: 

Now that I think of it, my answer was wrong. I was just reproducing examples mentioned by the question poser (Bing's, as seen in Ziegler's book). These examples cannot be reduced keeping the boundary to be a 2-sphere, but the question is whether there are examples that cannot be reduced keeping the boundary a 2-manifold. 

Here is a lower bound of $2^{\Omega(2^n)}$ for the number of unimodular triangulations. Let me start with the triangulation described by Włodzimierz Holsztyński, which is indeed quite classical and I will call the standard triangulation of the $n$-cube. Its $n$-simplices have as vertices the $n!$ monotone paths of vertices from $(0,\dots,0)$ to $(1,\dots,1)$. Observe that the standard triangulation $T$ has the following property: for each $2$-face of the cube, the two triangles in which $T$ divides that face have the same link (that is, they are joined to the same simplices). This implies we can perform a flip on that $2$-face: we can remove the two triangles in it together with all simplices containing them, and insert the other triangulation of the quadrilateral, with the same link as the old one had. (This is a higher dimensional analogue of changing the triangulation in a square pyramid, as described in David Eppstein's or TMA's answers) Now, if we find $k$ of these $2$-faces in which we can perform flips independently (that is, if no two of the flips affect a common simplex) then we get $2^k$ triangulations of the cube. One way to guarantee that the flips are independent is to use $2$-faces at the same level, by which I mean the following: every $2$-face is defined by $n-2$ equalities of the form $x_i=\epsilon_i$, where $\epsilon_i\in \{0,1\}$. I say a $2$-face has level $l$ if exactly $l$ of the $\epsilon$'s are equal to $1$. The number of $2$-faces at level $l$ is ${n \choose n-2}{n-2 \choose l}$ which, for $l\sim (n-2)/2$, grows as $2^n n^{3/2}$ (modulo a constant). Thus, we have at least $$ 2^{\Omega(2^n n^{3/2})} $$ unimodular triangulations of the $n$-cube. It is also easy to give a crude upper bound that is not that far from the lower bound. Observe that a unimodular triangulation is a set of $n!$ $n$-simplices taken out from a total of (at most) $2^n \choose n+1$ $n$-simplices. Thus, the number of unimodular triangulations (or, of all triangulations, for that matter) is at most $$ {{2^n \choose n+1} \choose n!} \le 2^{O(n^{n+2})} $$
