Qiaochu links to a really nice article by Timothy Chow that says a lot about the mechanics of how to go from a filtered complex to its spectral sequence. Two questions that remain are, (1) why do filtered complexes show up so much, and (2) is there anything that you could do with a filtered complex other than compute its spectral sequence? VA gives a very general motivation for why filtered complexes show up so much. Probably it is just more general than what I was going to say. To discuss things more concretely, (I am told that VA's interesting answer is not a generalization of this paragraph.) For question (1), here are two general ways that filtered complexes show up: (a) you might get a filtered complex if you are interested in a chain complex that comes from a filtered object. For instance it could be a stratified topological space. A CW complex is stratified, but it has a special structure so that its chain complex doesn't need a spectral sequence. (It is an acyclic resolution as VA says.) If you have a stratification that you wish was CW but isn't, then you just have a general filtered complex. (b) There are some cases where just a single map or similar gives you a filtered complex. These may all be special cases of what Grothendieck described. For example, suppose that you are interested in the de Rham cohomology of a manifold. (This is then a certain resolution of the sheaf of smooth constant functions on the manifold.) Suppose further that the manifold is fibered over another manifold, or maybe is just foliated. Then differential forms are filtered by how parallel they are to the foliation. Concerning question (2), there is an interesting result for filtered complexes over a field coming from representation theory. (I learned this some years ago in a discussion with Michael Khovanov.) The theorem in this case is that there is no more information in a filtered complex than in its spectral sequence. For simplicity, let's look at filtrations of length $n$. Then a filtered vector space is a representation of the $A_n$ quiver with all arrows in the same direction. (Each term of the filtration is assigned to a vertex of the quiver, and the arrows correspond to the inclusions.) The quiver also has other representations, but filtered vector spaces are the projective modules. A filtered complex is thus a projective complex over the $A_n$ quiver algebra. It is just like homological algebra over any other ring; you usually look at projective complexes. Since the $A_n$ quiver has projective dimension 1, it is easy to identify the indecomposable chain complexes of filtered vector spaces. There are two types, with two terms and with one terms: $$0 \to k^{(i)} \to k^{(j)} \to 0 \qquad\qquad 0 \to k^{(i)} \to 0.$$ In this notation, $k$ is the ground field and $k^{(i)}$ is $k$ in degree $i$. The first type of complex is valid if $i \ge j$. If you compute the spectral sequence of an indecomposable complex, you will see that detects the first type of term at the $(i-j)$th page, and kills it on the next page. The second type of complex is of course the surviving homology. You can also go backwards and reconstruct the filtered complex from its spectral sequence. Of course it is simplistic to only discuss filtered complexes and spectral sequences over a field. Nonetheless, roughly speaking spectral sequences are no more than a framework for analyzing filtered complexes. 

There is one particular fact that greatly helps me understand Schubert varieties and Schubert cells, and the serves as kind-of an introduction: They are a generalization of row echelon form for matrices. If $V \subseteq F^n$ is a $k$-subspace of the standard $n$-space over a field $F$, then it is well-known that $V$ has a unique basis of row vectors in reduced row echelon form. The shape of the form divides the set of all $V$ (the Grassmannian) into cells which are affine spaces. The closures of such a cell — itself plus lower cells — is a Schubert variety. For example, one pattern of RREF for a 2-plane in $F^4$ looks like this: $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & * & 0 & * \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & * \end{pmatrix}$$ This is clearly an affine cell. It is equally easy to show (in the case of a Grassmannian) that the cells are bijective with the $k$-subsets of an $n$-set. This is not a complete explanation because a Grassmannian is just the simplest type of flag variety, but it captures the basic geometric idea. As for references, there is an interesting mini-review for combinatorialists on page 398 of Stanley, Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol 2. 

I'll start with the second question first. Your question is to describe the tangent and cotangent bundles of projective spaces or a Grassmannian, and their exterior powers. The Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(k,n)$ is also the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(n-k,n)$, so you could say that it has two tautological bundles $A$ and $B$, of dimension $k$ and $n-k$. Their direct sum is an $n$-dimensional trivial bundle. My intuition from the geometry is that the tangent bundle is $\text{Hom}(A,B)$. You can also write this as $A^* \otimes B$. Now suppose that $k=1$ so that it is $\mathbb{C}P^n$. Then $A = \mathcal{O}(-1)$ (if I have my signs right) and $B$ is the quotient of $(n+1)\mathcal{O}(0)$ by $A$. So $A^* \otimes B$ is a quotient of $(n+1)\mathcal{O}(1)$ by $\mathcal{O}(0)$. This is thus a resolution of the tangent bundle by direct sums of line bundles. The cotangent bundle has a dual resolution, and you can explode a resolution like this to obtain a resolution of the exterior powers. This realization of the tangent bundle of $\mathbb{C}P^n$ lets you compute its Chern classes. I think that the values of the Chern classes tell you that it isn't more directly a direct sum of line bundles. When $n=2$, Maple tells me that the Chern classes of the line bundles would be irrational. (Edit: As David Speyer explains, you can confirm with pen and paper that the Chern class doesn't factor completely, and doesn't even have a linear factor when $n$ is odd.) 

Part of this question has an ad hoc nature that, in my opinion, weakeans it as a math question. How much spaghetti can you fit into a Volkswagen Beetle? Remark: Slightly more than otherwise if you remember to open the glove compartment. Okay, the question is not quite that bad, but it is clearly sensitive to boundary behavior. If you allow the box to be an arbitrary convex shape (say), then who knows if it can ever be completely solved. So let's look at the boundary-independent part of the question. In 2 dimensions, if you have a convex box of any shape with a very large inradius, then it is not hard to show that the asymptotic density of the rope is 1. You can go back and forth across the box in a boustrophedonic pattern (like the diagram on the left). In 3 dimensions, one can speculate that the asymptotic density of the rope is $\sqrt{\pi}/12$, the same as the circle packing density in the plane. There is a theorem of Andras Bezdek and my dad, Włodzimierz Kuperberg, that the maximum density space packing with congruent circular cylinders of infinite length is attained when the cylinders are parallel. Their theorem includes the special case of the rope question in which most of the rope is parallel to itself. (On the other hand, it is not quite obvious that the entire theorem is a special case. Given a pile of stiff, straight spaghetti, can you always efficiently connect the ends to make one long noodle?) In any case, I asked my dad this asymptotic rope question, and in his opinion, it is an open problem. A rope seems much harder to control than straight cylinders. Also, as far as I know, the same questions concerning either straight, round cylinders or one long rope in higher dimensions are also open. It's my philosophy that an argument that a problem is open is a valid MO answer to a MO question. 

I will assume that everything in sight is Noetherian and finitely generated. Then the primary decomposition amounts to a description of the geometric support of the module $M$ if you view it as a sheaf on $\text{Spec}(A)$. The scheme $\text{Spec}(A/\text{Ann}(M))$ is a subscheme of $\text{Spec}(A)$ that, by definition, supports $M$. If $N_i$ is minimal, then $\text{Spec}(A/P_i)$ is an irreducible component of $\text{Spec}(A/\text{Ann}(M))$. The module $M/N_i$ is also a quotient of $M \otimes (A/P_i^n)$ for $n$ large enough (and in a reduced decomposition I think they are equal), so it is part of $M$ on that irreducible component of its support. If $N_i$ is not minimal, then $\text{Spec}(A/P_i)$ is an irreducible scheme inside of a component of $\text{Spec}(A/\text{Ann}(M))$. 

There are two different kinds of directed graphs, graphs with and without 2-cycles. The question posed considers the kind without 2-cycles, but I don't see a problem defining either kind of Rado graph on the same class of groups. For that matter, you could have various kinds of colored Rado graphs, where some of the edge colors are directed and others are undirected. (So, allowing 2-cycles amounts to having two undirected colors and one directed color.) I don't think that it really says a whole lot about the group. It says that the Rado graph has such a huge automorphism group that many groups act freely transitively on it. It looks like the Cameron-Johnson condition on the group $G$ is actually not only sufficient for a freely transitive action, but also necessary, at least to obtain the $n$-colored Rado graph for every finite $n$ as a Cayley graph of $G$. Still, the groups $G$ that are impossible are essentially impossible for a local reason. As for the uncountable analogues of the random graph, I might guess that the same constructions still work sometimes, but I would ask someone like Joel Hamkins. :-) 

I think that MacLane made a mistake. I think that he just forgot that the category of $T_4$ spaces lacks closure properties. Claim: If $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ is a (full) reflective subcategory and $\mathcal{C}$ has finite products, then $\mathcal{A}$ is closed under $\mathcal{C}$'s finite products, up to isomorphism. If $\mathcal{A}$ is reflective, it means that an object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ has an "$\mathcal{A}$-ification" $X'$, e.g., an abelianization in the case where $\mathcal{A}$ is abelian groups and $\mathcal{C}$ is groups. If $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$ are objects, then they have a product $A \times B$ in $\mathcal{C}$, and then that has an $\mathcal{A}$-ification $(A \times B)'$. There is an $\mathcal{A}$-ification morphism $A \times B \to (A \times B)'$, and there are also projection morphisms $A \times B \to A, B$. Since $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$, the projection morphisms factor through $(A \times B)'$, and then the universal property gives you a morphism $(A \times B)' \to A \times B$. So you get canonical morphisms in both directions between $A \times B$ and $(A \times B)'$, and I think that some routine bookkeeping shows that they are inverses. So the Sorgenfrey plane (which is the non-normal Cartesian square of the Sorgenfrey line) does not have a "$T_4$-ification". I got onto this track after I found the paper, Reflective subcategories and generalized covering spaces, by Kennison. Kennison lists closure under products as a necessary condition for reflectiveness. 

We have been here before with the arXiv. This site is (somewhat inadvertently) a massive work of social engineering. It is a social dynamical system, and it spreads where it wants to spread. Yes it is the founder effect, but it is more general than that. It is going to spread unevenly in different areas for a long time. 

I don't know the topic well enough to give you a complete answer, but two things. First, Chomsky and Schutzenberger proved that unambiguous context-free languages have an algebraic generating function. These are languages for which there is a context-free grammar that accepts each word in only one way. Or more generally and more weakly, they showed that the number of acceptances, as distinct from the number of words, has an algebraic generating function. There is a paper by Philippe Flajolet in which he proves that certain CFLs have no unambiguous grammar exactly by showing that the generating function is transcendental. Flajolet is also interested in holonomic generating functions, but I did not see any clear statement as to whether the g.f. of an ambiguous CFL can be non-holonomic. Flajolet is surely a good person to ask about the entire question. Second, I can't resist mentioning an unfinished project from a while ago that might help you as a survey. Complexity Zoology is a computer-assisted compilation of inclusions and separations of language classes, to go with the much better known Complexity Zoo living survey started by Scott Aaronson. The Complexity Zoo moved to Stanford, so for now all of my links are broken, but Zoology knows things that would be difficult to add to the Zoo without its help. You can learn pretty quickly that there are not very many language classes between CFL and things that are clearly #P-hard to count, or harder. One candidate is GCSL, which means CSL with the restriction that all replacement rules make the words grow. Although in light of the first comment, looking at the next things after CFL is a little off the mark; DCFL or deterministic CFL is fairly standard and is contained in unambiguous CFL. My guess is that holonomic sequences are an enumerative intermediate that doesn't show up easily in complexity theory. 

To answer Qiaochu's question below, there's nothing wrong with using the standard switching map $v \otimes w \mapsto w \otimes v$ to define commutativity. It shows up all the time. The point is that the signed switching map $v \otimes w \mapsto (-1)^{|v||w|}w \otimes v$ is another valid and inequivalent symmetric monoidal structure. (The symmetric tensor structure is interpreted as what it means to permute factors of a product, of course.) There is nothing to prevent the signed switching map from arising among topological invariants or in physics, so it does arise. The structure theorems say that all "suitable" choices for the switching map are essentially these two, possibly disguised by a restriction to tensors that are invariant under a group action. For both good and bad reasons, I was deliberately vague about what it means for the symmetric tensor category to be suitable, in the sense that it will satisfy a structure theorem. You want some extra axioms and properties to hold, some of them related to existence of duals and traces. One version of the structure theorem, due to Deligne, is reviewed in this arXiv paper by Etingof and Gelaki. (The theorem cited as [De2] is the relevant one.) 

First of all, the one-point compactification of three open intervals is not a "tack", it's a three-leaf clover. I think that you mean a one-point union of three closed intervals; of course it doesn't matter if the other three endpoints are there or not. This topological type can be called a "Y" or a "T" or a "simple triod". R.L. Moore published a solution to your question in 1928. The answer is no. It was generalized in 1944 by his student Gail Young: You can only have countably many $(n-1)$-dimensional tacks in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for any $n \ge 2$. For her theorem, the name "tack" makes rather more sense, but she calls it a "$T_n$-set". Actually Moore's theorem applies to a more general kind of triod, in which three tips of the "Y" are connected to the center by "irreducible continua", rather than necessarily intervals. 

There have been several questions on mathoverflow about the field with one element. Of course, such a field doesn't really exist and the discussion must fray sooner or later. So here is a different kind of answer. Besides finite fields, which are 0-manifolds, there are only two fields which are manifolds, $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{R}$. There is a generalization of cardinality for manifolds and similar spaces, namely the geometric Euler characteristic. (This is as opposed homotopy-theoretic Euler characteristic; they are equal for compact spaces.) The geometric Euler characteristic of $\mathbb{C}$ is 1, while the geometric Euler characteristic of $\mathbb{R}$ is -1. In this sense, $\mathbb{C} = \mathbb{F}_1$ while $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{F}_{-1}$. It works well for some of the motivating examples of the fictitious field with one element. For instance, the Euler characteristic of the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(k,n)$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is then uniformly the Gaussian binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}_q$. In this interpretation, $\mathbb{F}_1$ is algebraically closed. It is also a quadratic extension of $\mathbb{F}_{-1}$; the generalized cardinality squares, as it should. 

$R(x) = x$ for a point $x$ (1) $R$ fixes a line $L$ pointwise (2) $R(L) = L$ by reflecting it (2) $R(P) = P$ for a plane $P$ (1) $R(x) \in L$ (2) $R(x) \in P$ (1) $R(L) \subset P$ (2) $R(x_1) = x_2$ (3) $R(L_1) \cap L_2 \ne \emptyset$ (1) $R(P_1) = P_2$ (3) 

For references: Really Turaev and Viro's original paper, state sum invariants of 3-manifolds and 6j symbols, is pretty good. The generalization to spherical categories is due to Barrett and Westbury, Invariants of Piecewise-Linear 3-manifolds. And there is a discussion in Turaev's book. A sketch: Recall that a basis-independent expression in tensor calculus has the structure of a graph with vertices labelled by tensors and edges labelled by vector spaces. A monoidal category allows the evaluation of similar expressions, except that the graph must be planar and acyclic. In a rigid pivotal category, there are good duals and the graph just needs to be planar. In a spherical category, left trace equals right trace, so a closed graph can be drawn on a sphere. If it is spherical, rigid, and semisimple, then you can use the graph of a tetrahedron to make a local interaction on the tetrahedra of a triangulated 3-manifold, and the result up to normalization is the Turaev-Viro 3-manifold invariant. (In this setting you should dualize the tetrahedra, so that a tensor morphism in the category is associated to a face of the tetrahedron.)
