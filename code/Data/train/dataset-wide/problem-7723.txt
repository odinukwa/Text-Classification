Every equation ought to be numbered in print publications or fixed-format electronic publications; if an equation is not important enough to be included as a numbered equation in the article, it ought not be included at all. As for "above" and "below", I've learned them contextually as meaning "prior" and "later" in the current article. I've never understood it to mean exactly one equation above or one equation down. In fact, I've even seen absolute and relative references together, as in "see equation 12 above." If an equation reference goes too far forwards or backwards, it makes sense to repeat the equation renumbered with a new number in this location. It's much easier to look at it on the same page rather than have to flip back and forth. Relative references make some sense for fixed publication media such as printed copies of journals. Absolute references, such as pointers and index numbers and URLs, make more sense for variable view-model media such as electronic publications (HTML particularly). I agree with the other answers (above, and below) for mathematical writings for print publications such as journals. However, there is an extra consideration for electronically published items in electronic journals or particularly in forums like this web-site, Mathoverflow. Users have the option of controlling their viewing model on electronic publication systems and changing what appears at the "top" of their electronic page. They may choose chronological order in order to view comments in the same order they were submitted, allowing ease in understanding the flow of commentary. They may choose reverse chronological order, for example when they are revisiting a question just to see what the latest entries have been. They may also choose to order the results by popularity or relevance (with popularity of votes being an electronic self-selected polling of relevance by other readers). On forums like Mathoverflow, references to other writer's contributions as "the answer above" or the "answer below" are rendered meaningless and confusing by the fact that the physical ordering of the answers is different for different readers and at different times. Reader preference can re-order the answers according to time submitted (oldest first, newest first) or by popularity (votes thus far); the popularity is evanescent as the number of votes will also change over time. Certain options lead to difficulty in following threads. For example, comments tend to be initally shown in descending order of votes, destroying the temporal ordering of conversations or the ordering of comments spread out amongst multiple entry boxes. I would have expected that long comments spread out amongst multiple boxes would be discouraged; but they seem to be rather prevalent among mathoverflow. I find that I always have to click on the "show additional comments" button in order to be able to follow the unfolding of the comments and understand the conversation in the commentary. 

What is the maximum number of cards that can be played which do not contain a collinear group of three? (ans=20) The card game misuses the mathematical term "set" in its name and in its directions for playing the game, since it asks the players to yell out "set!" when they find such a collinear grouping in the 4-d lattice. It should be rightfully called "line", or perhaps most correctly "4-dimensional affine space line over the field with 3 elements". But yelling that out each time would certainly slow down playing the game. :) $URL$ has an article from the Mathematical Intelligencer about this game by Benjamin Lent Davis, Diane Maclagan and Ravi Vakil. 

If you are restricting the weighting of the edges (it could just as equivalently be, in this case, weighting of vertices which would yield the same result) to be $\pm 1$, then you've got the weighting of a face being equivalent to the parity of the number of $-1$ weighted edges. Every $1$ edge contributes no change to the weighting of a face, while every $-1$ edge flips the parity of the weight of the face, thus the weight of a face is $+1$ if there is parity $0$ (an even number of $-1$ weighted edges) and the weight of a face if $-1$ if there is parity $1$ (an odd number of $-1$ weighted edges) surrounding the face. A similar simplification can be seen for the $j+1$-face: the weight of a $j+1$-face is the parity of the number of $-1$ weighted faces which surround it. Of course, the obvious physical weightings of polytopes exist: where the weights represent 

Please clarify your question: rigorously define what you mean by curve and line. @mmr, thus far, in the way you've defined your question, you do not have two 2-dimensional curves, you don't even have a curve or line defined for each individual set. What you do have are two sets of points in 2-d space, $N_1$, and $N_2$. You also have not stated that the number of points in each set is the same or different, thus the cardinality of both sets is not necessarily the same. Now how are you defining the "curves" or line-segments for each set of points? If you do not have a definition which maps from the set of points $N_1$ to either a line or line-segment in $\mathbb{R^2}$ or a curve in $\mathbb{R^2}$, then there is no point in trying to define a new function which defines the average or a new function which parametrizes the weighted average of a line which interpolates the two so-called "lines" defined by $N_1$ and $N_2$. Your function mapping from the point set to the "curve" you desire needs to defined, first of all, for a single set of points. 

Look at the appropriate space in which your data would have a normal distribution, or look at the appropriate space in which your data set becomes linear. This requires knowing the distribution of your experimental data as a prior value. The correlation coefficient $R$ works best for linearly related data expressable as $y=mx+b$. While $R$ may have some informative value (positive or negative correlation) for non-linearly related variables, it really doesn't have a good clear meaning in non-linear cases. Takes the logarithm of both sides and get $$\log(a)=b \cdot \log(T)$$ and see if you can calculate the correlation and do linear regression to find the best fit linear relation between $\log(a)$ and $\log(T)$. This way, you can see if the correlation coefficient can be informative for you. But the key thing is in knowing the distribution (or expected distribution) of your data. If it is not normally distributed in the space which you're working in, try to find a transform which moves the data into a space where it has a linear normal Gaussian distribution. 

This is a basic probability and distribution question, I believe, and I hope it is not homework. Based on Yemon Choi's comments, I'm posting this answer: For the sake of example, I will relabel your fruit 

The answer to that is no. If the people playing concur that the 12 cards initally dealt does not contain 3-points in the 4-d lattice that are collinear, then 3 more cards are dealt, etc. 

Simulated annealing is a good answer, as given by Kjetil B Halvorsen. You can also try genetic algorithms to mix and cross-over multiple tries at different permutations. Say that $\Pi_a$ and $\Pi_b$ are two permutations in your permutation space. If the function $f$ is not a black box, or if it is a black box which you are allowed to use as an oracle, find the value $f_a$ for $\Pi_a$ and $f_a$ for $\Pi_b$, or for a larger population of permutations. Take two or three of the highest scoring permutations based on the values of $f(X,\Pi_j)$ and use a genetic algorithm to cross-over between these two permutations. Or take the single highest scoring permutation and then internally permute a short region of the permutation and recalculate $f$. Iterate as necessary. This presumes that $f$ if smoothly continuous and that you can use a hill-climbing style of approach to find local maxima or local minima, whichever you need in your case. 

A morph in graphics is not always just the "tweening" (in between interpolation of the coordinates) of corresponding points between the starting shape $S_0$ and the ending shape $S_1$. Sometimes, some tweaking modifications such as rotation, bending, flowing, etc., are required in order to produce a visually satisfying or acceptable and believable transformation. (Of course, the concept of visually satisfying and acceptable are very subjective, contextual, and in the eye of the beholder, as evidenced by the nonobviousness of some of the examples in the question "Proofs without Words"). In the example you are trying to create, only the $S_a \to S_b$ step can be done as a linear interpolation morph. The rest of the steps require a bit of cleaning up and visual "eye candy" in order to be appreciable and understandable. I might try playing around with some animation tools to play with this, but I don't think that the transformation of the octahedral skeleton to the overtly obvious genus-7 shape can be done by the type of technique which you're asking for. 

Here's a quick on-line find of a page about population dynamics and chaos in insects: $URL$ It's by a theoretical biologist, Alexei Sharov, at the NIA. He also has other pages that could be of interest to you, including a summary of mathematical modeling of "forest insect dynamics": $URL$

Only in this last category did the department chair who invited me also send me a "formal invitation" as a written letter on departmental letterhead stationery. I have counted all of these as invited talks, even though only the last one had a formal written invitation, as in all cases, I was specifically asked and invited to give a presentation. " 

Each line that extends the boundaries of the polytope will decrease the angular extents available for escape zones and increase the likelihood of providing an intersection point. This is because each escape zone has a limited angular extent, $\theta_1 \le \theta \le \theta_2$, and the new line can only maintain that angular extent by being parallel to one of the two lines defining the angular extent of the escape zone. Any other angle will increase the area of the polytope and close off some of the angular extent available for that escape zone. That's the extent of my approach thus far. I'll have to ruminate on this a bit further, and add to this. Thanks for a very interesting question, Joseph. 

The software packages Octave and scilab can also do this. An example for $y^3 + x^3 - 6x^2y=0$ would be as follows. Change the last line from contour(z) to surf(z) to get a surface plot; to surfl(z) to get a shaded and illuminated surface plot. 

A permutation is the equivalent of an unbiased "good" hash function because it has even distribution. Since a permutation maps (1,2,...,n) $\to$ permuted-list-of(1,2,..., n), if the original set $A$ is an unbiased random selection of the range $1$ to $n$, then the likelihood that the $B$="permutation-hash" of $A$ will contain the minimum-value of $1$ to $n$ is the size of the set $A$ divided by $n$. If the hash function is equitable and well-distributed, then the range of input values will be "hashed" into and map into the output range in an evenly distributed fashion. If the domain is a group of 256 characters, and the hash is a function which outputs 8 characters, then you want the domain to be partitioned into as closely-equal-sized subsets based on the what the hash of the domain words are. A hash normally reduces the size of the object being hashed, thus because of the pigeonhole priniciple, at least one element of the range of the hash must map to more than one item in the domain. An equitable hash attempts to minimize the variance in the size of the bins which the domain is partitioned into. An inequitable hash leads to some of the bins being very different in size from the other bins. Thus a hash is usually a one-way mapping: given the hash of a message, it is not possible to determine what the original message consisted of, even though it may be possible to deduce what partition the message is part of (the partition whose hash digest is ...) For example, the hash function EVEN-ODD, equivalently called REMAINDER-MODULO-2, is easily calculated by looking at the last (lowermost) bit of the message. If the range is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$, e.g. the numbers $1...n$, then EVEN-ODD is an equitable hash, as the size of the partitions will differ by at most $1$. A permutation is equivalent to performing a hash which does not reduce the size of the domain as it maps into the range, it performs a bijection. As such, the size of each partition is $1$, the variance of the sizes of the partitions is $0$, and these partitions are as equitably sized as possible.
