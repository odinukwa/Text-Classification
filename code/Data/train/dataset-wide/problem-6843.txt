Yes, he is referring to a movement along the demand line. If the individual purchases less than $Q_0$, than the demand line would be higher than the price for quantities for $Q_0$, this means that the individual values consumption more than its cost (its price). Graphically, you just need to show that for a quantity less than $Q_0$, the demand line is higher than the price, i.e. the individual values consumption more than its cost. 

I am trying to study the effects of a policy on educational attainment of individuals (years of schooling, primary/secondary school completion, literacy). Since the policy starts in a specific year I decided to use an RDD using birth year as running variable. The problem is that my sample is made of 5 different countries in which the policy has been implemented in 5 different years. Am I able to pool the effect of the policy across countries? Because if I build a unique running variable as being 0 for each cutoff year I get individuals born in e.g. 1994 having running variable both 0, -2, +3 depending on the country of origin. How can I deal with this issue? Should I run a RD for each country alone? 

Mere googling leads me to find a bunch of references about elasticity of marginal utility. Here Professor Acemoglu defines the elasticity of marginal utility as the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (pagg. 17-18). Here you can find a question analogous to yours together with an answer explained in an easier way than Acemoglu's lecture. If you are interested in something more empirical, have a look here: it is a paper by David Evans about the empirical estimation of elasticity of marginal utility in OECD countries. Hope this is enough. If you have other questions, please ask 

Assuming that $W$ is wage and $L$ is labor, I would say this is a labor supply-demand graph. TD stand for demand and S for supply. The graph shows a positive shift in labor supply, i.e. labor offered by workers, leading to an increase in $L$ and a decrease of $W$ due to the excess of supply. The shift in labor supply can be caused by a variety of shocks as a preference shock which values more labor, a change in non-labor income, etc (look here for explanations) 

While I was studying, I stuck into a great debate between what is called "modern macro" and Keynesian macro with a lot of interesting and actual insights. I have already read about "classical economics", I mean Smith, Ricardo and so on but I did not succeed in finding a book/paper talking about the actual debate and its roots. Can you please suggest me some references in order to better understand the evolution of economic thought in the XX century and to make my own idea about the actual debate going on? 

My advice is to take out loans instead of working overtime during your university years. You are likely to be working for a very low wage until you get your degree. If you instead spend your time trying to excel academically, after graduation your per hour earnings may be several times higher than your wage as a student. Take advantage of loan availability and low interest rates. Don't worry about what other people say. Let others graduate debt-free with chronic illnesses, psychological disorders, and on the bottom of their class. Of course they are going to be bitter because you are going to get more with less effort. 

Neither American nor World economy will collapse as long as there at least two citizens producing goods and willing to exchange them. Roman Empire's economy did not collapse either, for the record, the Empire did. In any economy some jobs and sectors become obsolete, others take over and attract a lot of capital. At some point of the 20th century the car industry was booming and made Detroit the richest city in America. Then manufacturing jobs got outsourced and now the US economy strives creating IT products. Rich people rely on ordinary people's income and spending to maintain their wealth. It is the average people who buy products made by the rich people's firms and make them rich in the first place. It is the average people who produce goods and services that the rich people buy with their dollars. Also, the democratic political system of a country is centered around the median voter, the ordinary guy . If the tax and wealth redistribution policies favor rich too much, people will vote for more redistribution of wealth. This ensures resilience and sustainability of modern democracies, something the Roman Empire did not have. There is a balance, or equilibrium, between how much capital the rich get rewarded for their contributions to society and how much an average Joe earns on the average job. In this equilibrium there are very rich, there are poor, and there are unemployed. Sometimes, it may seem, rich become too rich and there are too many poor. 

In practice, there are many variables to it. I know such theories have extended lists of ceteris paribus (with everything else held equal). Hold enough things equal and elasticity can always be higher in the long run. I'd like to add a few examples to the ones dsmithecon provided. When people's buying power drops in the short term due to some crisis. One can switch from driving a car to a bicycle during tough times and then go back to driving the car when income goes back up. New substitutes can become available in the short term. Same example, a bicycle would never be considered by some if they could afford a car. Historically this happened even to staples such as bread during famines when people would start eating stuff they never ate before. It was especially acute before central banks figured out to ease monetary policy during crises or there were no central banks at all. Or gold or strictly limited commodity or currency of another country was used as a currency, or still is in some places. Or there are constraining regulations in place. Or a command economy entirely. I could probably extend this list even more, but the point is as far as I know there isn't an economic theory that exists without assumptions and can have a general proof or be completely refuted. If something is challenged, it is often added as an assumption and the theory may look sound again. It doesn't imply economic theories are wrong or even flawed. Economics, as all social sciences, deal with so many variables there is just no way to control them all and come up with something general, proven, and irrefutable. 

A share or stock is part of an individual company. Unit (Trusts) are a collection of different (and usually related) shares. For example, I am currently investing in a Singapore Equity Fund. And this is known as a Unit Trust. And within the Singapore Equity Fund, my investment is made up of different company shares, e.g. the local bank shares, telecommunication company and some other companies. And these Unit Trusts are usually managed by a Fund Manager who belong to a Fund Management Company (or known as Fund House). And there are many different Fund Management Companies in Singapore with their own expertise and knowledge. Source: here 

In a New Keynesian model, under the assumption of sticky prices, we need to express the monetary policy through an equation in order to close the model made of New-Keynesian Phillips curve and dynamic IS curve. I've read that an easy choice is to use the so called Taylor rule, which express the interest rate as a function of inflation (and possibly a random component). But, I've read that it is a suboptimal choice because it is something exogenous, whereas if we endogenously compute the optimal monetary policy we can reach a better result. My question is why using a Taylor rule when we know it is not optimal to do that? 

I would suggest you Ray, D. Development Economics. It received an endorsement by no less a person than Amyrta Sen, Nobel Prize Winner 1996. 

There is no trick in that Euler equation. In the New Keynesian model, the Euler equation for consumption is derived from the first order condition for $B_t$, the bond holding. You have to pay attention to the fact that bonds appear in the budget constraint at two moments in time $t$ and $t+1$. Thus you have to compute the foc as \begin{gather} B_t:\beta^t\lambda_tQ_t-\beta^{t+1}\lambda_{t+1}=0 \end{gather} Then substituting $\lambda$ using the foc for $C_t$ and simplifying the betas, you obtain \begin{gather} Q_t=\beta E_t\{\frac{U_{c_{t+1}}}{U_{c_t}}\frac{P_t}{P_{t+1}}\}=0 \end{gather} EDIT: In the NK model, household maximizes its utility function choosing $C_t$, $N_t$ and $B_t$. Thus, you have to compute the FOC for these three variables, i.e. \begin{align} B_t:&\beta^t\lambda_tQ_t-\beta^{t+1}E_t\{\lambda_{t+1}\}=0 \\ C_t:&\beta^tU_{c,t}-\lambda_tP_t=0 \\ N_t:&\beta^tU_{n,t}-\lambda_tW_t=0 \end{align} In order to compute the consumption Euler equation, you need to substitute $\lambda_t$ from the $C_t$ foc into the $B_t$ foc. Then rearranging and simplifying $\beta$ as $\beta^{t+1}/\beta^t=\beta$ you get the equation you wrote above. You get only one $\beta$ because it is constant over time, it is not index by $t$ as the other variables, it is a constant. Thus whatever time is $C$, you will have the same $\beta$. I think it is well explained in Gali too. 

If you are running a regression analysis I would say you should look first at p-values to check if the explanatory variables you added make sense. I mean if you have a hypothesis about a relationship among two variables and you find the explanatory one not significant (large p-value) I would check for possible mistakes or alternative explanations. It makes sense to have a look at $R^2$ if you are comparing two different specification, it does not really make sense looking at it alone. I have seen many papers, have a look at Nunn, Wantcheckon, (2011) as an example, which have been published on top journals (AER in this case) even with $R^2$ around 16%, not really an high value. 

Whether rising housing prices are a good or a bad thing depends on the stage of business cycle. If the economy is coming out of recession or economic growth is slow (below average), as it is now in 2017, then rising housing prices are generally a good thing. Housing reflects the broader state of the economy. People have more money to pay for houses, homeowners and companies benefit from real estate appreciation, lenders/borrowers are more optimistic, construction and related industries are hiring to build more houses, etc. If the economy is going strong and prices are rising rapidly, that is the sign of overheating. Lenders are lending recklessly and buyers become speculative (buying only because the prices are going up). It is not good because it causes a real estate bubble. Eventually it bursts and a lot of people lose a lot of money, like back in 2008. Or even like in 1990's in Japan: 

Yuan will certainly appear in the reserves of oil exporting countries. The question is how much of it? China still has many problems with its currency and a long way to go until it becomes as appealing as dollar or even Japanese yen. Whether countries include a currency in their reserve basket ultimately depends on how predictable and stable it is compare to other currencies. It is also preferred that the currency appreciates in the long term. Living in China myself and holding my savings in yuan, I try to keep an eye on factors and risks that may move it up or down in medium to long term. Here are the most important in my opinion: Upside: 

The goal of import quotas is to get people to buy domestic goods, which can only be bought for local currency. Therefore import quotas increase demand for local currency. But... Setting import quotas is a very undesirable economic policy. It is basically a state intrusion into a market economy. Quotas for imports are usually implemented as a desperate measure when there is a continuously negative trade balance, local currency rapidly loses value, and every other measure (increasing taxes, customs, subsidizing exporters, etc.) failed. Distribution of quotas usually involves plenty of corruption. On top of that, World Trade Organization does not normally allow import quotas. The more common use of import quotas is in agriculture, to support local farmers or production of a certain crop. But such limited use of import quotas should have very limited effect on the currency, unless it is a 'banana republic' where agriculture is the main economic activity. 

When people find jobs, they start receiving salaries and their consumption increases. Increased demand for goods and services leads to increase in prices, or inflation. Fed is expected to respond with a rate hike to keep inflation in check. 

Tight monetary policy reduces the amount of money available in the economy and strengthens the currency. It is usually implemented by raising interest rates, increasing capital requirements for banks, or sometimes selling government bonds. When there is less money and credit to go around, business activity slows down, economic growth slows down. Businesses that could have expanded by taking out loans do not do so; consumers who could have purchased more with their credit cards can't do so; investors who could have invested more money into businesses (equities) put the money into government bonds.
