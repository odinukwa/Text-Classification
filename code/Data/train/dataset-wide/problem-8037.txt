No. Let $w=1$ for simplicity. If the imaginary part $\Im z> 0$ then $\Im B(z,1)>0$ and if $\Im z< 0$ then $\Im B(z,1)<0$, so $B(z,1)$ vanishes on the line $\Im z=0$ so it is uniformly 0. The same thing happens for any $w$, just replace $\Im z$ by $\Im (z/w)$. 

It sounds like you have a percolation problem. In percolation theory one has a lattice, typically in the plane or in 3-space, and each vertex is "porous" independently with probability $p$. The question is to describe the connected components of the set of porous vertices. It is common to restrict to a finite box, as in your example. One expects a similar behaviour to the Erdős–Rényi graph model, and there are many cases in which it is proved (although there may be less emphasis on the size of the small components). Edit: As Ben Barber points out in his answer, the techniques used are quite different to the Erdős–Rényi case, and one needs a much larger value of $p$ in order to expect a giant component. For some impressive-sounding real-world motivation one might imagine oil percolating through rock; it can only pass through porous areas, and the question is whether it eventually occupies a positive proportion of the rock (in which case one can drill into it and make some money). For many researchers the actual motivation is probably more to do with theoretical understanding of phase transitions. These problems are well studied, for example there are some introductory lecture notes here. On a casual inspection I cannot actually find an example where diagonal connections (cells connected only at their corners) are permitted, as in your question. Frustratingly I actually remember playing with a simulation of exactly your example in a physics lesson back in my schooldays. Maybe I can track it down. 

Obtaining a non-trivial estimate for $\sum_p (\log p) e(p \alpha)$ over the minor arcs is one of the estimates required for obtaining the ternary Goldbach for $n$ sufficiently large via the circle method (at least for the 'classical' proof I am aware of). We know by Vaughn's identity that if $|\alpha - a/q| < 1/q^2$, $(a,q)=1$, $q \leq n$ then we have an estimate of the form $$ \sum_{p \leq n} (\log p )e(p \alpha) \ll (n q^{-1/2} + n^{4/5} + n^{1/2}q^{1/2}) (\log n )^4, $$ and in case when $(\log n)^{c_1} \leq q \leq n/(\log n)^{c_2}$ we obtain a non-trivial estimate for the above sum. My question is: are there other examples of sequence say $M = \{m_1, m_2, .. \} \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that we have an estimate of the above type if we replace the primes with $M$. In other words, are there examples of sequences $M$ (and possibly with a suitable weight function $f(m)$ ) such that for $$ \sum_{m \in M, m \leq n} f(m) e(m \alpha) $$ we have a similar estimate as above where we can obtain a non-trivial estimate when $q$ is in the appropriate range? Thank you very much! 

Let $0 < \delta_1 \leq \delta_2 \leq \delta_3 \leq 1$, and consider the box $B := [0,X^{\delta_1}] \times [0,X^{\delta_2}] \times [0,X^{\delta_3}] \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$. Let $X > 3$ say. Is it possible to pack $B$ with cubes (box which has equal side lengths) $J_1, \ldots, J_N$ contained in $B$ satisfying the following property: 

Many other answers make what seem to me important points. Emanuele Tron’s observation that novelty is rather fuzzy and relative, and YCor’s suggestion that good research is not just about “new results”, particularly resonated with me. Implicit in those answers is the fact that your "job" can be at most to produce work which is new enough to be publishable. This is a highly specific and technical sense of “new”! For example bringing together ingredients from two different published papers, to prove a result which does not obviously follow from either, might absolutely be “new” in this sense. Of course it is good to be more ambitious than this. In fact it would be nice to come up with some utterly unprecedented new ideas! But that would be extraordinarily rare and even if you did do it, you might not realise that you had. Most new mathematical ideas seem to me to come from understanding existing work more deeply, so as to extend it to new cases or prove stronger results with it. In practice a lot of the struggle can be to work out what results of a certain type have appeared in, or are well known to follow from, published work. Then you will be able to see the gaps where new results could fit. Because every person has a slightly different perspective, other people may be surprised by the work that results! If you follow the approach in the last paragraph, there might be a few false starts proving theorems that others do not find exciting or which are not publishable, but this is also part of the learning process. Remember that suggestions for alterations, extensions, alternatives or improvements can all be positive responses which show confidence in your ability. 

Let $k$ be a field. Given a form $f \in k[x_1, ..., x_n]$ of degree at least $2$, we define the Schmidt rank, also known as the $h$-invariant, $h_k(f)$ to be the least positive integer $h$ such that $f$ can be written identically as $$ f = u_1 v_1 + ... + u_h v_h, $$ where each $u_i$ and $v_i$ are forms in $k[x_1, ..., x_n]$ of degree at least $1$. For example, this comes up in the paper "The density of integer points on homogeneous varieties" by Wolfgang Schmidt. It can be easily shown that $$ h-1 \leq h_k(f |_{x_j = 0}) \leq h \leq n. $$ Let $i_1, ..., i_n$ be the integers $1$ to $n$ in any order. We have by the above inequalities that $$ h = h_k({f}) \geq h_k({f} |_{x_{i_1}=0}) \geq h_k( {f} |_{x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}=0}) \geq ... \geq h_k( {f} |_{x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, ..., x_{i_n} =0}) = 0, $$ where at each step in the above chain of inequalities, either the value stays the same or decreases by $1$. I am interested in proving the following: Let $f \in k[x_1, ..., x_n]$ be a form of degree $d>1$. Suppose positive integers $C$ and $M$ are given, and $h = h_k(f) > XC$ (where $X$ is sufficiently large with respect to $M$). Suppose also that $h_k(\mathbf{f}|_{x_j = 0}) = h - 1$ for all $1 \leq j \leq n$. Then there exists $M' = M'(X,M,f)>0$ and $\mathbf{x}' = (x_{i_1}, ..., x_{i_{MC}})$ such that $$ h_k(\mathbf{f}|_{\mathbf{x}'= \mathbf{0} }) \leq h - M' C. $$ I am guessing that the statement is true, and I am very interested in proving it but I don't even know where to start at the moment... I would appreciate any assistance! I would also appreciate any input or reference! Thank you very much! PS I also tagged commutative algebra and algebraic geometry in case there might be a more algebraic/geometric approach to this. Thanks! 

Expanding the solution in a Frobenius series $f_{\lambda}(x) = x^c \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_i x^i $ gives the indicial eq. $a_0 c (-1 + c) = 0$, which implies $c=0$ or $c=1$. The physical situation dictates that one should choose the $c=1$ solution. Now we are left with one solution for each $\lambda$ (i.e. the one which is regular at the origin). The problem is whether $\lambda$ should be continuous or discrete. To answer this we have to turn to the asymptotics of the ODE for large $x$. If one performs the substitution $f_{\lambda}(x) \rightarrow e^{-(a x+b x^2)/2} g_{\lambda}(x)$, one obtains \begin{eqnarray} g^{''}(x) &=& \left\{ \left[ \frac{k_0^2}{4 \sigma^2} (- 2 \alpha x + \eta)^2 +\frac{k_0 \alpha}{\sigma} \right] - \frac{1}{\sigma} \frac{(- 2 \alpha x + \eta)^2}{x}\lambda^2 \right\} g(x) \\ &&=\left[ q(x) + p(x) \lambda^2 \right] g(x) . \end{eqnarray} Note that for a given $\lambda$, for large enough $x$, $q(x) + p(x) \lambda^2 > 0$. I seem to find a theorem which says in this case the function ceases to oscillate. If this is the case, then it means the function either decays or explodes for large $x$. Indeed, the only special term seems to be the $1/x$-term in $p(x)$. For large $x$, try dropping this term. Then $q(x) + p(x) \lambda^2$ is just a quadratic polynomial of $x$, and the equation is nothing but the parabolic cylinder differential equation. It seems that one solution decays as $e^{-b/2 x^2}$ while the other blows up (as $e^{b/2 x^2}$?). Summing up, the solution that is regular at the origin may blow up at infinity for arbitrary $\lambda$, and it decays only for some (discrete) values of $\lambda$. In the completeness relation for the eigenfuntions, one should sum over discrete values of $\lambda$ rather than enforcing a continuous summation. May one compare the above system with the Hermite diff. eq. or Laguerre diff. eq.? 

This is Theorem 1.10 of Sardari (2017). Let $d\geq 5$, and for simplicity let $L=\mathbb{Z}^d$. Define the ball $B_0=\{x:|x-\lambda_0|<\epsilon\}$ and the normalised ball $B = |k|^{-1/2}B$. Provided that (1) the normalised ball $B$ is contained in some fixed compact set $\Omega$, and (2) the ball $B_0$ has a radius $\epsilon\gg |k|^{\frac{1}{4}+\delta}$ for some fixed $\delta>0$, he proves $$ F(\lambda_0,k,\epsilon) = \mathfrak{S}_\infty(\lambda_0) \Big(\prod_{p\text{ prime}}\mathfrak{S}_p(N)\Big)\epsilon^{d-1}|k|^{-\frac{1}{2}}\big(1+O_{q,\Omega,\delta}(|k|^{-\delta'})\big) $$ for some $\delta'>0$. Provided $q(x)=k$ is soluble everywhere locally, $\Big(\prod_{p\text{ prime}}\mathfrak{S}_p(N)\Big)$ is bounded above and below by constants depending only on $q$. Also $ \mathfrak{S}_\infty(\lambda_0)$ is bounded above and below by constants depending only on $q$ and $\Omega$. (See Remark 1.4 in the same paper) The exponent in condition (2) is optimal, see the second part of Theorem 1.10. It is possible that condition (1) is included to keep things manageable, rather than because it is essential to the proof. If so, then the same proof might show that as soon as $\epsilon\gg |\lambda_0|^{\frac{1}{2}+\delta}$ for some fixed $\delta>0$ we have $$ F(\lambda_0,k,\epsilon) =\overline{\mathfrak{S}}_\infty(\lambda_0) \Big(\prod_{p\text{ prime}}\mathfrak{S}_p(N)\Big)\epsilon^{d-1}|\lambda_0|^{-1}\big(1+O_{q,\Omega,\delta}(|\lambda_0|^{-\delta'})\big) $$ where the modified constant $\overline{\mathfrak{S}}_\infty(\lambda_0)$ is still bounded above and below by constants depending only on $q$. I would need to read through the proof in more detail to be confident of this last part. 

For elementary courses, say up to first year undergraduate or so, Khan Academy has a wide range of courses on maths (some of which are listed under computer science or physics). For graduate courses, several answers have mentioned MSRI and/or the Hausdorff institute but the Fields Institute video archive deserves a mention as well. The archive does no go back very far, but there are some excellent courses at various levels. (Search for the word "course" on the linked page). 

There are many results in number theory, where the existence of some $B \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with certain properties is proved by a probabilistic argument employing "random sets". One such example would be the result of Erdos and Renyi, where they proved the existence of a "think" $B_2[g]$ sequence. My question is are there certain known properties, so that if $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ satisfies them, then $A$ is considered to behave like a random set? or what properties would make $A$ considered to be close to being random? Thank you! 

Let $S \subset \mathbb{N}$. We say $S$ is of type $B_2(g)$ if the number of representation of the form $n = s_1 + s_2 \ (s_1 \leq s_2)$ is bounded by $g$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Let $S(n)$ be the number of elements of $S$ not exceeding $n$. There is a theorem by Erdos and Renyi, which states that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $g =g(\epsilon)$ and a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $S$ is of type $B_2(g)$ and $$ S(n) > n^{1/2 - \epsilon} $$ for $n$ sufficiently large. My question is, is this best up to $\epsilon$? In other words, if $S$ is of type $B_2(g)$, then does it follow that $$ S(n) \ll n^{1/2} $$ for $n$ sufficiently large? I am guessing that this is the case, but I was wondering if someone could possibly explain this to me. Thank you! 

I am interested in counting number of lattices using the following theorem. The following is Theorem IV (page 412) in Chapter VIII of "An introduction to the geometry of numbers (second printing, corrected)" by J.W.S. Cassels: Let $F(\bar{x})$ be a convex symmetric distance-function associated with a bounded convex set $$ \phi \ : F(\bar{x}) < 1 $$ of volume $$ V_F = V(\phi). $$ Let $\Lambda$ be a lattice with successive minima with $\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n$ with respect to $F$. For real $t>0$ denote by $S(t)$ the set of $h \in \mathcal{R} / \Lambda$ which have at least one representative $\bar{y} \in t \phi \ (i.e. F(\bar{y})< t)$. Then the measure $m(S(t))$ of $S(t)$ satisfies the inequality \begin{eqnarray} m(S(t))) = \begin{cases} = t^n V_F \ \text{ if } t \leq \lambda_1/2 \\ \geq (\lambda_1/2) ... (\lambda_J/2)t^{n-J}V_F \ \text{ if } \lambda_{J}/2 \leq t \leq \lambda_{J+1}/2 \\ \geq (\lambda_1/2) ... (\lambda_n/2)V_F \ \text{ if } \lambda_{n}/2 \leq t. \\ \end{cases} \end{eqnarray} Here $\mathcal{R}$ is the euclidean space which the lattice sits in. I am interested in deducing information about $N(U) = \# \{ \bar{x} \in \Lambda : F(\bar{x}) < U \}$ when say $\lambda_{J} \leq U \leq \lambda_{J+1}$ using this theorem. I would like an upper bound and a lower bound for it. I am guessing it is possible, but I don't quite see how (I feel like there might be something very simple I am not aware of). I would greatly appreciate any assistance. I would also appreciate any references. Thank you very much! PS I would also appreciate any reference or ways to estimate $N(U) = \# \{ \bar{x} \in \Lambda : F(\bar{x}) < U \}$ when $\lambda_{J} \leq U \leq \lambda_{J+1}$ not necessarily using the above theorem. 

Is it possible to ensure the normalisation (for the eigenfunctions), $\int_0^{\infty} dx \left[ (\beta - 2 \alpha x)^2 / x \right] e^{a x + b x^2} f_{\lambda_1}(x) f_{\lambda_2}(x) = \delta(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)$, where $\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function? What is the asymptotic behaviour for $f_{\lambda}(x)$? (I expect the set of eigenfunctions to be complete; I suppose that $f_{\lambda}(x) / \sqrt{\rho(x)}$ should behave like sine waves for large $x$ (??), where $\rho(x)$ is the weight function, and thus expect $f_{\lambda}(x) \sim \left[ x / (\beta - 2 \alpha x)^2 \right]^{1/2} e^{-(a x + b x^2)/2} $. Is this correct?) How may one relate an eigenfunction satisfying the above normalisation (if the latter is possible at all) with the Frobenius series solution at the origin. For example, the regular solution $f^{0}_{\lambda}(x)$ at the origin goes as $x^c$, $c>0$. One may define the series solution to be $f^{0}_{\lambda}(x) = x^c g(\lambda, x)$, where $g(\lambda, 0) = 1$. How does it relate to the eigenfunction satisfying the delta-function normalisation? i.e. What is $N(\lambda)$ in $f_{\lambda}(x) = N(\lambda) f^{0}_{\lambda}(x)$? Does $N(\lambda)$ depend on $\lambda$ at all? 

Thanks a lot. P.S.: I'm sorry. The claims above are almost all wrong. In the following I shall write down some of my observations. Would someone please comment (on whether the following arguments are valid or not.) 

Consider the 2nd-order linear ODE $x f^{''}(x) + x (\beta - 2 \alpha x) \kappa / \sigma f^{'}(x) - 1 / \sigma \left[ 2 \alpha \kappa - \lambda^2 (\beta - 2 \alpha x)^2 \right] f(x) = 0$, where $\sigma>0$, $\beta>0$, $\alpha<0$ and $\kappa>0$. The ODE has a non-essential singularity at $x=0$, and may be regarded as an eigenvalue equation for $\lambda$. The ODE may be cast in the self-adjoint form, $\left[ e^{a x + b x^2} f_{\lambda}^{'}(x) \right]^{'} - 2 \alpha \kappa /\sigma e^{a x + b x^2} f_{\lambda}(x) + \lambda^2 (\beta - 2 \alpha x)^2 /x e^{a x + b x^2} f_{\lambda}(x) = 0 $, where $a = \kappa \beta / \sigma$ and $b = - \alpha \kappa / \sigma $. If one requires the solution be regular at the origin, then
