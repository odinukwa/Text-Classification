Ramsey Theory says that every sufficently large (but finite) complete graph having $d-$coloured edges contains a monochromatic complete subgraph with $k$ vertices. One could ask for asymptotics: Let $A(n,d,k)$ be the minimal number of monochromatic complete subgraphs with $k$ vertices contained in any complete graph with $n$ vertices whose edges are coloured with $d$ colours. One has the obvious bounds: $n+1-N\leq A(n,d,k)\leq {n\choose k}\sim \frac{n^k}{k!}$ where $N$ is the corresponding Ramsey number. There exists thus a critical exponent $\alpha$ such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{A(n,d,k)}{n^{\beta}}=\infty$ for all $\beta<\alpha$ and $\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{A(n,d,k)}{n^{\beta}}=0$ for all $\beta>\alpha$. What is $\alpha$? Perhaps the function $\frac{A(n,d,k)}{n^{\alpha}}$ has a nice behaviour? Are there any instance where one can say anything interesting? (One has obviously $\alpha\geq 1$ a strict inequality would probably already be interesting.) The same type of question can be asked for Erd\"os-Szekeres, for van der Waerden (with a different, much smaller but still affine lower bound) etc. Added after Gowers solution: Gowers gave the following easy proof that $\alpha=k$. Denote by $m=\inf\lbrace n\ \vert\ A(n,d,k)>0\rbrace$ the Ramsey number corresponding to our problem. Since a fixed monochromatic $k-$clique is contained in exactly ${n-k\choose m-k}$ subsets of size $m$ we have $$A(n,d,k)\geq\frac{{n\choose m}}{{n-k\choose m-k}}\sim \frac{n^k}{m^k}\ .$$ The only interesting question is thus the exact value of $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{A(n,d,k)}{n^k}$ which exists by Gowers first argument. 

This is not at all a complete answer but a remark which can be improved. It is a completely rewritten and replaces bullshit (explaining the first comments.) Suppose the answer to Segerman's question is no. There exists thus a counterexample given by a decreasing sequence $r_1\geq \dots \geq r_n$ of radii such that $\sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2=1/2$ and one can not fit $n$ circles with radii $r_1,\dots,r_n$ into a circle $C_1$ of radius $1$. Suppose $n$ is the smallest integer for which a counterexample exists. Then $r_1<2/3$. Indeed, the area $\pi(1/2-r_1^2)$ of the discs of radii $r_2,\dots,r_n$ is at most half the area $\pi(1-\rho_1)^2$ of the largest disc $C'$ which fits together with the disc $C_1$ of radius $r_1$ into $C$. Since $n$ is minimal, the $(n-1)$ circles of radii $r_2,\dots,r_n$ can be packed into $C'$. This kind of argument can be improved (pack the circles of radii $r_2,\dots$ into more than one circle of suitable radii which fit into $C$ together with $ C_1$) in order to lower the upper bound on the largest radius of a minimal counterexample. I guess one can use a packing argument showing that a solution always exists if the largest radius is small enough. These two bounds can perhaps be made to met (but I fear that the involved combinatorics are quite messy). Let me make the argument for small radii a little bit more (but not entirely, I agree that some more work is needed) rigorous. (This is probably similar to the argument suggested by fedja (see comment below), I admit that I do not quite understand the details). Supposing the total area of all discs of radius $\leq \epsilon$ exceeds $2\pi \epsilon$, look at the annulus of width $\epsilon$ and outer radius $1$ inside the large disc, supposed to be of radius $1$. If $\epsilon$ is very small, such an annulus looks locally like a strip delimited by two parallel lines at distance $\epsilon$. I have thus to prove that given a collection of radii $\leq 1/2$, I can cover more than half of the area of a very long strip delimited by two parallel lines at distance $1$. If all discs have equal radius, then I can cover asymptotically a proportion of at least $\pi/4\sim .7854$ of the strip (the least favorable case corresponds to a collection of discs all of maximal radius $1/2$). The general case should be better but is harder to analyze. I claim however that this analysis can be made. Indeed, up to subdividing the strip into smaller substrips, we can assume that all radii are $>1/4$ and we have then a fairly small number of combinatorial situations to consider. We can thus compute the worst case. 

This looks like a close relative of the Hamming graph: Vertices of the Hamming graph in question are $2-$element subsets of $\{1,\dots,7\}$. Edges join vertices corresponding to subsets intersecting in an element. Your graph is the Hamming graph with "overlaid edges" (two vertices are adjacent if they are on a straight segment). 

The following very coarse invariant is perhaps useful: The argument of the sum $\sum_{s,t}a_{s,t}e^{i(s-t)\pi/n}$ (where $n$ is the size of the matrix and where the sum is over all entries) should be related to a typical jump. It is close to $0$ if the matrix is "concentrated" near the diagonal and close to $\pi$ if the matrix is "concentrated" near the antidiagonal. The modulus of the above sum indicates somehow how much the matrix is concentrated. 

The determinant of a positive definite matrix $G$ is proportional to $(1/\hbox{Volume}(\mathcal B(G)))^2$ where $\mathcal B(G)$ denotes the unit ball with respect to the metric defined by $G$. If $A$ and $B$ are positive definite then the volume of $\mathcal B(A+B)$ is smaller than the volume of $\mathcal B(A)$ or $\mathcal B(B)$. 

Not a new solution but an elaboration from a computational viewpoint. From a practical point of view one can solve your problem as follows: Firstly, we do not care about the diagonal values being $1$. Secondly, we enlarge the problem to real symmetric matrices with no strictly negative eigenvalues. Such a matrix $A$ of size $p\times p$ is then given by $A=\sum_i \lambda_i v_i^tv_i$ where $v_1,\dots,v_p$ is an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors with eigenvalues $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq\dots$ of $A$. Suppose there is a fast way for computing an eigenvector $v_1$ (of norm $1$) associated to the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of $A$. (One can for instance consider the projective limit of $A^k v$ for $v\in\mathbb R^p$ a generic vector.) The largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ is then given by $$\lambda_1=\sum_{i,j}A_{i,j}{P(1)}_{i,j}=\sum_{i,j}A_{i,j}{(v_1)}_i{(v_1)}_j$$ where $P(1)=v_1^t v_1$ is the orthogonal rank one projector associated to $v_1$. Replacing $A$ by $A-\lambda_1P_1$ and iterating one gets $P_2,P_3,\dots$ and $\lambda_2,\lambda_3,\dots$. Your solution is then given by $\sum_{i=1}^p\lambda_iP(i)=\sum_{i=1}^p\lambda_iv_i^tv_i$. 

Given $2n$ integral points of $\mathbb Z^2$, is there a polynomial algorithm which gives a matching consisting of $n$ non-intersecting straight vertical or horizontal segments between pairs of points if such a matching exists? (Not all segments have to be vertical or horizontal, there can be $a$ vertical and $n-a$ horizontal segments, but two distinct segments do never intersect.) Examples: (1) If the number of points is even in every row (or column) one can simply pair points row by row. (2) No such matching exists for the four points $\pm (1,0),\pm (0,1)$. There is also an obvious generalization to $\mathbb Z^d$ for $d\geq 3$. PS: There is always a solution using piecewise linear paths with vertical or horizontal steps making at most one quarter of a turn (ie. either straight horizontal or vertical segments or L-shaped (and its rotations) paths). 

I guess that you want something like "invariants of order-types". An order type is a configuration of a finite number number of points which is generic (no triplets of aligned points) and up to isotopy. An easy invariant of the order type is the number of vertices in its convex hull. This invariant is complete for four points since there are only two possible configurations. Let me mention another invariant which is much less know and also very easy to compute: Given an order type $\mathcal C$, there is a unique equivalence relation of $\mathcal C$ having at most two classes such that the following holds: If $\mathcal C$ is in convex position and consists of an odd number of points, the equivalence relation is trivial. If $\mathcal C$ is in convex position and contains an even number of points, then two consecutive vertices of the convex hull are non-equivalent. If two configurations $\mathcal C_1,\mathcal C_2$ are related by a move which goes through a unique (unavoidable) alignement involving three points $\lbrace P,Q,R\rbrace$, then the equivalence relation $\mathcal C_1$ and $\mathcal C_2$ is the same for $\mathcal C_i\setminus \lbrace P,Q,R\rbrace$. The three points $P,Q,R$ change classes (with respect to a fixed class represented by a point in $\mathcal C_i\setminus \lbrace P,Q,R\rbrace$). This determines the equivalence relation completely since any two generic configurations containing involving $n$ points can be related by isotopies and moves involving $3-$point alignements. Concretely, this relation can be computed as follows: Given two points $P,Q\in \mathcal C$ of a generic configuration $\mathcal C$ with $n$ points let $s(P,Q)$ denote the number of lines defined by two points of $\mathcal C\setminus\lbrace P,Q\rbrace$ which separate $P$ and $Q$. Then $P\sim Q$ if and only if $s(P,Q)\equiv n+1\pmod 2$. (This relation has in fact a group-theoretic interpretation which gives generalizations to arbitrary dimensions. There is even a "fermionic" version which I did not publish.) Application: This gives a rational rule for planting plum- and cherry-trees in an orchard (up to transposition of plum and cherry), if the positions of the trees are generic. For four points, you get points with alternating classes in the case of convex position. In the case of a triangle with an interior point, the three vertices of the triangle form one class, the remaining interior point forms the other class.
