There is only a set of isomorphism classes of étale geometric morphisms between any two Grothendieck toposes. In fact, the same is true for essential geometric morphisms. Recall that Grothendieck toposes are locally presentable categories, and that the left adjoint of a $\kappa$-accessible functor between $\kappa$-accessible categories must send $\kappa$-compact objects in the domain to $\kappa$-compact objects in the codomain. Since there is only a set of isomorphism classes of $\kappa$-compact objects in a $\kappa$-accessible category, we deduce that there is only a set of isomorphism classes of $\kappa$-accessible right adjoints between $\kappa$-accessible categories. But if $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ are locally $\kappa$-presentable toposes and $f : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{E}$ is an essential geometric morphism, then the inverse image functor $f^* : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{F}$ is a $\kappa$-accessible right adjoint. Thus there is only a set of isomorphism classes of essential geometric morphisms $\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{E}$. I imagine the same argument works verbatim for $(\infty, 1)$-toposes, but I do not know the details well enough to be sure. 

A $B$ with the above two properties gives a positive answer to your question by the following reasoning. We can prove by induction that for any $n$, $B^{(n)} \equiv_T 0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n}$. This is trivial when $n = 0$. Now for the inductive case, assume $B^{(n)} \equiv_T 0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n}$. Then we see that $B^{(n+1)} \equiv_T (0^{(n)} \oplus C_n)' \equiv_T 0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_n$ since $C_n$ is $(n+1)$-generic and hence $1$-generic relative to $0^{(n)}$. Finally, $0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_n \equiv_T 0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_{n+1}$ because either $n \notin A$ and so $C_n = C_{n+1}$ or $n \in A$ so $C_{n+1} \equiv_T B_n \oplus C_n$, but then $B_n \leq_T 0^{(n+1)}$. Hence, $B^{(n)}$ cannot compute $A$ for any $n \in \omega$, since $C_{n}$ is $(n+1)$-generic, and so $0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n} \ngeq_T 0^{(n+1)}$. (Indeed, it's easy to see that $B$ is $GL_n$ for every $n \in \N$). Thus, $A$ is not arithmetically definable relative to $B$. 

Yes, one can use functorial factorisation (of weak equivalences with a fixed codomain) to show that two categories of spans are homotopy equivalent is correct. Actually, the only subtle point I am aware of is in proving that your $\underline{\mathrm{Hom}} (X, Y)$ is equivalent to the space of hammocks from $X$ to $Y$ – for that one wants to use the homotopy calculus of right fractions introduced by Dwyer and Kan, so one has to show that the category of zigzags $$X \leftarrow \bullet \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow \bullet \leftarrow Y$$ (with leftward-pointing arrows being weak equivalences) is weakly homotopy equivalent to the category of zigzags $$X \leftarrow \bullet \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow Y$$ and the only way I know how to do this requires functorial factorisation of weak equivalences with a fixed domain! So if one has functorial path objects there is no problem at all. 

An undirected graph with $n$ nodes could be referred to as an adjacency matrix $A$. $A=[a_{ij}]_{n×n}$ with $a_{ij}=a_{ji}=1$ standing for there being an edge between node $i$ and node $j$, and no edges when it is $0$. Shortest distance matrix: A shortest distance matrix of an undirected graph with $n$ nodes is $B=[b_{ij}]_{n×n}$ where $b_{ij}=b_{ji}$ stands for the shortest distance between node $i$ and node $j$. There are already many algorithms to obtain the shortest distance in a graph, such as Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm or Floyd–Warshall algorithm. My Question How to restructure $A$ from $B$, where $B$ is given by $$B=\begin{bmatrix} T&\star\\ \star&\star \end{bmatrix}.$$ Here, $T$ is a $m\times m$ submatrix of $B$ which is a given, and can be regarded as the shortest distances between any two of the first $m(m<n)$ nodes in the graph. The $\star$ is a wildcard standing for matrixes with nonnegative integers. How to find a $A$ such that from $A$ we can get $B$. There are many $A$’s satisfy with the conditions above. For simplicity(Maybe), we can can some constraint condition on $A$. we can assume that the number of $1$ in $A$ is minimal. It is also welcome not to minimize the number of $1$ in $A$. The only thing I want is the method of find $A$ s.t. $B=\begin{bmatrix} T&\star\\ \star&\star \end{bmatrix}$.Thanks in advance! 

If $\mathcal{C}$ has finite products, then the class of projective cofibrations is also closed under finite products. Indeed, since the cartesian product in the category of simplicial presheaves preserves colimits in each variable, it suffices to check the claim on the generating projective cofibrations, i.e. that for every pair $(A, B)$ of objects in $\mathcal{C}$ and every pair $(n, m)$ of natural numbers, the inclusion $$(\partial \Delta^n \odot h_A) \times (\partial \Delta^m \odot h_B) \hookrightarrow (\Delta^n \odot h_A) \times (\Delta^m \odot h_B)$$ is a projective cofibration. But this is isomorphic to the inclusion $$(\partial \Delta^n \times \partial \Delta^m) \odot h_{A \times B} \hookrightarrow (\Delta^n \times \Delta^m) \odot h_{A \times B}$$ and $\partial \Delta^n \times \partial \Delta^m \to \Delta^n \times \Delta^m$ is a cofibration of simplicial sets, so the claim follows from the fact that $(-) \odot h_{A \times B}$ sends cofibrations of simplicial sets to projective cofibrations of simplicial presheaves. A similar argument works for projective trivial cofibrations. 

Graph combinatorics is very different under AD to what we are used to under AC. For example, under AD there is an acyclic graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with no 2-coloring (indeed, no coloring with countably many colors). Hall's marriage theorem is also false, even in a very trivial case: there is a 2-regular bipartite graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with no perfect matching. These theorems both follow from the assertion that every set of reals has the Baire property, and the arguments can be found in Kechris-Solecki-Todorcevic's 1999 paper: Borel Chromatic Numbers. I also have a recent paper on descriptive combinatorics that directly uses the axiom of determinacy, and not just measure or category arguments. For example, I show that under AD, for every n, there is an acyclic n-regular graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with chromatic number n+1, and an acyclic bipartite n-regular graph with no perfect matching. The games I use are based on partitions of free products of countable groups into two pieces. 

It is well known that the underlying simplicial set of a simplicial group is a Kan complex. However, the underlying simplicial set of the canonical simplicial resolution (call it $F_\bullet G$) you describe has an extra degeneracy, so it is really just a disjoint union of contractible Kan complexes. In particular, the homotopy groups of $F_\bullet G$ are all trivial, and we recover the original group as $\pi_0$. But we haven't really used the fact that we have a simplicial group. To get back group homology, we apply the abelianisation functor to $F_\bullet G$. The homology of the associated chain complex is then $H_{* + 1} (G, \mathbb{Z})$ (this seems to be folklore), and the 0th homology is the abelianisation of $G$. I suppose this should be expected, since the abelianisation of $G$ is $G \otimes \mathbb{Z}$, where $\otimes$ here is defined to be universal with respect to bihomomorphisms. 

I asked the following question on Math Stack Exchange, but no people reply. I know MO is more professional and it is for mathematicians to discuss research problems. Maybe this question is unsuitable for here. I truly appreciated if someone who could give me an explanation. Let $A\in\operatorname{M}_n(F)$. How to prove the following identity. $$\bigcap_{X\in C(A)}C(X)=F[A]=\frac{F[x]}{(m_A(x))}.$$ Here $m_A(x)$ the minimal polynomial of $A$ and $C(A)$ is the centralizer of $A$ and $C(X)$ is the centralizer of $X$. We can view $F^n$ as an $F[x]$-module via $A$, which is well known, denote this module by $F^n_A$, we have $$C(A)=\operatorname{End}_{F[x]}(F^n_A,F^n_A)$$ Since $$F^n_A\simeq\bigoplus_{i=1}^t\frac{F[x]}{(d_i(x))},\quad d_1\mid d_2\mid\cdots\mid d_t\quad\text{(invariant factors)}.$$ We have $$C(A)=\bigoplus_{i}\bigoplus_{j}\operatorname{Hom}_{F[x]} \left(\frac{F[x]}{(d_i(x))},\frac{F[x]}{(d_j(x))}\right) \simeq\bigoplus_{i=1}^{t}\left(\frac{F[x]}{(d_i(x))}\right)^{2(t-i)+1}.$$ For $X\in C(A)$, what is $C(X)$? Can we write the structure of $C(X)$ explicitly(using the above isomorphism)? I saw one proof of this result, but the proof is over algebraic closed field and they use Jordan canonical form. Could anyone explain this for me and give a purely algebraic proof. Use matrix method or the module structrue, but must be on the ground field $F$. Thanks in advance. By the way, are there any relations between this and the double centralizer theorem of central simple algebra? 

Thus, we can compute the (weak) homotopy type of $\Gamma (\hat{X})$ in terms of $X$ and hypercovers. Question. Is there a formula of the same kind that gives an actual "model" for $\Gamma (\hat{X})$? For instance, it would be nice if we had $$\mathop{\varinjlim_{\mathbf{Hc}^\mathrm{op}}} \underline{\mathrm{Hom}} (U, X) \simeq \Gamma (\hat{X})$$ but I do not see how to prove this. (Is it even true? It is easy enough to show that we get a bijection in $\pi_0$, and I think we also get an equivalence of fundamental groupoids.) 

By Lambek's theorem, any initial algebra for an endofunctor $F$ has the property that its structural morphism $\alpha : F A \to A$ is an isomorphism. So we seek an object $A$ such that $P P A = \Omega^{\Omega^A} \cong A$. However: Proposition. If a topos $\mathcal{E}$ contains an object $A$ such that $P A$ is a subquotient of $A$, then $\mathcal{E}$ is a degenerate topos (i.e. $0 \cong 1$). Proof. This is Proposition D4.1.8 in [Johnstone, Sketches of an elephant]. 　◻ So, suppose that $A \cong P P A$. Clearly, $A$ is a subobject of $P A$ via the singleton operator $\lbrace \cdot \rbrace_A : A \to P A$, so this isomorphism exhibits $P P A$ as a subquotient of $P A$, which by the proposition implies our topos is degenerate. That said, $\Omega$ is a bit special. The general form of Cantor's theorem for function-sets is known to fail in toposes; for example, in the effective topos, if $N$ is the natural numbers object, then $N^N$ is a subquotient of $N$. There are also cartesian closed categories (hence toposes via Yoneda) containing an object $A$ such that $A \cong A^A$ (and hence $A \cong A^{A^A}$). 

If $n \notin A$, then $B_n$ is arithmetically generic, and if $n \in A$, then $B_n$ is $(n+1)$-generic and computable from $0^{(n+1)}$. Hence $\{n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{$B_n$ is arithmetic}\}$ is equal to $A$. For each $k \in \N$, let $m_i$ be the $i$th element of the set $\{m \in \N : m \notin A \lor m \geq k\}$. Then $C_k = \bigoplus_{i \in \omega} B_{m_i}$ is $(k+1)$-generic. 

So lets turn now to the construction of a $B$ with the required properties (1) and (2) above. We construct $B$ in countably many steps where after step $n$ we will have completely defined $B_0, B_1, \ldots, B_n$ and finitely many other bits of $B$ (i.e. finitely many bits of finitely many $B_i$ where $i > n$). For step $0$, let $B_0$ be an arbitrary real satisfying condition (1). Given $k \leq n$, let $m_0, \ldots, m_j$ be the elements of $\{m \in \mathbb{N}: m \notin A \lor m \geq k\} \cap \{0, \ldots, n\}$, and define $C_{k,n} = B_{m_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{m_j}$. After each stage $n$, we will have ensured that $C_{n,k}$ is $(k+1)$-generic for every $k \leq n$. Now at step $n > 0$, for each pair $(i,k)$ where $i,k < n$, do the following. Let $S_{i,k}$ be the $i$th $\Sigma^0_{k+1}$ subset of $2^{< \omega}$. If we can find a finite extension of our approximation of $B$ so that the resulting approximation of $C_k$ extends an element of $S_{i,k}$, then extend our approximation of $B$ in this way. If this is not possible, then since $C_{k,n-1}$ is $(k+1)$-generic, there must be some finite subset of our current approximation to $B$ which cannot be extended to extend an element of $S_{i,k}$. Next, we finish step $n$ by defining $B_n$. If $n \notin A$ pick $B_n$ to be an element of $2^{\omega}$ extending the finite approximation of $B_n$ that we currently have, which is arithmetically generic relative to $B_0 \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{n-1}$. This clearly ensures that $C_{k,n}$ will be $(k+1)$-generic for each $k < n$, since $C_{k,n-1}$ is $(k+1)$-generic, and $B_n$ is $(k+1)$-generic relative to it. Similarly, $C_{n,n}$ is clearly $(n+1)$-generic. Otherwise, if $n \in A$, let $B_n$ be an arbitrary $(n+1)$-generic computable from $0^{(n+1)}$ and extending the finitely many bits of $B_n$ we have already determined. Now for any $k < n$, let $j_0, \ldots, j_t$ be the elements of $A$ that are $\geq k$ and $< n$. Then since $B_n$ is $1$-generic relative to $0^{(n)}$ which can compute $B_{j_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{j_t}$ we have that $B_{j_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{j_t} \oplus B_n$ is $(k+1)$-generic. Hence $C_{k,n}$ is $(k+1)$-generic, since the remaining elements in the finite join defining $C_{k,n}$ are mutually arithmetically generic (and are hence $(k+1)$-generic relative to $B_{j_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{j_t} \oplus B_n$). Similarly, $C_{n,n}$ is again clearly $n+1$-generic. To verify that our construction works, note that condition (1) is satisfied by how we pick $B_n$ in the last paragraph. Condition (2) is satisfied by the paragraph before that. 

In principle $\textrm{End}(X)$ could have two elements, $\textrm{id}_X$ and $0_X$. If it has only one element, then $\textrm{id}_X = 0_X$, so for all $f : X \to Y$, $f = f \circ \textrm{id}_X = f \circ 0_X = 0$. Similarly, for all $g : Z \to X$, $g = \textrm{id}_X \circ g = 0_X \circ g = 0$. Thus $X$ is both initial and terminal. This argument works in any category with a reasonable notion of zero morphism, not just preadditive categories. 

we get a coherent, or at least geometric theory, and the category of models in $\textbf{Set}$ is indeed the category of local rings and local ring homomorphisms, and the structure sheaf homomorphism $f^\ast \mathscr{O}_{Y} \to \mathscr{O}_{X}$ of morphism of locally ringed spaces $X \to Y$ is a homomorphism in the category of models for this theory?
