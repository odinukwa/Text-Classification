It depends on how you define "growth". Trade models have multiple goods in them, so there's no unique way to define "growth" - you are just moving along a fixed production possibility frontier. You can calculate nominal GDP, but then you have to come up with a measure of inflation so that you can deflate the nominal figure into something real. One of the results here is that if your economy which produces $ n $ goods has a production possibility frontier given by the zero set of a $ C^2 $ function $ Q : \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R $ (with the usual properties, i.e increasing in each coordinate and with positive definite Hessian at every point), then a simple application of the chain rule gives (here the $ dx $ notation denotes derivatives with respect to time, so we're assuming that the economy shifts continuously along the ppf instead of a unit step jump from one point to another - this assumption is important, otherwise we can't lose the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of $ Q $...) $$ 0 = dQ = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x_k} dx_k $$ if you're moving along the ppf, so that the value of $ Q $ is conserved. However, we also know from the first order conditions of producers in a competitive market that $$ \frac{\partial Q/\partial x_i}{\partial Q / \partial x_j} = \frac{p_i}{p_j} $$ where $ p_i, p_j $ are the nominal prices of good $ i $ and good $ j $ respectively. Substituting this into the above identity gives $$ 0 = \sum_{k=1}^n p_k dx_k $$ This is an important result: it says that if you calculate growth by looking at changes in production and hold the prices fixed, then you will detect no growth if the economy moves along a fixed production possibility frontier. Furthermore, this identity combined with the identity $$ NGDP = \sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k x_k $$ gives, using the product rule, that $$ d(\log(NGDP)) = \frac{1}{NGDP} \sum_{k=1}^n x_k d p_k = \textrm{GDP deflator} $$ In other words, if we deflate GDP by using the GDP deflator which is defined as the percent change in the price of a basket of goods weighted by the share of total production they represented in a given time period, we will measure zero RGDP growth so long as the economy remains along the same production possibility frontier $ Q(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = 0 $. The results hold true in autarky as well as in an environment of free trade, so in this sense free trade does not lead to "more growth", at least not due to the effects present in Heckscher-Ohlin. We can get away from this result if we choose to deflate nominal GDP by an alternative measure, but I think this should be enough illustration that you should be thinking about the welfare effects of trade and not about the "growth" effects. If you do come up with an appropriate notion of CPI inflation in a model, it will most likely be a "cost of living index" of the kind you find in Dixit-Stiglitz type models, so you will still indirectly be measuring welfare. The basic proof of the first welfare theorem carries over to the case of international free trade vs autarky, so under the usual assumptions (locally nonsatiated preferences and such) free trade outcomes are Pareto optimal, whereas autarky outcomes are in general not Pareto optimal. 

The concept of using energy as currency doesn't make theoretical sense. Energy alone isn't inherently valuable, it's the energy along with how that energy is expended that makes the energy valuable. The energy is only valuable as long as a mechanism exists to use that energy. Let me provide a scenario to make this more clear. If you could somehow harvest raw energy in joules into an energy container which could be easily expended, an energy container would be economically similar to a human. Humans are essentially containers of energy. They get this energy from metabolizing food. The energy in a human can be easily used because their bodies are designed to use energy towards moving their muscles, which makes the energy in a human valuable. Whereas the energy contained in a rock (E=MCsquared) is not valuable because it would be so difficult to use that energy. When we pay a human a wage to do a task, such as build a house, we're paying for them to expend their energy towards a specific purpose. In essence, a human is a walking container of energy, and we pay them to use this energy towards different tasks. Have you ever volunteered? By volunteering for two hours, you are basically giving a charity an energy container which contains two hours of your energy (if you expend 50 kCal an hour, then the energy box would contain 100 kCals of energy at a power of 50kCals an hour). Since we can see that human labor is inherently valuable, an energy container would be inherently valuable as well. Therefore, having an energy container would be similar to having a person work for you. But now the issue becomes, what can that human do? What kind of skills does that human have? Humans can expend their energy in different ways. A body builder can use their energy towards contracting their muscles to lift heavy weights, whereas a mathematician uses their energy towards using their brain to process complex problems. So the concept of an energy container is not possible without defining how the energy from that container is expended. So energy containers would differ in value based on: 

A reduction in trust in the USD (not just in US politicians) A good (better than the USD) alternative currency 

Think about what a loan is in terms of purchasing power. You give a bank your signature on a loan contract and they give you something that will allow you to buy real stuff (houses, cars, whatever). You enjoy this real stuff for some time. Then at the end you have to give the bank something that will allow them to buy real stuff, only more of it. I'm calling it "something" instead of "dollars" for a reason I will explain below. In the foreign exchange case, the US gives other countries pieces of paper, which are essentially IOUs. They give the US either real stuff, which is then enjoyed, or they give the US their currency, which is immediately spent on real stuff. The US doesn't hoard their currency. Time passes and at the end they give back the IOU's in exchange for some real stuff. Only instead of giving back more real stuff than was originally given, the US gives back less (because of inflation). I called dollars "something" in the loan example and "IOUs" in the macro example because dollars take on a different role in each case. In the loan, the dollars represent real purchases that are made immediately. In the macro example, the dollars take the place of the loan contract. They don't buy any real stuff until the end of the transaction. You can think of it another way by ignoring the dollars. Foreigners give the US electronics and clothes and stuff in exchange for nothing. After a while the US gives them back food and machines or whatever, only what the US gives back is worth less than the electronics and clothes it was given. That's a zero interest (or negative interest) loan. By the way, it's not just foreigners. Whoever holds currency has given up something valuable (time, materials, land, etc.) in exchange for paper. As long as that paper is under your mattress, you are not consuming and the paper is becoming worth less than it was. You've made a negative interest loan. 

If it was not feasible, then the residents of the city would bid up the price of the services provided by the low-paying jobs until the induced rise in wages (and the fall in rents) would make housing affordable enough for people who are supposed to provide the "make the world go round" services. It's important to note that this process can't create housing units out of nothing; so the restricted supply of housing still leads to inefficiency - if no new houses are constructed, people who are dissatisfied with the lack of affordable basic services have to move out of the city until enough housing is freed up for workers who are going to provide these services. This leads to inefficient allocation of labor, etc etc. "Labor market corrections" or rent regulation don't solve the underlying problem, which is a shortage of housing units in areas which offer higher productivity to workers. Public transit could help, but how exactly do we make it "high quality"? The best way to improve the quality of public transit is probably to build more roads to alleviate traffic problems during peak times, and these construction projects usually run into the same barriers that housing construction projects do. The solution I would recommend is to reform some of the environmental regulation, zoning laws and the government's internal review processes which make it so hard to build new housing units, high-speed trains, roads, etc. If the problem is a lack of housing and transportation infrastructure, the correct response should be to remove the supply-side barriers which are contributing to the shortage. 

First, we should remember that the government did not particularly spend any money on the air strike, except for incidental stuff like fuel costs. It already owned those missiles, which were part of a previous government spending program. Unlike profit-motive organizations that try to be streamlined, the government buys many things it never uses and doesn't necessarily replace things it does use. This is particularly true of the military. The US military has enough stockpile to use incredible force in Syria and still not need to change its future spending. But anyway, let's talk about your question. Military is, indeed, an example of stimulus-style spending: a government program that employs people and creates demand across the economy, but which does not generate much in the way of goods and services that we would normally count as wealth. Engaging in war does increase employment and temporarily increase demand. To be clear, this should not be confused with helping the economy in the long-term. The Keynsian argument suggests stimulus spending as a way to smooth out short-term trends, but which must be paid for later. It's not a way to improve the economy overall. The wealth of a country is measured by the goods and services it produces (or can buy). Military spending can jump start an economy full of pessimism or in a bad equilibrium, but it clearly shifts resources and people away from wealth-building and is a long-term economic drag. Think of military spending as similar to hiring people to break rocks or farm weeds, as was done in earlier periods of our history. It increases employment and but does not add to the nation's overall wealth. In fact, you can think of military spending as a transfer payment from the wealthy (who pay most of the taxes) to those who benefit from military spending (weapons manufacturers and associated industries). As you mention, I'm not saying military spending is good, bad, immoral, or moral. Just saying economically it's a short-term stimulus, long term drag. 

Habit forming models should work fine for this if you just switch the sign with which the habit enters the utility function of the consumer. The usual habit model looks something like $$ \Delta X_t = \phi (C_t - X_t) $$ with $ \phi > 0 $ where $ X_t $ is the consumer's habit at time $ t $ and $ C_t $ is consumption. Habit forming models usually take a standard utility function $ u $ and say that consumer's time $ t $ utility from consumption is given by $ u(C_t - X_t) $. For your purposes, assuming the utility from consumption at time $ t $ is given by $ u(C_t + X_t) $ will do. With multiple goods instead of one, you may specify a moving habit for each good and put each habit in the same way into the multivariate utility function. Habit models may also assume that habit formation is "external", i.e the consumer makes decisions without taking into account that consumption decisions affect the habit process. For your purposes, you want the exact opposite: the consumer should notice the effect consumption decisions have on habit formation and act accordingly. The point of this modification is that for large values of $ X_t $ it reduces the marginal utility of consumption, so (for instance) if the consumer has to work and suffer some marginal disutility to acquire income and there are no savings, they will work less in times of high $ X_t $ compared to times of low $ X_t $. If there are savings, then the consumer will still consume less in times of high $ X_t $, because the marginal utility gain from doing so is small. 

Yes, if there were more competition then net neutrality would not be such a big issue. Any throttling would cause an ISP to lose customers to competitors. Competition is a main assumption behind why markets work. However, in this case an ISP has market power which breaks the assumption. The market power allows them to easily put smaller ISPs out of business. Here is a link to a rather long article on how ISPs get this market power. Essentially, the reason is that starting an ISP is entering an economy of scale, which requires a large amount of capital to start: $URL$ 

So energy containers to be most similar to robots. A robot's battery has a certain amount of energy, the battery has a certain output, and the energy can be expended as defined by the robot (was the robot designed to lift heavy weights, or to process complex simulations?). So a world where we use energy as currency, in a practical scenario, would be a world where people use robots as currency. And a robot would not make good currency because it is not fundamentally valuable, since a robot is made of many parts such as metals and other raw materials. So even from a science fiction, theoretical viewpoint, this concept does not make sense. 

You could say IS-LM is too simplistic. The fundamental discrete time consumption-based asset pricing equation says that if $ r_t $ is the risk-free interest rate at time $ t $, we have $$ \beta (1+r_t) \frac{u'(C_{t+1})}{u'(C_t)} = 1 $$ (I'm dropping the expectation since I will be working with a perfect foresight model later on) where $ u $ is the utility function of any consumer, $ 0 < \beta < 1 $ is a discount factor which measures "impatience" of the same consumer, and $ c_t, c_{t+1} $ is the consumption of the same consumer in time $ t $ and $ t+1 $ respectively. The most elegant form of the relation is with the assumption of power utility $ u(c) = c^{1 - \gamma}/(1 - \gamma) $ with $ \gamma > 0 $, in which case we get (after log-linearization) $$ r_t = R + \gamma \Delta c_t $$ where $ \Delta c_t $ is log consumption growth and $ R = -\log(\beta) $ is the real interest rate consistent with flat consumption. The intuition is simple: people want to smooth consumption over time. If they expect their consumption in the future to be much higher than their consumption today, they will try to borrow against the better future and push real interest rates up, and vice versa. Consider a baseline economy with no investment, perfect foresight, and a representative consumer first. (This is unrealistic, but IS-LM is even more unrealistic, so...) In this case, the resource constraint of the economy reads $ Y_t = C_t + G_t $ in every period, where $ G_t $ is government spending. If you assume consumers have utility that is additively separable over time (the asset pricing relation assumes this as well), then the no investment assumption turns their decision problem into a set of one-period decision problems. (This is a technical condition to ensure what I am doing is well-defined.) Define $ D_t $ as the level of output consistent at time $ t $ with $ G_t = 0 $, and let $ m_t $ be the "fiscal multiplier", defined by $$ m_t = \frac{dY_t}{dG_t} $$ Most models won't give constant $ m $, but if necessary we may linearize the model around somewhere other than $ G_t = 0 $ and make this assumption locally. These assumptions imply $ Y_t = D_t + m_t G_t $ at any time $ t $, so we may express consumption as $ C_t = D_t + (m_t -1) G_t $. Plugging into the relation gives $$ r_t \approx R + \gamma \Delta d_t + \gamma (m_t -1) \Delta \left( \frac{g_t}{1 - m_t g_t} \right) $$ where $ g_t = G_t/Y_t $ is the ratio of government spending to GDP and $ \Delta d_t = \Delta \log(D_t) $. (Ignore the pole of the denominator - we're working around $ g_t = 0 $.) The fraction $ \frac{g_t}{1 - m_t g_t} $ is increasing in $ g_t $ with $ m \geq 0 $, so we see that the real interest rate at time $ t $ depends on two things: the "natural" growth rate of the economy given by $ \Delta d_t $, and the consumption growth induced by changes in government spending rel to GDP $ g_t $. However, the sign of the effect of an anticipated increase in government spending depends on the value of the fiscal multiplier $ m $. If $ m < 1 $, then government spending crowds out consumption, and rising government spending is associated with low real interest rates, i.e expectations of high spending in the future would push rates down today, and vice versa if $ m > 1 $. Most everyone would agree that the fiscal multiplier in the US economy today is less than $ 1 $, so news of higher spending in the future should be associated with lower real interest rates now, if with anything at all. It also matters, of course, if government spending affects $ \Delta d_t $ - if we're speaking of an infrastructure investment program, for instance, then we should expect that the change in government spending also leads to a change in the path of $ D_t $. The two effects for such a program act in opposite directions, so the net effect of a government investment program tomorrow on real interest rates today could go either way, even in this simple economy. I won't work out the model with investment (allowing consumers to invest) here, but the effect of investment is to allow consumers to trade consumption now for consumption in the future in aggregate; so it dampens the impact of a change in government spending on real interest rates (since now consumers have a tool for smoothing consumption in the face of government expenditure shocks). It's also true that the announcement in the State of the Union address probably carried less information than an announcement in this model, since market participants were already aware of such an infrastructure investment plan for months (maybe a year?), but with a fiscal multiplier less than $ 1 $ it's not easy to say anything about the direction of the real interest rate response. 

Summary: The fear of future inflation causes treasury yields to rise today. Wider deficits also lead to higher yields because the supply of treasuries increases. This will lower the price of treasuries, which is the same as increasing yields. Now, why is the market buying dollars? The market is anticipating US consumers and government going into debt and driving up interest rates. In order to take advantage of these higher interest rates, one must have to have dollars to lend. But no, foreigners are not buying dollars because they are anticipating inflation...they are buying because they anticipate higher (real) interest rates. The inflation will come as a side effect of the anticipated spending spree and foreigners are expecting the inflation to be smaller than the rise in nominal interest rates. 

Falling oil prices may or may not lead to a lower price level depending on how you're measuring the price level and what measure of inflation the monetary authority is trying to target. Is the relevant inflation figure the GDP deflator? The PCE deflator? The CPI? The "core" CPI? Ignoring any nominal effects of falling oil prices if they exist at all, the mantra here is "never reason from a price change". Why is the price of oil falling? Is it because we've invented a new technology which allows us to synthesize oil at low cost, or is it because there was a recession in China which is leading to lower global demand? In the latter case, clearly the experience of the US and of China would be different. There's also the fact that higher productivity of the kind that would be caused by a new technology allowing easier production of oil may not necessarily translate into higher employment. In general, there are competing income and substitution effects in these situations - as you become wealthier you want to work less, but as wages are higher you want to work more. It's not clear a priori which effect would dominate. Finally, "unemployment" as used in "natural rate of unemployment" is meant to be a proxy for output gaps - if unemployment is higher than the "natural rate", then there's a negative output gap, and vice versa. In down-to-earth terms, we define "unemployment" as the state of not working but actively looking for a job, and the unemployment rate is the ratio of the number of such people to the size of the labor force. A change in the employment rate (the employment-to-population or employment-to-working age persons ratio) need not have any effect on the unemployment rate. Unemployment in a time of negligible output gaps is mostly the result of search frictions in the labor market. If a technological development made it easier to match potential employees with employers we would expect the "natural rate of unemployment" to fall, but it's not clear if or how an oil price change would lead to such an outcome.
