Not an answer, but perhaps something useful from an apprentice in CFT: Considerations very closely related to your question led Andre Weil to discover the "Weil group"; see his paper on Class Field theory (1955). Let $G$ be the Galois group of $L/K$ and $H$ the Galois group of $E/L$. The multiplicative group $L^*$is naturally a $G$-module and so one can consider the cohomology group $H^2(G, {L^*})$. Now $E^*$is not a $G$-module in any natural way. But it does give rise to a $G$-module which should be useful in answering your question. Namely, the subgroup $NE^*$ of norms from $E$ to $L$ is a $G$-module. So one can consider the quotient $G$-module $M = {L^*}/{NE^*}$ and the cohomology group $H^2(G, M)$. If $E/K$ is Galois, then its Galois group $\Gamma$ would be sit in an exact sequence $$0 \to H \to \Gamma \to G \to 0.$$ The conjugation action of $\Gamma$ on its normal subgroup $H$ (identified with its image in $\Gamma$) factorises via the quotient ${\Gamma}/{H} = G$. So this gives $H$ a $G$-module structure. The group $\Gamma$ gives rise to an element $\gamma$ of $H^2(G, H)$ (via a standard construction). Local class field theory provides us with 

It would appear that the answer to the question as stated is no. However, Voevodsky's motivic homotopy theory does provide an adequate framework for both Weil cohomologies and generalized cohomology theories; there is a version of "Brown representability" theorem (representing object for a generalized cohomology theory) which is exploited in the applications to K-theory (Milnor conjecture and Bloch-Kato conjecture). 

See Serre's paper where he shows how the the image in $GL_2(Z_p)$ (and hence mod $p^n$ for any $n>0$) is determined by the image of Galois in $GL_2(Z/{pZ})$; there are more recent works by Zywina among others.treating the case of abelian varieties. Serre's paper does the case of non-CM elliptic curve (the CM case can be found in Serre-Tate's Good reduction paper). 

no: the Witt ring of $\bar{F_p}$ is a complete DVR and so its field of fractions will be a complete local field; but the algebraic closure of $Q_p$ is not complete. However, take the maximal unramified extension of $Q_p$; this is a non-complete field. Its completion $F$ is the fraction field of the Witt ring of $\bar{F_p}$ and the Witt ring itself is the ring of integers in $F$. (Serre's Local Fields contains all of this and much more!!) 

Motivation: Let $Q_{\infty,p}$ be the field obtained by adjoining to $Q$ all $p$-power roots of unity for a prime $p$. The union of these fields for all primes is the maximal cyclotomic extension $Q^{cycl}$ of $Q$. By Kronecker-Weber, $Q^{cycl}$ is also the maximal abelian extension $Q^{ab}$ of $Q$. A well known conjecture due to Mazur (with known examples) asserts, for an elliptic curve $E$ with certain conditions, that $E(Q_{\infty,p})$ is finitely generated. This is the group of rational points of $E$ over $Q_{\infty,p}$ (not a number field!). A theorem due to Ribet asserts the finiteness of the torsion subgroup $E(Q^{ab})$ for certain elliptic curves. Questions: (a) Can one expect to find elliptic curves (or abelian varieties) $A$ with $A(Q^{ab})$ finitely generated? (c) Can one expect to find curves $C$ of genus $g >1$ with $C(Q^{ab})$ finite? Thanks! 

Not an answer, but related somewhat is an important topological property of the weight filtration. Namely if $f: X \to S$ is morphism of complex algebraic varieties such that $R^if_*Q$ are local systems (e.g. all fibers are homeomorphic) on $S$, then the weight filtration assembles to give sub-local systems. So the weight filtration is locally constant, in families. An arithmetic version (over Spec $Z$) is also available. See Deligne's ICM 1974 address, especially Theorems 2 and 14. 

See the recent work of Meng Fa Lim (with Sharifi) (1) Poitou-Tate duality over extensions of global fields (2) Nekovar duality over p-adic Lie extensions of global fields 

It is well known that the Mumford-Tate group of a polarizable pure $Q$-Hodge structure is reductive. (this is proved for instance in Deligne et al LNM 900, Voisin's books on Algebraic Geometry,..) Question: Is there an example of a non-polarizable $Q$-Hodge structure whose Mumford-Tate group is reductive? Thanks! 

here are some basic sources: Bernstein's papers (and course notes) are all available at his homepage, Benstein's paper roche's notes 

Consider a variety $X$ over a field $k$ and let $\ell$ be a prime different from the characteristic of $k$. One has the derived category $D(X, Q_{\ell})$ of $\ell$-adic sheaves. There are very important abelian subcategories (of perverse sheaves) corresponding to $t$-structures given by various perversity conditions. Question: What is the precise crystalline analogue of $D(X, Q_{\ell})$ and the subcategories of perverse sheaves? Here I am thinking of crystalline as being some sort of "$p$-adic sheaves" where $p$ is the characteristic of $k$. Perhaps one needs to assume $k$ is perfect.. Thank you in advance for your help. 

Beilinson's original paper on Height pairings does indicate how his height pairing generalises that of Neron-Tate: see page 10 (also, Muller-Stach and Kunneman's works expand on Remark 4.0.8 on page 14). Also, Scholl's paper provides a very nice interpretation (via Ext in mixed motives). 

Perhaps what you are looking for is the universal vectorial (aka additive) extension of an abelian variety; this has been discussed by Rosenlicht, Mazur-Messing and been applied to height pairings by Coleman and others. This universal object is an algebraic group whose Lie algebra is the first de Rham cohomology of the abelian variety. see here 

see the very nice book of Guillemin-Sternberg (Supersymmetry and ...); it also has a reprint of Cartan's paper. 

Hello, For a $p$-adic local field K, the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture characterises the $p$-adic representations of the Galois group of $K$ which arise from geometry. Is there a conjectural generalization to higher local fields? or to the $p$-adic representations of the etale fundamental group of a variety defined over $K$? Thanks 

Yes, it is the basic premise on which Tannakian theory rests! see corollary 2.9 (page 20 of the texed version) of Deligne-Milne's article Tannakian categories 

The work of Dennis Sullivan (see his ICM 1970 address for a summary) is a veritable source of such unexpected Galois actions. 

Consider an elliptic curve $X$ over a number field $F$. The Tate conjecture for $X$ is trivially true (By this is meant the statement that Galois invariant subspace of $\ell$-adic cohomology is spanned by algebraic cycles on $X$). But proving the finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group is still open in general; the situation is better for $F = Q$. Even the validity of Tate conjecture for all powers of $X$ does not suffice to prove the finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group; there are examples of CM elliptic curves for which the Tate conjecture is known for all powers (work of Milne, Zarhin, Kumar Murty) but the finiteness is as yet unknown. For function fields, there are results known to the effect that the Tate conjecture implies the finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group (but the $p$-part - here $p$ is the characteristic of the function field - is notorious to handle, I am informed); see papers of Zarhin, Schneider, Milne, Ulmer, Trihan-Kato, Geisser. 

Some of the relevant results can be found in the book "Algebraic Groups and their birational invariants" by V. E. Voskresenskii (Translations of Math Monographs 179, American Math Society 1998). Specifically, Chapter 4, Section 9 is all about tori over a finite field, number of rational points, and zeta function; this proves the (local) results you mention for a general torus. Section 13 (same chapter) shows how the global zeta function of a general torus is expressible in terms of Artin L-functions. The case of norm-one tori is actually a simple but important case. Here is a link: $URL$ 

it seems that the lectures were not recorded (there are only photos on the conference website); so there is no point in searching for the videos. However, there are a few video excerpts available from Professor Stein's channel..small consolation. (1) bsd1 (2) bsd2 (3) bsd3 

Edited following comments of Wanax: This is just an amplification of Wanax's comments: All you need to do is to pick a prime $p$ of $Q$ which splits into (more than two) distinct primes $\mathfrak p_1$ and $\mathfrak p_2$ in $K$ and which is unramified in $K$. There are infinite number of such primes if $K$ is distinct from $Q$. Pick an element $\alpha$ of $K$ which is divisible by $\mathfrak p_1$ but not $\mathfrak p_2$. Then the quadratic extension $L= K(\sqrt{\alpha})$ is an abelian extension of $K$ and this $L$ gives the extension you want. Because if $L$ were obtained by adjoining a root of unity to $K$, both primes $\mathfrak p_1$ and $\mathfrak p_2$ would have to be ramified in $L$ but our choice ensures that only $\mathfrak p_1$ is ramified in $L$. 

Maybe you already know this! But Miles Reid and Ron Donagi have shown that the intermediate Jacobian of the intersection of two quadrics is the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve. See Donagi's old paper where there is a beautiful generalization of the group law on an elliptic curve. Recent results on such questions all use Nori's general results or Bloch-Srinivas's paper on the diagonall see for example Nagel's paper or Voisin's paper. 

The latter yields a map $L^* \to M \cong H$ of $G$-modules which provides a map $$t: H^2(G, L^*) \to H^2(G, H).$$ If $E/K$ were Galois, then the Galois group $\Gamma$ would have a constraint, namely, $$\gamma = t(u_{L/K}).$$ This discussion presupposes that $E.K$ is Galois and gives a constraint; it does not answer your question on how to check if $E/K$ is Galois!! The fundamental class is what gives rise to the local Weil group. By the way, every finite Galois extension of $Q_p$ (or a $p$-adic local field) is solvable. All of this can be found in Cassels-Frohlich or Serre's Local Fields or Milne's notes on Class Field Theory. Let us wait for a master in LCFT for an answer!! 

Beilinson's results (two papers, one mentioned by Keerthi and the other here) have been generalised by Bhargav Bhatt; his paper also introduces a global period ring $A_{ddR}$ for global Galois representations!! The ring $A_{ddR}$ is a filtered $\hat{Z}$-algebra equipped with a Gal$(\bar{Q}/{Q})$-action. A (one of the many) beautiful result in this paper is the following theorem: Let $X$ be a semistable variety over $Q$. Then the log de Rham cohomology of a semistable model for $X$ is isomorphic to the $\hat{Z}$-etale cohomology of $X_{\bar{Q}}$, once both sides are base changed to a localization of $A_{ddR}$ (whle preserving all natural structures on either side). 

Question: why are there no non-trivial extensions of $\mathbb{G}_m$ by abelian varieties? Specifically, let $A$ be an abelian variety over a field $k$. Then it seems to be well known that any extension $$ 0 \to A \to G \to \mathbb{G}_m \to 0$$ in the category of group varieties over $k$ is split. For instance, this is mentioned in Deligne's Theorie de Hodge I page 426 just before Section 3. Chevalley's structure theorem of algebraic groups certainly implies this. Question: Is there a simple/direct proof? Note that there are non-trivial extensions of abelian varieties by tori (semiabelian varieties). Thanks. 

Though there are several automorphic papers discussing the Tannakian outlook (notably Ramakrishnan's article in Motives (Seattle 1991, AMS) and Arthur's A note on the Langlands group, (referred to above) there is as yet no formulation of Langlands correspondence between Galois representations and automorphic representations as an equivalence of Tannakian categories. There are (at least) two outstanding fundamental questions on the Tannakian aspects of the Langlands correspondence. 1) What is the definition of the category of automorphic representations for any number field? here one means automorphic representations for GL, any $n \ge 0$. 2) How to endow the category in 1) with a tensor structure so as to render it Tannakian? here the postulated Tannakian group is the "Langlands Group" which is much larger than the motivic Galois group (not all automorphic representations correspond to Galois representations..only algebraic ones do - see work of Clozel and more recent work of Buzzard-Gee). An interesting point: Arthur's paper postulates the Langlands group as an extension of the usual Galois group by a (pro-) locally compact group whereas the motivic Galois group is an extension of the usual Galois group by a pro-algebraic group. An illustration of the difference is provided by the case of abelian motives; the Langlands group is the abelianisation of the Weil group whereas the motivic group is the Taniyama group (see references below). But the Tannakian outlook, despite its present inaccessibility, has already made a profound impact. See Langlands paper "Ein Marchen etc" (where the Tannakian aspect was first written out with many consequences for the Taniyama group (Milne's notes)) as well as Serre's book Abelian l-adic representations for many references. Nothing seems to be known regarding the second question. However, see (page 6 of) these comments of Langlands: "Although there is little point in premature speculation about the form that the final theory connecting automorphic forms and motives will take, some anticipation of the possibilities has turned out to be useful. Motivic $L$-functions, in terms of which Hasse-Weil zeta functions are expressed, are introduced in a Tannakian context. .... An adequate Tannakian formulation of functoriality and of the relation between automorphic representations and motives ([Cl1, Ram]) will presumably include the Tate conjecture ( [Ta] ) as an assertion of surjectivity. The Tate conjecture itself is intimately related to the Hodge conjecture whose formulation is algebro-geometrical and topological rather than arthmetical. ..." The references here are to Clozel and Ramakrishnan's papers and then Tate's paper for the Tate conjecture. This is just a rough answer from a novice..for a precise and detailed answer, let us wait for the experts! 

Electronic Research Announcements of the AMS is perhaps one such journal. But why not publish in Comptes Rendus? It is well known the world over and has many gems (with complete proofs). For example, Gabber's proof of a deep finiteness result in etale cohomology is in O. Gabber , Sur la torsion dans la cohomologie l-adique d'une variété. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 297 (1983), pp. 179–182. 

The geometry certainly puts restrictions on the weights. For proper varieties, the allowed weights on $H^m(X)$ are between $0$ and $m$. So on $H^1$, the weights are $0$ and $1$; but if $X$ is normal, $H^1$ is pure of weight one (reflected in the fact that the Picard variety is an abelian variety). This is an example of the type of restrictions you seek, if I am not mistaken. A general result may be in the literature (this is very probable). The suggestion of Shenghao of using devissage and using induction on the dimension of $X$ seems right on target. The weight filtration in characteristic zero and over a finite field are related and even compatible; the argument is by spreading out to Spec $Z[1/N]$ for some positive integer $N$ and this works even for singular varieties. See Deligne's ICM 1974 address (the examples in section 3, and sections 7, 13 and 14 are the relevant ones). 

The finiteness is known; see Szamuely's Seminaire Bourbaki expose and Remarque 3.4 (5) on page 11 is a precise reference. 

Is there a discrete group G which is the fundamental group of a compact Kahler manifold but which is not the fundamental group of any smooth projective complex algebraic variety? It is known that there are cohomology rings of compact Kahler manifolds not realisable by smooth projective complex algebraic varieties (some of the recent results are due to Voisin). 

This is a basic question about Grothendieck's conjectural category $M_k$ of pure motives (over a field $k$). This construction first produces a category (the "false category of motives") which need not be Tannakian; the category undergoes a modification of the commutativity constraints which produces a category (the "true" category) which could be Tannakian (this is spelled out on page 451 Jannsen's great paper). The modification requires that the Kunneth components of the diagonal be algebraic (part of the standard motivic conjectures). Question: Is there an alternate (geometric) construction (modulo standard conjectures) which produces the "true" category bypassing this artificial commutativity modification? Does this happen in Voevodsky's setup? Thanks! 

The analytic case is simpler: Every holomorphic vector bundle on $C^n$ is trivial. A short proof (3-4 pages) can be found in P. Griffiths, Topics in Algebraic and Transcendental Geometry, Princeton 1980 (Mathematical Notes 13). 

The main case can be found in Milne's article specifically Theorems 1.13, 1.14 on page 310. The idea, briefly, is as follows: Given a sheaf $F$ on a variety $X$ over a finite field $k$, then over an algebraic closure $\bar{k}$ of $k$, the group $H^i_{et}(\bar{X}, F)$ becomes a $Gal(\bar{k}/k)$-module. There is a spectral sequence involving the $H^j(Gal(\bar{k}/k), H^i_{et}(\bar{X}, F))$ which converges to $H^n_{et}(X,F)$. This is true over any perfect field. When you have duality over $\bar{k}$ (e.g. $X$ smooth proper and $F$ nice), combine it with duality in Galois cohomology (in our case, the group is very simple: $\hat{Z}$) to get duality over $k$. The duality theorems now reflect the $k$: if Poincare duality for $X$ of dimension $d$ over $\bar{k}$ pairs $H^i$ with $H^{2d-i}$, over $k$ the pairing will be between $H^i$ and $H^{2d +m -i}$ where $m$ is the cohomological dimension (assumed finite) of the Galois group ($m=1$ in the case of a finite field). Hope this helps.
