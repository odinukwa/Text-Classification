VY Canis Majoris and UY Scuti are variable star designations. The first discovered variable star in a constellation is called R, the second, S, and then unto Z. After Z comes RR and so on. For a full description see this wikipedia page. NML Cygni is also a variable star, but its variable star designation is V1489 Cygni. The letters NML come from its discoverers: Neugebauer, Martz, and Leighton. 

You can calculate the angular diameter of the Earth using the equation: $$a = \arctan \frac{D}{d}$$ where $a$ is the angular diameter, $D$ is the physical diameter of the Earth, and $d$ is the distance from the Moon to the Earth. The equatorial radius of the Earth is $r_E = 6378.1 \textrm{km}$, the diameter is therefore $D= 2 \times r_E = 12756.2$. 

No, this is not possible. Kuiper belt objects are in orbit around the Sun and their average distance (semi-major axis) will be beyond the orbit of Neptune. This means that their orbital period will be much longer than Earth's (following Kepler's third law). In the most extreme case (further away) the motion of the object will be virtually non observable and the object will appear not to move with respect to the background stars apart from the apparent motion due to parallax. These objects will still show apparent retrograde and prograde motion because of the movement of the Earth around the Sun. This prograde and retrograde motion can also be observed in nearby stars where it is used to measure the parallax and thereby the distance to the star. See the figure below for the apparent motion of a star as measured by Hipparcos. 

The edge of the Universe in space-time can only be the moment of its creation (or end if the Universe is closed). What it would be like at that time depends on what you would consider close to the edge. Your question is about the edge of the expansion so I will presume that you mean during the Inflationary era (until about $10^{-32}\textrm{s}$ after the creation of the Universe). There would be no objects as matter as we know it today did not exist (according to the big bang model). The major interacting forces (gravity, strong and weak nuclear force, and the electromagnetic force) were unified at the time of the Inflationary era. There would be no protons or neutrons as the strong interaction has not decoupled yet from the other forces. The temperature would be extremely high $>10^{27}\textrm{K}$. 

I'm not aware of any APIs that provide $\Delta T$, but you may be able to parse $URL$ for the value $\Delta T$. Of course if you want to calculate the approximate position of the Sun, a few second more or less should not matter too much ;-) 

If you'd somehow be able to freeze a star and stop nucleosynthesis (fusion) then it would not be a star anymore. By definition, a star needs a temperature high enough to support fusion. This is why brown dwarfs are not true stars. There are of course stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars) that have actually crystallised (and are therefore in a solid state). See for instance PSR J2222-0137. One might say they have 'frozen'. How you might actually do that artificially, I have no idea... 

where is the sidereal time $\theta$. The sidereal time is not a time but actually an angle that gives the right ascension of objects that are at that moment crossing the local meridian (i.e. the line between South and the Celestial north pole, for observers on the northern hemisphere). It is in a sense the longitude of your position on Earth if the geographical coordinate system were to rotate along with the celestial sphere. EDIT: To calculate the Sidereal time, you can use the method explained in Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus: $$T = \frac{JD-2451545.0}{3625}$$ $$\theta_0 = 100.46061837 + 36000.770053608 T + 0.000387933 T^2 - \frac{T^3}{38710000}$$ The sidereal time is expressed in degrees. Then express the UTC time as an angle: $$t = 15h+0.25m+\frac{0.25}{60}s$$ where $h$ is the number of hours, $m$, the number of minutes, and $s$ the number of seconds. The sidereal time at Greenwich at the specified time is then: $$\theta_G = \theta + 1.00273790935*t $$ and the local sidereal time is: $$\theta = \theta_G - L$$ Where $L$ is the geographical longitude (positive west from Greenwich). 

These types (MS/RGB/HB/AGB) are classes in a very useful and common classification scheme. In the end it just depends on what you want to do with your classification scheme. NB. The classification of the Sun changes from G2 to M because the outer envelope and atmosphere expand enormously, causing the atmosphere to cool down. A cooler atmosphere means that the Sun changes from a yellow (6000K) to a red (4000K) star. The wavelength, and therefore colour, at which most energy is transmitted depends on the temperature of the star's atmosphere. 

There is actually disagreement on this matter (within the IAU?). Dr. Alan Stern (lead of the New Horizons mission) for instance points out that "this rule is inconsistent" (e.g. see Pluto vote 'hijacked' in revolt). Not only has Neptune not cleared its path, but the same holds for Earth, Mars and even Jupiter. Jupiter has a set of asteroids (the Trojans) which follow the same orbit (in the Lagrangian point L4 and L5). Maybe the definition should be adjusted to include only those bodies as planets in the solar systems that have cleared all objects from their path except those objects that are in resonant orbits with the planet. Resonant objects are those objects whose Periods are related to the Planet's period by a ration of "small integer numbers". Pluto has a resonance with Neptune of 2:3. This means that for every two orbits completed by Pluto, Neptune will complete three orbits with the result that Neptune and Pluto never come close enough for Neptune to clear Pluto from its orbit. In the case of the Trojan asteroids, the resonance is 1:1. the Trojans are alway either 60° in front of or behind of Jupiter and therefore never come close to Jupiter. 

Kepler orbits cannot explain planetary migration as they assume constant orbital parameters such as semi-major and -minor axes and constant eccentricity. To explain planetary migration you would need at least Newtonian mechanics and numerical models, i.e. you would need the concept of gravity and the means to calculate the effects of gravity. 

The number density of stars (e.g. the number of stars per cubic parsec) is given by $$N(z) = N(0) e^{-|z|/h}$$ where $z$ is the height above the Galactic plane, $h$ is the scale height for a specific component of the Galaxy, and $N(z)$ is the number density at different heights above the plane. The scale heights for the thin disk and thick disks are: 

Assuming negative longitude in WGS84 is west of Greenwich than you would get LONGITUDE = RA*15 and LATITUDE = DEC. The celestial longitude RA=0 through the vernal equinox would then be projected on the meridian of Greenwich. If you subtract 180 from the LONGITUDE then you would just rotate the celestial sphere by 180°. The meridian of Greenwich would then equate to RA=12h. If you want the stars to move with the rotation of the Earth, then you would use LONGITUDE = RA*15 - THETA*15, where THETA is the sidereal time at Greenwich in decimal hours. You should be aware that for the celestial sphere you look from the centre towards the inside of the surface of the sphere, while for geographical purposes you look from the outside (above) towards the spheroid (down). So if you project the stars on a globe like this, you will notice that the constellations will look inverted from what you're used to in star maps. If you find one of those old celestial globes, you will also see the inverted constellations. For instance on this image, you'll see Leo to the left of Virgo and Hercules, while on most star maps, Leo will be to the right. If you want the constellations to look 'right' then you would need to use LONGITUDE = -RA*15 (mind the minus sign). But then you would also need to invert the rotation of the Earth as well. 

As @barrycarter mentioned you can use the Horizons web interface from JPL: $URL$ You can change the setting in the web form by clicking on the [change] links for the different settings (for instance the time span or the planet). There are several different settings that can be changed to get different outputs (table columns) and such. If you really want the orbital elements (and not just the Right Ascension and Declination) you will have to select ELEMENTS in the Ephemeris type settings. You then get a table with the following elements: 

I think, you are mixing two different concepts. Equatorial coordinates are coordinates in the equatorial coordinate system (as opposed to the ecliptical, galactic, super galactic, or horizontal coordinate systems). The coordinates also refer to a specific origin. This origin might be heliocentric (centre of the Sun), baryocentric (centre of mass of the Solar System), geocentric (centre of the Earth), or topocentric (a specific location on the Earth's ellipsoid). So you may have heliocentric equatorial coordinates, geocentric equatorial coordinates, or topocentric equatorial coordinates. From your question I infer that you have geocentric coordinates of the Moon and you want to convert them to topocentric (not geocentric!) coordinates for an observer at a specific location (latitude and longitude) on the Earth. The best way to go about this would be to: 

The classification of stars using spectral class is a very useful classification when considering the properties of (the atmosphere of) a star at that moment. If you consider the different stages in human development (embryo, fetus, infant, toddler, etc...), for instance, here one person also continuously changes its class. So it is not strange/uncommon/forbidden to change a classification of a thing whether it is a human or a star. It also does not mean that other classifications are not useful. It depends on how you want to use the classification. In literature, concepts such as low-mass star, or Sun-like star are also used. Classification according to the evolutionary stage (i.e. the type of fusion going on) of a star is also very common. See the image below from ATNF in which you can see how stars of different zero-age main-sequence mass move along a colour-magnitude diagram. If we follow the track of a star of one solar mass then we get the following subsequent evolutionary stages: 

The European Southern Observatory has catalogues with image data available from $URL$ you will have to register before you are able to access them. I'd suggest you look at other observatory's websites for their data. You will have to look past the pages targeted at the general public and find links for data or science, or user portal or something like that. They are sometimes difficult to find. Ideally you would have a standard annotated data set of images for classification so that you will be able to compare your results with others. Unfortunately I'm not aware of any standard sets. For literature on using pattern recognition on astronomical images, $URL$ is a good resource. They've created an ML system that is able not only to distinguish stars from other object classes but also able to identify which stars are visible in an image! Very interesting research. NB For classifying stars in clusters, the problem is likely not classification, but more segmentation. 

The density variation is certainly different between different types of stars. High mass stars only occur near star forming regions (i.e. in spiral arms). Their lifespan is so short that they do not have the time to get very far from the region in which they were formed. I'd expect that the density variation for gas and dust will be higher (but I have no knowledge to support this). 

Most of the stars in the Hipparcos catalogue do not have a common name. In the main catalogue file you will also find the Henry Draper (HD) number of the star (if it has one) at columns 391-396. You can use this ID to find the name in the Bright Star Catalogue. The Bright Star Catalogue contains all stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 (naked eye stars) together with the HD number (columns 26-31) and a Name (columns 5-14), which in fact is the Bayer (greek letter - constellation) or Flamsteed (number - constellation) name. Using both catalogues you can get the Bayer or Flamsteed name from the HIP identifier. I do not know of any catalogue to get the common name. The distance of the star can of course be found in the Hipparcos catalogue, which is the reason the Hipparcos catalogue exists. Columns 80-86 give the trigonometric parallax $\varpi$ in milliarcseconds. You can get the distance from: $$d=\frac{1}{\varpi}$$ where the distance $d$ is in parsec and the parallax $\varpi$ is in arc seconds. For the Hipparcos catalogue you should divide the parallax by 1000 as the parallax is given in milliarcseconds. You can get the constellation for any position in the sky from the algorithm and data in $URL$
