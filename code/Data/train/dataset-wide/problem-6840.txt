Keep in mind that the Coase Theorem assumes there are low transaction costs to borrowing. Someone who has a very low credit score because of high variance in their ability to pay may not have access to typically better interest rates, so there may be a high cost to negotiating/earning a better rate, especially if you are pressed for cash. Most people who borrow money are poor, and usually in poor communities, the poor form kinship ties with other poor people. In these circles, there is high pressure to share any additional money you may get, which may discourage getting extra income unless the individual in the group is very hard pressed. So having to share wealth could arguably be a transaction cost of borrowing any loan. If a bank knows there are high search/transaction costs for these types of consumers for finding and getting a loan, they could conceivably charge above a perfect market equilibrium I think. 

Welcome to Economics SE. We ask that when asking about homework questions that you show your work so we can see what you need help with. The site is not meant to be a free homework solving machine. Remember that a firm's profit is revenue minus costs, where costs can be fixed (200) or variable (manipulation of the marginal costs). $$\Pi(q) = pq - c_f - c(q)$$ where $p$ is price, $c_f$ is fixed costs, and $c(q)$ is the cost with respect to $q$. We don't necessarily need to expression the variable costs as a function in this case. So using the information we have, we know that for producing one unit of the good, our profits are: $$\Pi(1) = 300 \cdot 1 - 200 - 270 = -170$$ For two goods, we have $$\Pi(2) = 300 \cdot 2 - 200 - (270+210) = -80$$ And so on... So you do this calculation for all the quantities and you see which one maximizes profits. That will also allow you to answer part b. As for part c, you have to see if there is a way for profits to be above 0 for some quantity produced. 

Although you are new here, it is much appreciated if you looked at our guidelines for asking questions, particularly ones that look like homework questions. Generally, we ask that people show some reasonable semblance of effort into trying the question, and to talk about which part of the question they are struggling with. We're not homework doing machines. As such, I can only give a rough guideline for how to approach the question. Any cursory Google search will show you that the marginal rate of substitution is marginal utilities of each good $(x, y)$ divided by each other. $$\text{MRS}_{xy, i} = \frac{\frac{\partial U_i}{\partial x_i}}{\frac{\partial U_i}{\partial y_i}}$$ Where $i$ is person 1 or 2. To find the indifference curves, simply solve for $y$ in terms of $x$ and $U$, where $U$ is treated as a constant level of utility. Now try the question for yourself. 

Plugging in the data (number of laborers, capital stock on farms, etc.) could prove difficult or impossible without existing data of course. This is obviously a very rough sketch for an empirical framework for analyzing labor supply, but it is a foundation for analyzing all sorts of shocks to the labor supply. For a more detailed analysis, you can refer to Cahuc, Carcillo, and Zylberberg and their first few chapters on labor supply and labor demand. Sometimes in the economic literature, undertaking a more detailed study like this requires a lot of funding and time, with in mind particularly the hassle of data. People want practical policy answers in the short run, particularly in the private sector. With limited resources, sometimes studies like the ones you've looked at provide "second-best results" and that is the analysis we have to work with. The productive, honest thing to do with studies that take on partisan issues is to think about how to feasibly improve them and ask specifically about how to look at the research being done on the topic. There are plenty of voices accusing all manner of partisan research/analysis as misleading, and still plenty polemics out there who would waste their time writing polemics. It is not for this site. 

As you have pointed out: where it comes from is very important. As to the Japanese situation it is quiet different from the US position from example. In fact most of the Japanese debt is owned by Japanese people (90% of the current debt). More specifically the BoJ plays a big role as a buyer, and puts pressure on Japanese yield, which makes it cheaper for the government to issue bonds ! Another interesting point that is usually left by anlysts: Japan is the biggest creditor in the world. The country holds a net amount of about 3 trillion USD (367 trillion yen) of financial assets through the world, which makes Japan the first creditor worldwide (before China !). An interesting further reading which gives other information on the Japanese debt under stress tests of the IMF (P.40): $URL$ You also might want to read this paper of Rogoff and Reinhart called "Growth in a time of debt": $URL$ . It was really criticized but is a good first glimpse... Afterwards you might want to go a little bit deeper into the debt sustainability analysis of the IMF... Edit 

Because let's say that a firm makes even 1$ profit ... Then another firm can come in a sell the product for only 0.99cts profit ! And so one until the equilibrium is the marginal cost of a product ! 

Operating expenses: include rent, equipment, inventory costs, marketing, payroll, insurance and funds allocated toward research and development For EBITDA, I guess you can find it on your own ! 

Very interesting question, I'll try to summarize some aspects and I probably won't be exhaustive ! Venezuela has long been a country relying on oil (95% of their exports). Certain experts have estimated that Venezuela holds just shy of 25% of worldwide oil reserves, but the oil extracted in Venezuela is very heavy and hard to refine and then sell to other countries, which makes it more expensive than oil coming for example from Saudi Arabia. When prices boomed, the former President Hugo Chávez, who died in 2013, used oil exports to quadruple the foreign debt. He also led a some nationalisations. The main factor for Venezuela's current crisis is therefore the counter-shock on oil prices which lowered exports. This quote comes from an FT article 

You have to differenciate the debt that is already existing from the one that is going to be issued: whenever the US Treasury issue a bond lets say a 10% coupon 10yrs... for a 100USD. It's still going to pay 10USD to the holders during the 10yrs. When you see the yield going up or down it's usually on the secondary market. I say usually because sometimes the government issues bond with a floating rate which can be impacted by a rate increase. As for the new debt that is going to be issued you are right to say that this going to be more costly ! 

I agree with @BBKing, just to put it here as an answer: if we go back to your two definitions you can find quiet easily some counter examples. Let's take a firm, which uses a machine as capital. Let's assume also that this machine can only be used by one man at a time. Do you think this machine is a non-excludable / non-rival good ? 

I was wondering if anyone had an idea about the first author to have mathematically computed an isoquant or at least the first occurrence of a drawn isoquant ? My best guess would be F. Edgeworth in Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences (1881) but I really doubt it ! 

One of the direct consequences of that is that the country is relying on its dollar reserves to pay its imported goods. The country's foreign reserves are already withering at 12-year lows. Venezuela has even paid Switzerland with gold! But the problem is that on the land the demand was still the same and the supply could not follow, which led to a massive inflation. Inflation will surge to 720 percent in 2016 from 275 percent last year, according to a note published by the IMF. The huge outstanding debt is also worrying investors.Creditors are now demanding a high premium for their trust in that promise. The yield on Venezeula’s dollar bond that matures in 2020 is 37% (an investment mainly made by hedge fund). This is the more financial aspect of the question: it's hard or costly for Venezuela to get financial help from investors right now. For this aspects, I encourage you to take a look at this article by The Economist: 

I don't think there's really a name for the type of ordering on preferences, and preferences are between vectors, which aren't necessarily ordered. It looks like because you have a finite number of alternatives though, you can easily have utility function representation, where $U$ represents $\succcurlyeq$ on the set of alternatives $X$ if $\ \forall x,y \in X, x \succcurlyeq y \implies U(x) \geq U(y)$ Even though $U$ would be discontinuous in this case, you could probably call the domain of $U$ totally ordered (since $U \in \mathbb{R}$), and that should be sufficient in characterizing the preferences as well. We can't necessarily describe it as monotone, since we don't know the size of $\{A, B, C\}$, or what each element in the vectors are. 

As was said above, buying debt to affect the exchange rate and make Chinese exports more attractive may be one reason to buy these Treasuries. Surely all of these are not reinvested into buying more debt and some of it is put into other civic projects. The other reason to buy debt is to have a string of payments over time that may become more valuable later on. Since the US is a large nation and powerful nation, China probably feels it is very unlikely that the USA will default, and if they did, that would give China a legitimate complaint against the US, that might help them in foreign relations. It may even be that they want the US to be stable so as not to crash the global economy and so that they can still sell lots of products to the US, so they buy up the debt to keep the USA stable. The more important part of that whole paragraph though is to have a string of payments. For the same reason that governments like to hold debt even when they have the ability to pay it off, China might find that investing into debt will provide a better rate of return than infrastructure at the moment, and later on, once infrastructure has a better rate of return (capital steady state changes) then they can take a stream of income from interest payments from the US and taxes and then invest into that. Finally, I couldn't help but notice that you see China as needing to lift itself out of poverty. That may be true, but why would investments into infrastructure be the solution to helping the rural poor--places that don't need as much infrstructure? Most of the poor in China are in rural areas, so there's something to think about. 

In "Uncommon Sense", by Gary Becker and Richard Posner, Posner, going off of Becker's comment, suggests that while a fat tax would be regressive, poverty and obesity are correlated more because of a lack of salience about the causation between soft drinks and obesity. To remedy this, he actually suggests a complete ban on the sale of soft drinks with sugar to children. They have no nutritional value and sugar is very related to obesity. In his own words: 

In economics, a firm wants to maximize profit. Your ice cream shop has some costs that vary depending on how many half-gallon ice cream packages are made, and some benefits, the revenue from selling ice cream. The additional cost of making one more package of ice cream is called the marginal cost, and it can change based on how much ice cream you are already making. The marginal benefit of course the price that you sell each package for. In order to maximize profit, you have to choose some quantity of ice cream packages to produce. You do this by setting marginal cost equal to marginal benefit, and then solving for production. So if you have a formula for what the price of ice cream will be over time, then you can predict your marginal benefit of production over time, and can anticipate what your production will look like in the future. 

These sorts of things are issued through SIVs, structured investment vehicles. So for examples of firms that used them, Citigroup had some SIVs like Centauri. Europe had a few of these too, like Barclays's (UK) own Sheffield Receivables.
