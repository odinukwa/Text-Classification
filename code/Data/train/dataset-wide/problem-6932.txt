The demand for liquidity is usually defined as $$ L(Y,i) $$ where $Y$ is income and $i$ is the nominal interest rate. In equilibrium this equals the aggregate money supply $M$ which is function of several things, like $M_0$ the reserve rate, etc. Let us assume that everything except $i$, $M_0$ and $M = f(M_0)$ is constant. Then $$ L(Y,i) = M = f(M_0). $$ Demand for liquidity decreases in $i$ and $M$ increases in $M_0$. Thus for any given value of $i$ there is at most one equilibrium value of $M_0$, hence the central bank cannot simoultaneously set both $i$ and $M_0$ and always expect an equilibrium outcome. Lacking equilibrium either $i$ or $M$ will shift. 

You need strict concavity of $v(\cdot)$, not concavity. According to the definition of quasiconcavity, the function $x^2$ is not quasiconcave, it is quasiconvex. 

I believe he assumes that there is no arbitrage and also that there are no pricing bubbles. So two assets that have the same price today would have the same net present value. Let $P_t$ denote the price of an asset in year $t$, $d_t$ the dividend (or rental income or cashflow) you get from said asset in year $t$ and let $r$ denote the interest rate (which I assume to be constant for simplicity's sake). Then the price of the asset today is $$ P_1 = \frac{d_1}{1+r} + \frac{P_2}{1+r}. $$ Using iteration $$ P_1 = \sum_{t=1}^{n - 1} \frac{d_t}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{P_n}{(1+r)^{n-1}}. $$ If you compare two assets with $$ P_1^A = P_1^B $$ where $$ \forall t: \ d_t^A > 0, \ d_t^B = 0, $$ then or all $t>1$ you will get: $$ P_t^B > P_t^A. $$ This is somewhat paradoxical, as a there is no clear reason why $P_t^B$ should be positive if it never pays dividends. You could assume that it has not yet payed any dividends but will start doing so soon. However I think Landsburg's main argument is that $d_t>0$ holds for the house as well, not just the stock. 

The text basically explains that consumer is assumed to be rational. This means the consumer can identify the best bundle and picks that as her choice. If the consumer was unable to identify the bundle that is best for her or was simply choosing randomly rather than based on her preference then her choice would not reveal anything about her preferences. 

If the prices $p_1$ and $p_2$ are positive than as you pointed out the equations \begin{eqnarray*} \frac{30p_1}{p_1+p_2} + \frac{20p_2}{p_1+4p_2} & = & 30 \\ \\ \frac{30p_1}{p_1+p_2} + \frac{4 \cdot 20p_2}{p_1+4p_2} & = & 20. \end{eqnarray*} hold. This is troublesome, because subtracting the first equation from the second yields \begin{eqnarray*} \frac{3 \cdot 20p_2}{p_1+4p_2} & = & -10 \end{eqnarray*} which has no solution for positive prices. However if a good has zero price, than the demand equations are different as no one minds buying superflous goods as long as they are free. For $p_2 = 0$ you would have \begin{eqnarray*} \frac{30p_1}{p_1+p_2} + \frac{20p_2}{p_1+4p_2} & = & 30 \\ \\ \frac{30p_1}{p_1+p_2} + \frac{4 \cdot 20p_2}{p_1+4p_2} & \leq & 20. \end{eqnarray*} This is because $\frac{30p_1}{p_1+p_2} + \frac{4 \cdot 20p_2}{p_1+4p_2}$ is a minimum that the buyers need but they do not mind having more as good 2 is free. There is also a formulation of equilibrium, the 'value-equilibrium' which is that for good $i$ \begin{eqnarray*} p_i \cdot D_i(p) = p_i \cdot S_i(p) \mbox{ and } D_i(p) \leq S_i(p) \end{eqnarray*} meaning that there can be oversupply of zero price goods. (Think about air. Would you buy air from someone?) 

If you think this question is not too broad I have an example for you. On more than one occasion I went to the store to buy milk. I would not have bought milk if it cost more than \$3. The store (its pricing strategist) knew this, because the milk cost less than \$3! This happens like once a week, so he is pretty good at making predictions. Since you might argue that the above is a monopoly example: If the milk cost more than \$3 I would have gone to a different store. There are numerous other examples: Stores usually estimate how many supplies they will need and they frequently get it right. The FED is frequently wrong, but it is sometimes right, e.g. see 2015 unemployment rate vs. the projection. 

It is my understanding that the word remittance is usually used to describe transfers by foreign workers to their home countries. From Wikipedia: 

Excellent question. You can understand this by reading the original study referred in the article. I will try to provide a short explanation here. Basically the study argues that if you take into account all sorts of taxes like taxes on properties, consumption, dividends, etc. the European countries tax their rich residents relatively less than the poor residents, while the US does the opposite. This is possible because there are other significant taxes besides the income tax. As the study states: 

Your analysis seems to be spot on, except for some minor typos: $$ x_A^* = 100 \frac{p_x + p_y}{p_x + p_y} = 100, $$ because the value of A's endowment is $100 \cdot (p_x + p_y)$. And you could include the case of $$ x_B^* \in [0,50] \mbox{ if } p_x = p_y. $$ As you state at the end the equilibrium price vector is not unique, there is equilibrium for all $\frac{p_x}{p_y} < 1$, because with this price vector we have $$ (x_A^*,y_A^*) = (100,100), \hskip 20pt (x_B^*,y_B^*) = (50,0) $$ and the market is then indeed in equilibrium as $$ x_A^* + x_B^* = x_A + x_B, \hskip 20pt y_A^* + y_B^* = y_A + y_B. $$ The price ratio $\frac{p_x}{p_y} = 1$ also results in equilibrium, because one of the optimal consumptions of B is still $(x_B^*,y_B^*) = (50,0)$. 

I believe this is the basic case discussed in the Laffont-Martimort textbook "The Theory of Incentives". The choice of the agent is either 0 or 1. You can find a complete description in "The Moral Hazard" chapter, section 4.2. The results are listed later, and while I am not sure, I do not think there should be qualitative differences. 

CV and EV are not supposed to have opposing signs. You can see this from their definitions where $$ CV = e(p_1,u_1) - e(p_1,u_0), \hskip 20pt EV = e(p_0,u_1) - e(p_0,u_0). $$ Either $u_1 > u_0$ and then a larger income is needed to reach $u_1$ given any price or the opposite is true. 

Are there any microeconomics or general equilibrium articles on universal basic income? Papers dealing with general wealth transfer mechanisms where a basic universal income would be a subset of the general transfer mechanism discussed are also fine. 

Your statement does not seem to be true for normal goods either. A counterexample: $$ U(x_1,x_2) = (x_1x_2)^{\frac{2}{3}} $$ By the Cobb-Douglas property the optimum bundle given $w,p$ is $$ (x_1,x_2) = \left(\frac{w}{2p_1}, \frac{w}{2p_2}\right), $$ so both goods are normal. The indirect utility is $$ U(w,p) = \left(\frac{1}{4p_1p_2}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}w^{\frac{4}{3}}. $$ Here $w$ is raised to a power higher than 1 so $U(w,p)$ is convex in $w$. 

Because the banks are not loaning their own money but that of depositors. One may also argue that the depositors should know the risks and if their bank makes bad investments it is partly their fault so they cannot complain should they lose their deposits. But a functioning banking system is essential to the current economic system. The bankruptcy of a big bank would cause panic and banks runs, which because of fractional reserve banking would probably result in the insolvency of other banks, banks that perhaps made good investments but ones that cannot immediately be liquidated. After the closing of the banks considerably less savings would be deposited in financial institutions. This will hinder consumption because credit/debit card traffic would cease and getting investment funds would also be considerably more difficult. So the governments have considered the damage the bankruptcy of a bank would cause to their economy and decided it is better to bail them out. ("Too big to fail.") Of course since banks have a very large revenue stream they can also afford lobbying for intervention as well, but this does not mean that the intervention is not beneficial to the public. Furthermore, if you lose your deposits you may very well (wrongly) blame the government, so a bail-out is also politically prudent. If you are interested in what could be done I recommend reading about the Glass-Steagall act. If you are not satisfied with my answer there are any number of conspiracy theories that offer unconvincing alternative explanations.
