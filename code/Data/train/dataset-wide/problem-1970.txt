The premise that the Stefan-Boltzmann equation is used for greenhouse gases is wrong. The Stefan-Boltzmann equation is used for irradiance output, not energy input. The ground warms the atmosphere, and the atmosphere releases energy into space. I suggest looking at the one-dimensional energy balance model. See $URL$ 

The influence of friction decreases Areas of higher wind speed are transported in (yes, the wind blows the wind- that is why it is such a difficult problem) The difference in pressure over a distance increases. Air is trapped to moving along a curve, and the curvature increases (like a spinning ballerina) 

Erupting volcanoes release ash. When ash particles collide, it can build a static charge. When that charge is released, there is lightning. 

If there is a quantity that varies in the atmosphere, there is inherently a gradient. Since you know there is a pressure and temperature gradient, there must also be a density gradient. There is also wind speed gradients, buoyancy gradients, wind shear gradients, isentropic gradients, vorticity gradients etc. let $\chi$ be a scalar quantity with the diagnostic equation: $$\frac{\partial \chi}{\partial t}+\vec{v}\cdot \nabla \chi=F(x,y,z,t)$$, where $\vec{v}$ is the wind vector, and $F$ is the forcing term (source-sink) Therefore $$\nabla \frac{\partial \chi}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial \nabla\chi}{\partial t} $$ and $$\frac{\partial \nabla\chi}{\partial t}+\nabla \vec{v}\cdot\nabla\chi+\vec{v}\cdot\nabla(\nabla\chi)=\nabla F(x,y,z,t)$$ Therefore changes in the gradient of a quantity is dependent on the changes of the advection of the quantity and the changes in the forcing of the quantity. For example, an advancing cold front (effectively a moving thermal gradient) can be strengthened if the cold side is cooled/warm side is warmed, or the spacing decreases. 

The stability correction factor is related to the effects of atmospheric stability (function of buoyancy and shear) on wave growth, and has been implemented in Wavewatch3 in the Tolman and Chalikov 1996 input source term. The code where the correction happens can be found in : 

I've been a WRF user for almost 5 years now, and contributed code to a recent public release. I am not aware that WPS (WRF Preprocessing System) has such a tool that takes in the grid and point coordinates and returns the appropriate index. However, it is very straightforward to do so yourself. Some suggest using an external library, I think that may be an overkill for such a simple task. Here is what you need to do: 1) Run to generate the parent grid. Since you don't know the exact location of the nest yet, set in . This will generate a file called . 2) Look at the file to find the right indices for your child domain. and refer to the x and y indices on the parent grid at which the southwest corner of the child grid will be positioned. and are the longitude and latitude grids of the mass (pressure) points. Using a programming language of choice, find the grid cell that is closest to your desired location for the child nest corner. This is typically done by looking for the minimum value of distance between desired location and all the points on the grid. For example, in Fortran, you can do something like: 

The atmosphere, as a whole, is approximately in hydrostatic equilibrium. This means that the gravity of the earth holds the atmosphere to the earth, preventing its escape, though few molecules may escape every so often. Mathematically, this can be described by $$\frac{dP}{dr}=-\rho g$$ where P is the pressure, $\rho$ is the density, and $g$ is gravity. Using the Ideal Gas Law $$P=\rho R T$$, where $T$ is temperature and $R$ is the gas constant for air. Assuming that the temperature in the height of a column of the atmosphere is averaged ($\bar{T}$) an equation for the average height of the atmosphere can be found $$P(r,\phi,\lambda)=P_0(\phi,\lambda)exp(-\frac{(r-r_0)g}{R\bar{T}(\phi,\lambda)})=P_0(\phi,\lambda)exp(-\frac{gz}{R\bar{T}(\phi,\lambda)})$$ where $r_0$ is the radius of the earth,$P_0$ is the surface pressure, $r=z+r_0$, where $z$ is the height above the earth's surface, $\phi$ is the latitude, and $\lambda$ is the longitude. To Summarize: As the average temperature of the atmosphere increases, the height of the atmosphere will generally increase. This means that the height of the atmosphere will generally be the lowest near the poles, but highest near the equator. There are certainly exceptions to this rule, but this generally works. If you were to go around the equator, it will likely not be a "perfect circle" since the average temperature would have to be exactly the same. 

The answer to this question depends on what process one is interested in simulating well. As you know, short/mid-range weather prediction models and climate models have very different applications and goals. Because the short range weather prediction model is typically of much higher resolution than climate models (~1-10 km versus ~50-200 km), it is almost always more skilled at simulating clouds forming at a specific location and time. Cloud and rain prediction skill tends to be greater in synoptic scale fronts and near topographic features, and smaller for sporadic, small-scale, tropical thunderstorms. In very high-resolution NWP models (2-3 km or smaller), convection and clouds may be simulated reasonably well without using any cloud parameterization scheme. Nevertheless, clouds and rainfall are still hard to simulate or forecast very accurately. On the other hand, due to very low grid resolution, climate models can really aim only for correctly simulating the occurrence frequency and the amount of clouds and rain in a larger geographical region over a longer period of time. In climate, clouds play a significant role in radiative feedbacks. Climate models still rely on cloud parameterization schemes. 

Get reanalysis data of accumulated rainfall, or interpolate observations (NOMADS is a good resource) Read in the precipitation data, adjusting the values over multiple times, if needed. Isolate the data associated with the gridpoints over your area of interest *(such as California). Sum the accumulated rainfall over all of your chosen gridpoints, and multiply the accumulated rainfall by the product of the resolution of the data (in inches). That should get you your data in cubic inches. 

Beginning with the Primitive equations governing atmospheric motion for a dry gas, primarily the ideal gas law, and the conservation of mass and energy, neglecting diffusivity. $$P=\rho R T$$ $$\omega \equiv \frac{DP}{Dt}$$ Therefore $$\omega=R(\rho\frac{DT}{Dt}+T\frac{D\rho}{Dt})$$ Since $$\frac{D\rho}{Dt}=-\rho \nabla\cdot\vec{u}$$ and $$\frac{DT}{Dt}=\frac{\omega\rho}{c_p}+\frac{Q}{c_p}$$ $$\omega=R(\frac{\rho^2\omega}{c_p}+\frac{\rho Q}{c_p}-T\rho\nabla\cdot\vec{u})$$ Distributing $R$ and applying the ideal gas law $$\omega=\frac{R\rho^2\omega}{c_p}+\frac{PQ}{Tc_p}-P\nabla\cdot\vec{u}$$ Separating $\omega$ from the right hand side of the equation yields $$\omega=(1-\frac{R\rho^2}{c_p})^{-1}(\frac{PQ}{Tc_p}-P\nabla\cdot\vec{u})$$ I call this semi-diagnostic, for $\omega$ is still a part of $\nabla\cdot\vec{u}$ Is this a valid semi-diagnostic equation for $\omega$? 

Thus, is geographically located $\Delta x /2$ East of and $\Delta x /2$ south of . 2) For computational efficiency and accuracy, the data from the child (nested) domain is copied to the parent domain. This is opposite from the data going from parent to child, which is interpolated. For more specifics, see the WRF Registry documentation by Michalakes and Schaffer. As a consequence of the above two, it is more computationally efficient and accurate to use a nesting ratio of 3, rather than 2. In the example below, for 2:1 nesting ratio and 1-d case for simplicity, values are simply copied from child to parent array because these points are guaranteed to overlap between two grids. Notice that the points do not overlap and child values must be interpolated to the parent. This induces computational overhead and numerical damping of the $2\Delta x$ wavelength in mass: 

Well, one side of the earth would heat up, while the other side would not. This would cause a very large thermal gradient, causing extreme wind speeds. Also, you would not have the Coriolis effect, destroying quasi-geostrophic theory. 

My answer is no. The reclassification of clouds is not affected by climate change. It is more of our understanding of how they work, formation mechanisms, etc. Cloud classification can generally be broken down into altitude and shape (cirrus-type, cumulus-type, and stratus-type). The subtypes of those describe the behavior, and may be combinations of types (such as cirrostratus, pyrocumulus and cumulonimbus). There are other types, such as the new asperitas cloud (formed by gravity waves), the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability cloud (formed by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability), contrails (formed by jet exhaust), fog (formed by either advection or radiation), etc. That is not to say that clouds don't affect climate. For example, cirrus clouds, and other high clouds, are optically thick, preventing the low temperature from dropping. It has been debated what the net effect clouds have on the environment, newer research seems to indicate net warming (see latest IPCC report), despite the traditional thought being cooling. Being that water vapor is a greenhouse gas with generally greater concentrations than the famed CO$_2$, it is extremely important to consider in climate discussion. 

Because the Stokes drift is not uniform in the vertical but compensating Eulerian backflow is, the resulting transport is into the cave in the upper 2 m, and out of the cave below that depth. Assumptions made: 

This case is an excellent example of urban-induced convection. Urban areas have very different surface and soil properties, leading to a different heat balance relative to more natural environments. At times when solar shortwave radiation forcing is high - summer time, early afternoons - urban areas act as heat islands. Sensible heat flux and outgoing longwave radiation are then increased relative to the environment. While latent heat fluxes are decreased because of lack of soil moisture and vegetation in the cities, there is enough moisture coming from the environment to trigger convective cloud formation and rainfall downwind from the urban area. As to the question why did this occur in four urban areas at the seemingly similar time, it just happened so. See this review article on urban-induced convection and associated physical processes for more details. 

I would agree with your hypothesis, but I must point out that it will likely break down further and further as you approach the tropopause. Whether the ISA model is actually a average, I cannot say. However, the idea that the ISA model is a horizontal average is plausible. 

Now there are plenty of limitations, such as the nonlinear version of that equation. If I had my notes on hand, then I could address those problems more. I'll edit this when I can. Also, model physics cannot be computed in spectral space, so there has to be conversion from spectral to physical space and vice-versa. I'll check my notes and correct any errors I can find later. 

This indicates that there was wind shear. Wind can change direction and speed with height. Since air is a fluid, it's wind vectors can change with height. On a large scale, this is called the thermal wind balance. In the ocean, it is Ekman balance. On smaller scales, there isn't really a term that I know of that describes the balance, because it is rather turbulent. As far as "How could this happen": What you saw was the mean flow over the height of one cloud, followed by the mean flow over the depth of another cloud.
