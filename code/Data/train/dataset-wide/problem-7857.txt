Remark Moors and Warren give an elementary proof an even stronger inequality. $$(w!)^{t-1}{{{v}\choose {w}}\choose {t}} > (t!)^{w-1} {{{v}\choose {t}}\choose {w}}.$$ 

Let G be a graph and let C be a set of coloring. Suppose that there is an involution $\phi$ from C to C. We can think about the element of C as the nonzero elements of some Abelian group and $\phi(x)=-x$. (For concreteness we can consider especially the special case that C corresponds to the cyclic group, so that $\phi$ has no fixed points when |C| is even and one fixed point when |C| is odd.) Consider a colorings where for every edge {u,v} in G we color the directed edge from u to v with some color c and the directed edge from v to u with -c. We will also require that two edges with the same tail and two edges with the same head must have different colors. If $\phi$ is the identity this is a usual edge coloring of $G$. My question is if such colorings were considered and what is known about them. For example, is there an analog of Vizing theorem? (Vizing theorem asserts that the edges of every graph with maximum degree d can be colored by d+1 colors.) 

Euler's theorem V-E+F=2, can be regarded as a first theorem in graph theory, or in the theory of convex polytopes, and probably 0th theorem in algebraic topology and other fields. 

Another manifestation of mirror symmetry of combinatorial nature, that can be formulated in simple words, is in terms of typical shape of various classes of partitions. I mentioned it in a remark above and let me quote a description taken from my adventure book. 

Somehow my experience, at least these days, is quite different. I do not see much difference between the way I think about things and the way I talk or write about them. Part of the reasons is being involved in semi-formal Internet acticities like blogs, polymath projects, MO, etc., another reason is that I think more about conceptual and meta questions (like this one), yet another reason is that I am quite interested in the process (for me and even more for others) leading to ideas and answers. Also, getting older may have something to do with it: On the one hand, you are less surprised from your own partial-thoughts and unexplained intuition, and, on the other hand, you are less surprised from your half-thoughts and unexplained intuitions. 

Zeno's paradox on Achilles and the tortoise is related to the formula for infinite geometric sums and more generally to the idea that infinite sums can lead to finite outcomes. It is quite remarkable how relevant 17th century calculus is to Zeno's three paradoxes. In fact, it looks that in a different universe these paradoxes could have started calculus. Terry Tao remarked on some post I made about it: "Zeno's arrow paradox can be reinterpreted in the light of the theory of differential equations that the equations of motion must be second-order in time rather than first-order, since one has to specify initial velocity in addition to initial position in order to have a well-posed system. So the arrow paradox may well be the earliest precursor of Newton's famous equation F=ma..." 

RSA (From the Wikipedia article) In cryptography, RSA (which stands for Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) is an algorithm for public-key cryptography. It is the first algorithm known to be suitable for signing as well as encryption, and was one of the first great advances in public key cryptography. RSA is widely used in electronic commerce protocols, and is believed to be secure given sufficiently long keys and the use of up-to-date implementations. 

On recent extension of Birkhoff's theorem is by Ellis, Friedgut and Pilpel. The context is Erdos-Ko-Rado theorems for permutations. See Section 5 and especially Definition 17 and Theorem 29 of this paper. Let me also mention this paper by Jessica Striker regarding the alternating-sign-matrix polytope. A conjecture extending Birkoff von Neumann theorem to finite Coxeter groups (The A_n family gives the original case) which is proved in all cases but one can be found in this paper by N. McCarthy, D. Ogilvie, I. Spitkovsky, and N. Zobin. 

A grand programme in mathematics with some enthusiastic supporters is that of computerized proofs for mathematical theorem. Another related (but different) programme is that of automatic verification of (humanly created) mathematical proofs. 

Consider $m$ random 0-1 vectors of length $n$. Let $L$ be the lattice spanned by them. What is the value of $m$ (as a function of $n$) for which it is true with positive probability that $L=Z^n$? More generally, let $V(L)$ be the rank of $Z^n/L$ (The volume of $L$). What is the behavior of $V(L)$ as a function of $n$ and $m$? 

This is a very nice question. Let me describe the very different behavior of convex polytopes in 3-dimensions compared to convex polytopes in higher dimensions. In three dimensions we have the following facts: 1) Every triangulation of $S^2$ and, more generally every realization of $S^2$ by a polyhedral complex are combinatorially equivalent to the boundary complex of a convex polytope. 2) Every polytope is combinatorially equivalent to a rational polytope - namely to a polytope all whose vertices have rational coordinates. 3) Every automorphism of the face lattice of a convex polytope can be realized by a rigid motion of a combinatorially equivalent polytope. These statements follow or extend a well known theorem of Steinitz. They are related to the Koebe-Andreev-Thurston circle packing theorem. They all fail very strongly in dimension 4 and higher. 

Jarik Nesetril and Patrice Ossona de Mendez developed the notion of "nowhere dense graphs" which extends the class of planar graphs. The class of nowhere dense graphs include all graphs with a forbidden minor; all graphs of bounded degrees but not all $d$-degenerate graphs. They are important in graph theory and in logic. 

Let me add a few remarks to the very good answers above. Indeed there are two important papers by Nathan M. Dunfield and William P. Thurston with a definition of random 3-manifolds. The first paper Finite covers of random 3-manifolds discuss the advantages of the proposed model compared to other models. The paper also compares the situation with earlier notions and results about random groups. The virtual Haken conjecture is the central motivating question. (Much was recently done on this and related questions.) The second paper by them is The virtual Haken conjecture: Experiments and examples. These papers are related to earlier papers on "random groups" of various kind, and turned out to be connected to notions of "growth" of groups, to properties T and $\tau$, and to be related to sieve computations (see, e.g., this paper by Kowalski). Another natural model of random manifolds is based on random triangulations. We have to remember that as the dimension grows it is harder and harder being a manifold. (And its also hard to be orientable.) One possibility is to consider triangulations of d-manifolds with n vertices and alternatively we can consider triangulations with T facets (namely T d-dimensional simplices). These are quite different models. There are obvious guesses that we cannot prove: 1) it is likely that most triangulated 3-homology spheres are not spheres, (It is also plausible that most triangulated spheres are not PL, and that most PL spheres re not shellable.) 2) It is plausible that the dual-graph of a triangulated sphere (perhaps also homology-sphere) determined the entire triangulation. This is not known, 3) There is a simple computation for what the maximum Euler characteristic of a d-dimensional manifold with n vertices should be, when d is even. It is likely that most d-manifolds attain or come close to this maximum. This is not known and for dimension > 2 there are only finite example of manifolds attaining the proposed maximum. 4) It is a big mystery how many triangulations of d spheres there are with T facets. (exponential in T or more). This can also be asked for manifolds.
