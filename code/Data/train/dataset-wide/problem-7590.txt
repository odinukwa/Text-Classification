Any Lindelöf non-metrizable Hausdorff space will do (EDIT: you need that the space is C-closed as well, see below), but more generally, a space is called isocompact iff every closed countably compact subset of X is compact, cl-isocompact iff the closure of a countably compact subset is compact, and C-closed iff any countably compact subset is closed. This paper by Cho and Park contains various results on (cl)-isocompactess, as well a other references: $URL$ And this one by Ismail and Nyikos has good informations on C-closed spaces: $URL$ 

For instance, I am sure that $Z$ cannot be finite, but can it be Dedekind finite ? Must it be "big" in any appropriate sense ? 

There is a maximal connected Hausdorff topology for the reals, according to this paper of Guthrie, Stone and Wage. I haven't read it, some googling led me to the paper "Problems on (ir)resolvability" of Oleg Pavlov in "Open problems in Topology II" which lists some open questions and cites the above paper (among others). 

Here "nice" means that there is an explicit description of the action of the standard generators of $\mathfrak{g}$, so one could actually write (infinite) matrices for the Lie algebra elements. I have checked some sources including Lie Algebras of Finite and Affine Type by R. Carter and Affine Lie Algebras, Weight Multiplicities and Branching Rules by Kass, Moody, Patera and Slansky, but none contains such details even for the smallest cases like $\tilde{A}_1$. Here is a picture from the second: 

This is an expansion of my comment. The Smith normal form is a normal form of a matrix with entries in any given PID (but this probably works for non-domains and for Bezout rings in general). It goes as follows: given an $m\times n$ matrix $A$, there exist invertible $m\times m$ and $n\times n$ matrices $B$ and $C$ such that $BAC=\operatorname{diag}(a_1,\ldots,a_r,0,\ldots,0)$. Moreover, the entries $a_i$ satisfy $a_i\mid a_{i+1}$ and are unique up to the multiplication by a unit. This decribes the representatives of $GL(m,R) \backslash M(m,n,R) / GL(n,R)$. From here you can obtain the decription for $SL(m,R) \backslash M(m,n,R) / SL(n,R)$ — no independent multiplication by a unit anymore, so the difference is the same as between $K_1$ and $SK_1$. When $R$ is a Euclidean ring, one has an algorith for computing the Smith normal form. This works for any PID, in fact, but the resulting matrices $B$ and $C$ are not necessary elementary in this case. For a Euclidean ring the algorithm gives you the chain of elementary transfromation for obtaining the SNF. As you mentioned, $E(n,R)=SL(n,R)$ when $R$ is Euclidean, but this is not the case for a PID. This equality fails, for example, for the ring $S^{-1}\mathbb{Z}[x]$, where $S$ is the multiplicative system generated by all cyclotomic polynomials. This is a result of D. R. Grayson — $SK_1$ of an interesting principal ideal domain. Here are two other links with examples: 

They are different since there is (for instance) a model of $\forall n\in \omega$ $AC(\{n\})$ which does not satisfy $AC(\omega)$, see Theorem 7.11 in Jech's "The axiom of Choice". Notice that $AC(Z)\Rightarrow\forall n\in Z$ $AC(\{n\})$ and if $Z$ is finite, then of course both are equivalent. Will Sawin gave the correct answer for Question 1: 

I believe that $\omega_1$ with the order topology is a counter example. Call a subset of $\omega_1$ bounded if it is contained in some initial interval $[0,\alpha]$ and unbounded otherwise. Lemma: Any cover of $\omega_1$ by bounded open subsets is not minimal. I am sure that this is standard, but here is a proof. It contains way too many notations and is a bit clumsy, I am afraid, but I hope it is readable. We can assume that such a cover is is of cardinality $\omega_1$. Let thus $\mathcal{V} = \{V_\alpha\,:\,\alpha\in\omega_1\}$ be a cover of $\omega_1$ by bounded open subsets. By a standard argument the sets below are closed and unbounded in $\omega_1$: \begin{align*} C_1 &= \{\alpha\,:\, \cup_{\beta<\alpha} V_\beta\subset[0,\alpha)\}\\ C_2 &= \{\alpha\,:\, \cup_{\beta<\alpha} V_\beta\supset[0,\alpha)\} \end{align*} Hence their intersection $C = \{\alpha\,:\, \cup_{\beta<\alpha} V_\beta =[0,\alpha)\}$ is closed and unbounded as well. We may assume that each member of $C$ is a limit ordinal. When $\alpha\in \omega_1$, let $\alpha^*$ denote the smallest element of $C$ which is $>\alpha$. For each $\alpha\in C$ choose $V_{s(\alpha)}\ni\alpha$ with $s(\alpha)\in[\alpha,\alpha^*)$. Since $V_{s(\alpha)}$ is open and $\alpha$ is limit, $V_{s(\alpha)}$ contains some interval $[\gamma(\alpha),\alpha]$. By Fodor's Lemma, there is some $\gamma\in\omega_1$ such that the set $S$ of $\alpha\in C$ such that $\gamma(\alpha) = \gamma$ is stationary and in particular unbounded. For any $\alpha\in S$ with $\alpha>\gamma^*$, $V_{s(\alpha)}$ contains in particular the interval $[\gamma^*,\alpha]$. Fix now $\eta\in[\gamma^*,\gamma^{**})$. Choose $\alpha \ge \gamma^{**}$ in $S$. Then $$ V_\eta \subset V_{s(\alpha)} \cup \left(\cup_{\beta<\gamma^*}V_\beta\right). $$ Notice that $\gamma^*\le\eta<\alpha\le s(\alpha)$, hence the indices in the union at the righthand side do not contain $\eta$. It follows that $\cup (\mathcal{V} \backslash \{V_\eta\}) = \omega_1$. Corollary: The cover of $\omega_1$ by the intervals $[0,\alpha]$, $\alpha\in\omega_1$, has no refinement that is a minimal cover. 

I've been in contact with Patrick Dehornoy and Ales Drapal and both thought that $A_{28}$ is likely the current record for a Laver table computation. 

It is consistent that $2^{\aleph_0} > \aleph_\omega$. This is immediate from Cohen's work; force with all finite partial functions from $\aleph_{\omega}$ to $2$. More generally Easton has shown that the only constraints on exponentiation of regular cardinals is that it be monotonic and satisfy $\mathrm{cof}(2^\kappa) > \kappa$. For singular cardinals, the matter is much more subtle. For instance one of Shelah's celebrated results is that if $\aleph_\omega$ is a strong limit cardinal, then $2^{\aleph_\omega} < \aleph_{\omega_4}$ (and no, that $4$ is not a misprint). 

Suppose that $(S,*)$ is a finite set equipped with a binary operation. Extend the binary operation to the vector space $V$ with basis $S$. The set of probability measures on $S$, viewed as a compact convex subset of $V$ is closed under $*$ and, since $*$ is continuous, there are idempotent measures on $S$. Must two idempotent measures on $S$ have distinct supports? I am also interested in the more general question where the assumption of finiteness is dropped and one considers the extension (by convolution) of $*$ to the family of all finitely additive measures on $S$ (in that context, define the support of a measure to be all subsets of $S$ with positive measure). 

Let $T$ be a Suslin tree and $f:T\to Y$ be continuous. ($T$ is endowed with the order topology.) Assume that the image of $T$ is contained in a Lindelöf subset of $Y$. Then, force with $T$. Which properties of $f$ and/or $Y$ ensure that the image of $T$ is still contained in a Lindelöf subset of $Y$ in the forcing extension ? I know that spaces which remain Lindelöf after a countably closed forcing are called indestructibly Lindelöf and have been recently well studied. The preservation of Lindelöfness after adding Cohen or random reals has also been investigated, with some interesting results. It might be that some of these results hold as well when one forces with a Suslin tree, but I must admit that my knowledge of forcing is not very "hands on" and I am not able to see quickly if this is the case. My motivation is to try to extend an old result of Steprans which says that a continuous real valued map on a Suslin tree has a countable image. 

Here $H$ is the maximal split torus of $G_2$, $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $K$ such that $\sigma^2\varphi=1$, $\varphi$ is the Frobenius, $U^1$ and $V^1$ are the subgroups of upper and lower unitriangular matrices stable under the exceptional automorphism of $G_2$ induced by $\sigma$ and the root length changing symmetry of the Dynkin diagram, the subgroup $G^1=\langle U^1, V^1\rangle$ and $H^1=H\cap G^1$. My question: is this still the case? 

Consider the root system $\mathsf{B}_n$ with the standard numbering of the fundamental roots (that is, $\alpha_n$ is short). Take $\alpha_{n-2}$ and $\alpha_n$ as a pair of orthogonal roots (indeed, $\alpha_{n-2}+\alpha_n$ is not a root), and take $\gamma=\alpha_{n-1}+\alpha_n$. Then $\beta_1=\alpha_{n-2}+\alpha_{n-1}+\alpha_n$, $\beta_2=\alpha_{n-1}+2\alpha_n$ and $\alpha_{n-2}+\alpha_{n-1}+2\alpha_n$ are all roots. But among the differences of the form $\beta_i-\alpha_j$ the only roots are $\beta_1-\alpha_{n-2}$, $\beta_1-\alpha_n$ and $\beta_2-\alpha_n$, so this gives a counter-example. The beautiful pictures of Hasse diagrams you refer to provide a good way to spot such examples, but for this one should draw them in a different way, which is easier to read. The keyword here is a weight diagram. For examples, see this collection of the diagrams along with a description of their various usages. Namely, Figure 14 on page 35 is the weight diagram of the adjoint representation of a group (or of a Lie algebra) of type $\mathsf{B}_n$, which also describes the structure of the root system (its vertices are the roots, plus the "zero weights" corresponding to the fundamental roots). One looks for a square which has non-consecutive label on its sides (say $i$ and $j$), such that the bonds joining its top or bottom vertex to something on the right are also labeled by either $i$ or $j$. Such a square is immediately found on the very bottom of the picture slightly to the left from the middle. By the way, the quick inspection of the weight diagrams shows that there is no counter-examples besides the one above (I'm not sure, but I haven't spotted any). 

As I wrote in my comments, D.N. Sarkhel constructs such examples in Section 4 of "Some generalizations of countable compactness" (Indian J. pure appl. math 17 (6), 1986). It works as follows. Fix some $n\ge 2$. Take a partition of $[0,1]$ into pairwise disjoint dense subsets $A_i$, $i = 1,\dots, 2n$. If $x\in[0,1]$ there is a unique $n(x)$ such that $x\in A_{n(x)}$. Then set $E_i=A_i$ when $i$ is odd and $E_i = A_{i-1}\cup A_i\cup A_{i+1}$ if $i$ is even, where $A_{2n+1} = A_{2n}$. Then $G$ is open if for each $x\in G$ there is an interval $I(x)$ such that $x\in I(x) \cap E_{n(x)} \subset G$. Sarkhel proves on page 782 that this space is Hausdorff and $n$-star compact but not $n-1$-star compact. It is not possible to obtain regular such spaces since $2$-star compactness is equivalent to $n$-star compactness for any $n\ge 2$ in this class, and to pseudocompactness in the class of Tychonoff spaces. This is shown by van Douwen, Reed, Roscoe and Tree in "Star covering properties" (top. app. 39 issue 1, 1991). 

Corollary 7.10 extends this result to rings of the form $A[x_1^\pm,\ldots,x_k^\pm,x_{k+1},\ldots,x_n]$ for $A$ regular. For other Chevalley groups the situation is complicated. One has the stability theorems for $K_1(\Phi)$ in terms of stable rank (or its ramifications such as absolute stable rank or $\Lambda$-stable rank), but they give pretty bad bounds for polynomial rings. There is, however, the following version of Suslin's theorem for symplectic group in a paper "On symplectic groups over polynomial rings" by F. Grunewald, J. Mennicke and L. Vaserstein: 

If you ask the matrices to be unipotent, then, first, you can only get matrices from $SL_n$, and second, three is not enough, the torus is the obstacle. But if you take four upper and lower unipotent triangular matrices, you can do it (still in $SL_n$). For this the keyword is "unitriangular factorisation". 

I think one could make the case that idempotent ultrafilters are so closely related to Ramsey theory that anything which uses them does relate to Ramsey theory in some way (almost by definition). A less obvious example though would be Gowers's result that $c_0$ is oscillation stable --- that every bounded Lipschitz function on the sphere of $c_0$ is $\epsilon$-constant when restricted to an infinite dimensional subspace. That utilizes a system of idempotent ultrafilters on a families of (partial) semigroups known as $\mathrm{FIN}_k$ (where $k$ ranges over the natural numbers). 

Let $\gamma_\infty$ denote the product Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$. Which $a,b \geq 0$ satisfy that for every Borel set $K\subseteq \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ of positive measure, $a K + b y$ has positive measure for $\gamma_\infty$-a.e. $y$? The knee-jerk answer is ``only $a = 1$, $b=0$.'' The Cameron-Martin Theorem tells us that $x \mapsto x + y$ is absolutely continuous exactly when $y$ is in $\ell^2$ (a set of $\gamma_\infty$-measure $0$). Similar arguments apply to linear transformations like those above. This does not answer the question, however. In fact Solecki and I have recently proved that if $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $K \subseteq \mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}$ is Borel and of positive measure, then $\gamma_\infty(\sqrt{1+b^2} K + b K) > 0$ for $\gamma_\infty$-a.e. $y$ (i.e. a sufficient conditions is that $a^2 = b^2 +1$). See $URL$ for the preprint. It is not difficult to prove that a necessary requirement for a positive answer is that $a^2 + b^2 -2ab \leq 1 \leq a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$. This leaves some discrepancy, however, and that is the question at hand. 

The question is motivated by the fact that from the viewpoint of structure theory of algebraic groups $SL_n,~n\geqslant3$ behaves much better than $SL_2$, while modular forms for $SL_2$ seem to be studied more that those for groups of higher ranks. So let me formulate another version of the above question (not sure if it is less vague): 

By locally principal ring they mean a commutative ring such that its localization at any maximal ideal is a principal ideal ring. For euclidean ring $A$ this gives $K_1(\mathsf{C}_\ell,R)=0$. As a byproduct they also prove a stronger version of Suslin's theorem for $SL$ and a locally principal ring. They also have a version for Laurent polynomial rings and claim that by using stability theorems for $K_1$ as in M. Stein's papers one can prove the same results for classical simple algebraic groups of relative rank $\geqslant2$, but the latter has never been written in full details.
