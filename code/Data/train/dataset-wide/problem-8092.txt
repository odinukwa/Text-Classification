This is really a comment, but I need a bit more space. If $\phi$ is a sentence of ${\cal L}_{\omega_1,\omega}$ that is $\aleph_0$-categorial, there is a complete first order theory $T$ in an expanded vocabulary such that the models of $\phi$ are exactly the reducts atomic models of $\phi$. The expansion is done in such a way that two structures will be isomorphic in the original language if and only if they are isomorphic in the expanded language. So your question is really the same as: For $\phi$ a sentence of ${\cal}L_{\omega_1,\omega}$ is ``$\phi$ is $\kappa$-categorical for all infinite $\kappa$" absolute? This is, as far as I know, still an open question. It is also open if ``$\phi$ is $\aleph_1$-categorical" is absolute. John Baldwin in his paper ``Amalgamation, Absoluteness, and Categoricity" addresses some issues around this. Here is a link $URL$ 

I think the answer is no, but let me first give a precise version of the question (which I think Daniel's argument doesn't quite address). Fix some reasonable listing $P_0,P_1,\dots$ of recursively enumerable sets of polynomials. [See below for a ``reasonable" coding.] I claim that there is no algorithm to determine if $V(P_e)=\emptyset$. Let $K$ be the diagonal halting set. Namely, $K=$ {$e$: the $ e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $e$}. For each $e$ let $P_e=\{p_0,p_1,\dots\}$ be the recursively enumerable sequence of polynomials where $p_i=0$ if the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine has not halted by stage $i$ and $p_i=1$ if has. Then $V(P_e)=\emptyset \Leftrightarrow e\in K$. Since $K$ is undecidable there is no algorithm to decide if $V(P_e)$ is empty. One way to code sequences of polynomials would be to let $q_0,q_1,\dots$ list all polynomials, and let $P_e$ be {$q_i:$ the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $i$}. To get to Ian's setting we could view $P_e$ as the sequence $p_0,p_1,\dots$ where $p_{(i,j)\}$ is 0 unless the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input i at stage $j$ in which case it is $q_i$ and $(i,j)$ is some computable pairing function. 

As far as I can tell, the idea to use filtered categories instead of just ordinal-indexed diagrams is due to Grothendieck. In fact, let me use this opportunity to advertise my favorite text on abstract category theory: Exposé I of SGA 4. It rocks. Anyway: Proposition 8.1.6 (loc. cit.), which Grothendieck attributes to Deligne, says that every filtered category receives a cofinal map from an ordered set. Grothendieck remarks that, while this result says that the two points of view on filtered objects (general or ordered) are essentially equivalent, filtered objects arise more naturally. A nice example is Grothendieck's Theorem 8.3.3 on ind-representability. Aside from some set-theoretic issues, this basically boils down to the statement that exactness of a presheaf of sets $F$ on a category $C$ is equivalent to the category $C_{/F}$ being filtered. 

Say you've got a surjective smooth submersion $\widetilde{M} \rightarrow M$ that's also a (smooth?) fiber bundle. (Assume all the manifolds are compact... though I wish there were some weaker condition than that for the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to apply. It'd be nice if one could make sense of it whenever the manifold had finitely generated cohomology). EDIT: See update below. Slap Riemannian metrics on $\widetilde{M}$ and $M$ so that the submersion is a Riemannian submersion. (I just feel like one would need this in step 4. The other thing that would make sense is if we could somehow put a Riemannian metric on $\widetilde{M}$ that would be the 'twisted product' of Riemannian metrics on $F$ and $M$- whatever that means). By the Generalized Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, $\int_{\widetilde{M}}Pf(\Omega_{\widetilde{M}}) = (2\pi)^n \chi(\widetilde{M})$. And here's the thing that seems the hardest to make rigorous (though who knows, I may have already been wrong at step 2): I want to say that $\int_{\widetilde{M}}Pf(\Omega_{\widetilde{M}}) = \int_M\int_F Pf(\Omega_F)Pf(\Omega_M) = (2\pi)^k(2\pi^{n-k})\chi(F)\chi(M)$. 

The classical argument Andres mentions can be taken one step further to show that if every uncountable $\Pi_1^1$ set contains a perfect subset then $\aleph_1$ is inaccessible in $L$. This follows from the same fact for $\Sigma^1_2$-sets since, by the uniformization theorem, every $\Sigma^1_2$-set is the injective projection of a $\Pi^1_1$-set. 

This doesn't exactly answer your question but... If $A$ is any upper bound for the arithmetic degrees then $0^{(\omega)}$ is recursive in $A^{\prime\prime}$. Enderton and Putnam proved that there upper bounds with $A^{\prime\prime}=0^{(\omega)} $ Dave 

Pillay and Scanlon gave an example showing Morley rank isn't definable in elementary extensions in: Compact complex manifolds with the DOP and other properties, J. Symbolic Logic, vol. 67 (2002), pp. 737–743. In a different direction Dale Radin showed the you do have definability of dimension in the standard model in: A definability result for compact complex spaces. J. Symbolic Logic vol. 69 (2004), pp. 241–254. 

Another way to do this is to use the Hensel-Rychlick version of Hensel's Lemma. This says that if you have $f\in {\mathbb Z}_p[X]$ and $a\in{\mathbb Z}_p$ such that $v(f(a))>2v(f^\prime(a))$, then $f$ has a zero in ${\mathbb Z}_p$. As in Jerome's answer we can find an integer $n$ such that $x=n+p^3\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is a unit. Let $f(X)=X^p-{x\over n}$. Then $v(f(1))=3$ while $v(f^\prime(1))=1$. Thus $x\over n$ has a $p$-th root. Indeed, the Hensel-Rychlick Lemma says you can find a zero $c$ with $v(c-a)\ge v(f(a))-v(f^\prime(a))$. 

Let me try to turn my comment into an answer. Again, the intuition is to filter $\mathrm{Ind}_{\mathbb{E}_0}^{\mathbb{E}_k}M$ by arity, and the result (at least in slightly less generality) is certainly classical, but I'll give a proof in the language you use above. I will also make the following assumptions (which hopefully you are making too): 

In Segal's paper on $\Gamma$-spaces, he gives a functor $Spectra \rightarrow \Gamma-Spaces$ defined by taking a functor $E$ and sending it to the $\Gamma$-space $AE$ with $AE(n) = Mor(S \times \cdots \times S, E)$, where $S$ is the sphere spectrum. Now, since this is supposed to define a $\Gamma$-space, in particular the sets $Mor(S \times \cdots \times S, E)$ should be topological spaces... but they don't seem to come with any obvious topology, at least not obvious to me. On the other hand, it seems like there should be some sort of spectrum that acts like $Mor(S \times \cdots \times S, E)$; could he mean, possibly, the 0th space of this spectrum?

It seems that there is a common theme in mathematics where, if we want to find out about a category C, then we look at $\hat{C}$ (the category of contravariant functors from $C$ to $Set$). There are all sorts of good reasons for this (Yoneda's lemma being a big one, and the fact that this is a topos). There are other versions, sometimes you look at contravariant functors into some other category, like groups (e.g. for algebraic groups). But I have never seen the dual notion: covariant functors from some other category INTO $C$. Is this notion as useful as the notion of a presheaf? I guess it's like looking at a category "over" $C$ as opposed to a category "under" it. I guess, hidden in this question is the question: Can one learn anything about a category $C$ by looking at presheaves of $C$? For example, does the difference between presheaves of sets and presheaves of ableian groups tell us anything about the differences between the category of Groups and the category of Sets? EDIT: There seems to be a bit of confusion of what I mean by "dual of a presheaf." I don't mean "copresheaves" (which I didn't know existed before I asked this), I mean what you get by reversing the arrow of the functor not taking the opposite category. So I'm looking at functors into the category of interest, as opposed to out of them. I can see how this is confusing because usually "dual" doesn't turn around functors, just arrows inside categories. So I guess I mean presheaves in $C^{op}$... (but covariant instead of contravariant?)... who knows. 

Another spin on this question, that gets around the fact that there are only countably many second order sentences, is to look at categoricity in $L^2_{\kappa,\omega}$ where we allow conjunctions of size less that $\kappa$ and second order quantifiers. Hyttinen, Kangas and Vaananen (see $URL$ show that, for suitable cardinals $\kappa$, all models of a complete first order theory $T$ of size $\kappa$ are characterized by and $L^2_{\kappa,\omega}$-sentence if and only if $T$ is ``classifiable" in the sense of Shelah's Main-Gap i.e., $T$ is stable, NDOP, shallow, and NOTOP. 

The theory of the natural numbers with addition and $x\mapsto 2^x$ is decidable. One reference is the Cherlin-Point paper "On extensions of Presburger arithmetic". It can be found on Francoise Point's webpage: $URL$ 

The classical example is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ sets of reals. We say that $X\subset \mathbb R$ is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ if the complement of the projection of a Borel set in ${\mathbb R}^n$. Any such set of cardinality greater than $\aleph_1$ has cardinality continuum. 

As I recall, McAloon's method for proving that there are no computable nonstandard models of $I\Delta_0$ was to show that there are initial segments that are nonstandard models of PA. The usual Tennenbaum tricks can then be used to show that addition and multiplication are not computable. Additional Comment-- Here are references for McAloon's paper and the paper of Wilmers that proves a similar result for $IE_1$ the fragment of $I\Delta_0$ where you only have induction for formulas with bounded existential quantifiers McAloon, Kenneth, On the complexity of models of arithmetic. J. Symbolic Logic 47 (1982), no. 2, 403--415. Wilmers, George Bounded existential induction. J. Symbolic Logic 50 (1985), no. 1, 72--90. 

An example is given in MacLane's "Sheaves in Geometry and Logic." Consider the constant presheaf on a space $X$ with $P(U) = S$ where $S$ is a set with more than one element and restriction maps are identities. The plus construction doesn't change anything except that $P(0) = 0$, and one can show easily that this is not a sheaf. In general it is true that the plus construction turns separated presheaves into sheaves and any presheaf into a separated presheaf; hence ++ = sheafification. 

Sort of an answer to my own question that I just stumbled across: A "stack over a category $S$" is a functor from some other category into S that satisfies various properties. If these properties are similar or dual to the ones that a presheaf must satisfy in order to be a sheaf... then I would say that the notion I was talking about in my question was that of a "pre-stack," and that the answer is "Yes, they are useful... they give rise to the notion of stacks!" EDIT: Considering my original question simply asks if the notion of functors into a category being useful, it doesn't really matter if the property of a stack that separates it from any old functor into $S$ is related to the property of a sheaf (that separates it from any old functor out of $S$)... What matters, I think, is that stacks are a type of functor INTO $S$ as opposed to out of it, and they are, indeed, useful. But it would be nice if someone could clean this answer by erasing this sentence and replacing it with some "big-picture" description of what (if anything) a stack over $S$ tells us about $S$... in relation to, say, a sheaf on $S$. Am I still incomprehensible? It is rather late... Of course, I may be spouting nonsense... so I'm making this answer a community wiki in the hopes that someone who knows something about stacks can verify or falsify what i've written, and hopefully expand. (Meta-note: I put this as an answer because I wasn't really sure what to do... I don't think it properly belongs as an edit to the original question... it's basically a different question "are stacks basically what I was thinking of?" but it was sufficiently related and similar to my original question that I don't think it merits a whole NEW question... so I put it here as community wiki. If this is not the correct thing to do, then I trust a moderator or someone much wiser than me will take down this post!) 

We will always have ${\rm ZF}^M\supseteq {\rm ZF}$. The problem comes if $M$ contains nonstandard sentences--which is equivalent to the question of whether $M$ contains nonstandard natural numbers since we can identify formulas with their Godel codes. If there are no nonstandard integers, then they type of externl induction you are doing works fine, but if there aren't it might break down at a nonstandard stage. 

Wilkie's proof of o-minimality of exponentiation tells you (without needing to assume Schanuel's Conjecture) that for each $k$ there is a bound $M_k$ such that any exponential polynomial $\sum_{i=1}^k c_ie^{\alpha_i x}$ has at most $M_k$ real zeros [assuming that the $c_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are real.] Perhaps Khovanskii's work gives an explicit bound on the $M_k$. 

This was intended to be a comment to SJR's post, but was too long. Here is a proof that any formula that is preserved downwards in models of $T$ is equivalent in $T$ to a universal formula, from which we deduce that formulas preserved upwards are equivalent to existential formulas. Let $T$ be an $\cal L$-theory. Suppose $\phi(\bar v)$ is preserved downwards in models of $T$. Let $\Gamma(\bar v)=\{\psi(\bar v): \psi$ is universal and $T\models \phi(\bar v)\rightarrow \psi(\bar v)\}$. We claim that $T+\Gamma(\bar v)\models \psi(\bar v)$. If that happens then there are $\psi_1,\dots,\psi_n\in\Gamma(\bar v)$ such that $T\models \phi(\bar v)\leftrightarrow (\psi_1(\bar v)\land\dots\land\psi_n(\bar v)$. Suppose not. Then there is ${\cal M}\models T$ and $\bar a\in \cal M$ such that ${\cal M}\models \psi(\bar a)$ for $\psi\in\Gamma$ and ${\cal M}\models \neg\phi(\bar a)$. Let $T_1= T+ \phi(\bar a) + $ atomic diagram of $\cal M$. If $T_1$ is satisfiable there is ${\cal N}\models T$ with ${\cal M}\subset {\cal N}$ and ${\cal N}\models \phi(\bar a)$, contradicting the fact that $\phi$ is preserved downward. Thus $T_1$ must be unsatisfiable. Thus there is a quantifier free formula $\theta(\bar v,\bar w)$ and $\bar b\in \cal M$ such that $$T\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)\rightarrow \neg\phi(\bar a).$$ Since the parameters $\bar a$ and $\bar b$ don't occur in $T$, $$T\models \forall \bar v\ (\phi(\bar v)\rightarrow\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w))$$ But then $\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w)\in \Gamma$ contradicting the fact that ${\cal M}\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)$. 

Algebraic topologists like to cook up algebraic invariants on topological spaces in order to answer questions, so they are often concerned with how strong those invariants are. Currently, I am concerned with just how much information is lost when moving from a space to `the' chain complex associated to that space. Now, I should be a bit more specific here. There are many homology theories in which one takes a space, cooks up a chain complex, and takes its homology. I am mainly interested in just singular homology for this question, but if you can only think of an answer using sheaf cohomology or some other homology theory then that's alright. Now, the actual question is: 

Work on exotic spheres via homotopy theory (an example where this is the only known method to produce the results.) (one of) Quillen's proof(s) of the Atiyah-Swan conjecture. While there is a purely algebraic, group-cohomological proof, it turns out to be very natural to prove this theorem using spaces with an action, as opposed to specializing to when the space is a point. 

I've heard that chromatic homotopy theory is about setting up a rough dictionary between algebro-geometric terminology regarding $M_{FG}$ and the stable homotopy category, so I guess the question is about whether or not we can make the dictionary into a proper functor. 

The category of chain complexes on a Grothendieck abelian category can be given the structure of a stable model category in which the weak equivalences are the quasi-isos. The category of chain complexes of $\mathcal{O}$-modules on any ringed space admits a symmetric monoidal model structure, which means that the unbounded derived category is at the very least a tensor-triangulated category (it's not immediately obvious that the tensor structure plays nice with the triangular structure, but it would be very strange to me if this wasn't true or obvious to someone else?)
