You get cheaper access to inputs. For a large advanced economy that is relatively diversified, it is possible that unilateral tariff reductions across many or all sectors can be good for the economy by freeing up resources presently occupied in low-value activities with few prospects to contribute to technological progress. The additional ease of doing business in that country may also attract additional financial investments and human resources talent from abroad, which would tend to increase technological progress and productivity at the same time. For a small economy that specializes in some specific sector (e.g., tourism, finance), a unilateral tariff reduction may improve the competitiveness of the sector they specialize in, and therefore be good for the economy and/or technological progress over both short and long time frames. These are somewhat special conditions, and most often countries do not see benefit in unilateral tariff reductions. As for what politicians do, this is a somewhat different question and should be considered separately from the economics argumentation about unilateral tariff reduction. It is very straightforward to argue that some concentrated interest(s) in just one or two industries could be major campaign contributors in a winning campaign, leading the politician to try to impose tariffs which benefit specific industries while causing overall negative impacts across the entire economy. Theoretically, it would be possible to be in a situation where both a) unilateral tariff reductions could benefit the economy and b) at the same time concentrated interests could legally and/or illegally obtain political influence which resulted in an increase in their own profits at a cost to the overall economy. 

Actually, Section 3 of the paper you linked is probably one of the most comprehensive lists you could find of the movers and the shakers with regard to predictive game theory. I know that many of them have both published and working papers addressing these issues. Fudenberg even addresses those specific two topics. A few selections from the paper: 

To elaborate on what has been said in the comments already, using GMM based on Euler Equations generally involves uncertainty that motivates some sort of expected orthogonality between a moment equation and some instruments. Here is a common example of a "Consumption-Based Asset-Pricing Model" (see, for example, Campbell, 1993, 1996) posted by Dave Giles: 

A representative agent chooses a consumption time-path to maximize expected discounted utility $E\left[\sum_{i=0}^\infty\beta^i U(c_{t+i})|\Omega_t\right]$, where $\Omega_t$ is the information set at time $t$, subject to the inter-temporal budget constraint, $c_t + p_tq_t = r_tq_{t-1} + w_t$, for all $t$. The optimal consumption path satisfies: $p_tU'(c_t) = \beta E[r_{t+1}U'(c_{t+1})|\Omega_t]$, for all $t$ Which gives the Euler equation: $E[\beta(r_{t+1}/p_t)[U'(c_{t+1}) / U'(c_t)]|\Omega_t] - 1 = 0$. He then imposes the CRRA utility function $U(c_t) = c_t^{1-\gamma}/(1-\gamma)$, making the Euler equation become $E[\beta(r_{t+1}/p_t)(c_{t+1}/c_t)^{-\gamma}|\Omega_t] - 1 = 0$. This yields the moment equations: $E[\{\beta(r_{t+1} / p_t)(c_{t+1} / c_t)^{-\gamma} - 1\}z_t] = E[E[\beta(r_{t+1} / p_t)(c_{t+1} / c_t)^{-\gamma} - 1|\Omega_t]z_t] = 0$ with $z_t$ a vector of instruments belonging to $\Omega_t$. 

First, it is important to note that there is a substantial literature both developing and using nonlinear VAR estimation (for example, see papers here, here, here, and here). The reasons linear VARs are seen a lot, though, are similar to the reasons that least squares (in its varying forms) is seen a lot. The model is very transparent and analytically tractable. This is a benefit for both pedagogy (analysis can be done on linear VARs just using lag polynomials) and for interpretation of results. You also don't run in to the concavity and global vs. local solution issues you do with big nonlinear problems, which can make your results more credible in many circles. 

Domestic oligopolies could be charging uncompetitively high prices, while inflation remains low due to importing lower-priced goods in other sectors. For example, paying $20 to download a 0 marginal cost film (a much higher price resulting from oligopoly), while buying cheap imports (which helps to keep down price levels). 

You don't have to apply a single continuous function as required in many textbook applications. Theoretically, you could say something like "beyond production level x, some other factor kicks in which begins to apply pressure". So, below production level x, f(x) is the function, and above production level x, the total cost function is the sum of f(x) + g(x). This is still a somewhat simplistic and theoretical representation, but for practical applications could be updated with some variety of parametric or non-parametric approaches. For example, perhaps some social media platform succeeds quite a lot in reaching 1 billion users under economies of scale production conditions, but then its per unit costs rise a lot beyond some threshold, for example due to: concerns related to privacy, data localization, spread of fake news, speech which promotes violence or hate against individuals based on ethnicity or religion, etc. Each of those concerns would enter as an essentially separate cost function into the overall production activities of the company. (In terms of pro-competition concerns, it would be arbitrarily easy to not apply such rules to start-ups with size under one thousand or one million users, etc). 

The concept is actually the other way around. Think of it in the same way as the Law of Demand. If you go to the grocery store and you see a food that you like selling for \$.25/lb, you would buy a whole lot of it before the price rises. Conversely, if you go to the grocery store and you see a food that you like selling for \$100/lb, you would probably wait to buy this item until it is cheaper or at least buy a small amount of it. In economics, the price drives the quantity demanded by the consumer. Now let us look at the Law of Supply. Imagine that you are the owner of a company. You go to the store, and you see that the item you are producing and the similar items produced by your competitors is selling for \$.25. You would not necessarily want to produce a lot of the product because the margin between the selling price and the production costs (profit) is small. Conversely, imaging going to the store and seeing that the item you are producing and the similar items produced by your competitors is selling for \$100. You would want to produce a lot of the product because the margin between the selling price and the production costs is (presumably) large. In this case, as in the other case, the price drives the quantity produced by the supplier. 

If you check data.workdbank.org, then go to the "databank", you can select "World Development Indicators" (WDIs). Then you can select China, and searching for "value added" within your browser you can get a variety of measures of agriculture, manufacturing, services and industry (e.g., % of GDP, in USD). The time series goes back long before 1990. Even if not disaggregated enough for what you want to do, it could be useful as a point of comparison. 

If the company has excess cash or excess liquidity that it cannot effectively deploy in capital investments, and it has reason to believe that the expected value of returns from purchasing shares will be higher than alternatives (such as buying equities or financial instruments), this would be legitimate, where "legitimate" can be defined as an increase in the long-term value for anyone holding shares in the company. As for determining how often this is done "legitimately", as opposed to being done manipulatively in order for inside traders to profit from reducing the supply of shares and thus illegitimately driving up prices, that's a different question. The question of whether it is "legitimate" in terms of share buybacks giving the executive board control out of proportion to shares held, this should be considered separately from the question of whether excess cash legitimizes the buyback from a long-term profit maximization perspective. As for the question of whether excess cash that cannot be deployed effectively is a sign of a "healthy economy" or not, this need not be determined by the observation of excess cash of a specific corporation considering share buybacks. For example, one company may have excess cash that it cannot deploy effectively in a situation where it expects to earn higher returns from a share buyback than investing in alternative financial assets or securities, without this necessarily applying on an economy-wide basis (which would contradict a variety of theoretical assumptions about financial markets always efficiently reallocating capital to its most profitable use ... but that could happen.) Relevant regulatory approaches to "illegitimate" share buybacks could fall under shareholder rights (other shareholders would be poorly represented by executives deciding on share buybacks to temporarily inflate share prices for their personal profit), or possibly in some cases insider trading. The regulatory framework, and its application, varies across jurisdictions. 

There are actually five different types of trading blocs: preferential trading areas, free trade areas, customs unions, common markets and economic (and monetary) unions [1]. A preferential trade area (PTA) is a trading bloc that reduces tariffs on particular goods between two countries but does not abolish them completely. There are no particularly well-known examples, but a list can be found here [2]. A free-trade area is the agreement among all member countries to eliminate tariffs, import quotas, and preferences on goods and services traded between each other (the free-trade as defined in the question) [3]. Probably the best known free-trade area is NAFTA; but others are listed here and here. Again, there are no well-known customs unions, but a list can be found here. A common market has free trade and free movement of the factors of production but other economic policies of the countries may be different (one of the differences between a common market and an economic union). You may also want to look at single market and unified market. There are no well-known common markets, but the previous link also contains a list. The best known economic union is the EU though more can be found here. An economic and monetary union has the same qualities of an economic union but each member nation also uses the same currency. One example would be the nations in the EU who also utilize the Euro. 

In this scenario, the uncertainty referred to is captured in the expectation operator over the information set $\Omega$. Notice that the interpretation of $\Omega$ motivates which instruments to use in the estimation. Takeaway: if you want to use Euler equations to motivate GMM, you need some kind of uncertainty. Use uncertainty structure to decide instruments. 

The simple answer is they estimate the demand curves for each product and, using their cost structure and market characteristics (competition structure, etc.) set price to maximize profits. This is standard for any firm, though. How Google in particular and these big firms in general (Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) estimate demand curves is somewhat different than the usual economist might do it. For usual demand estimation, a researcher would have to make use of market idiosyncrasies to identify demand. For example, using supply shifters with 2SLS for basic demand estimation, BLP for discrete choice with heterogeneous products, etc. Identification is such a big issue for demand estimation because a researcher generally just observes equilibrium (p, q) combinations, not the actual demand curve. We are also often constrained purely by the amount of data available. For a big firm like Google, however, they 1) have the ability to enact exogenous perturbation in price to see how sales change and 2) have access to tons and tons of data. Using 1) they are constantly running little experiments to see how consumer behavior changes. They can then use the results to actually trace out the demand curve. In these experiments, the firm could easily take into account things like movie popularity, genre, etc. With respect to 2), Pat Bajari, chief economist at Amazon and one of the biggest names in modern empirical IO, has a (at this point) working paper with Nekipelov, Ryan, and Yang on how to use machine learning to estimate demand curves across products with lots of sample points bunches of characteristics (think thousands of product characteristics). As a "fledgling computer science researcher," you'd probably be in to this. This approach is especially relevant for people/firms with access to tons of data (like Google, Amazon, etc.) 

If survivor bias means that more successful firms more typically list on a public exchange and less successful firms do so less often, then it would be possible for "the stock market" to grow faster than GDP indefinitely. Perhaps trivially, and ignoring survivor bias implicit in stock market indices per se: you might also assert some condition where the share of capital grows in the economy by, say, 0.000000000000001% per year, or any other sufficiently small number, for NPV of profits from economywide capital to perpetually increase faster than GDP. This would be more likely if taking sufficiently long periods of analysis - for example, it is unlikely to hold in each and every single quarter, but it could hold in each and every decade. 

Prices are easy to observe. However, they do not contain information about externalities (or other market imperfections), so while they are the most commonly used source of information by consumers and producers, it is debatable whether they are the "best" information. 

A great many things can be said on the question. But it might be worth pointing out that people have been building stuff for a very very long time, so maybe 1% productivity growth is not a bad result. The most difficult is anti-corruption. You could compare the free press + independent judiciary + empowered investigative authorities within specified limits + free elections ... with the approach of President Xi, whose name is now entrenched in the Chinese constitution. However, it seems that you're more interested to motivate a specific theory. So perhaps you could develop that and come back with a question that is more aligned to what you want to know. For example, you could be additionally descriptive about what it is about Tesla's operations that might have broader lessons in construction? (Note that Tesla makes cars, not ports, not bridges and not roads.)
