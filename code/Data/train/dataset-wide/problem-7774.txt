Let $W$ be the canonical $\operatorname{Spin}^\mathbb{C}$ spinor bundle on a symplectic 4-manifold $(M, \omega)$, with a compatible $J$ and $g$, so \begin{equation} {W_ + } = {T^{0,0}}{M^*} \oplus {T^{0,2}}{M^*}, \;\;\;... \end{equation} and the determinant line bundle $L = T^{0,2}M^*$. Now I want to define a connection on $W$. I learn about basic general theory on spinor bundle, and it says a connection on $W$ consists of the Levi-civita connection $\nabla_g$ and a connection $A$ on $L$. In particular, after I have a $\nabla_g$, I still need to saparately define the $A$, which does not induce from $\nabla_g$. But I see in Sergeev's lecture on Vortex and Seiberg-Witten equations, that in the case of $(M, \omega, J, g)$ one can modify $\nabla_g$ by adding a term with Nijenhuis tensor to give a connection to $L = T^{0,2}M^*$, and therefore a full connection on $W$. 

This is a simple question, but I can't find explicit discussion in literatures that I can find. Real/imaginary Killing spinor equation \begin{equation} \nabla_\mu \psi = \lambda \gamma_\mu \psi \end{equation} where $\lambda$ is constant is a well known subject. But I wonder why the case where $\lambda$ is non-constant receives no discussion? One reason I can think of is, one may perform Weyl rescaling to bring $\lambda$ to constant, so the non-constant case is not interesting. 

I am confused by two examples of spinor bundles over 4-manifolds, which I saw in various places: (1) The spinor bundle $S = S_+ \oplus S_-$ associated to a spin or spinc structure of Riemannian four-manifold $M$ (2) If the manifold $M$ has almost complex structure, then the bundle $\tilde S \equiv \Lambda^{0,*}T^*M$ is also a spin bundle, which can also be split into $\tilde S_+ = \Lambda^{0,0}T^*M \oplus \Lambda^{0,2}T^*M$ and $\tilde S_- = \Lambda^{0,1}T^*M$. My question is: are the two examples the same? In particular, I know that $S_+ \otimes S_+ = \Lambda_+^2 T^*M \oplus C^\infty(M)$ where $\Lambda_+^2T^*M$ denotes the bundle of self-dual two forms (corresponding to symmetric product of two $S_+$), I wonder if the same is true for $\tilde S_+$? I think it is true, since I can multiply by $(\sigma_{\mu \nu})^{\alpha \beta}$ to go from a bi-spinor to a self-dual 2-form. But I want to see if there is a more geometrical way (playing with the $(0,{\rm even})$-forms) to see it. Thanks! 

I naively guessed the metric induced from $\sum\limits_i {d{z_i}d{{\bar z}_i}} $, but it does not satisfy $g_{mn}R^m = \kappa_n$, since the power of $\omega_i$ does not match: $g_{mn} \sim \omega^{-2}_i$, which cannot do the job. I tried also $\sum\limits_k {\omega _i^{ - 2}d{z_i}d{{\bar z}_i}} $, but then ${\Phi ^m}_n \equiv {g^{mk}}{\left( {d\kappa } \right)_{kn}}$ does not seem to give $\Phi^2 \sim -1 + R\kappa$. 

Let $M$ be a compact manifold with a nowhere-vanishing vector field $R$. Consider principal $G$-bundle $P$ over $M$, and $\mathcal{A}$ being the space of irreducible connections. Let me denote a subspace $\mathcal{A}_R$ of all irreducible connections $\mathcal{A}$ as \begin{equation} \mathcal{A}_R \equiv \{{A \in \mathcal{A}} | \mathcal{{L}}_RA = {d_A}\left( {{\iota _R}A} \right) \} \end{equation} where $\mathcal{L}_R$ denotes the Lie-derivative. The condition implies an infinitesimal action of diffeomorphism generated by $R$ is equivalent to infinitesimal gauge transformation with parameter $\iota_R A$, and it is equivalent to $\iota_R F_A = 0$. My goal is to understand the space $\mathcal{A}_R$. One naive guess is that one could choose a gauge such that $\mathcal{L}_R A = 0$, since infinitesimally Lie-derivative can be compensated by gauge transformation. Note that by irreducibility it implies $\iota_R A = 0$.However this is not true in general: if some orbits $\mathcal{C}$ of $R$ is closed and $A$ has non-zero holonomy along $\mathcal{C}$, then one cannot have $\iota_R A = 0$ So my question is: Is there a way to classify the space $\mathcal{A}_R$ (modding out gauge equivalence $\mathcal{G}$), namely some decomposition (some Fourier decomposition according to behavior of $A$ under action of $R$) \begin{equation} \mathcal{A}_R/\mathcal{G} = \{ A|\mathcal{L}_R A=0\}\cup \{...\}\cup\{...\}...? \end{equation} In particular, is there obstruction to the existence of connection $\mathcal{L}_R A = 0$? 

Perhaps this is the proof, at least for the Kahler case. I use complex coordinate system: \begin{equation} \beta = \frac{1}{{2!}}{\beta _{\bar \mu \bar \nu }}d{{\bar z}^{\bar \mu }} \wedge d{{\bar z}^{\bar \nu }} = {\beta _{\bar 1\bar 2}}d{{\bar z}^{\overset{\lower0.5em\hbox{$\smash{\scriptscriptstyle\smile}$}}{1} }} \wedge d{{\bar z}^{\bar 2}} \end{equation} Then \begin{equation} {{\bar \partial }^*}\beta = - {\nabla ^{\bar \mu }}{\beta _{\bar \mu \bar \nu }}d{{\bar z}^{\bar \nu }} \to \bar \partial {{\bar \partial }^*}\beta = - {\nabla _{\bar \lambda }}{\nabla ^{\bar \mu }}{\beta _{\bar \mu \bar \nu }}d{{\bar z}^{\bar \lambda }} \wedge d{z^{\bar \nu }} \end{equation} Commuting the covariant derivatives, one gets the curvature and another second order derivative: \begin{equation} \bar \partial {{\bar \partial }^*}\beta = - \bar \partial \left( {{\nabla ^{\bar \mu }}{\beta _{\bar \mu \bar \nu }}} \right)d{z^{\bar \nu }} = {F_{\bar \lambda }}^{\bar \mu }{\beta _{\bar \mu \bar \nu }}d{{\bar z}^{\bar \lambda }} \wedge d{z^{\bar \nu }} - \frac{1}{2}{\nabla ^{\bar \mu }}{\nabla _{\bar \mu }}{\beta _{\bar \nu \bar \lambda }}d{{\bar z}^{\bar \lambda }} \wedge d{z^{\bar \nu }} \end{equation} In passing, one needs to use the fact that we are sitting on a 4-manifold, and therefore $\bar \partial \beta = 0$, namely \begin{equation} {\nabla ^{\bar \mu }}{\nabla _{\bar \lambda }}{\beta _{\bar \mu \bar \nu }}d{{\bar z}^{\bar \lambda }} \wedge d{z^{\bar \nu }} = - \frac{1}{2}{\nabla ^{\bar \mu }}{\nabla _{\bar \mu }}{\beta _{\bar \nu \bar \lambda }}d{{\bar z}^{\bar \lambda }} \wedge d{z^{\bar \nu }} \end{equation} Finally,${F_{\bar \lambda }}^{\bar \mu }{\beta _{\bar \mu \bar \nu }}d{{\bar z}^{\bar \lambda }} \wedge d{z^{\bar \nu }} = \left( {{F_{\bar 1}}^{\bar 1} + {F_{\bar 2}}^{\bar 2}} \right)\beta \sim\left\langle {\omega ,F} \right\rangle \beta $ So up to some convention of $i$, the formula is obtained. 

Consider a torus $T^n$. An differential operator $\mathcal{O}$ acts on differential forms on $T^n$. Let $R$ be a smooth vector field on $T^n$, whose orbits are dense on $T^n$ (for instance, irrational flow on $T^2$). My question is: if $\mathcal{L}_R$ and $ \mathcal{O}$ commutes, does it imply $\mathcal{O}$ also commutes with all $n$ generators of torus action (namely $\partial_{\varphi_i}$ in coordinate)? I tested for example $n = 2$, and $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{L}_X$ for some smooth vector field $X$, and $R = p\partial_{\varphi_1} + q \partial_{\varphi_2}$ where $p$ and $q$ are co-irrational. Then $\mathcal{L}_R\mathcal{O}=\mathcal{O}\mathcal{L}_R$ implies $X$ can only has constant components and therefore must commute with $\partial_{\varphi_i}$. But I don't know how to generalize. Thank you! ================= Edit: as pointed out by Sergei Ivanov, the answer to original question is "No". Now let me put in a bit more assumptions. Put a standard flat metric on $T^n$, and let $R$ be also Killing, and $\partial_{\varphi_i}$ be generators of the isometry group. So I asked: does $\mathcal{O}$ commutes with the isometry group? 

To understand some physics problem, I want to know if there is (non-$L^2$ or $L^2$) solution to the Seiberg-Witten equation on $\mathbb{R}^4$ \begin{equation} {D}_A \psi = 0\\ F_A^+ = i\zeta\omega + \sigma(\psi) \end{equation} where $\zeta$ is a real number, and $\omega$ is the standard symplectic form on $\mathbb{R}^4$. I know that when $\zeta = 0$, a square-integrable solution would imply $\psi = 0$ everywhere, because by Weitzenbock formula \begin{equation} D_A^*{D_A}\psi = \nabla _A^*{\nabla _A}\psi + \frac{s}{4}\psi + \frac{1}{2}F_A^ + \psi \end{equation} and then using the S-W equation itself, one gets \begin{equation} \int {{{\left| {{\nabla _A}\psi } \right|}^2} + \frac{1}{4}{{\left| \psi \right|}^4} + \left( {i\zeta\omega \cdot \psi ,\psi } \right)} = - \frac{1}{4}\int {s{{\left| \psi \right|}^2}} \end{equation} which forces $\psi = 0$ when $s = \zeta = 0$ 

Question: Is there a classification of almost contact or contact structures on $S^3$? What is it and references? The motivation of this question is as follows: (1) There is one paper showing that a supersymmetric gauge theory can be defined on a 3-manifold $M$ for any almost contact structure that $M$ admits. (2) On String 2013 conference, there is a talk on supersymmetric partition functions in three dimension, which claims that they are invariants of almost contact structures. (3) Many papers have computed partition functions on $S^3$ with different metrics (with $U(1) \times U(1)$, $SU(2)\times U(1)$ and $SU(2) \times SU(2)$ isometries, with various auxiliary fields), and the results are all similar, with only one parameter call $b$. So it seems there is only 1-parameter family of almost contact structures on $S^3$, and I would like to know if that is the true story. Thank you! 

Is there an analog of the statement of "every 2d oriented surface is a complex manifold"? I saw a theorem in Blair's book, that "every 3d contact metric manifold is a strongly pseudo convex CR manifold". And we also know from Lutz and Martinet that every compact 3d manifold has a contact structure (and therefore a contact metric structure), it seems the analog would be "every compact 3-dimensional manifold is a strongly pseudo convex CR manifold". So my question is: 1) Is this the right analog? 2) Introductory/review references on the 3d analog of "pseudo-holomorphic curve in symplectic manifold" (for instance, references on how they are defined, basic properties, counting invariants analog to G-W invariants)? 

When I study 5-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetry, I came across such structure as follows. $(R, \kappa, \Phi, M)$ is an almost contact 5-manifold, such that \begin{equation} \kappa \left( R \right) = 1,\;\;\;\;\Phi R = \kappa \circ \Phi = 0,\;\;\;\;{\Phi ^2} = - 1 + \kappa \otimes R. \end{equation} Supersymmetry requires these quantities satisfy an extra condition: \begin{equation} {N_\Phi }\left( {X,Y} \right) + d\kappa \left( {\Phi X,\Phi Y} \right) = 0,\;\;\;\;\text{for} \; \kappa(X) = \kappa(Y) = 0\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(*) \end{equation} where ${N_\Phi }\left( {X,Y} \right) \equiv {\Phi ^2}\left[ {X,Y} \right] + \left[ {\Phi X,\Phi Y} \right] - \Phi \left[ {\Phi X,Y} \right] - \Phi \left[ {X,\Phi Y} \right]$. 1) If $d\kappa \left( {\Phi X,\Phi Y} \right) = d\kappa \left( {X,Y} \right) \Leftrightarrow \kappa \left( {\left[ {X,\Phi Y} \right] + \left[ {\Phi X,Y} \right]} \right) = 0$, then the structure is Cauchy-Riemann. 2) $(*)$ implies \begin{equation} \left[ {{X^{1,0}},{Y^{1,0}}} \right] = {Z^{1,0}} - d\kappa \left( {{X^{1,0}},{Y^{1,0}}} \right)R, \end{equation} which further implies ${\left( {d{\omega ^{0,1}}} \right)^{2,0}} = 0$, and therefore I naively think we have usual decomposition $d = d_V + \partial + \bar\partial$. 

I am reading Charles Nash's book on differential topology and QFT. In particular, I have question on the part calculating dimension of instanton moduli space. The question split into conceptual part and calculation part. In the book p235-236, the dimension problem is recast into cohomology problem: \begin{equation} \dim \mathcal{M} = \dim \frac{{\ker d_A^ - }}{{{\mathop{\rm Im}\nolimits} {d_A}}} \end{equation} and it is identified as the dimension of the second cohomology group of the complex \begin{equation} 0 \xrightarrow{\iota} \Gamma \left( {adP} \right)\xrightarrow{d_A} \Gamma \left( {{T^*}M \otimes adP} \right) \xrightarrow{d_A^- \equiv \pi^- d_A} \Gamma \left( {{\Lambda ^2}{T_-^*}M \otimes adP} \right) \xrightarrow{\pi^+} 0 \end{equation} with \begin{equation} {H^1} = \frac{{\ker {d_A}}}{{{\mathop{\rm Im}\nolimits} \iota }} = \ker {d_A},\;\;{H^2} = \frac{{\ker {\pi ^ - } \circ {d_A}}}{{{\mathop{\rm Im}\nolimits} {d_A}}},\;\;{H^3} = \frac{{\ker {\pi ^ + }}}{{{\mathop{\rm Im}\nolimits} {\pi ^ + } \circ {d_A}}} \end{equation} Now we need to argue $h^3 = 0$ (for self-dual manifold with positive scalar curvature). But my understanding is: ${\rm ker}\pi^+ = \Gamma \left( {\Lambda _ - ^2{T^*}M \otimes adP} \right)$ and the $H^3$ is just $\Gamma \left( {\Lambda _ - ^2{T^*}M \otimes adP} \right)/{\rm Im}d_A$. So $H^3$ tells us how many anti-self-dual forms there are which are NOT $d_A$-exct. (1) My feeling is that, among the many arbitrary anti-self-dual 2-forms, there must be some, right? Naively thinking, setting $A = 0$, there should be some anti-self-dual 2-form which is not even $d$-closed, let alone being $d$-exact. So how should I understand when imposing curvature condition, all these (rather easy to exist) forms are forbidden to exist? (2) The book compute the dimension $h^3$ by investigating the Laplacian \begin{equation} \Delta _A^{\left( 2 \right)} = d_A^ - {\left( {d_A^ - } \right)^\dagger } \end{equation} and the answer provided is \begin{equation} \Delta _A^{\left( 2 \right)} = \frac{1}{2}d_A^{\left( 1 \right)}{\left( {d_A^{\left( 1 \right)}} \right)^\dagger } + \frac{R}{6} - {W_ - } \end{equation} where $R$ is scalar curvature, $W_-$ is the anti-self-dual part of Weyl tensor. I tried to do this in coordinate: \begin{equation} {\Delta _A}\omega \sim\frac{1}{2}\left( {{D_m}{D^k}{\omega _{kn}} - {D_n}{D^k}{\omega _{km}}} \right) - \frac{{\sqrt g }}{2}{\epsilon _{mn}}^{pq}{D_p}{D^k}{\omega _{kq}} \end{equation} To produce curvature, I commute the $D^k$ with $D_m$ and $D_n$. There are a few terms, schematically ======================== OLD QUESTION ======================== (1) ${Ric_{m}}^l{\omega _{ln}}$ (2) ${R_{mknl}}{\omega ^{kl}}$ (3) $\pi^- d_A^\dagger d_A \omega$ (4) $D^kD_k\omega$ along with anti-symmetrization of $m$ and $n$, and anti-self-dual completion. However, non of the objects like scalar curvature and $d_A d_A^{\dagger}$ comes out. So I am wondering what has gone wrong? Or this is the right track and I should keep on expanding curvature into scalar, Ricci and Weyl tensor? ====================================================== ========================UPDATE======================== Expanding out curvature in terms of Ricci, Scalar, Weyl, the expression turns into basically of the form suggested by Nash with correct coefficient, except for the differential terms \begin{equation} = \frac{1}{2}\left[ {{D^k}\left( {{D_m}{\omega _{kn}} + {D_n}{\omega _{mk}}} \right) + {\rm{A.S.completion}}} \right] \end{equation} instead of $d_A d_A^\dagger$ in the book. It doesn't seem positive definite, which is a requirement for vanishing $h^2$: multiplying $\omega^{mn}$, integrated over $M$ and completing squares, the differential term seems to split into positive and negative term \begin{equation} \sim \int {{\omega ^{mn}}{D^k}\left( {{D_m}{\omega _{kn}} + {D_n}{\omega _{mk}} + {D_k}{\omega _{nm}}} \right) - \int {{D^k}{\omega ^{mn}}{D_k}{\omega _{mn}}} } +... \end{equation} where the 1st term is positive by partial integration, and ... denotes anti-self-dual completion. So again, Can some one points out what mistake I have made, or the differential term is secretly positive definite? 

Finally have time to update. After applying the projection operator, actually the $\pi^- d_A^* d_A$ merge with the original operator, and hence only positive-definite objets are left on the RHS, proving the statement form the book. 

In Hutchings and Taubes lecture note on Seiberg-Witten equation HERE, above equation (4.20) the authors claim that there is a version of Weitzenbock formula reads (where $\beta \in \Omega^{0,2}(M, E)$, M is a symplectic manifold with compatible $J$, $E$ is a line bundle with $U(1)$ connection $a$) \begin{equation} \int {{{\left| {\bar \partial _a^*\beta } \right|}^2}} = \frac{1}{2}\int {\left( {{{\left| {\nabla _a^*\beta } \right|}^2} - i\left\langle {\omega ,{F_a}} \right\rangle {{\left| \beta \right|}^2}} \right)} \end{equation} I try to prove it, by first guessing that it might come from something like a Kahler identity \begin{equation} {{\bar \partial }_a}\bar \partial _a^*\beta = \frac{1}{2}{\nabla _a}\nabla _a^*\beta + \left( {...} \right) \end{equation} and try to figure out if the ... matches the formula in the note. But I could not reproduce the result: the ... I got is of the form $\Lambda \left( {F_a^{2,0} \wedge \beta } \right)$, where $\Lambda = (\omega\wedge)^*$, and a (2,0)-piece of $F$ rather than a (1,1) piece shows up. So I wonder how to prove the Weitzenbock formula above? Any reference is welcome; I google for a while but may be I am not looking at the write place.
