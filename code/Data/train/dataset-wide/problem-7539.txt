A Grothendieck topology by definition consists of sieves – what Johnstone calls a sifted coverage – whereas a Grothendieck pretopology in any non-trivial case will contain a non-sieve. (Recall that $\lbrace \textrm{id} : X \to X \rbrace$ is always a covering family for $X$, but it is a sieve if and only if there are no morphisms $Y \to X$ for any $Y \ne X$.) Thus, in any case of interest, no topology is a pretopology and no pretopology is a topology. But siftedness is not the key difference between topologies and pretopologies. The key difference is saturation: as you are already aware, it is possible to add covering families to a pretopology without changing the category of sheaves. One can define the non-sifted analogue of a topology as a family of sinks satisfying the following axioms: 

If the hom-categories of $\mathfrak{K}$ are posets (and I mean partially ordered set, not preordered set) then definitions (1) – (4) coincide. This is because the only isomorphisms in a poset are the identities. 

Your claim is incorrect because you truncated the simplicial diagram too much. Indeed, if what you said were true, then the isomorphism class of a group would be determined by its cardinality, but this is obviously not true. What you are missing is the data that tells us about composition. We need to look at the diagram $$G_2 \mathrel{\hbox{$\begin{matrix} \smash{\rightarrow} \newline \smash{\rightarrow} \newline \smash{\rightarrow} \end{matrix}$}} G_1 \mathrel{\hbox{$\begin{matrix} \smash{\rightarrow} \newline \smash{\leftarrow} \newline \smash{\rightarrow} \end{matrix}$}}G_0$$ where $G_2$ is the set of composable pairs of morphisms in $\mathcal{G}$, and the arrows are the evident face and degeneracy operators of the nerve of $\mathcal{G}$. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the pseudocolimit of this diagram. By definition, that means the exponential $[\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}]$ is isomorphic to the pseudolimit of the following diagram: $$[G_2, \mathcal{D}] \mathrel{\hbox{$\begin{matrix} \smash{\leftarrow} \newline \smash{\leftarrow} \newline \smash{\leftarrow} \end{matrix}$}} [G_1, \mathcal{D}] \mathrel{\hbox{$\begin{matrix} \smash{\leftarrow} \newline \smash{\rightarrow} \newline \smash{\leftarrow} \end{matrix}$}} [G_0, \mathcal{D}]$$ There is a natural comparison functor $[\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{D}] \to [\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D}]$, and if you squint for a while you will see that it is (half of) an equivalence of categories (though usually not an isomorphism). Thus $\mathcal{G}$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{C}$. 

Let $x_1,\dots,x_n$ be a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $\mathcal{O}_1 ,\dots, \mathcal{O}_m$ denote a set of polyhedral obstacles. What is the name for the surfaces that describe the boundaries of a Voronoi tessellation of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with respect to the points $x_i$, using the shortest-path metric induced by the obstacles? By comparison, in $\mathbb{R}^2$, it is easy to show that the boundaries of a Voronoi tesselation are hyperbolic arcs. 

Suppose I have a collection of points $p_1,\dots,p_N$ in the plane. In the Euclidean $k$-medians (or $k$-means) problems, our objective is to distribute a set of $k$ points $x_1,\dots,x_k$ in the plane so as to minimize the distances (or squares of distances) to the points $p_i$, i.e. to minimize the quantity $\sum_{i=1}^{N} \min_j \| x_j - p_i \|$ (I am not requiring that the $x_j$'s be a subset of the $p_i$'s; they can lie anywhere in the plane). Obviously this problem has many practical applications. My question is: let's suppose we impose some constraints on the first or second moments of $x_1,\dots,x_k$, i.e. require that $\frac{1}{k}\sum_j x_j = x_0$ for some fixed point $x_0$, or that $\frac{1}{k} \sum_j \|x_j - \bar{x}\|^2 \leq S^2$ for some given threshold $S^2$. Is there any conceivable practical scenario where this might arise? I am not asking for assistance in solving this problem -- I'm really just interested in any thoughts on contexts where it might occur. 

Suppose I'd like to distribute a set of points $P=\lbrace p_1 ,\dots, p_n \rbrace$ in the unit square $S=[0,1]\times[0,1]$ to minimize a weighted sum of two things: 1) The average distance between a uniformly selected point in $S$ and its nearest neighbor in $P$, i.e. $D_{avg}(P) = \iint_S \min_i\lbrace\|x-p_i\|\rbrace dA $ , and 2) The sum of the edge lengths in a Delaunay triangulation of $P$, notated $DT(P)$, so that my problem can be written as $\mathrm{minimize}_P ~ D_{avg}(P) +\phi DT(P)$ for some scalar $\phi$. Let's suppose that we can also choose the number of points in $P$ as well. My question is: as $\phi\rightarrow0$, is the optimal solution $P^*$ going to be a honeycomb lattice? The honeycomb conjecture, $URL$ , would appear to suggest that the answer to my question would be "yes" if, instead of using a Delaunay triangulation, we took the sum of the edges of a Voronoi diagram of $P$, but even that will probably require quite a bit of work. 

Forgive me if this is a well-known observation/result, but I'm quite new to graduate-level algebra and I was wondering if there are generalisations of the constructions I describe below. It's straightforward to see that the functor "adjoin an indeterminate to a ring" is the unit of the adjunction $F : \mathbf{Ring} \to \mathbf{Ring}_* : U$, where $U: \mathbf{Ring}_* \to \mathbf{Ring}$ is the forgetful functor from the category of pointed rings to the category of rings. Along similar lines, the functor "disjoint-union an element to a set" is the unit of the adjunction $F : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}_* : U$, and if I'm not mistaken, the functor "coproduct with $\mathbb{Z}$" is the unit of the adjunction $F : \mathbf{Grp} \to \mathbf{Grp}_* : U$. Indeed, in general, it seems that if a category has a notion of "free object on one generator", a notion of "pointed" objects, and binary coproducts, then the forgetful functor from the category of pointed objects has a left adjoint, and the unit of the adjunction is the functor which takes objects to their coproduct with the free object on one generator. 

One can show that every pretopology is contained in a unique such saturated coverage, and every saturated coverage contains a unique topology – just pick out the sieves! 

In fact, if we replace $\lnot A$ by $A \to q$, then the above derives $p \to ((p \to q) \to q)$ from axioms K and S. It's not surprising that this is derivable from K and S alone: it is easy to verify that $\lambda x . \lambda y . y x$ is a lambda term of the required type. 

My question is just as in the box. Is every smooth projective toric variety diffeomorphic to a quotient of $\prod_i S^{n_i} \times T^k$ (I know torus is a one-sphere but I just wanted to make clear I allow this) by a free torus action? If not which ones can be realized like this? Maybe it can be proven using the Geometric Invariant theory construction. Namely, when is the fiber of the corresponding torus action on $\mathbb{C}^l$ diffeomorphic to the one of the above spaces? 

Let P be a lattice polytope and lying in $ N \times {1} \subset N \times \mathbb{R}$. Let $\sigma$ be the cone over this polytope and $X_\sigma$ be the corresponding toric variety, which is an affine,Gorenstein, toric variety. Is there a simple algorithm for computing the ring of global sections of the structure sheaf on X_{\sigma}? I would like the presentation in terms of generators and relations if possible. If this is not possible in general, I would be happy if this is possible under some nice, fairly general situation. Thank you for your help. I suppose a different version of this question is: Are there computer programs which are freely available and which can make these computations quickly? 

Is there an elementary description of the affinization of the algebraic cotangent bundle of $CP^n$? I know that it can be described as some sort coadjoint orbits, but I am interested in a translation of that to concrete equations. Is it correct that the cotangent bundle can be obtained from the affinization by a blowup at a point? If the general equations are too complicated, I would be interested in some low dimensional examples such as n=2,3... 

I believe the full details, along the lines of what domotorp posted, are provided in "Reconstructing sets of orthogonal line segments in the plane" by Rendl and Woeginger. From the abstract, "We show that reconstructing a set of $n$ orthogonal line segments in the plane from the set of their vertices can be done in $O(n log n)$ time, if the segments are allowed to cross. If the segments are not allowed to cross, the problem becomes NP-complete." The authors give a reduction to planar 3-SAT that uses points on an integer lattice, which I believe is the setting you're interested in. 

Linear programs with this many variables are solved all the time using column generation: $URL$ In your problem, let variable $q_k$ denote the probability of using permutation $\pi_k$, and let variable $p_{ij}$ denote the marginal probability that agent $i$ is assigned to $j$, so you have a total of $n! + n^2$ variables. Let $\pi_k(i,j) = 1$ if agent $i$ is assigned to position $j$ in permutation $k$ and zero otherwise. We can relate the $p_{ij}$'s and $q_k$'s via $n^2$ constraints of the form $\sum_k q_k \pi_k(i,j) = p_{ij} \forall i,j$ Now, assume as Kevin did that $\sum_i v_i = \sum_j b_j = 1$. Your equity criterion is just $\sum_j p_{ij} v_j = b_i \forall i$. We obviously must require that $q_k \geq 0$ for all $k$. Thus the feasible set of these permutations can be written as: $\sum_k q_k = 1$ $p_{ij} = \sum_k q_k \pi_k (i,j) \forall i,j$ $q_k \geq 0 \forall k$ $\sum_j p_{ij} v_j = b_i \forall i$ There are a total of $1 + n^2 + n$ equality constraints and $n!$ inequality constraints, and you have $n! + n^2$ variables. Any basic feasible solution of this set (i.e. a corner point) therefore must have $n! - (n+1)$ of the inequality constraints active, which means that the corner points have only $n+1$ nonzero $q_k$'s. Thus, if your problem is feasible at all for particular choices of $v$ and $b$, it's possible to find such a set of assignments using at most $n+1$ possible permutations. You may gain further insight by looking at the dual of this LP -- the primal problem above has $n^2 + n!$ variables, $1 + n^2 + n$ equality constraints, and $n!$ inequality constraints, so its dual will have $n^2 + n!$ constraints, but only $1 + n^2 + n$ variables. Those constraints should have a nice structure to them (something like, one constraint for each permutation, and that constraint sums over all nonzero $\pi_k(i,j)$'s or something), which would give you a polynomial-time separation oracle for solving the dual LP. There may likely be a way to recover a primal solution from the dual using complementary slackness. 

I have a naive question I am asking. Given a higher geometric stack X in the sense of Simpson, Toen etc is it true that there is an affinization Spec Gamma(O_X) such that Hom(X, Spec(A))= Hom(A,Gamma(O_X)) for every affine scheme Spec(A)? Or does this require some more hypotheses. I have very much a hard time finding this out. 

Edit: I realize the mathematics below is lacking a precise phrasing. I hope that the intuitiion behind the question is clear enough that a reader will understand the question and provide guidance. The question is essentially to what extent a degeneration of tropical curves reflects an actual degeneration of complex tropical curves in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ More precisely, On page 10 of his paper, $URL$ Mikhalkin discusses the degeneration of a smooth tropical curve to a nodal tropical curve. Given such a local degeneration, which we assume occurs in a one dimensional real family paramaterized by $t$, via some reconstruction process, we can associate for each $t$ an actual hypersurface in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ (either a curve in some degenerated complex structure or a complex tropical curve), whose tropicalization is the tropical curve $\Pi_t$. Is it true that the limiting curve over the nodal tropical curve is nodal? To be more demanding, can one associate to this degeneration in a canonical way a fibration of curves in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$, $H_t \to Spec(\mathbb{C}[\tau,\tau^{-1}])$ such that one fiber has a nodal curve and the rest of the fibers are smooth? The following example makes me believe this may be possible: In the local model corresponding to Mikhalkin's example, we may consider the family of hypersurfaces: $$\tau+x+y+xy $$ when $\tau$ is not $0,1$, the smooth tropical curve is a smooth deformation retract of the amoebaas of curves in this family. The singular tropical is the (tropical) amoeba of: $$ 1+x+y+xy=(1+x)(1+y) $$ 

I have come across the following result regarding equitable division of a resource, which is a simple and immediate consequence of linear programming complementarity (in the infinite-dimensional case). I strongly suspect that it is a special case of some other well-known principle, perhaps in a related field such as economics or even geography, but as of yet I have not found any helpful leads. Can anyone suggest any results from which the statement below is a consequence? Any other leads will also be appreciated. Let $R$ denote a contiguous resource (such as a piece of land) that is to be divided into $n$ pieces $R_1,\dots,R_n$ among $n$ agents (so agent $i$ gets piece $R_i$). Suppose that each agent has a continuous "utility density" function $u_i(x)>0$ defined on $R$ and that $R$ also has a continuous "population density" $f(x)>0$ defined on it. The total "utility" that agent $i$ receives is then $\iint_{R_i} f(x)u_i(x) dx$. One might consider the problem of choosing $R_1,\dots,R_n$ as "equitably" as possible, say by maximizing the minimum utility of the agents: $\text{maximize}_{R_1,\dots,R_n}\lbrace\min_i \iint_{R_i} f(x)u_i(x) dx\rbrace$ subject to $\bigcup_i R_i = R$ and $R_i \cap R_j = \emptyset \text{ for all }i\neq j$ It is easy to verify that, at the optimal solution $R_1^*,\dots,R_n^*$, all of the agents' utilities are equal. Now, define $q_i^* := \iint_{R_i^*} f(x) dx$ (the population of the $i$th optimal piece), and consider the problem of choosing regions to maximize the total utilities of the agents, but under a logarithmic utility function, and imposing constraints on the populations in each piece: $\text{maximize}_{R_1,\dots,R_n}\lbrace\sum_i \iint_{R_i} f(x)\log(u_i(x)) dx\rbrace$ subject to $\iint_{R_i} f(x) dx = q_i^*$ $\bigcup_i R_i = R$ and $R_i \cap R_j = \emptyset \text{ for all }i\neq j$ It is not hard to show that the solution to this problem is the same as the solution to the original problem. I have uploaded a MATLAB script that demonstrates this principle using cvx at $URL$ if anyone is interested.
