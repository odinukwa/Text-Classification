The formula for orbital speed is $$v = \sqrt{\frac{G\cdot m_P}{r}}$$ Rearranging, the formula for orbital height is $$h = \frac{G \cdot m_P}{v^2} - R_P$$ Where $G$ is a constant. The mass of the planet is $m_P$. The orbital velocity in $\frac{m}{s}$ is $v$. The radius of the planet is $R_P$. And that gives you the height above ground as $h$. But what you actually want here is to calculate the orbital height purely in terms of the orbital period, not the velocity. $$h = \sqrt[3]{\frac{G\cdot m_P \cdot t^2}{4\pi^2}} - R_P$$ You describe the planet as half the mass and radius of earth. You give the orbital period as sixty seconds. So that gives us $$h = -1.6\cdot 10^6 m$$ So this would be about 1600 kilometers below ground. I think that we can safely say that this is not feasible. 

Why would you choose a ring (or torus) over a tube (or cylinder)? First, you would choose either over other shapes because they spin. If you're not spinning, there's no point in either shape. This is why the International Space Station (ISS) is neither tube nor ring. It's just a bunch of modules stuck together. It's a little closer to a tube shape, but it's actually shaped more like a series of buildings connected by tunnels. So the main reason to choose a ring or tube is because you can spin them. The fictional Deep Space 9 (DS9) has the same problems as an example as the ISS. It looks a bit like a ring, but it actually isn't one. People live in the center of DS9, not on the edges. This is because DS9 doesn't have to spin to create gravity. It has artificial gravity that works in a way unknown to our physics. If we do build ring shaped space habitats, it is unlikely that they will look like DS9. They will have more on the edges and less in the middle. The primary advantage of a ring is that it can be smaller than a tube for the same radius. You want to maximize the radius because gravity is generated by the illusion of centrifugal force, that is force away from the center of the spin. This is actually a fictitious force, as the real forces are inertial (in the direction of the spin) and centripetal (from the floor keeping you from following the inertial force). Increasing the radius reduces the side effects of the spin (e.g. the Coriolis effect). For a small radius, you are constantly changing direction. A larger radius makes the change of direction more gradual. It's easier to make a ring that uses less atmosphere. You can make a tube with another tube inside it, but for a similar expenditure of material, you could make a larger radius ring. The rings are generally shown with a center that is either hollow or contains spokes. You could make a disc instead of a ring, but that would have a lot of unused atmosphere in the middle. We can guess that rings are cheaper in atmosphere while cylinders are cheaper in structural material. There is some reason to believe that structural material is easier to obtain in space than atmosphere. In particular, we can mine the asteroid belt for structural material while we'd have to mine comets, moons, or planets for atmosphere. After Earth, Venus is the closest planet. Everything else is at Jupiter's orbit or farther. Comets can come closer but they are small and move comparatively quickly. So we'd spend a lot of energy to match speeds. Saturn's rings might be the best source, but they are far away and still partly in the gravity well. The ring provides more structure. Note that the spin will affect objects that are attached to the "ground" or floor most, then objects that rest on the floor, and will affect things like atmosphere the least. The obvious result would be that the side of a building that faces into the spin would have a thicker atmosphere than the sides or the leeward portion. How much of a problem will that be? What kind of weather side effects would occur? It would be easier to run an elevator from point to point on a ring, as there's already structure there (the spokes of the ring). It would be more difficult with a cylinder, as you'd have to create the structure for the elevator. Cylinders are more compact though, so it might be easier to run a shorter track along the edge of a cylinder than to run through the middle of a ring. You could also fly in a cylinder. A ring would likely be forced to use artificial light. Rings have too much structure to work well with windows. A cylinder can be constructed such that windows let in light regularly. Unfortunately their rotation speed doesn't support a day/night cycle, so it's unclear if we'd do this. We might be able to give a night cycle by "shutting" the windows. This is either an advantage of cylinders or irrelevant. Perhaps both use artificial illumination. The real truth is that we don't know whether we'd prefer a ring to a cylinder. Unfortunately, we've never had the resources to try either of them. Our current International Space Station doesn't have artificial gravity. We don't have any real understanding of when the simplicity of the wider ring of the cylinder outweighs the advantage of a decreasing side effects from a greater radius. We have no experience of how either would impact atmospheric effects. Our best guess is that we'd start with rings, as they are easier to build for smaller capacity. As our needs increased, we'd switch to cylinders, as it is easier to move from point to point on them. So for something big enough to be a city, it is more likely that it would be cylindrical. But that remains speculation at this point, as we have no experience with either. 

Children of the Grey become officers in the military or the police. Children of current members of the military or the police may become officers as well, although most would stay in the ranks. Officers are expected to exemplify the ascetic nature of the Grey. Everyone else can join the military or the police but few slots are available. When a member of the Grey dies, one of the officers is chosen as a replacement. This might be a child of the Grey, of an officer, or of someone from the ranks. This keeps the Grey on top. It gives them strong roots in the military and police. It allows for merit-based promotion. It does not allow for quick promotion, such that someone would have to live the ascetic lifestyle for years to reach the Grey. This would be hard for someone to fake for that length of time, particularly as their schooling would also have been monitored by the Grey. So a non-believer would likely be dismissed early. People in the everyone else category can not themselves join the Grey. They can only join the military or police ranks. Their children can potentially join the Grey. 

Space elevator Just to clarify the other answers, the requirement is that the counterweight has to be past the aerostationary orbit level. That makes it attempt to pull the rest of the cable up and away from Mars. There are basically two approaches, although a combination is certainly possible. 

Destroyed art It would make more sense to go back and fetch destroyed artworks than commodities. Show up the day of the fire or whatever and just steal them. The whole world gains a unique piece of art. And if you make a bit of money out of the deal, that's just gravy. Crafted goods The reason why this works is that art is worth more than its components. Often a lot more. Rather than commodities, move crafted goods. Use modern machining to craft goods better than what can be produced in the past. Sell those. You don't even need improved alloys, although taking a steel sword back to the bronze age is likely to provide good returns. A weapon fit for a king (or his bodyguard or best soldier). Knowledge is lighter than commodities Why carry goods? The easiest thing for a time traveler to take back in time is knowledge. It costs no mass, and it carries high value. As an example, it is trivial to look up the locations of diamond and gold mines. Or oil fields. Buy the land in the past with partners who can manage the actual mining or drilling. Set up a trust that invests the profits for you. Collect the money in the future after compounding has made it much more valuable. You don't need time travel to carry wealth forward. Compounding value will produce better results. You only need to time travel wealth back. 

$$ 5 \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{s}} * 86400 \frac{\text{s}}{\text{day}} $$ $$ 432,000 \frac{\text{m}^3}{\text{day}} * 1000 \frac{\text{l}}{\text{m}^3} * 1 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{l}} $$ $$ 432 \text{ million} \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{day}} / 6 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{day}} $$ That's food for seventy-two million pigs, roughly a sixth of all the pigs currently slaughtered in Europe per year. Note: I assumed that it takes twice as much soup per weight to feed pigs as dry feed. So I'd pick a high mountain and let soup flow in a river from the top. Create offshoots so as to allow more room for the pigs to eat. End in a big marsh/lake. Add power generation as well, using turbines to generate electricity. At the beginning, package some of the soup for human consumption. It's enough to just stick a pipe into the flow. You might want to build a building around it to protect the early flow from the elements. Build a spigot into the building so people can just walk up and draw some soup for themselves. I'm sure that someone else will come up with a better answer later, but hopefully this makes the scale clearer. 

According to an answer to a previous question, it is possible to support one person per 800 $m^2$. Converting that to square kilometers, we get 1250 people. Converting to square miles, about 3200 people. Roughly half the world's land is used for farming, as per National Geographic. So cut that down to 1600 people. Let's assume that the original estimate was generous. We have 1000 people per square mile. Assuming people have to walk to their farms from a central, fortified town, that gives us a community size with a three mile radius or roughly twenty-eight square miles. This is because it takes about an hour to walk three miles. And a daily commute length of an hour each way is feasible. So roughly 28,000 people in the community. This gives us an upper community size of 28,000. To support a larger community, it would need to trade with smaller communities. It would have to offer something for which people would trade food that they couldn't just build themselves. And it would have to be something that they would need continuously. Otherwise the large community would starve as soon as it ran out of communities with whom to trade. Some communities may be able to survive longer if they are powered by nuclear or renewable fuels and have access to stored frozen food. But that won't work perpetually. Eventually the food stores will run out. For longer term survival, they need to find new food sources. The same problem applies with scavenging food. That can work for the first year or two, but after that the food will have spoiled. Certainly anything that is served fresh. But even things that are canned will run out eventually. If you wait long enough, the cans will fail. They can rupture after getting too hot or too cold. Or the steel rusts away. Post-apocalypse survival favors small, distributed communities over large central communities. For defensive purposes, a three mile radius might be too large. If it takes an hour of hard marching to respond to an attack, then attackers can do significant damage to the crops before being repelled. 

First, hire a lawyer. For purposes of this answer, assume that the lawyer operates under American rules (as I know them better). Feel free to adjust advice to fit a Czech lawyer if that works better for you. Grant a wish to the lawyer in compensation for her services (assuming a female lawyer for ease of pronouns). She can retire if she pays for a replacement lawyer. Have the lawyer approach an organization like Make-a-Wish and tell them that she represents a rich client who would like to participate. Her client is quirky though and would prefer to acquire the items himself and donate the whole item to the child. They say that they fulfill one wish every thirty-seven minutes. Since you only need one a day, you should easily be able to cover your daily wish requirement. The lawyer is bound to client confidentiality, so she doesn't reveal your secret. The charity just thinks that you are rich and eccentric. Because this creates a variety of things, it should be less economically distorting than giving just one thing, like a pile of gold. You're doing good with your wishes. The wishes come as English statements, which is acceptable under your limitations. If necessary, you should be able to get the wishes directly from the children. The lawyer can help them with phrasing. If you need money, have the lawyer recruit someone to buy something from you. I'd try destroyed artwork. Again, this should be only mildly distorting of the economy. It depresses demand for artwork slightly but otherwise just shifts the money from someone who doesn't need it to you. 

That fits more with what I would expect from an iDevice: a simple interface that hides the complexity from the user. Dirty dishes go in one slot; clean dishes loaded with food come out another. You could even have a mobile device like a cart. Fresh food is on the top of the cart. Dirty dishes go on the bottom. It trundles around the kitchen table. People dump their dirty dishes and grab the next course when ready. It gathers more food and dumps off dirty dishes as needed. An android waiter might be a future alternative to the cart. 

As a general rule, setting a defined value for money tends to struggle later. It usually works better to let the market sort it out. So it wouldn't be ten tokens per day is what everyone agrees per se. As such, I'm unconvinced that ten tokens would count the same for both physical and magical labor. The value of a magical token in physical labor would be based on whether it is easier to do some tasks magically or physically. If all tasks are easier to do magically (i.e. one wizard day is more productive than one physical day), then the currency value would fluctuate until they came into balance. Perhaps one token would equal a day's wages for physical work. Or it might equal a week's wages. It all depends on how common magic is. If you don't allow magical and physical labor to fluctuate against each other, you're likely to have two problems. One, the labor that should be more valuable but isn't will be reluctant to work for others. Why trade for less than your worth? Two, black markets will arise that trade labor at closer to their actual worth. The only way that you can get magical and physical labor into rough equivalence would be for everyone to be wizards. Then each person would be choosing either magical or physical labor. In that setup, magical and physical labor would naturally tend to equivalence as being out of balance would favor one over the other. Short of that, magical labor is almost certainly going to be more valuable. Otherwise, no one would do magic. If the tokens are magical batteries, then there is some loss from having people maintain a supply of tokens rather than just using the magic for whatever. This would be no worse though than the more common system of people digging holes in the ground just to get materials to make money. Yes, it would be better with paper money, but who'd trust that? Eventually they'll make the switch as banking improves, but the magical tokens are no worse than any other commodity money. In fact, they're better than some, as it's much more direct to switch a wizard's magical output from general magic work to currency production than it is to have someone open a new mine. The magical switch will work regardless. Opening a new mine means finding the right place to dig, which is non-trivial. Mining tends to follow boom and bust cycles. Find a new mine. Production is great: boom. An older mine's vein runs out: bust. During booms, people have plenty of money to look for new mines, which multiplies the boom. During busts, they cut back on looking for new mines, which reinforces the bust. It's also worth noting that the money supply would be more stable than with most commodity money. You wouldn't get the same sudden gluts of money as used to occur when new mines were found or gold was stolen from someone else (think of the Spanish with the Aztecs and Incas). Inflation would be more self-regulating. If money drops in value, then wizards would switch to magical work. Or if money increases (deflation), then wizards would switch from other work to producing currency.
