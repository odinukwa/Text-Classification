(OR, symmetrically, all $q$s and $p$s swapped.) $\DeclareMathOperator{\lcm}{lcm}$ Now let $u = \lcm(p_1, p_2)$ and $v = \lcm(p_3, p_4)$. We can then build these rectangles: 

[1] Wagon, Stan, Fourteen proofs of a result about tiling a rectangle, Am. Math. Mon. 94, 601-617 (1987). ZBL0691.05011. 

When we have the last case, we cannot build 3 rectangles from our set such that no pairs have common factors among either their widths or heights, since for every three rectangles 2 share a factor along either width or height. So we can never apply Theorem 3. (However, we can say slightly more. I have not worked out the details of this exactly, but sometimes you can tile every rectangle with width of a certain factor for sufficiently large heights.) 

Here is one way to construct a counterexample. Start with an unoriented cycle with a cyclic automorphism group (of order $\geq$ 3) generated by an automorphism $\varphi$. Insert arrows at vertices $a$ and $b=\varphi(a)$ pointing to new vertices $v$ and $w$ respectively. 

Such a characterization was already given in the paper where standardly stratified algebras were first defined: 

In this answer I freely use results and notation from the book you refer to. Let me know if I need to fill in more details. Let $U=\operatorname{Ext}^1_A(T,N)$. We can assume $\operatorname{pd}_B (U)=n>2$ since the statement holds trivially for smaller values. Let $$0 \rightarrow \Omega_B U \rightarrow P_B \rightarrow U \rightarrow 0$$ be the first step in a projective $B$-resolution of $U$. Since $N \in \mathcal F(T)$, we have $U \otimes_B T=0$ and $\operatorname{Tor}^B_1(U,T) \cong N$ as $A$-modules. Therefore, when we apply $- \otimes_B T$ to the sequence above, we obtain an exact sequence of $A$-modules $$0 \rightarrow N \rightarrow \Omega_B(U) \otimes_B T \rightarrow T' \rightarrow 0,$$ where $T'$ is in $\operatorname{add}T$. The module $\Omega_B(U)$ is in the category $\mathcal Y(T)$ since it is a submodule of a projective $B$-module. There is an exact equivalence $- \otimes_B T \colon \mathcal Y(T) \rightarrow \mathcal T(T)$, and therefore $$\operatorname{pd}_A (\Omega_B(U) \otimes_B T) \geq \operatorname{pd}_B (\Omega_B(U))=n-1>1.$$ Since $\operatorname{pd}_A (T') \leq 1$, it follows from the exact sequence that $$\operatorname{pd}_A(N)=\operatorname{pd}_A (\Omega_B(U) \otimes_B T).$$ Combining with the previous inequality we get $$\operatorname{pd}_A(N) \geq \operatorname{pd}_B (U)-1$$ which proves the statement. 

Applying this to my example problem using the tile set $6\times 6$, $10 \times 10$, and $15 \times 15$, we can form partitions several ways; one way is $\{ 6\times 6, 10\times 10\}$ and $\{15 \times 15\}$, giving us tileable rectangles have either width with a factor of 2, or height with a factor of 16. $r = 2, s = 15$. Other ways of partitioning gives us other conditions; there are 6 in total (here, $m$ and $n$ are the width and height of the rectangle we wish to tile): 

For case 1 and 3 we can therefor tile any sufficiently large rectangle, and for case 2 at least one of the sides must have a certain factor (and therefor there are some rectangles, however large, we cannot tile). The proof of this is a bit tedious. We can use induction on the number of rectangles in the tile set. The base case for $n = 3$ is is discussed above. The rest is just confirming that adding a rectangle to a set that satisfy one of the three cases will lead to a set that will also follow one of these three cases. (It's tedious because the new rectangle can share factors in various ways with the existing set). The only tricky bit is dealing with case 3. The basic idea is, supposing the other cases don't hold, that there are four rectangles $R_1, \cdots, R_4$, that satisfy: 

Fáry's theorem says that every finite simple planar graph admits a planar embedding with straight line edges. For which $(k,d)$ is it true that every finite $k$-dimensional simplicial complex embeddable in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has an embedding which is linear on every face? It is true when $d \ge 2k+1$ by putting things in general position. I am especially interested to know if anything is known about the case $(k,d)=(2,3)$. I vaguely remember an old conjecture of Branko Grünbaum that every triangulation of the torus admitting a "straight" embedding in $\mathbb{R}^3$ but I don't know a reference (or whether this is still open). 

One observation which may be relevant: If $n < 2d$, then every pair of vertices has a common facet. One can use this to show that the general Hirsch conjecture reduces to the $n \ge 2d$ case, (see Ziegler's book Lectures on Polytopes, p. 84). But this doesn't seem to answer the question here. 

This is probably just a mistake in the preprint. If you look at the corresponding paragraph in the published version Claus Michael Ringel, MR 1128706 The category of modules with good filtrations over a quasi-hereditary algebra has almost split sequences, Math. Z. 208 (1991), no. 2, 209--223.), the category ${\mathscr F}(\Theta)$ is defined differently. Quote: 

Yes, it is possible. (So the answer to the question in the title is no.) Consider the ring $$A = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbb Q & \mathbb R \\ 0 & \mathbb Q \end{bmatrix}.$$ It has primitive idempotents $e=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $f=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.$ Now $J=AeA$ is a heredity ideal and there is a heredity chain $0 \subseteq J \subseteq A$. As an $A$-module $J$ has a direct sum decomposition $$J=AeAe \oplus AeAf.$$ The first summand is isomorphic to $Ae$. The second summand decomposes further into infinitely many direct summands, each isomorphic to $Ae$, the sum indexed by a $\mathbb Q$-basis for $\mathbb R$. 

It seems that many, if not almost all, of the properties studied in graph theory are monotone. (Property means it is invariant under permutation of vertices, and monotone means that the property is either preserved under addition or deletion of edges, fixing the vertex set.) For example: connected, planar, triangle-free, bipartite, etc. Many quantitative graph invariants can also be considered monotone graph properties, e.g. chromatic number $\ge k$ or girth $\ge g$. 

By "a triangulation of $X$", I mean a simplicial complex whose geometric realization is homeomorphic to $X$. Tutte showed that the number of combinatorially distinct triangulations $t(n)$ of the $2$-dimensional sphere on $n+3$ vertices is asymptotically given by $$t(n) \approx \frac{1}{16} \sqrt{\frac{3}{2 \pi}}n^{-5/2} \left( \frac{256}{27} \right)^n.$$ What is known about the number of combinatorially distinct triangulations $t(n,g)$ of the genus $g$ surface? (1) It seems likely to me that for fixed $g$, the growth is still roughly exponential, and maybe even $$ t(n,g) = \exp \left( c_1 n + c_2 \log n + c_3 + o(1) \right)$$ for some constants $c_1, c_2, c_3 \in \mathbb{R}$ which only depend on $g$. For example in the case $g=0$, Tutte's result gives that $c_1 = 256 / 27$, $c_2= -5 / 2$, and $c_3 = \log \left( \frac{1}{16} \sqrt{\frac{3}{2 \pi}} \right)$. Is the growth of $T(n,g)$ always exponential in $n$, and if so can we at least compute the base of the exponent $c_1$ for higher $g$? Updated: The rooted version of this question is answered in the paper: Z.-C. Gao. The number of rooted triangular maps on a surface. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 52(2):236 – 249, 1991. For fixed genus $g$, Gao establishes strong results along the lines of the above. (2) At the other extreme, is anything known about the rate of growth of $t(n,g)$ as $n \to \infty$ if $g \approx cn^2$ for some constant $0 < c< 1/12$? (3) Finally, let $T(n)$ be the total number of combinatorial types of triangulated surfaces on $n$ vertices. What is the rate of growth of $T(n)$ as $n \to \infty$? Updated: What I would really like to know is if we can not establish the rate of growth of $T(n)$, is there at least an upper bound of order $$T(n) = n^{o(n)}?$$ Or let $\tilde{T}(n)$ denote the number of labelled triangulated surfaces on $n$ vertices. Is it true that $$\tilde{T}(n) = n^{n+o(n)}?$$ Since $\tilde{T}(n) \le n! T(n)$, the second inequality would follow from the first. Gao's results give that if we assume that the genus $g$ is bounded, then we get the stronger bound $$T(n) = n^{O(n /\log n),}$$ but I still don't know how to handle $g$ growing with $n$. 

An idempotent $u$ is called primitive if the equation of idempotents $$(1-u)x=0$$ has a unique non-zero solution $x=u$. The primitive idempotents in $R$ are $\chi_{\{a\}}$ for $a \in (-1,1)$ and $\chi_{(-\infty,-1]}$ and $\chi_{[1,+\infty)}$. For ease of notation give two last mentioned primitive idempotents index $-1$ and $1$ respectively. The primitive idempotents in $S$ are indexed by $a \in \mathbb R$. A ring isomorphism $\phi \colon R \rightarrow S$ would then define a bijection $\tilde \phi \colon [-1,1] \rightarrow \mathbb R$. Let $A=\tilde \phi^{-1}(\mathbb Q) \subseteq [-1,1]$, where $\mathbb Q$ denotes the rational numbers. Then $\chi_A$ is an idempotent in $R$ with the property that $\chi_A \cdot \chi_{\{a\}} \neq 0$ for all $a \in A$ and $\chi_A \cdot \chi_{\{a\}}= 0$ for all $a \in [-1,1] \smallsetminus A$. The idempotent $\phi(\chi_A) \in S$ must be of the form $\chi_B$ for some $B \subseteq \mathbb R$. We must have $$\chi_B \cdot \chi_{\{\tilde \phi(a)\}}=\phi(\chi_A \cdot \chi_{\{a\}}) \neq 0$$ for all $a \in A$ and $$\chi_B \cdot \chi_{\{\tilde \phi(a)\}}=\phi(\chi_A \cdot \chi_{\{a\}}) = 0$$ for all $a \in [-1,1] \smallsetminus A$. Therefore $B$ contains all the rational numbers and no numbers that are not rational. But $\chi_{\mathbb Q}$ is not an element of $S$ and we reach a contradiction. Therefore there is no ring isomorphism $\phi \colon R \rightarrow S$. 

Update This is the situation for tile sets with 4 or more rectangles: Theorem 6 For a set of 4 or more rectangles, one of the following is true: 

This completes the "for sufficiently large" and "has a factor" type characterization; of course there is still what happens if the rectangles we wish to tile is not sufficiently large, or they do have the required factors (since these does not guarantee a tiling exists). 

We can select from the set 3 rectangles such that $\gcd(p_i, p_j) = \gcd(q_i, q_j)$ for $i \neq j$. We can partition the set as in Theorem 5. We select four rectangles that can tile any sufficiently large rectangle. 

For every tree on $n$ vertices, there are exactly $4 \times 3^{n-1}$ $4$-colorings. This follows from the fact that its chromatic polynomial is $t(t-1)^{n-1}$. (Or by induction since every tree with at least one edge has a "leaf.")

(1) The Computational Homology Project offers free software CHomP that will compute homology of simplicial complexes, at least with finite field coefficients. (2) Dionysus, from the computational topology group at Stanford, is good for computing persistent homology of Rips and Cech complexes, etc. This might be especially useful, for example, if you had points sampled from a manifold. (3) Afra Zomorodian has apparently recently written some code for computing homology of clique (i.e. flag) complexes very quickly and with small memory requirement by going through calculations involving simplicial sets, but I don't know if the code can compute homology of arbitrary simplicial sets, and (more importantly) I don't know if the code is publicly available. 

The three altitudes of a triangle intersect in a common point, the orthocenter of the triangle. This does not generalize to tetrahedra and higher-dimensional simplices. The altitudes of a general $d$-simplex, $d \geq 3$, are not necessarily concurrent. Source: Hajja, Mowaffaq; Martini, Horst. Orthocentric simplices as the true generalizations of triangles. Math.

The algebra is $A=kQ/I$ with the assumptions $I \subseteq J^2$ and $I/(JI+IJ) \neq 0$, where $J$ is the ideal in $kQ$ generated by the arrows. Assume $A$ is hereditary. Then $J/I$ is a projective $A$-module and the exact sequence of $A$-modules $$0 \rightarrow I/IJ \rightarrow J/IJ \rightarrow J/I \rightarrow 0$$ must split. Let $s \colon J/IJ \rightarrow I/IJ$ denote a retraction. Let $x$ be an element in $I \smallsetminus (JI+IJ)$. Since $I \subseteq J^2$, we can write $$x=p_1 q_1 + \cdots + p_n q_n$$ with $p_i,q_i \in J$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. Then $$x+IJ=s(p_1 q_1 + \cdots + p_n q_n+IJ)=p_1 s(q_1) + \cdots + p_n s(q_n) +IJ \in JI+IJ,$$ a contradiction. Therefore $A$ is not hereditary. 

(Here $d$ is the dimension of the lattice.) Since the number of boundary vertices is at most some constant times the number of vertices in the animal itself, this also gives an affirmative answer to your question. 

One metric on trees that has received a lot of attention over the past ten years is the one introduced by Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann in their paper, "Geometry of the space of phylogenetic trees." I am not sure what you mean by "mind maps", but this metric has been of particular interest for statistical and biological applications, so it is probably worth a look. 

For a striking example of a classical result in algebraic geometry given a tropical proof, see A tropical proof of the Brill-Noether Theorem by Cools, Draisma, Payne, and Robeva. The original proof of this theorem (by Griffiths and Harris) involves subtle transversality arguments, which they are able to circumvent in this "combinatorial" proof. The new proof is also valid in all characteristics.
