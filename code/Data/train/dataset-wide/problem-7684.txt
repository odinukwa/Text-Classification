Yes, there is a direct analog (see the article "The number of vertices of a tropical curve is bounded by its area") 

I consider the group $B_{n,n}$, the braids, colored in two colors, say all odd strings are black and all even strings are white. It is easy to find a set of generators for $B_{n,n}$: $$ \begin{cases} \def\s{\sigma} a)&M_i=\s_{2i-1} \s_{2i}\s_{2i-1} = \s_{2i}\s_{2i-1}\s_{2i}, i=1,\dots,n-1 \\ b)&N_i=\s_{2i}\s_{2i+1} \s_{2i} = \s_{2i+1} \s_{2i} \s_{2i+1}, i=1,\dots,n-1\\ c)&P_i=\s_{2i}^2, i=1,\dots,n-1 \\ d)&Q_i=\s_{2i-1}^2, i=1,\dots,n \\ \end{cases} $$ and relations $(M_iP_i^{-1}N_i)Q_i(M_iP_i^{-1}N_i)^{-1} = Q_{i+1}, (N_iQ_{i+1}^{-1}M_{i+1})P_i(N_iQ_{i+1}^{-1}M_{i+1})^{-1} = P_{i+1} $ But I can not find any source where it is proven. Could you give me a reference (paper, textbook)? 

there is an article of Quo-Shin Chi "The dimension of the moduli space of superminimal surfaces of a fixed degree and conformal structure in the 4-sphere" where the dimension of contact curves moduli space is computed. It lays between $2d-4g+4$ and $2d-g+4$ for a fixed complex structure on a curve 

is it true that any numerical polynomial , i.e. $f(t)\in \mathbb Q[t], f(n)\in\mathbb Z\ \forall n\in\mathbb Z\ $ can be presented as Hilbert polynomial of some variety? 

It sounds like a multijet transversality theorem (see for example M. Golubitsky, V. Guillemin, Stable mappings and their singularities) in context of algebraic geometry. So, the answer is true --- a proof of this theorem uses only polynoms for perturbations which achieves general position. 

For a $\mathbb C P^2$ is known a result: if through the generic points $p_1,p_2,\dots p_n$ with multiplicities $m_1,m_2\dots, m_n$ correspondingly a degree $d$ irreducible reduced curve passes then $d^2\geq m_1^2+m_2^2+\dots+m_n^2-min (m_i)$. (see Lemma 1 in "Curves in $\mathbb P^2$ and symplectic packings" Geng Xu) The idea of the proof is the following: move slightly a point $p_i$ and apply Bezout theorem; formally he gave a construction of a new curve via deformation of the old one. I was wondering if the same proof works in positive characteristic ? In the article it is written $\mathbb P^2$ without mentioning of characteristic, but the proof doesn't work : as you know, a derivation of a polynomial in positive characteristic can drastically change its degree. From the other hand it is very frequently when a result in complex geometry automatically translates to any characteristic by some logic reasons, it is the case here? 

As I understand your question, the answer is: for any open set $U'\subset M, 'V\subset N$ such that $U,V$ are diffeomorphic to $U',V'$ you can identify $J^k(U,V)$ with subset of $J^k(M,N)$. So, it is enough that all such identivication are diffeomorphisms. 

"every locally complete intersection curve in P3 can be defined by four equations." look at $URL$ and $URL$ 

There is the following estimation (Duffin, Discrete potential theory, Theorem 5): Let $f$ be a discrete harmonic function in a sphere of radius $R$ with the center $p$, all in $\mathbb Z^3$. Then, if $f$ is non-negative in this sphere, then for each neighbor $p'$ of $p$ we have $|f(p)-f(p')|\leq C f(p)/R$ for some absolute constant $C$. It seems that the proof can be generalised for the integer lattices of all dimensions. Do you know any reference for that? Also, Duffin uses Fourier transform and estimates for Green function. Probably, there is a simpler way to prove this statement... 

There is something like Cech cohomology. It is Alexander-Kolmogorov cohomology (see Spenyer "Algebraic topology", Alexander cohomology). Simplixes in this theory are collections of near points. As I understand it works well for locally contractible spaces (and coincides with Cech cohomology). But it seems that in your situation it works well too. 

Let's consider closed simply-connected 4-manifold $M$ and some $a\in H^2(M)$. It is very natural question to estimate minimal $g$ that $a$ can be presented as embedded surface of genus $g$. As I know there is the adjunction inequality for estimation of minimal genus via Seiberg-Witten theory. Question 1: Does there exist other methods to estimate minimal genus ? I heard that there are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic 4-manifolds $M,N$ such that for some $a\in H^2$, $a$ has different minimal genus in $M,N$. Question 2: Could you give me such examples? As I understand it should be some manipulations with Seiberg-Witten invariants... 

There exists an honor thesis dedicated to exactly this problem, and its generalizations: Problems in Harmonic Function Theory Ronald A. Walker, see $URL$ 

Suppose we have a convex compact body $D\subset \mathbb R^n$. We can try to apply affine transformation keeping the volume and decreasing the diameter of $D$. It is clear that there is a constant $\lambda_n$ such that for any $D$ there is an affinity $F$ such that $diamater(F(D))^n\leq\lambda_n Volume(F(D))$. I'm interesting in the optimal value for $\lambda_n$. The article "On the thinnest non-separable lattice of convex bodies" (E. Makai, p.23) gives an estimate $\lambda_n\leq (_n^{2n})n^{n/2}/k_n$ where $k_n$ is the volume of the convex hull of the unit sphere and $(\pm\sqrt{n},0,0,..)$, $\lambda_2$ is also computed. I can not find in literature any better estimate for $\lambda_3$, but it seems that I can prove a few better estimate by school-like methods: if there is no affinity decreasing diameter, that means that in $D$ there are a lot of diameters which will increase if we apply an infinitesimal affinity, so we get an estimate. I'm sure that I'm not the first one who apply such a simple idea to this problem. Do you know any others references concerning this problem? 

Look at so-called Parshin reciprocity law, for example Mazin' approach $URL$ I guess that is exactly what you want. If I am not mistaken, your version follows from the standard version of Weil reciprocity law for the functions $f/g,f/h$, in the spirit of logarithmic differentials (cf. $URL$ If not, it is very strange. 

Recently, I discovered a rather unexpected thing. We are writing an article in collaboration and we permanently have some discussions about how to write, in which order, how to organize material etc. Today we have understood that we are reading articles in different maners. I start from the abstract, then I'm reading the introduction where I expect all results stated clearly and the motivation is explained. If I don't understand the introduction, I don't read this acticle. Then, I am reading the text in the article which is kind of "water". Probably, at the end, I start to carefully check the details in theorems and proofs. My friend usually proceeds in an opposite way. He skips the introduction, reads only definitions, propositions and theorems, and some stuff around which he could understand. Then, if he is really interested, he starts to read the usual text. These two approaches result in writing: I care about the introduction, beginings and ends of each chapter, making proofs as short as possible and explaning motivation only in the introduction. I suppose that the reader reads from the beginning till the end. He only cares about all the important thing being stated in propositions and theorems, no matter in which part (in which order) of the paper. He also does not care a lot about the logical structure, but more about motivation explained and repeated. So, what are possible ways to structure an article? Do you normally suppose that the reader reads from the beginning till the end or just skimming? Does it correlate with your writing style? It is a big vague and personal, so I expect also rather personal opinions and strategies. 

There is a very good article "Complex contact threefolds and their contact curves" of Yun-Gang Ye where on can find a classification of complex contact structures on threefolds 

I was wondering if the sum $TS^{2n}\oplus TS^{2n}$ is a trivial bundle? The same is true for spheres of odd dimension (one can find a nowhere zero section of the second bundle, add it to the first, the first becomes trivial and the rest of second bundle plus trivial bundle of rk 2 is trivial too). It seems that one should take $2n$ sections $v=(v_1,\dots,v_{2n})$ of $TS^{2n}$ (for example projections of coordinate vector fields from $\mathbb R^{2n+1}$ to $S^{2n}$), $u=(u_1,\dots,u_{2n})$ for the second part and than perturb a little u=u+av, v=v+bu. Nevertheless I can not prove that it works. From the other point of view I see no reasons for this bundle to be non-trivial. 

It is known that a Hilbert scheme of degree $d$ curves in $\mathbb P^3$ can have dimension more than $4d$. But, does it imply that for some types of curves there are such a curve through any, say, $2d+1$ points? (or $3d$) 

It seems that I found a proof. Consider a figure $A$. Consider a figure $F$ with minimal ratio $S/d^2$ among all affine transforms of $A$. Lemma. There are two diameters of $F$ with angle at least $\pi/3$ between them. Note that Lemma implies the estimation because $\sin(\pi/3) =\sqrt 3/2$ and area of $F$ is at least $d^2\sin(\pi/3)/2$. Proof. Consider a diameter $D$. Try to squeeze $F$ in the direction of $D$ and stretch out in the perpendicular direction. It is not possible, therefore there is an other diameter $D'$ with angle at least $\pi/4$ and less than $\pi/3$ with $D$. Well, among all pairs of diameters chose the pair $D,D'$ with the biggest shapr angle between them. Now try to perform an affine shift parallel to $D$ in the direction decreasing $D'$. It is not possible, therefore there is a diameter $D''$ which is a kind in a "symmetric" position with $D'$. So, now either the angle between $D$ and $D'$ is big enough, or the angle between $D'$ and $D''$. 

Let's consider spatial algebraic curve $C\subset \mathbb P^3$. How could I describe a family of such curves, for example the set of all curves genus $g$ passing through $k$ points? I'd like to some "computationable" description(and then use macaulay2 ), so in case of rational curves we can parametrize them and say that my set is some linear subspace of coefficient space. For example, how can I describe a pencil of elliptic cubics degree 4 (3,5,6 ?) passing through 4 points? 

Let M be a smooth Riemannian manifold. Let $f:S^1\to M$ be a locally-flat injective loop. Must there exist such $\varepsilon>0$ that if we connect points $f(0),f(\varepsilon), f(2\varepsilon)... , f([1/\varepsilon]\varepsilon), f(1)=f(0) $ by shortest geodisic path then we obtain piecewise-smooth loop without self-intersection? If it is true, does this $\varepsilon$ depend on $f$ continuously? 

I add our explanation and the origin of the problem. To obtain the formula we just need to verify the following lemma (by a straightforward computation). Magic Lemma. Let $(a,b),(c,d)$ be as in our summation in the main posting. Draw tangents to the unit circle which are orthogonal to the directions $(a,b),(c,d),(a+c,b+d)$. Then the triangle in the intersection has the area $\frac{f(a,b,c,d)^2}{2}$. Now consider the circle given by $x^2+y^2=1$. At every rational point on it we draw the tangent line. Clearly, our disk is the intersection of all the half-planes given by these lines. So we can approximate the area of the disk by the following sequential cutting. We start with the square $[-1,1]\times [-1,1]$. It has four points of tangency with our circle. We will construct a sequence of polygons converging to the circle. Initially we have sides of directions orthogonal to $(1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,1)$. At every step, we take two vectors $v_1,v_2$(in the same quadrant) which give the basis of $\mathbb Z^2$ and add to our polygon a new side, which is given by the tangent line of the direction orthogonal to $v_1+v_2$. For example, the first step will be cutting the square by the line $x+y=\sqrt 2$, if we take the vectors $(1,0),(0,1)$. The area of the eliminated triangle is $\frac{(\sqrt2-1)^2}{2}=\frac{f(1,0,0,1)^2}{2}$. It seems that this procedure can be generalized to higher dimensions — at least a preliminary computation shows that something like the above magic lemma should happen. 

So, $f2=x^4+y^4+z^4+t^4\ $ (in the above notation) does NOT produce contact structure. It is convex but not strictly(!) plurisubharmonic (on the plane $x=y=0$). Here ($URL$ there is a good explanation why the induced structure is contact ($d\eta$ tames complex structure on $\mathbb R^4$ ) 

Let's consider curve $C\subset \mathbb P^n$ of degree $d$ and genus $g$. We want to calculate dimension of deformation space of $C$, i.e. $h^0(C,L)$ where $L$ is the normal bundle. We can decompose $L$ as $L_1\subset L_2\dots \subset L$, such as $dim L_{i+1}/L_i =1 \ $ and apply Riemann-Roch to each $L_{i+1}/L_i$. I heard that this gives us $(n-1)(d-g+1)+2g-2 + 2d\ $ (as expected to be dimension of deformation space of $C$ or the number of points need to fix to count curves degree $d$ and genus $g$ passing through them). But I can't calculate it ! Could you help me with this or give me a reference ? 

I'm interested in deformations of subvarieties of a toric variety $X$. Suppose we know a subvariety $V$ in the Chow group of $X$, for example, $V$ is a linear combination of powers of hypersurfaces. Can we deduce out of here some meaningful information about dimension of the deformation space of $V$? For example, in the case of curves on a toric surface we can find the dimension of the deformation space of $V$ as its self-intersection. Similar arguments work for any hypersurface: its deformation space is encoded by its $n+1$-th power, where $n$ is its dimension.
