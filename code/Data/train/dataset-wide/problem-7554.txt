Recently I have come across the books Combinatorial Commutative Algebra by Miller and Sturmfels along with Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra by Stanley. I will soon own a copy of each. I also purchased a used copy of Multiplicities and Chern Classes in Local Algebra by Roberts. My question is about the edge of research in commutative algebra. Which books (such as the above?) represent the edge of current research? By that I mean complete comprehension of such a book would prepare one to tackle a valuable (but doable) open problem for graduate research. Perhaps this edge is better represented by articles and papers. Are there a lot of these being published and how has this varied over time? I'm trying to get at the current state of the area of commutative algebra by considering the more concrete topic of current literature on the topic, especially the literature that is spawning new open problems. 

First, some setup: So: given a commutative ring $R$, let $Ideals(R)$ be set of ideals of $R$ and let $IdealClosure(R)$ be the set of closure operations $cl: \mathcal{P}(R) \rightarrow Ideals(R)$. In other words, let $IdealClosure(R)$ be the set of functions $cl: \mathcal{P}(R) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(R)$ such that 

TVS's $V$ of larger and larger cardinality become more and more pathological / difficult / intractable or, There is a cardinal $A_{max}$ so that almost all pathological behavior exhibited in any TVS is exhibited in a TVS of density $A$ less than or equal to $A_{max}$. 

This was surprising because before that point I had considered the two sides of a coproduct to be reversible, but they can no longer be considered so if the first set is designated as the collection of "normal" outputs and the second set is designated as paramaterizing an "exceptional" result. My question: are there other places where an function/arrow to a coproduct is viewed as an alternative between a normal/regular outcome on one side and an exceptional/irregular outcome on the other? Though I can't think of many right now, I'm guessing there must be computations (etc) where coproducts have an asymmetric normal vs irregular interpretation. 

More concretely, are there other cardinality related restrictions one can put on a TVS to obtain decent results, or are such pursuits apparently fruitless? Is any cardinality restriction looser than separability useful? [Note: Model Theory would have a lot to say about this, but I'm looking for additional perspectives as well. In addition, we could ask the same question about other structures, but I'd like to start with something concrete.] 

Is there a single suitable reference to study for the smooth manifold (geometry) half of a typical Topology/Geometry PhD preliminary exam at an average AMS group I school? (Note: I know details about the presentation of these prelim tests varies, but at many schools there is a single Topology/Geometry exam, half of which is roughly smooth manifolds "Geometry" and the other half algebraic topology "Topology") Being a bibliophile, I've invested some time looking around at various qualifying exam syllabi until something stuck out: for Topology, relatively fewer books are listed. It seems quite often a book like Algebraic Topology by Hatcher is listed along with one or two others (seemingly to cover certain small gaps). Also, for Algebra, a few books often suffice... the books by Lang, Jacobson, and Dummit & Foote are often listed. One or two of these together with an outlier often suffice. Compare that to the situation with smooth manifolds. One site (which I lost track of... UCR?) I saw listed as many as 8 books as references for the topic! Many universities seem to use Guillemin & Pollack despite teaching manifolds abstractly, rather than as submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is understandable, but somewhat pedagogically suspect and in my own experience as a student, confusing. It appears that the topic of smooth manifolds needs an expository text that fills the same role for Geometry as does Algebraic Topology (Hatcher) does for Topology. Some sensible criteria: 

Given a topological vector space $V$, let its density be the smallest cardinal $A$ such that a set of cardinality $A$ is dense in $V$. Naively, it seems one of two things happen: 

First, some background: recently in learning more about functional programming I saw one use for coproducts that surprised me a little bit: A function $f: A \rightarrow B \coprod C$ may result when considering a computation that starts with an $a \in A$ and results with an element of $B$ unless "something exceptional happens" in which case it results in an element in $C$ that describes / paramaterizes some sort of 

Your property implies in particular: "Every nowhere dense closed subset of $X$ is compact." (A nowhere dense closed subset is the boundary of its complement.) This in turn is equivalent to compactness for $T_1$ spaces with no isolated points, as shown by Katetov in 1947. Interestingly, the result holds as well for Lindelöf spaces, or more generally for $[\lambda,\kappa]$-compact spaces (a space is $[\lambda,\kappa]$-compact if every cover of it by $\le\kappa$ open sets has a subcover of cardinality $<\lambda$). This is due to Mills and Wattel, a very nice short proof can be found in Blair's "Some nowhere densely generated topological properties" (easily found online). Completely unaware of these results, I actually recently published a paper whose main result is weaker than Mills and Wattel's, and with a more complicated proof than Blair's. 

They are different since there is (for instance) a model of $\forall n\in \omega$ $AC(\{n\})$ which does not satisfy $AC(\omega)$, see Theorem 7.11 in Jech's "The axiom of Choice". Notice that $AC(Z)\Rightarrow\forall n\in Z$ $AC(\{n\})$ and if $Z$ is finite, then of course both are equivalent. Will Sawin gave the correct answer for Question 1: 

Any Lindelöf non-metrizable Hausdorff space will do (EDIT: you need that the space is C-closed as well, see below), but more generally, a space is called isocompact iff every closed countably compact subset of X is compact, cl-isocompact iff the closure of a countably compact subset is compact, and C-closed iff any countably compact subset is closed. This paper by Cho and Park contains various results on (cl)-isocompactess, as well a other references: $URL$ And this one by Ismail and Nyikos has good informations on C-closed spaces: $URL$ 

The reverse implication can be proved as follows: first notice that $\forall n\in Z$ $AC(\{n\})$ implies $AC(\{p\})$ for each prime $p$. Then, apply the following general result (Theorem 7.15 in Jech's book): 

I believe that $\omega_1$ with the order topology is a counter example. Call a subset of $\omega_1$ bounded if it is contained in some initial interval $[0,\alpha]$ and unbounded otherwise. Lemma: Any cover of $\omega_1$ by bounded open subsets is not minimal. I am sure that this is standard, but here is a proof. It contains way too many notations and is a bit clumsy, I am afraid, but I hope it is readable. We can assume that such a cover is is of cardinality $\omega_1$. Let thus $\mathcal{V} = \{V_\alpha\,:\,\alpha\in\omega_1\}$ be a cover of $\omega_1$ by bounded open subsets. By a standard argument the sets below are closed and unbounded in $\omega_1$: \begin{align*} C_1 &= \{\alpha\,:\, \cup_{\beta<\alpha} V_\beta\subset[0,\alpha)\}\\ C_2 &= \{\alpha\,:\, \cup_{\beta<\alpha} V_\beta\supset[0,\alpha)\} \end{align*} Hence their intersection $C = \{\alpha\,:\, \cup_{\beta<\alpha} V_\beta =[0,\alpha)\}$ is closed and unbounded as well. We may assume that each member of $C$ is a limit ordinal. When $\alpha\in \omega_1$, let $\alpha^*$ denote the smallest element of $C$ which is $>\alpha$. For each $\alpha\in C$ choose $V_{s(\alpha)}\ni\alpha$ with $s(\alpha)\in[\alpha,\alpha^*)$. Since $V_{s(\alpha)}$ is open and $\alpha$ is limit, $V_{s(\alpha)}$ contains some interval $[\gamma(\alpha),\alpha]$. By Fodor's Lemma, there is some $\gamma\in\omega_1$ such that the set $S$ of $\alpha\in C$ such that $\gamma(\alpha) = \gamma$ is stationary and in particular unbounded. For any $\alpha\in S$ with $\alpha>\gamma^*$, $V_{s(\alpha)}$ contains in particular the interval $[\gamma^*,\alpha]$. Fix now $\eta\in[\gamma^*,\gamma^{**})$. Choose $\alpha \ge \gamma^{**}$ in $S$. Then $$ V_\eta \subset V_{s(\alpha)} \cup \left(\cup_{\beta<\gamma^*}V_\beta\right). $$ Notice that $\gamma^*\le\eta<\alpha\le s(\alpha)$, hence the indices in the union at the righthand side do not contain $\eta$. It follows that $\cup (\mathcal{V} \backslash \{V_\eta\}) = \omega_1$. Corollary: The cover of $\omega_1$ by the intervals $[0,\alpha]$, $\alpha\in\omega_1$, has no refinement that is a minimal cover. 

For instance, I am sure that $Z$ cannot be finite, but can it be Dedekind finite ? Must it be "big" in any appropriate sense ? 

As I wrote in my comments, D.N. Sarkhel constructs such examples in Section 4 of "Some generalizations of countable compactness" (Indian J. pure appl. math 17 (6), 1986). It works as follows. Fix some $n\ge 2$. Take a partition of $[0,1]$ into pairwise disjoint dense subsets $A_i$, $i = 1,\dots, 2n$. If $x\in[0,1]$ there is a unique $n(x)$ such that $x\in A_{n(x)}$. Then set $E_i=A_i$ when $i$ is odd and $E_i = A_{i-1}\cup A_i\cup A_{i+1}$ if $i$ is even, where $A_{2n+1} = A_{2n}$. Then $G$ is open if for each $x\in G$ there is an interval $I(x)$ such that $x\in I(x) \cap E_{n(x)} \subset G$. Sarkhel proves on page 782 that this space is Hausdorff and $n$-star compact but not $n-1$-star compact. It is not possible to obtain regular such spaces since $2$-star compactness is equivalent to $n$-star compactness for any $n\ge 2$ in this class, and to pseudocompactness in the class of Tychonoff spaces. This is shown by van Douwen, Reed, Roscoe and Tree in "Star covering properties" (top. app. 39 issue 1, 1991).
