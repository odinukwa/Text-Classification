The .06 microseconds figure doesn't sound accurate The moment of inertia for a solid sphere is $$I = \frac{2mr^2}{5},$$ where $m$ is the mass of the sphere and $r$ is its radius. Applied to the Earth, this gives us $$I = \frac{2\cdot5.972\times10^{24} \text{ kg} (6371000 \text{ m})^2}{5} = 9.70\times10^{37} \text{ km-m}^2.$$ A simplified estimate of moment of inertia for the water in the three gorges dam is $mr^2$. The change in moment of inertia from raising that water by 175m can be calculated by $$\begin{align}\Delta I &= m_{water}\left[(r_{earth}+175)^2-r_{earth}^2\right] \\ &= 39\times10^{12}\left(6371175^2-6371000^2\right) \\&= 8.69\times10^{22} \text{ km-m}^2.\end{align}$$ Assuming that the angular momentum ($L$) of the Earth stays constant, then since $L=I\omega$, $$I_{before}\omega_{before} = I_{after}\omega_{after},$$ or $$\omega_{after}=\omega_{before}\frac{I_{before}}{I_{after}}.$$ The angular velocity, $\omega$, of the Earth (before) is $7.292\times10^{-5} \text{ radians/s}$. The discrepancy between the before and after moment of inertia is so significant that I would be wary of floating point error on this calculation, but using Python2 I calculate the delta in rotational speed to be $6.776\times10^{-20} \text{radians/s}$. For a rotation of the Earth this means the rotation will take about 80 picoseconds longer, or 0.00008 milliseconds. Conclusion The statements made by VSauce don't match up with Physics 101. I am not inclined to believe this claim unless there is some other explanation or compelling evidence. Given that the magnitude of the change in rotational speed is three orders of magnitude less than he claims, and that 80 picoseconds is about 1/4 of the time it would take your computer to add 2 integers, I think it is safe to say that this is not measurable. 

My interpretation of this is that inland Tamil Nadu sees high surface temperatures from sunlight through clear skies striking the ground. The resulting heat is released in the late afternoon and evening, which causes cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud formation and rainfall. During this, the ground cools off at a rate faster than the nearby Bay of Bengal. This causes oncoming sea breezes laden with moisture and coastal rainfall peaks in the early morning hours. In Tamil Nadu especially, this pattern is very stable. 

This tool lets you determine daylight hours from latitude for any day of the year. I feel like this answer should be longer, but there is not much more to say. 

Its complex structure is driven by the location of the continents. Without continents spread around the world, the ocean circulation would look more like the Pacific ocean, with three separate gyres (probably four if Antarctica was not there, as in the Permian) and much smaller areas of upwelling water: Reduced complexity of ocean circulation could reduce the ability of the ocean recover oxygen levels. Deep water anoxia especially would take far longer to correct with reduced upwelling currents. 

For a total of 31.1 million km$^2$ or 6.1% of the earth's surface. For Temperate, there are two listed above plus: 

Dry season It is easy to burn things in the dry season, not so much where it is wet. Eastern North America generally qualifies as wet, certainly in the winter, less so in the summer. This isn't to say that you CAN'T do slash and burn where it is wet, since it is done in rainy Papua New Guinea an the Amazon, but it makes more sense as a strategy when there is a clear rainy and dry season. A forest or scrubland area will be cut in the wet season, allowed to dry in the dry season, and then burned, returning valuable nutrients to the soil. The soil can then be farmed for several years without needing further nutrients. The burning during dry is key, because it allows the burning to be done between two growing seasons (the wet season). In Eastern North America, if you tried to burning during the dry season (summer), you would lose that growing season, and have to find another source of food that year. The other side to the dry season is the wet season. Seasonal climates will almost all see much more rain in at least one month than anywhere in the eastern US, which has remarkably stable precipitation all year. Therefore, the washing of nutrients out of the soil happens more quickly in the tropics. Soil quality Many places where slash and burn agriculture are prevalent had poor soil quality. Tropical environments tend to have more leached soils due to heavy seasonal rains (or heavy year-round rains). That means that burning is an effective way to add soil nutrients. Areas brought under cultivation from forest-land in Northern Europe have remained productive under cultivation for at least 2000 years (in the case of northern France and England) due to the fertile soil layer. I suspect Eastern American soils have similar vitality. The rainforest, on the other hand, retains almost no minerals and can be exhausted quickly. The only way to effectively farm is to cut down and burn the minerals in the living plants and trees to return them to the soil. Leguminious plants This is a little more theory than fact, but in the tropics, there are many leguminous trees, while in the northern latitudes there are many leguminous ground plants. African savannah-forests are dominated by acacia, mopane, and miombo. These are all leguminous trees that add nitrogen to the soil. No comparable array of dominant tree species are available in the northern latitudes. In America and Europe, soil fertility was traditionally restored with vetch, clover, alfalfa, or (nowadays) soybeans. Those are single season plants; in the case of clover and vetch the can be grown as a meadow in a year or two of fallow. The trees in the tropics, on the other hand, need a longer time to establish. Therefore, it makes relatively more sense to do a yearly fallow rotation in the northern latitudes, and a slash and burn many-year rotation in the tropics. 

Possibly, but they don't apply to today's world I'm reasonably sure, without having read the book but having looked at summaries online, that Dauvillier was arguing that the conditions on Earth when life first developed were such that life would not have developed if the Earth were 2 C warmer. First of all, you would need to specify from what baseline the 2 C rise was measured. There are many times in the past where the Earth was at least 2 C warmer than the present and covered in advanced life (possibly up to 10 C warmer at time during the Mesozoic). NOAA suggests that parts of the Neoproterzoic saw global temperatures of 90 F and up, and of course life managed to persist through that. Since his book is about biogenesis in general, there isn't much comparison to the conditions on Earth today. On that early Earth where life developed, the sun was much weaker (a paradox not completely resolved). There was no oxygen and much more carbon dioxide, ammonia, and/or methane, depending on who you ask. There were also (obviously) no photosythesizing plants and no biological component to the carbon cycle. Life has profoundly changed how the Earth is. The atmospheric dynamics of the early Earth are not comparable to those of our Earth, and thus a 2 C rise then has almost nothing to do with a 2 C rise now. Again, I haven't read the book so I can't asses what specific theories Dauvillier made about the early Earth. However, it could be possible that both things are true: a 2 C rise 4.5 billion years ago would have sterilized the Earth forever, and a 2 C rise today would not. 

Etienne Godin mades some good points about various credibility problems with the paper. I decided to take a quick look at the actual content, to see if the authors have any good points. I'll summarize my findings in two broad categories. Statements made without evidence The paper is poorly referenced, as Edienne Godin says. That in and of itself isn't necessarily a problem if the paper is able to make its own arguments. After all, Einstein couldn't rely on references to make his points about special relativity. However, the paper doesn't do a good job of providing internal evidence for some of its claims. The key foundation claim is that the various bodies creating global temperature estimates are systematically biasing the underlying GHCN climate data to show more warming than there actually is. Most of these claims appear on page 9 of the linked paper, or thereabouts. The authors claim that there is an increase in climate sensing stations that are located at 'urban' airports; while providing no evidence about how airports are affected by urban heat island effects. The 'reference' blog linked from the paper makes claims about poorly sited meteorological stations being used in the data set, but has no systematic evidence (i.e. not anecdotal evidence) about how many stations are poorly sited, and if those numbers have fluctuated in the past. The authors claim that 

First off, your observation that Tamil Nadu gets more rainfall in the evening is partially backed by records. Sahany, Venugopal, and Nanjundiah, 2010 provide data on diurnal scale rainfall distribution during the Southwest monsoon season shows that Tamil Nadu is dry from 0530-1430 each day, and likely to be wet from 1730-0230:
