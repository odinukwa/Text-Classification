Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a surjective continuous map between two topological spaces such that $X,Y$ are path-connected and such that every fibre $f^{-1}(y)$ is connected, for each $y\in Y$. Is there always a continuous section $s\colon Y\to X$ (i.e. a continuous map $s$ such that $f\circ s$ is the identity on $X$)? If no, what kind of sufficient conditions could we impose on $f$ ? For example, is it better if $Y$ is supposed to be simply connected? Or if we choose $Y$ to be the interval $[0,1]$ ? 

The two polynomials that you are giving provide a morphism $\tau\colon\mathbb{C}^2\to \mathbb{C}^2$, given by $(x,y)\mapsto (f(x,y),g(x,y))$. This map $\tau$ is dominant if and only if $f$ and $g$ are algebraically independent (which seems what you already ask). This map $\tau$ is birational if and only if $\mathbb{C}(f,g)=\mathbb{C}(x,y)$. This is also equivalent to ask that is is generically injective, which means that the preimage of a general point consists of one single point. In practical, you can extend your morphism to a birational map from $\mathbb{P}^2$ to $\mathbb{P}^2$ by homogenising, and use Bézout Theorem: you find the common roots of the two homogenised polynomials in $\mathbb{P}^2$ (all these are on the line at infinity because the map is a morphism on $\mathbb{C}^2$). You then blow-up these and count the multiplicities of all base-points, including infinitely near ones. Then the map is birational if and only if $d^2-\sum m_i^2=1$, where $d$ is the degree (max of the degree of $f$ and $g$) and the $m_i$ are the multiplicities. The article you mention are dealing with a related question which takes only one polynomial $f$ and try to find if it is a variable, i.e. if there is $g$ such that $(f,g)$ is birational. 

Let $X$ be a Fano 3-fold with terminal singularities. Is there some bound (possibly explicit) for the Picard rank of $X$ ? If $X$ is smooth, it is well-known that the bound is $10$, obtained by del Pezzo fibrations of degree $1$. With some assumptions on $X$, the bound is $7$ (Nikulin, "On the Picard number of Fano 3-folds with terminal singularities"). Does someone knows what happens in the general case? 

Is there some nice compactification of the affine space with a del Pezzo surface of degree $\le 4$ (for example with a cubic surface) ? More precisely, I would like a projective algebraic variety $X$ and an open subset $U\subset X$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^3$, such that $X\setminus U$ contains a del Pezzo surface of degree $\le 4$, and not too many other components (say $0$, $1$ or $2$). The variety $X$ being smooth would be perfect, but terminal singularities are OK. Of course, it is easy to do this with $\mathbb{P}^2$, and there are some constructions with quadrics or del Pezzo surfaces. We can also blow-up some points and get del Pezzo surfaces, but this create some artificial planes. 

Maybe I missed something, but in the case where the characteristic is zero, it seems to be simple as follow: if $G$ is a closed subgroup of $(K,+)^n$ which is not trivial, then it contains an element $g$, and thus contains all powers of $g$, corresponding to $m\cdot g$, $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ (view $(K,+)^n$ as a vector space). The Zariski closure of this set is then $\{\lambda \cdot g\mid \lambda \in K\}$, which is a closed algebraic subgroup of dimension $1$, isomorphic to $(K,+)$. If $G$ is not equal to this group, it contains another element $h$, linearly independent with $g$ so contains $\{\lambda \cdot g +\mu h\mid \lambda,\mu \in K\}$, which has dimension $2$. 

The question is natural and I would like to say that in practice, it depends a lot of the given hypersurface. The way you suggest seems to be a good idea in general, but the blow ups can sometimes be long to compute. I dont know a good algorithm in a software and do it always by "hand". Note that there are in general choices in the blowups. For example you have a cuspidal cubic curve at infinity and blowing up the pt and then the curve seems natural but if you have reducible sets of singularities there is no canonical choice. In the case of this cubic, I suggest to keep the $x$ fibration (which is natural because of the automorphisms group) and to see that the remainining coordinates give something which looks like a del Pezzo surface of degree $1$. Such a surface has equation $z^2+t^3=F6(w, y)$ in a weighted projective space. Hence, going to $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}(1,1,2,3)$ seems to be natural. I didnt check if it is already smoothor if you need to blow up more but I guess that the del Pezzo fibration obtained has to be checked. 

I am interested in morphisms of algebraic varieties $X\to Y$ over a field $k$, and want to have examples of injective morphisms which are not universally injective. If $k$ is not algebraically closed, it is easy to construct plenty of examples, so I am only interested in the case where $k$ is algebraically closed. The motivation of the question is that open immersion = étale + universally injective. This latter condition is equivalent to radicial, or to the fact that it is injective under a field extension $K/k$. I would thus be even more interested in examples with étale morphisms. 

Two non-singular projective curves are birational if and only if they are isomorphic (a birational map between smooth projective varieties has indeterminacy points in codimension $\ge 2$). The geometric genus of an irreducible projective curve $C$ is the arithmetic genus of its desingularisation $\tilde{C}$. Moreover, $C$ is birational to $\tilde{C}$. By the above observation, the desingularisation $\tilde{C}$ is unique up to isomorphism, and the geometric genus is then well defined. The arithmetic genus of an irreducible curve of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$ is $(d-1)(d-2)/2$ as you said. If it is smooth, the arithmetic and geometric genus coincide. Otherwise, you can blow-up one singular point, and the arithmetic genus decreases by $m(m-1)/2$, where $m$ is the multiplicity at the point blown-up. The process has an end, since the arithmetic genus is non-negative. So you can compute the geometric genus as $(d-1)(d-2)/2-\sum m_i(m_i-1)/2$ where the sum runs over all singular points that you see when doing the desingularisation. All these things are very classical and can be found in any book of introduction to Algebraic geometry. 

Consider the morphism $S_{m,n}\to \mathbb{A}^2_{*}=\mathbb{A}^2\setminus \{(0,0)\}$ given by the projection to $(x,z)$. Then, it is a locally trivial $\mathbb{A}^1$-bundle. This latter is trivial for the Euclidean topology so $S_{m,n}$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{A}^2_{*}\times \mathbb{A}^1$. However, these can give non-isomorphic varieties. In fact $S_{a,b}$ is isomorphic to $S_{a',b'}$ if $a+b=a'+b'$, but apart from this, the question is open (except maybe for $S_{1,1}\simeq\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ which is probably not isomorphic to the other ones). For more details on this, look at the paper "On exotic affine $3$-spheres" of A. Dubouloz and D. Finston $URL$ 

Let us give an answer in the case where $X$ is rational. Since $V_1$ and $V_2$ are birationally equivalent and of codimension $2$, there exists a birational map of $X$ which restricts to a birational map from $V_1$ onto $V_2$. (See "Equivalent birational embeddings" of Mella and Polastri). Hence, if $Y_1\to X$ and $Y_2\to X$ are the blow-ups of $V_1$ and $V_2$, there is a birational map $Y_1\dashrightarrow Y_2$ which sends the exceptional divisor $E_1$ onto the exceptional divisor $E_2$. This means that the pairs $(Y_1,E_1)$, $(Y_2,E_2)$ are birational. In particular, they have the same Kodaira dimension, but also share many birational geometric properties. 

What are sufficient condition on a given diffeomorphism of the sphere (say, given explicitly with formulas) that can ensure that it is conjugate to a rotation, in the group of diffeomorphism of the sphere? Also, if I take a given rotation of some fixed angle, is there a neigbourhood of it which consists only of elements conjugate to a rotation? 

If the field is $\mathbb{C}$ (or algebraically closed of characteristic $\not=2,3$), then you can put any smooth cubic into the Hessian form: $$X^3+Y^3+Z^3+\lambda XYZ=0$$ for some $\lambda\in \mathbb{C}$. This corresponds to put the nine inflection onto the intersection of the curve with $XYZ=0$. Then, the pencil generated by the cubic and $XYZ$ is the Hessian pencil (which corresponds to let $\lambda$ vary in the equation) and is preserved by the classical Hessian group $G\subset \mathrm{PGL}(3,\mathbb{C})$, of order $216$. The groups acts on the set of parameters, paramertised by $\mathbb{P}^1$, and the kernel of this action contains the group $(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^3\rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ generated by the diagonal action $$[X:Y:Z]\mapsto [X:\theta Y:\theta^2Z]$$ $\theta^3=1$ and the group of permutations. This shows that you have generically this group as a group of automorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^2$ preserving the curve. For some values of $\lambda$, you have other automorphisms. Indeed, each of the elements of the Hessian group has two fixed points on $\mathbb{P}^1$. I suggest to read the nice article "The Hesse pencil of plane cubic curves" of M. Artebani and I. Dolgachev on this subject $URL$ . 

Let us describe the general case first, before going to your special case. The intersection of two quadrics has always degree $4$, if you count the intersection with multiplicities. So if you want something of degree $3$, it means that it is a conic (degree $2$) and a line counted with multiplicity $2$, or three lines where one is counted with multiplicity $2$. If you want to find how is the intersection, you can choose one quadric to be smooth, and then isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$ over $\mathbb{C}$, and restricts the equation of the second one to the first one. You get an equation of bidegree $2,2$ and check if it decomposes. If the quadric is a cone you can do a similar argument. But in general, if you have the explicit equation it is not hard to directly check if some line is contained in both quadrics. Let us go back to your equation. It is quite strange written, since you let coefficients which are zero, but it corresponds simply to two equation of the form $q_2(Z_1Z_3-Z_2Z_4)+q_3(Z_2Z_3+Z_1Z_4)+q_6Z_3Z_4+q_7(Z_3^2-Z_4^2)+q_8(Z_3^2+Z_4^2)$ Your other assumptions on the $q_i$'s do not seem to be really special. If you have no conditions on the $a_i,l_i$, the $q_i$ above can be anything. As Johannes observed, the line $Z_3=Z_4=0$ is contained in your quadrics. This implies that the intersection contains the line (counted maybe with multiplicity) and the remains curve has degree $3$. If you check correctly you will see that there is no reason that in fact the intersection has degree $3$ in your case; it is easy to find coefficients such that the intersection is the line $Z_3=Z_4$ and an irreducible cubic. If someone told you that the intersection had degree $3$, he probably meant that the intersection is the line AND a curve of degree $3$. 

Is every pseudo-automorphism (self-birational map which does not contract any hypersurface) of a smooth Fano variety of Picard rank $1$ equal to a biregular automorphism? Remark: For $\mathbb{P}^n$, the answer is yes, and easy: every birational map of degree $>1$ contracts a hypersurface, given by its Jacobian. Same for any projective surface (because birational maps are sequence of blow-ups and blow-downs). 

Yes, it is true. This is easily seen by looking for example at the Picard group, generated by $C$ and $D$, the two fibres of the projections. Since $C^2=D^2=0$ and$C\cdot D=1$, the only curves of self intersection $0$ are multiple of $C$ or $D$, and the irreducible ones are equivalent to $C$ or $D$. Composing an automorphism by the exchange of coordinates you fix then $C$ and $D$ and thus act on each factor via an automorphism. This gives the result. 

Suppose for the moment that $n=2$. Then the birational map $f\colon \mathbb{P}^n\dashrightarrow(\mathbb{P}^1)^n$ described in the question, which is $f\colon [x:y:z] \dashrightarrow([x:y],[x:z])$ has two base-points, $[0:0:1]$, $[0:1:0]$ and the inverse is $f^{-1}\colon ([a:b],[c:d]) \dashrightarrow[ac:bc:ad]$ and has one base-point, namely $([0:1],[0:1])$. If $X\to \mathbb{P}^2$ is the blow-up of $[0:0:1]$, $[0:1:0]$ and $X'$ is the blow-up of $(\mathbb{P}^1)^2$ at $([0:1],[0:1])$, the corresponding map $X \dashrightarrow X'$ is an isomorphism, and thus a "crepant" birational map. If you want to blow-up more points on $X$ and $X'$, which corresponds via this isomorphism you again get an isomorphism. If you blow-up other points you get a birational map which is not an isomorphism and thus not crepant (between two smooth projective surfaces crepant=isomorphism). For $n>2$, the birational map $f$ has more that only isolated base-points, so you need to blow-up more complicated stuff, then contract, and maybe blow-up again... and can get a sequence of simple birational maps (blow-ups or inverse of blow-ups) from $\mathbb{P}^n$ to $(\mathbb{P}^1)^n$. In any case, you cannot get morphisms if you only blow-up points of $\mathbb{P}^n$. 

As explained in the comment of Ruadhai Dervan, the case where $X$ is not Fano (or even worse, when $X$ is not weak-Fano) is probably hard to deal with. The Picard group of $X_r^n$ is generated by $H$, the pull-back of a hyperplane, and by $E_1,\dots,E_r$, the divisors associated to the points blown-up. In dimension $2$, Nagata's conjecture corresponds to say that if $r> 9$ and $dH-\sum_{i=1}^r a_iE_i$ is effective, then $\sum a_i< \frac{d}{\sqrt{r}}$ (the result is false for $r\le 8$, which corresponds to the Fano case and for $r=9$, as you take a cubic through the points). This is true when $r$ is a square, and proved by Nagata, but still open if $r$ is not a square and $r>9$. There are however partial results in the direction of the conjecture, that you can find on the web by looking for "Nagata conjecture for curves". In dimension higher, I don't know what are the results when the variety is not Fano. You can also describe when $X_r^n$ is Fano, or only weak-Fano, depending on $r$ and $n$. In "Weak Fano threefolds obtained by blowing-up a space curve and construction of Sarkisov links." Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. (2012) 105(5): 1047-1075, S. Lamy and myself considered the case of blow-ups of curves in $\mathbb{P}^3$, but also did the easier case of points (see section 2.7), which is basically an exercise. I summarise the result: For $n\ge 3$, $X_r^n$ is Fano if and only if $r=1$ and is weak-Fano (and not Fano) if and only if $n=3$ and $2\le r\le 7$. You can also have a look at the texte and see the conditions that you need to put on the points so that you obtain a weak-Fano $3$-fold. 

Let $G$ be an algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ (any characteristic). Suppose that: (1) the set of $k$-points has the structure of a group. (2) for any $g\in G$ the right-multiplication by $g$ is a morphism of algebraic varieties $G\to G$. (3) the inverse map is a morphism $G\to G$. Does it imply that $G$ is an algebraic group? (i.e. is the multiplication $G\times G\to G$ a morphism?) 

I think that there is no real perfect answer to your question. Here is a simple example, that I often say in talks, I hope it can give an idea of what people mean when saying that a construction is algebraic. Given any smooth cubic $C$ in the projective plane, and a point $p\in C$, I can define a birational map of the projective plane. A general line passing through $p$ is invariant and the restriction of the map to the line is the unique involution which fixes the two points of $C$ lying on the line which are distinct from the point $p$. For the beginner, it is not clear that the map is really birational, but as soon as you deal with such constructions, you understand that if you give explicitly the point and the curve, then you can write the map with polynomials. To see this, you can say that given a point in the plane, the equation of the line, of the points of intersections, and then of the image depend "algebraically" from the point. Hence the map is rational and does not involve for instance square roots or anything else. 

Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a surjective morphism of algebraic varieties, defined over an algebraically closed field. We take a morphism $\psi\colon X\to Z$, where $Z$ in another algebraic variety, that satisfies the following condition: for all $x,x'\in X$, $f(x)=f(x')\Rightarrow \psi(x)=\psi(x')$. This yields the existence of a unique map $\psi'\colon Y\to Z$ such that $\psi=\psi'\circ f$. What are conditions on $f$ we can put on $f$ to be sure that $\psi'$ is a morphism of algebraic varieties? Of course, if $f$ is an isomorphism, the result is true. But is for example enough to ask that $f$ is non-ramified? Or another local condition? I would be happy by only considering the case where $f$ is quasi-finite, even if the general case seems also interesting. 

Your second "parametrization" is not birational. Since you have a parametrization, it is easy to check. Indeed, the first parametrization is a birational map $\tau\colon \mathbb{A}^2\to S$, where $S$ is your surface. The second one is a rational map $\mu\colon \mathbb{A}^2\to S$. Because $\tau$ is birational, we can find that $\mu$ is birational if and only if $\tau^{-1}\circ \mu$ is birational. This map is equal to $(s,t)\mapsto (\frac{s(-1+4t^2)}{3t},\frac{2s(-1+t^2)}{3t})$ composing with the birational map $(s,t)\mapsto (3st,t)$ we obtain $(s,t)\mapsto (s(-1+4t^2),2s(-1+t^2))$ which is clearly not birational ($(s,t)$ and $(s,-t)$ have the same image). 

Once you have the six points in $\mathbb{P}^2$, there is a very easy algorithm to give the cubic surface and the $27$ lines. First, the map to $\mathbb{P}^3$ corresponds to cubics through the six points. So you can choose reducible ones (union of three lines through $2$) and get generators $(f_0:\dots:f_3)$. Then, you find the equation by putting the $f_i$ into a polynomial of degree $3$ and solving the linear equation on the coefficients. Then, the $27$ lines are the strict transforms of lines through $2$ points, conic through $5$ points and the exceptional divisors. If you have the points and the $f_i$, this is algorithmic. To simplify your calculation, you can choose the points and choose (over an algebraically closed field) $[1:0:0]$, $[0:1:0]$, $[0:0:1]$, $[1:1:1]$, $[1:a:b]$, $[1:c:d]$. The only non-algorithmic part is starting from the cubic to find the contraction to $\mathbb{P}^2$. This corresponds to find lines on the cubic and is then more complicated (and there is in general no solution with radicals, as explained by David Speyer). Note that the same kind of algorithm works with del Pezzo surfaces of degree $4$, $2$, $1$. I did it often with Maple with points given.
