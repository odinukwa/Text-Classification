Any moon exerts a tidal force on its primary, tending to cause the primary to bulge outward along the axis passing the moon and to narrow slightly in the other two directions. This effect is greater if the moon in question is larger and/or closer to the primary, but a solid primary may largely resist it, so that it changes shape little if at all. In the case of the Earth and its Moon, the solid Earth moves relatively little, while the water of the oceans is moved quite a bit. As a result, water has to flow from one place to another over the solid crust. That flow causes friction, which causes the "bulge" of water to lag behind the Moon and pull back on it by gravity. This process gradually slows the rotation of the Earth and drives the Moon further away. This process acts, in general to bring the rotation of the planet and the revolution of the Moon to the same rate, so that the planet keeps one face to the Moon. Usually this means slowing the planet's rotation, but a few moons are so close to the planet that it would be the opposite. This process will be less pronounced on a planet which has a deeper liquid layer, since there will be less friction, or on a planet which has a stiff solid structure, since there will be less movement. The number of moons is not directly relevant. To a reasonable approximation they all work independently. 

An alternative expression for the extra, (supra-Newtonian, relativistic) acceleration (brought to my attention by user /u/uhoh) is presented by Shahid-Saless (Colorado) and Yeomans (JPL) in their 1994 Astronomical Journal paper: Relativistic Effects on the Motion of Asteroids and Comets. Their equation 3.11 for the Newtonian + Relativistic acceleration of a single target body orbiting the Sun is as follows:- $$ \frac{d^2 \textbf{r}}{c^2dt^2} = \frac{-\mu}{r^3}\textbf{r} + \frac{\mu}{r^3} \left[ \left(4\frac{\mu}{r}-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)\textbf{r} + 4 \frac{(\textbf{r}\textbf{.v})\textbf{v}}{c^2}\right] $$ where $\textbf{r}$ is the instantaneous position vector of the target body relative to the Sun, $\textbf{v}$ is the instantaneous velocity vector of the target body relative to the Sun, $c$ is the speed of light, $\mu = GM/c^2$ is the Schwartzschild Gravitational Radius of the Sun, $G$ is the universal gravitational constant, $M$ is the (post-Newtonian) mass of the Sun, $\frac{-\mu}{r^3} $ the first term on the RHS, is the Newtonian radial acceleration with the negative sign indicating acceleration towards the source. The authors present a derivation of the equation (which is beyond my expertise). They also use it to derive an expression for $\delta \omega$ the amount (in radians) of rotation of the line of apsides per complete ($2\pi$ radians) orbital revolution:- $$ \delta\omega = \frac{6\pi\mu}{a(1-e^2)} \equiv \frac{6\pi GM}{c^2 a(1-e^2)} \equiv \frac{24\pi^3 a^2}{T^2c^2 (1-e^2)} $$ where $a$ is semi-major axis of orbit, $e$ is eccentricity of orbit, and $T$ is the orbit period. The right-most version is identical to the Einstein 1915 equation presented in the question. It is noteworthy that the Shahid-Saless & Yeomans equation 3.11 indicates that when $\textbf{v}$ is not perpendicular to $\textbf{r}$ a part of the non-Newtonian acceleration will be directed in the direction transverse to the radial direction. Note that caveats apply when moving between a General Relativistic model of Space-Time and a Euclidean-Galilean model -see Stan Liou's answer and the Shahid-Saless & Yeomans paper itself. 

Firstly do not confuse the event horizon with the singularity. Wikipedia gives the formulae for the Kerr metric. There are a number of places where this formula appears to break down because you appear to be dividing by zero, essentially whenever $\Sigma = 0$ or $\Delta = 0$, in the notation of that page, corresponding to the ergosphere and the event horizon respectively. There are two event horizons and two ergospheres but they all have the topology of spheres, one inside another (with some touching at the poles). However those are not singularities in general because you can choose other coordinates for space and time where the division by zero goes away. However you can't do this at points on the equator of the inner ergosphere, which makes those points a ring singularity. It is a ring with zero thickness (at least until quantum effects come in) .There is a helpful picture Flow of liquids doesn't really enter the picture here. One can think of the properties of this metric as a "flow" of space-time, but that's an analogy at best. There seems to be considerable doubt about what really happens inside a rotating black hole, or even, given that no information can escape from the black hole, about whether this is even a meaningful question. 

Not only Earth is moving but also you with the rest like atmosphere, so you are in closed system. The edge of atmosphere does not fly off because it has nothing to rub against, it just stays in same speed. When you put your hand from the car and you feel the force against it, it is the force which you must make to push the air from your way. If the air would be moving at same velocity as you, your hand would not feel this and you would be able to hold outside of car even at 300km (do not do that, it is dangerous). 

Ok, I read about the Supernova of type Ia and I found out that there are two detonations happening. First one is in helium shell around the white dwarf and second one seems to be triggered by the first one and it is the main part of whole supernova. I did not find how this helium shell explodes at all so that`s what I am looking for. Thanks in advance! 

PREDICTING CYCLE DURATIONS We can also derive an expression for the cycle duration $D$, as follows. The start periaston is at $t=0=T0$ and the first following periaston is at $t=T1$ then $$ \Phi(T1)=\int_{t=0}^{t=T1}\frac{1}{P(t)}\,\mathrm{d}t = 1 $$ this can be expressed as $$ 1 =\int_{t=0}^{t=T1}\frac{1}{ \dot{P} t + P_0 }\,\mathrm{d}t = \left[ \frac{1}{\dot{P}} ln ( C\dot{P}t + CP_0 )\right]_0^{T1} $$ hence $$ \dot{P} = ln ( C\dot{P}T1 + CP_0 ) - ln ( CP_0 ) = ln \left( \frac{ C ( \dot{P}T1 + P_0 )} { C ( P_0 )} \right) = ln \left( \frac{ \dot{P}T1 + P_0 } {P_0 } \right) $$ $$ \rightarrow exp(\dot{P}) = \frac{ \dot{P}T1 + P_0 } {P_0 } \rightarrow P_0 exp(\dot{P}) -P_0 = \dot{P}T1 $$ giving us $$ \rightarrow T1 = P_0 \frac{exp(\dot{P}) -1} {\dot{P}} $$ so the duration of the first orbit (from start periastron to first following periastron) is $D_1 = T1-T0 = T1$ thus $$ D_1 = D_0 \frac{exp(\dot{P}) -1} {\dot{P}} $$ and we can generalize this to $$ D_{N} = D_{N-1} \left( \frac{exp(\dot{P}) -1} {\dot{P}} \right) .$$ For example using the made-up value $\dot P = -2.34\,10^{-8}$ we obtain $$ D_{N+1} = D_{N} \frac{exp(-2.34*10^{-5}) -1} {-2.34*10^{-8}} = 0.999 999 988 D_{N} $$ However, using standard arithmetical software (such as Excel) when we try to calculate using $\dot P = -2.34\,10^{-10}$ we get nonsense results because of truncation errors. The approximate value of $\dot P$ reported for the Hulse-Taylor system is about $-2.34\,10^{-12}$. We can analyze the formula for $D_{N+1}$ using series expansions. A Taylor Series expansion of $exp(x)/x -1/x$ is given by WolframAlpha as $$ exp(x)/x -1/x= 1 + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{6} + \frac{x^3}{24} + \frac{x^4}{120} + \frac{x^5}{720} + \frac{x^6}{5040} + \frac{x^7}{40320} + \frac{x^8}{362880} + \frac{x^9}{3628800} + \frac{x^{10}}{39916800} +O(x^{11}) $$ or $$1 + \frac{x^{2-1}}{2} + \frac{x^{3-1}}{3*2} + ... \frac{x^{i-1}}{i!} + ...$$ No easilly computable expression or approximation is obvious at present. Proceeding anyway, it is clear that the duration of any subsequent orbit $N$ can be computed from $$ D_N = D_0 \left(\frac{exp^{\dot P} -1} {\dot P} \right) ^N = D_0 \left(\frac{1}{\dot P} \right)^N \left(exp^{\dot P} -1 \right) ^N $$ It is interesting to compare this expression for cycle duration with that which was used as the basis of the coarse binomial solution (see other answer: Method 4) $$D_1=D_0(1+\dot P)^1$$ The ratio of durations Phase-based to Coarse binomial based is $$ D_0 \left( \frac{exp(\dot P)-1}{\dot P} \right)^{1} :D_0(1+\dot P)^1 $$ becoming $$ \frac{exp(\dot P)-1}{\dot P} :1+\dot P \qquad \rightarrow exp(\dot P)-1 :\dot P +\dot P^2 \qquad \rightarrow exp(\dot P) : 1+\dot P +\dot P^2 $$ applying the series expansion of $exp(\dot P)$ we obtain $$ \qquad \rightarrow 1+\dot P + \frac{\dot P^2}{2} + \frac{\dot P^3}{6} + \frac{\dot P^4}{24} +\,...\, : 1+\dot P +\dot P^2 $$ Clearly the two expressions give different values for cycle duration $D$ and the difference appears at the term in $\dot P^2$ and seems to be no bigger than $\frac{\dot P^2}{2}$.
