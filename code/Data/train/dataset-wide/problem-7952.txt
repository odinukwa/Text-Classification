Let $G$ be a connected reductive group acting on a projective variety $X$. Let $L$ be a $G$-linearized (very) ample line bundle on $X$, and let $R$ be the ring of sections (or homogeneous coordinate ring of $(X, L)$). Let $R_k = H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$ denote the $k$-th graded piece of $R$, and $R_{k, \lambda}$ its $\lambda$ isotypic component where $\lambda$ is a dominant weight. Consider the GIT quotient $X //_\lambda G$ i.e. $Proj(\bigoplus_k R_{k, k\lambda})$. Then one can define the volume of this GIT quotient $f(\lambda) = vol(X //_\lambda G)$ say as the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial of the graded algebra $\bigoplus_k R_{k, k\lambda}$ times $d!$ where $d = dim(X //_\lambda G)$. By homogeneity one can extend f to rational values of $\lambda$. (When $X$ is smooth $f$ is just the Duistermaat-Heckman function in symplectic geometry on the moment/Kirwan polytope.) Question: Under what conditions is f continuous at 0, i.e. as \lambda approaches $0$, $f(\lambda)$ approaches $f(0)$ (we consider $f$ as a function on the moment polytope and we assume that $0$ in on the boundary of the moment polytope)? Little bit weaker questions is: when can we find a sequence of regular dominant $\lambda_i$ approaching $0$ such that $f(\lambda_i)$ approaches $f(0)$? Clearly a sufficient condition for continuity of $f$ is that $X$ is smooth and $0$ is a regular value of the moment map. For example, is $f$ continuous under the assumption that generic orbits of the action of $G$ on $Spec(R)$ (cone over $X$) are closed? 

In this question I had asked about proof of the property of selective ultrafilter. As was answered, the proof is trivial if we know that ultrafilter is selective iff it is Ramsey ultrafilter. The proof of latter fact can be found in book "Theory of ultrafilters" by Comfort and Negrepontis. Non-trivial part of this proof is the implication "selective $\implies$ quasi-normal". While it is easy to see that the proof of latter implication is correct, I was unable to understand intuitive idea of this proof. So, I tried to find more easy and intuitively clear proof. So, the question : Proof that for any selective ultrafilter $\mathcal{F}$ and for arbitrary family of big sets $\{A_i\}_{i\in\omega}$ there exists a big set $A$ with the property: $\forall i,j \in A : i<j \implies j\in A_i$ I will give my proof in answers below. 

It is easy to see (using AC, of course) that there exist two sets $U\subset\mathbb{R}$ and $V\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that any real number $x$ can be represented as unique sum $x=u+v$, where $u\in U$ and $v\in V$. There are $2^{2^\omega}$ such $(U,V)$ pairs. The question given by my son: prove existence of pair $(U,V)$ with $U=V$. In other words, prove the existence of $U\subset\mathbb{R}$ such that for any $x\in\mathbb{R}$ there exists unique pair $\{u,v\}$ with $x=u+v$ 

Hi, Let $I$ be an ideal in a polynomial ring $S = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Fix a term order on $S$ (e.g. a lexicographic order) and let $in(I)$ denote the initial ideal of $I$, that is, the monomial ideal generated by all the initial terms of elements of $I$. It is clear that for any $k > 0$ one has $in(I)^k \subset in(I^k)$, with equality if $I$ itself is a monomial ideal. 

Let $X$ be a set with a collection of subsets $\mathcal{A}$. A finitely additive measure on $(X, \mathcal{A})$ is a function $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ such that for any two subsets $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$ we have $\mu(A \cup B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B) - \mu(A \cap B)$. Now consider the set $\mathcal{L}$ of all linear subspaces of a given finite dimensional vector space $V$. The dimension of subspaces satisfies an equality similar to a finitely additive measure. That is, for any two subspaces $W, U \in \mathcal{L}$ we have $\dim(U+W) = \dim(U) + \dim(W) - \dim(U \cap W)$. My question: Is there a generalized notion of measure which includes dimension of vector spaces (and one can define analogues of integration for it)? For example is there a generalized notion of a measure on a lattice (where intersection and union are replaced with meet and join)? Thanks 

For example, one can write direct sums of Hopf links as $2^2_1\# 2^2_1$ to form a new 3-component non-prime links. it may be the easiest one in the case of $$6^3_2 \to 3_1.$$ There should be also some considerations of orientations and framing for the others: $$6^3_1 \to 3_1,$$ $$6^3_3 \to 3_1.$$ p.s. It will be greatly appreciated that if someone please makes the statement explicitly and as simple as possible. (excuse me, I am a physicist.) Thank you. 

The entries in groupprops.subwiki.org and in this MO post show the results for the symmetric group S$_4$. 

To make a lower-dimensional analogy, recall that in 3-dimensional sphere $S^3$, we can have a very symmetric configuration of three 1-circles $S^1$ linked in the 3-dimensional sphere $S^3$, as the Borromean rings. 

In mathematics and in physics, people use the terms "modular..." and "moduli space" very often. I was puzzled by the etymology, the origins and the similarity/equivalence/differences for these usages/concepts behind for some time. Could I seek for expert's explanations on the contrast/comparison of the "modular..." and "moduli space" in the following contexts: 

"Modular" in the modular tensor category. (Also the "pre-modular" category.) "Modular" in the modular form. "Modular" in the topological modular form (tmf). "Modular" in the modular invariance (e.g. in Conformal Field Theory). "Moduli space" in algebraic geometry "Moduli space" in Non-supersymetric Quantum Field Theories or gauge theories "Moduli space" in Supersymetric gauge theories "Module" in the "mod" or modular arithmetic. "Modular" in modular representation theory of (finite) groups/algebraic groups. [As André Henriques suggested] "Module": $G$-module in the group (co)homology and topological $G$-module for the topological group. [Likely related to 9.] "Modulus" of convergence and "Modulus" of continuity in analysis. 

Let $\{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_r\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ be a finite subset of lattice points and let $\Phi: (\mathbb{C}^*)^n \to \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r$ be the corresponding map from the algebraic torus to the projective space defined by: $$\Phi(x) = (x^{\alpha_0}: \cdots : x^{\alpha_r}).$$ Here $x^\alpha$ is short for $x_1^{a_1} \cdots x_n^{a_n}$, $\alpha = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$. For simplicity let us assume that $\Phi$ is an embedding. Consider the standard Fubini-Study metric on $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r$ and equip the torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ with the pull-back metric which we call $g$. It is clearly a metric invariant by the action of the compact subgroup $(S^1)^n$. Let us decompose $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ as $\mathbb{R}^n \times (S^1)^n$ by $(r, \theta) \mapsto e^{r+i\theta}$. Then we can consider $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a subset of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$. My question is if one can describe the geodesics of $g$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$? Is it true that the geodesics are straight lines? 

Let $\Delta$ be a convex body (i.e. a compact convex subset) or a convex polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $x$ be a point inside $\Delta$ and consider a (uniform) random walk starting at $x$ inside $\Delta$. I am interested in the probability distribution of the first time the random walk hits a point in boundary $\partial \Delta$. We consider a uniform random walk were $x$ with equal probability can go to any point in a small neighborhood of radius $\delta$ of $x$. We are interested in the probability distribution (on the boundary) that the random walk hits a boundary point. Is there a "nice" formula for this distribution on the boundary points (in terms of $x$ and $\Delta$)? If $\Delta$ is a polytope one expects that this distribution should be related to the distance of $x$ to different facets of $\Delta$. In general are there nice formula relating geometry of $\Delta$ and relative position of $x$ in $\Delta$ to probability distributions (associated to random walks)? I am from algebraic geometry and don't know much about random walks. I thought this problem might be known to the experts.

More precisely, the Spin(8) triality specifies the symmetry allowed interation terms for the following systems: a chiral $p_x+i p_y$ with a anti-chiral $p_x-i p_y$ superconductor. Combine a chiral $p_x+i p_y$ with a anti-chiral $p_x-i p_y$ superconductor, what we obtain is a Topological Superconductor respect to $Z_2$-Ising global symmetry as well as a $Z_2^f$-fermionic parity symmetry. So it is a 2+1D $Z_2 \times Z_2^f$-Topological Superconductor. It turns out that stacking from 1 to 8 layers of such $Z_2 \times Z_2^f$-Topological Superconductor ($p_x+i p_y/p_x-i p_y$), you can get 8 distinct classes (and at most 8, mod 8 classes) of TQFTs. They are labeled by $\nu \in \mathbb{Z}_8$ classes of 2+1D fermionic spin-TQFTs:

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $k$. I was wondering if there is a standard terminology for a function $v: V \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$ which is invariant under multiplication by nonzero scalars and satisfies non-Archimedean inequality $v(x+y) \geq \min\{v(x), v(y)\}$? In the paper "Newton-Okounkov bodies, semigroups of intergral points, graded algebras and intersection theory", the authors call such a function a "pre-valuation", I was wondering if this concept has been introduced before and if there are other terms used for it. Of course, this is related to the notion of ultra-metric. Thanks 

Hi, Can one define a Fubini-Study metric/Kaehler metric on the projective space of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, i.e. using the formula $\partial \bar{\partial} \log |Z|^2$? This should be very well-known to the experts. Anyhow I don't have much experience with infinite dimension and worried that something may go wrong. I appreciate any comments or references. 

Consider the complex algebraic torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ where $\mathbb{C}^*$ stands for $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$. Fix a finite set of lattice points $A = \{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_r\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ and define the map $$\phi_A: (\mathbb{C}^*)^n \to \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r,$$ by $x \mapsto (x^{\alpha_0}:\cdots:x^{\alpha_r})$. Let us assume that $\phi_A$ is an embedding and equip the torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ with the Kahler form $\omega_A = \phi_A^*(\omega_{FS})$ which is the pull-back, via $\phi_A$, of the standard Kahler form (the Fubini-Study form) on the projective space $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r$. We regard $((\mathbb{C}^*)^n, \omega_A)$ as a symplectic manifold. The compact torus $(S^1)^n$ acts on $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ in a Hamiltonian fashion and the image of its moment map is the interior of the convex hull of the finite set $A$. Two important notions of capacity for a symplectic manifold are the Gromov width and the Hofer-Zehnder capacity. One can give estimates for the Gromov width of $((\mathbb{C}^*)^n, \omega_A)$ in terms of the moment polytope, i.e. the convex hull of $A$. My question is: are there any estimates known for the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of $((\mathbb{C}^*)^n, \omega_A)$ in terms of the finite set $A$ or its convex hull? Any statement in this regard would be interesting.

You are welcome to comment or answer the partial case, for example, when $d=2$, $d=3$ or $d=4$, and when $G$ is a finite group. Partial comments or answers are still welcome! 

You can determine the possible inflation of $d$-cocycle in $G$ by lifting to a larger group $G$, from the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. For $H/K= G$, with $BG$ path connected and $\pi_1(BG)$ acting trivially on $H^*(K, U(1))$, there is a spectral sequence $\{E^{p,q}_n, d_n\}$ with $E^{p,q}_2 = H^p(G, H^q(K,U(1) ))$. The differential $d_n$: $E^{p,q}_n \to E^{p+n,q-n+1}_n$. And $E^{p,q}_{n+1}=\frac{\text{Ker} d_n}{\text{Im} d_n}$ at $E^{p,q}_{n}$. We shall focus on the $d_2$ differential of $E_2$ page in LHS spectral sequence $$d_2: E^{p,q}_2 \to E^{p+2,q-1}_2$$ $$\Rightarrow d_2: H^p(Q, H^q(N,U(1) )) \to H^{p+2}(Q, H^{q-1}(N,U(1) )), $$ $$ d_2: H^{d-2}(Q, H^{1}(N,U(1) )) \to H^{d}(Q, H^{0}(N,U(1) ))=H^{d}(Q, U(1)). $$ If we want to trivialize the $d$-cocycle $\omega_d \in H^{d}(Q, U(1))$, we can look for a larger group $G$, where $G/N=Q$ for your $G$. However, all the examples above fail to demonstrate the successful inflation. So the answer to your questions shall be negative. There may be loopholes, but I could not find any examples either. So this is the best conclusion so far. 

First of all we can assume with no loss of generality that $\forall i\in A_k~:~ i>k$, because we can replace $A_k$ with $A_k'=\{i\in A_k | i>k\}$. Let $f:\omega\to\omega, f(i)=min\{j\in\omega | i\notin A_j\}$. Thus $f(i)\leq i$. Obviously, $f^{-1}(j)\cap A_j = \emptyset$ and, so, there exists big set $B$ such that $f$ is injective on $B.$ My main idea is creating of big set $A$ with property: $\forall i,j\in A : i<j \implies i<f(j) \leq j$. Such a set satisfies the conditions of the statement. Now let construct finite subsets $P_k$ of $B$ as follows: $m_0=f(b_0)=min f(B), P_0=\{b_0\}$, $ m_k=min\{s\in f(B) ~|~ s>max \cup_{n=0}^{k-1}P_n\}$, $P_k=\{b\in B ~|~ m_{k-1}< f(b) \leq m_k\}$. We have $\coprod_k P_k = B$. One of $\coprod_k P_{2k}$ and $\coprod_k P_{2k+1} $ is big and partitioned with $P_n$ where n is odd or even. Applying selectivity we get big set which can be taken as $A$. 

Thanks to @AndreasBlass and @JingZhang for the answer. First of all saying "Ramsey ultrafilter" I meant "Every partition of $\omega$ into sets not in ultrafilter admits a selector in ultrafilter". So-defined ultrafilter better to be called selective. And Ramsey ultrafilter can be defined as follows "Every partition of $[\omega]^2$ into two pieces has a homogeneous set in ultrafilter". This two definitions are eqivalent, so termins "Ramsey" and "selective" are used as synonyms in literature, which led me to some misunderstanding. If we know that this two definitions are equivalent, the answer is trivial, what was noted by @AndreasBlass and @JingZhang. But proof of equivalence is not trivial in part "selective" $\implies$ "Ramsey". Proof can be found in the book "Theory of ultrafilters" by Comfort and Negrepontis cited by @AndreasBlass. 

The discrete delta function $\delta_{v_1v_2\cdot v_2v_3\cdot v_3v_1}$ is unity if ${v_1v_2\cdot v_2v_3\cdot v_3v_1=1 }$, where $1$ is the identity element in $G$, and 0 otherwise. Note again that here, the ordering of $v_1,v_2$, and $v_3$ does not matter because of the identities $\delta_{v_1v_2\cdot v_2v_3\cdot v_3v_1} =\delta_{v_3v_1\cdot v_1v_2\cdot v_2v_3}$ and $\delta_{v_1v_2\cdot v_2v_3\cdot v_3v_1} =\delta_{\overline{v_1v_2\cdot v_2v_3\cdot v_3v_1}} =\delta_{\overline{v_3v_1}\cdot \overline{v_2v_3}\cdot \overline{v_1v_2}} =\delta_{v_1v_3\cdot v_3v_2\cdot v_2v_1}$. In other words, in any state on which $B_f=1$ on a triangular face $f$, the three group degrees of freedom around $v$ is related by a chain rule: $$ v_1v_3=v_1v_2\cdot v_2v_3 $$ for any enumeration $v_1,v_2,v_3$ of the three vertices of the face $f$. Here are how the space lattice and the triangulation of spacetime lattices looks like: 

The corresponding 3-cocycles of $H^3(\mathbb{Z}_n,U(1))=\mathbb{Z}_n$ are very simple: $$ \omega_{{I}}^{}(a,b,c) = \exp \left( \frac{2 \pi i p^{}_{{I}}}{n^{2}} \; a^{}(b^{} +c^{} -[b^{}+c^{}]) \right) $$ with $p_I \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ labels the element in $H^3(\mathbb{Z}_n,U(1))$. Also $a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}_n$. $[b^{}+c^{}] \equiv (b^{}+c^{})$mod $n$. You can check explicitly it satisfies 3-cocycles conditions. 

Due to the lack of solutions, I thought it will still be nice to consider a particualr case --- Here are the solutions for the $n=0$ case. Define $U(r) \pm V(r)=U_\pm(r)$, and $\partial_r U_{\pm}\equiv U'_{\pm}$, the $\pm$ linear combinations give $$ -a \partial_r (U'_+(r))+ (B(r) -\frac{a}{r}) (U'_+(r))=0 $$ $$ -a\partial_r (U'_-(r))- (B(r) +\frac{a}{r}) (U'_-(r))=0, $$ Thus $$ U_+(r)= c_+ \int_{0}^r dw \cdot \exp(\frac{1}{a}\int_{0}^w ds (B(s) -\frac{a}{s}) $$ $$ U_-(r)= c_- \int_{0}^r dw \cdot \exp(\frac{-1}{a}\int_{0}^w ds (B(s) +\frac{a}{s}) . $$ In the end, we can plug in to solve. $$ U(r)=\frac{1}{2}( U_+(r)+ U_-(r)) $$ $$ V(r)=\frac{1}{2}( U_+(r)- U_-(r)) $$ As for appropriate boundary conditions, one can choose the values of $c_+$, $c_-$ which are some constants to fit the boundary conditions. Maybe there is a way to deal with the general $n$ from here.
