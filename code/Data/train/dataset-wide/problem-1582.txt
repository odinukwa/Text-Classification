from Folkner et al 2014. I understand how spaceraft telemetry has been used to obtain highly accurate distances between Earth and the terrestrial planets. But I am not clear about how highly-accurate distances can be determined between those planets and the centre of the Sun. Question Do such (Sun-planet-distance) determinations still basically rely on (the more accurate Newtonian version of) Kepler's 3rd Law relating planet orbital period and Sun-planet semi-major axis distance? $$\frac{T^2}{a^3} = \frac{4 \pi^2}{G(M+m)}$$ What other methods or assumptions are used/involved? EDIT - Afterthoughts After further thought prompted by feedback from u/atmosphericprisonescape my question boils down to "How are the positions (over time) of the Sun's Centre tied-in (with sub-kilometre accuracy) to the 4D space-time array of triangulated, high-accuracy, telemetry-derived, Terrestrial planet position determinations. I guess that Kepler's 3rd Law is not invoked as such. Rather, high-accuracy (sub-kilometre) determinations of the position of the Solar centre presumably require (in addition to the high-accuracy planet positions) some specific deterministic "motivation model"; i.e. a model of motion-determining factors. These factors would include Newtonian Inertia, Newtonian Gravitational forces and Non-Newtonian factors leading to additional orbital angular velocity (cf Non-Newtonian Perihelion Precession and General Relativity as described at wikipedia/Apsidal_precession ). The "motivation model" would constrain the relative positions of the Sun and planets via their involment as motion generators, reactors and enactors. 

METHOD 3 Predicting Periastron Times and Cycle Durations from Orbital Phase ($\Phi$) In the answer by Stan Liou he uses a Taylor Series approximation of the Mean Anomaly to derive a nice formula which determines the CPTS (Cumulative Perihelion Time Shift) value as a function of $t^2$. This formula produces results very close to those graphed by Weisberg & Taylor. As it took me a while to understand how the Mean Anomaly can be applied for a decaying-period orbit I thought it useful to note here what I learnt and present a slightly different way of obtaining a formula to predict periastron times. Mean Anomaly basically indicates the phase of the orbit at a particular epoch, e.g. what time fraction of the orbit period has been completed. For Mean Anomaly the fraction is scaled by $2\pi$. Let $\Phi(t)$ be the phase of the orbit at time $t$ such that at the start of the orbit $t=0$ and $\Phi(0)$ = 0 and at the end of the orbit when $t=P$ (the period of orbit) $\Phi(P)$ = 1. I will assume that an orbit starts at one periapsis and finishes at the next periapsis. In a decaying-period orbital system the value of $P(t)$ changes with $t$. Here $P$ is the period of orbit. In a decaying-period orbit I will assume that orbital phase $\Phi(t)$ is completely specified by time $t$ and either $P(t)$ or $F(t)$, i.e. aspidial precession, progressive changes in semi-major axis length or eccentricity do not lead to significant additional changes in phase. In a decaying-period system the concept of period at a given epoch is somewhat abstract, it might be construed as a hypothetical period that would occur thereafter if the force causing period change ceased at that particular moment. Instead of period we can think in terms of $F(t)=1/P(t)$ where $F$ is the orbital frequency. I like to think of $F(t)$ as "the rate of change of phase with time", i.e. $F(t) = \dot{\Phi}(t)$. Picture an imaginary phase clock comprising a circular dial whose circumference has markings running from $\Phi=0$ around in a full circle to $\Phi=1$. The phase $\Phi(t)$ of our subject system at any given epoch $t$ will be indicated by a marker at a particular point on the circumference of the dial. Then $F(t)$ can be thought of as the speed at which the marker is moving around the circumference of the dial at a given epoch $t$. In a particular short interval of time $\delta t$ the (system state) marker will move a certain distance around the dial and this distance travelled will indicate the change in phase. The "travel" (change of phase) will depend on the value of $F$ during that time as per $\delta \Phi \approx \delta t * F(t)$. This is only approximate because F(t) changes during the interval $\delta t$. Now let us assume that the time interval $T$ between succesive periaspes is known and that the time of the first periapsis is at $t=0$. If $P(t)$ (and therefore $F(t)$ too) changed in a step-wise manner between time intervals, then we could write $$ \sum_{i=1}^{i=N=T/\delta t} \frac{\delta t}{P(t)} = \sum_{i=1}^{i=N=T/\delta t} \delta t F(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{i=N=T/\delta t} \delta \Phi(t) = 1. $$ To represent continuously-changing $P$ and $F$ we reduce $\Delta t$ towards zero and obtain these integral functions $$ \int_{t=0}^{t=T} \frac{1}{P(t)}\, \mathrm{d}t = \int_{t=0}^{t=T} F(t)\, \mathrm{d}t = \int_{t=0}^{t=T} \dot{\Phi}(t)\, \mathrm{d}t = 1. $$ At any time $\tau$ during the orbit ($0\leq \tau \leq 1$) the current instantaneous phase is given by $$ \Phi(\tau) = \int_{t=0}^{t=\tau} \dot{\Phi}(t)\, \mathrm{d}t = \int_{t=0}^{t=\tau} F(t)\, \mathrm{d}t = \int_{t=0}^{t=\tau} \frac{1}{P(t)}\, \mathrm{d}t. $$ and given a constant value of $\dot P$ (the rate of change of period), and $P_o=P(0)$ we obtain $$ \Phi(\tau) = \int_{t=0}^{t=\tau} \frac{1}{P_o + \dot P t}\, \mathrm{d}t \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad \dot{\Phi}(\tau) = F(\tau) = \frac{1}{P(\tau)} = \frac{1}{P_o + \dot P \tau}. $$ Using $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left( \frac{1}{f(x)} \right) = \frac{-\dot f(x)}{f(x)^2} \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad f(x) = P_o + \tau \dot P \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad \dot f(x) = \dot P $$ we get $$ \ddot \Phi(\tau) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left( \frac{1}{P_o + \tau \dot P} \right) = \frac{-\dot P}{P_o^2 + (\tau \dot P)^2 + 2 P_o \tau \dot P} $$ and for $\tau = 0$ we get $$ \Phi(0) = 0 \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad \dot{\Phi}(0) = \frac{1}{P_o } \qquad \mathrm{and} \qquad \ddot \Phi(0) = \frac{-\dot P}{P_o^2}. $$ 

$$k\,\frac {\pi\,m}{L \,c^2} = k \frac{4 \, \pi^3a^2}{c^2 T^2(1-e^2)}.$$ where $L = a(1 - e^2)$ is the semi-latus rectum of an ellipse, $m$ is a function of the angular speed $\omega$ of an orbiting planet: $m = a^3 \omega^2$ with $\omega = 2\pi/T$ and $k$ is a constant which might be derived from theory. Clearly with $k = 6$ we get the PPF formula given above. I wish to know where the $k\pi m/Lc^2$ expression comes from. From the article it would appear to come from the 28-page review paper by Oppenheim, 1895 which is scanned here. I have been through the scans of this paper but without finding that equation explicitly (the paper is in German which I know very poorly, Google Translate helps a bit but leaves a lot of ambiguity). It might be that the anonymous author of the article extracted the expression from a review of Oppenheim's paper or even the original (French & German) papers themselves, but he is not contactable. Maybe someone here is familiar with this era of astrophysical history and can point me in the right direction? 

Is there a standard mapping of symbols to terms for celestial and orbital mechanics (and physics in general)? For example here are some ambiguities Angular Momentum: L, H, J, $\Gamma$, Orbital period: T or P, M: mean anomaly or mass of the Sun, E: energy or eccentric anomaly, p: linear momentum or length of semi-latus rectum, a: acceleration or length of semi-major axis, e: eccentricity or base of natural logarithms,
