Edit: I also think this is a good reference: $URL$ Hope something in there helps. This was an issue for me as well when I began learning such things and it took me a bit of reading and practice to finally become comfortable with it all. 

This may sound silly, but also make sure you are ridiculously comfortable with algebra. Sometimes I feel like the unending onslaught of algebra is the thing that slows me down the most during exams etc. Edit: I'd like to recommend a book for math prep that covers almost everything I've listed: The Foundations of Mathematical Economics by Michael Carter It's a solid book with good exercises and readily available solutions to confirm your answers. Alright - I tried to give you some specific things rather than provide the broad strokes. I figure it is easy enough to know that you should study a subject and so I've tried to highlight what I remember being the important little bits of math that we use most often. Good luck with graduate school. 

Nope, every pure strategy equilibrium can be characterized as a degenerate mixed strategy equilibrium. That is, it is a mixed strategy in which a pure strategy is played with probability $1$. 

You're correct on the definition of the strategies: Albus' strategy set is $S_{A} = \big\{N,E,S\big\}$, and Minerva's is $S_{M} = \big\{a, b\big\} \times \big\{a, b\big\} \times \big\{a, b\big\}$. Remember, a strategy is a contingent plan that prescribes an action at every possible node at which a player plays. Then, the unique equilibrium (via Backward Induction) is $(N, b, a, b)$. The others you mention are not equilibria, because they involve incredible threats, e.g. if Minerva found herself at the decision node following a choice of $E$ by Albus, she would never choose $b$. 

1.) An economy with two agents who both have linear preferences will always have Pareto optimal points along either the right and bottom edges or the left and top edges of the Edgeworth box. Edges are dictated by the ratio of MRSa,MRSb. 2.) The contract curve is the locus of Pareto Optimal points. 

This is a very poorly written question. The gist of the question is this: should a company take a lump-sum payment from a customer of \$8,525 or a \$12k payment that is spread uniformly over 12 years. The thing the question wants you to consider between 1a and 1b is that in 1a the company cannot earn interest (which the answer just assumes is compounding) and in 1b the company can earn 7% interest. 

As a caveat, disclaimer, I am not too familiar with Evolutionary Game Theory and it is quite outside my research area/main areas of expertise. However, I can show here that range of $(a,b)$ for which $B$ is a best response is strictly greater than for either of the other two strategies. To that end, You can characterize the range of $(a,b)$ for which $B$ is a (strict) best response by solving the system $$\begin{split} 4−2b−3a &\> b+2-2a\\ 4−2b−3a &> 1+a-b\\ \end{split}$$ Or, $$\begin{split} 2 &> 3b + a\\ 3 &> 4a + b\\ \end{split}$$ Or, $$\begin{split} a &> 7/11, b<3-4a\\ a &\leq 7/11, b<\frac{2-a}{3}\\ \end{split}$$ 

I agree with the comments that suggest that the question is almost indecipherable. However, it should be easy, given the cdf, to derive the bounds. Why? Well we know for a cdf $F$, we must have $F(\underline{S}) = 0$ and $F(\overline{S})=1$. We can use the latter to work backwards from the upper bound i.e. We guess that $F(s)$ is of the form $$F(s) = k\bigg(\frac{S-v_l}{v_h-S}\bigg)$$ We must have $F(\overline{S}) = 1$ and using your solution, we have $$\begin{split}F(\overline{S}) = F\bigg(\frac{7v_h+3v_l}{10}\bigg) = k\bigg(\frac{\big(\frac{7v_h+3v_l}{10}\big)-v_l}{v_h-\big(\frac{7v_h+3v_l}{10}\big)}\bigg) &= 1\\ k\bigg(\frac{7v_h+3v_l}{10}\bigg)-kv_l &= v_h-\bigg(\frac{7v_h+3v_l}{10}\bigg)\\ \frac{7kv_h - 7kv_l}{10} &= \frac{3v_h-3v_l}{10}\\ 7kv_h - 7kv_l &= 3v_h-3v_l\\ k &= \frac{3}{7}\end{split}$$ Thus, I suspect that your mixed strategy for the high type is given by the cdf $$F(s) = \frac{3}{7}\bigg(\frac{S-v_l}{v_h-S}\bigg)$$ 

I thought it might be helpful to discuss the LS condition in general as it pertains to the LS equilibrium: A Lind./Sam. equilibrium allows for a unique equilibrium price $q_i, \forall i \in {1,...,n} \equiv N$, the set of agents, for the public good. The clearing condition for the public good price vector, given by $\sum MRS=MRTS$ (as stated in another answer here) is an aggregate condition. Individuals value public goods differently, which is reflected by vector $q$. To make it a bit more intuitive: If it were necessary that each individual contribute equally to a public good, then our idiosyncratic valuations would prevent some (or maybe many) of us from contributing to a public goods project (because the fixed contribution exceeds our individual, unique valuation for that public goods project). This could cause us to scrap projects that are actually socially desirable. And in easily conceivable circumstances, it can cause us to scrap projects that would be beneficial to every person in our society. The price vector $q$ does not necessarily comprise distinct prices. However, the question is can it? The answer to that question is, clearly, yes. 

History $(D,D)$ (Yes, this is with some abuse of notation.): On Path: Each player gets an average payoff of $4$. Deviating: Say player $1$ deviates and instead chooses $H$. Then the resulting sequence of actions is the alternating sequence, $(H,D)$, $(D,H)$, $(H,D)$,... Accordingly, player $1$’s sequence of payoffs is $(8,0)$, $(0,8)$, $8,0$... Player $1$'s average payoff is $(1-\delta)\big(8 + 0 + \delta^{2}8 + 0 + \delta^{4}8 + \cdots\big)$, which is $$(1-\delta)\frac{8}{1-\delta^{2}}=(1-\delta)\frac{8}{(1-\delta)(1+\delta)}=\frac{8}{1+\delta}$$ Hence, there is no profitable deviation here iff $$\begin{split} 4 &\geq \frac{8}{1+\delta}\\ 4\delta &\geq 4\\ \delta &\geq 1 \end{split}$$ Thus, $\delta \geq 1$ is a necessary condition (not necessarily sufficient because we still need to check that following tit-for-tat is still optimal for the other histories. I'll leave that to you!) 

Given a utility function of the form $U(a,b)=min\{a,b\}$. Suppose that currently $a<b$. To increase utility, you should allocate more of $a$ to this person until $a=b$ and then increase $a,b$ proportionally. 

When a country, or perhaps a country's central bank, prints money it is increasing the money supply. When the amount of money available in an economy increases, the value of the currency will decrease. So think about the capital flight from the Euro to the Kroner that is causing the value of that currency to spike. Printing money can basically cause a 'reversal' of sorts. That is, it places downward pressure on the value of the currency. So Denmark's banking authority might have some large stash of Kroner to meet the current demand. It can sell Kroner to counter-balance the new fluctuation in demand to keep its currency's value from spiking. Denmark might make this decision to avoid making its exports more expensive etc. However, it certainly does not have an unlimited supply of money. If it was willing to print an unending amount of money, Denmark's banking authority would actually be manufacturing hyperinflation. I've written this in a non-techinical fashion. Please let me know if you want more details. 

Say you have two distributions, $G$ and $H$ with equal means supported on (say) $[0,1]$ and $H$ is second-order stochastically dominated by $G$. Then, for any concave increasing $u$, we'll have $$\int udG \geq \int udH$$ This would correspond to Aigner and Cain, where the risk averse firm would prefer to hire an agent from distribution G. However, now suppose that $G$ and $H$ are distributions of talent (with the same stochastic ordering i.e. $H \succ_{C} G$). One equivalent notion to this idea is that distribution $G$ can be obtained by ``fusing" together part of the mass of $H$, i.e. by collapsing part of the mass to its respective barycenter. Given this, it is easy to see that there is always a cutoff $\eta \in [0,1]$ such that $H(\eta) \geq G(\eta)$. This corresponds to Heckman's result--if the job is sufficiently demanding, then it will be (at least weakly better) to be part of the high variance population. Moreover, note that this by no means depends on the expected quality of the agent. There are simply more of the highest quality people in the group with distribution $H$ than in the group with distribution $G$. They are not just more likely to exceed the cutoff, there are more of them that exceed the cutoff. Another way to think about the hiring problem is as follows: say a firm wants to hire one person but receives applications from $10$ applicants, $5$ from group $A$ and $5$ from group $B$. A candidate's quality is unknown and it it ranges from $[0,1]$ continuously. Suppose also for the sake of simplicity that the firm may observe the candidate's group (and so knows what distribution he/she is drawn from): the distribution of quality for group $A$ is given by $G$ and the distribution of quality for group $B$ is given by $H$. Interviewing a candidate fully reveals a candidate's type, but the firm has the budget to interview only $4$ candidates. Whom should they interview? The answer is simple: all four candidates interviewed should be from group $B$ (which has distribution $H$). Why? Because we can think about a candidate's quality as a random variable $X_{i}$ and thus the firm wants to maximize $\mathbb{E}[Z]$ where $$Z:=\max\big\{X_{1},X_{2},X_{3},X_{4}\big\}$$ Since $H \succ_{C} G$, $$\mathbb{E}_{H^{4}}[Z] \geq \mathbb{E}_{G^{4}}[Z]$$ Note also that $H \succ_{C} G$ $\Rightarrow$ $Var(H) \geq Var(G)$ but not $\Leftarrow$. In this sort of thing, I think it is stochastic dominance and not variance that is the apposite metric. 

I will try to do this at an intuitive level without being technical. If you want rigorous definitions of any of this I can edit my post. 

The Lindahl Equilibrium $y^*$ with quasi-linear preferences is uniquely determined. That is, $y^*$ is independent of individual consumption levels of $x$ 

I intend this as only a comment - it is just too long for the comment section: As it stands, I think you answer your own question. Lucas quantifies the impact of recessionary cycles by calculating how much an agent with a smooth consumption path would need to be compensated in terms of average consumption to instead endure a more volatile consumption path. He expressed the result as a percentage of average annual consumption. Remember, in economics more volatility usually implies more risk. And so what Lucas really did was create a function involving an agent's level of risk aversion that answered the question "how much do I need to compensate this risk averse person to endure 'this much' more risk?". As for your ending bit - you're correct. The idea you're getting at is called stochastic discounting. Essentially - I will pay more to ensure myself against a negative outcome whenever I believe that negative outcome will occur with a high probability relative to when I believe it will occur with a low probability. 

The Envelope theorem is arguably one, $URL$ . I would say Blackwell's papers on comparisons of experiments are a significant mathematical contribution--extending Hardy,Littlewood and Polya's earlier results, and paving the way for further investigation. Econometricians have made statistical contributions as well; see e.g. $URL$ . More recently, I saw a paper presented last year on how a certain type of stochastic PDE could be solved by reinterpreting it as a (stochastic) differential game. I would expect to see more related to this (the relationship between differential games and stochastic pdes) in the coming years, especially given the recent surge of interest in mean-field games. 

In your basic introduction to information economics, the two classic interpretations of screening with hidden information correspond to monopolistic screening or a principal agent problem. Viewing the situation through the lens of the principal agent problem; there is a firm who wants an agent to produce a good, and the agent has private information as to how costly it is to her to produce a good of a certain quality. That is there are multiple types of agents--if there is just one type, this is just the full information (first-best) case, and the screening problem is trivial. The producer's problem is to design a contract in order to maximize expected social value while minimizing the agent’s rent. The basic problem with moral hazard, on the other hand, need not concern an agent with multiple types. Instead, the agent has multiple choices of effort. Now, the principal's problem is to choose the optimal level of effort and the best contract with which to elicit that effort level. To sum up, in the hidden information (screening problem), there is an agent with a private type, and the principal designs a contract in order to maximize some objective, given this information asymmetry. In the moral hazard problem the principal chooses a contract in order to elicit the optimal level of effort. Finally, as a caveat, this distinction is only clear at the introductory level, where the problems are very basic. One can easily have more complicated mechanism design problems that incorporate elements of both. 

I think one might use either vector auto-regression or perhaps factor-augmented vector auto-regression to make such predictions. The later will allow an economist to condition on hundreds of time series to predict future unemployment values without encountering the degrees-of-freedom issues that plague VAR whenever VAR attempts to condition on larger information sets. Here is a paper detailing Kalman filtering and VAR for predicting unemployment: $URL$ TLDR: VAR does better than does KF. This is for Romania's economy, FYI. Here is another paper detailing the use of VAR to forecast unemployment: $URL$ Here is the seminal paper that introduced FAVAR: $URL$ Wiki for VAR: $URL$ within the wiki, you will find a link to the seminal paper by Sims that introduces the VAR methodology to economics. Fair warning: this paper is dense: $URL$
