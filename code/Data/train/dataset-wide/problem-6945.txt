It depends on what you mean by "sustained growth" and "flourishing markets". Clearly the Earth as a whole is a big market. If you do not look at human made borders: the global economy is currently growing and some would say it is flourishing. There is no physical reason why this could not be done without the borders. There are areas where the current technology cannot support the current population without outside help. An example is the heavily industrialized North Korea (which seems to motivate your question) which gets large amount of aid in food from the UN. 

There is more than one indifference curve. There is one belonging to every utility level. So for any utility level $c$, the points $(x,y)$ that satisfy $$2\cdot \sqrt{x} + y = c$$ are an indifference curve. For example let $c = 2$. Can you find a point $(x,y)$ that satisfies $$2\cdot \sqrt{x} + y = 2$$ and is on the $y$-axis or the $x$-axis? 

a) Your calculations are correct, but in order for consumption to be positive, so for $$ c_t=\bigg(\frac{R}{(\beta R)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}}-1\bigg)k_t > 0, $$ you will need to additional conditions. The first is the obvious $k_t > 0$. If there is nothing to gain interest on, there will be no growth and no consumption. The second is the more nuanced $$ \frac{R}{(\beta R)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}}-1 > 0. $$ This is actually a necessary condition for the existence of an optimal solution. The inequality may be reformulated as $$ \beta \cdot R^{1 - \gamma} < 1. $$ If this does not hold, then given any consumption path the consumer would gain by pushing off all consumption one period further. Since there is no infinitely distant timeperiod, no optimum exists. b) On reaching the balanced consumption path: Perhaps there is a trick with the indeces. $c_0$ seems ill defined unless there is a $k_{-1}$. If consumption only starts at $t = 1$, the above conditions are satisfied and the consumer is rational then $$ \forall t: \ c_t=\bigg(\frac{R}{(\beta R)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}}-1\bigg)k_t $$ defines the optimal consumption path as I assume $k_0$ is given and $$ \forall t: \ k_t = k_0 \cdot (\beta R)^{\frac{t}{\gamma}}. $$ Hence $$ \forall t: \ c_t=\bigg(\frac{R}{(\beta R)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}}-1\bigg) \cdot k_0 \cdot (\beta R)^{\frac{t}{\gamma}}. $$ It is straightforward to check that this path is feasible (if the conditions set out in a) are met) and balanced. 

A sufficient but perhaps not necessary condition would be if the demand functions of all consumers were decreasing in price. (Price ratio to be exact.) This would cause the aggregate demand to be decreasing in price, and since the aggregate supply is constant there could only be one equilibrium price. If there is only one equilibrim price then for each consumer there is only one utility maximization problem and it has a maximum. Denote by $\omega_m$ the initial endowment of good $m$. Let $e$ denote the income derived from the initial endowments given the prices, so $e = p_x\cdot \omega_x + p_y\cdot \omega_y$ Then the condition would be $$ \frac{d \ x(p_x,p_y,e)}{d \ p_x} = \frac{\partial x(p_x,p_y,e)}{\partial p_x} + \frac{\partial x(p_x,p_y,e)}{\partial e} \cdot \frac{d \ (p_x\cdot \omega_x + p_y\cdot \omega_y)}{d \ p_x} < 0 $$ This looks like the Slutsky equation so there are probably some theorems on what this implies, but I cannot readily say what this says about the underlying utility function. Most common examples (perfect substitutes, Cobb-Douglas, quasilinear) fulfill this condition. EDIT: I first said the perfect complement utility functions always fulfill this condition but this is not true. 

Using an example from the US treasury's website you can buy a \$100 dollar face value bond that pays 3% annual interest semiannually for thirty years. That means you would get $100 \cdot 3\% / 2 = 1.5$ dollars every six months, and at the end of the thirty years you also get \$100. In total you would get $1.5 \cdot 2 \cdot 30 + 100 = 190$ dollars but as it is explained in the link in Jamzy's comment adding up dollars in this case is not very sensible, because dollars in different years have different value. (If you disagree I would love to trade with you. For 1000 dollars today I will happily give you 1000 dollars 10 years from now.) The price you pay for this bond is determined by auction. Using this you can calculate the yield of the bond. (Again, please see the explanation in the link.) The answer would follow the same logic for â‚¬100,000. You can convert the euros to dollars or find a suitable European bond. 

While the total value of exports is a useful piece of information, here Europe means the continent, not the EU. Thus Norway, Switzerland and several Balkan countries are also included. It is not clear where Russia would fall under such a categorization so it is better to look at Eurostat's statistics. In 2015 the UK's intra-EU trade share was lowest among the member states but it was still 50%. 

Yes it is: If direction $$ x \succ y \Rightarrow x \not \precsim y \Rightarrow u(x) > u(y). $$ Only if direction: For all $x, y \in X$, $$ x \succsim y \iff u(x) \geq u(y) $$ implies $$ x \sim y \iff u(x) = u(y). $$ Also $$ u(x) > u(y) \Rightarrow u(x) \geq u(y) \Rightarrow x \succsim y , $$ $$ u(x) > u(y) \Rightarrow u(x) \not = u(y) \Rightarrow x \not\sim y. $$ and $$ x \succsim y \mbox{ AND } x \not\sim y \Rightarrow x \succ y. $$ 

In your second graph, how much quantity do you think is offered for sale at \$ 3000 if the supply curve is S? And how much if it is S2? Comparing S(3000) with S2(3000) would you say that given this price the new quantity is bigger, smaller or the same as the old one? 

I think a basic problem is that any utility function defines a preference, and discontinuous utility functions can be used to define discontinuous preferences. Hence there are many discontinuous preferences that can be represented by utility functions. An example: Let $U(x,y)$ be a continuous utility function that maps from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $(0,1)$. This latter may seem arbitrary, but the strictly monotononicaly increasing function $\frac{x}{x+1}$ maps from $\mathbb{R}_{++}$ to $(0,1)$, so it should be fine. Also define a closed set $H \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Let $$ \hat{U}(x,y) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} U(x,y) & \mbox{if} (x,y) \notin H \\ \\ U(x,y)+1 & \mbox{if} (x,y) \in H. \end{array} \right. $$ Obviously $\hat{U}(x,y)$ is not continuous and neither are the preferences defined by it. (The boundary of $H$ is prefered to anything outside $H$.) But the way these preferences were generated seems fairly general. So a large class of discontinuous preferences exists for which there is a utility representation. Future question: How 'large' is this class, what measure can be used? EDIT: As @NicolasPinto points out in his answer it is also necessary to specify that $H$ is such that $$ \exists x \in H, \exists y \notin H: y \succ x, $$ so $H$ is not the upper contour set of some point, otherwise $U(x,y)$ and $\hat{U}(x,y)$ would in fact represent the same continuous preferences. 

I am afraid the solution to world poverty will not be two pages long. Some flaws: You cannot simply give poor people in other countries money, their government controls their financial system. Even if the government agreed and you transferred millions of dollars it would not make more housing and consumer goods available at their location, they would just have credit. They could use these dollars to import the desired things but this may cause a lot of additional costs and again the government might interfere with large scale imports by controlling the distribution. On hiring soldiers in Syria: This was an idea early on, but how can you be sure that they are doing what you pay them to do? Also there might not be a sufficient number of soldiers for hire at the desired location. On giving poor people in the US unlimited access to basic goods. I like this idea, but to my knowledge no country in the world has implemented such a scheme. Also access to some goods does not eliminate crime, look at all the white collar crime that wealthy people commit or consider that they also struggle with drug problems. Humans are complex creatures who will always compete with their environment. 

Marginal cost is always the same as the shadow price in the cost minimization problem \begin{eqnarray*} \min_x && w \cdot x \\ s.t. && f(x) = y. \end{eqnarray*} In optimum the shadow price (Lagrange multiplier) belonging to the condition $f(x) = y$ is the marginal cost. However there are other optimization problems where the shadow price is something else, for example in the utility maximization problem \begin{eqnarray*} \max_{x,y} && U(x,y) \\ s.t. && p_x \cdot x + p_y \cdot y = m \end{eqnarray*} the shadow prices correspond to the marginal utility of money. (One could argue that this is the reciprocal of the marginal cost of producing more utility.) Neither of these examples had anything to do with equilibrium, just individual optima.
