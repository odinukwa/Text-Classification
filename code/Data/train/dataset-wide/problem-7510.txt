What I personally do is as described by Emerton in his post, and so the following is what other people have told me, and not perhaps totally my own thoughts. I have also heard that people do the following: post to the arxiv after acceptance by the journal but before giving the final proofs. Advantages: 

Actually, I'm not quite sure where this is explained completely basically in the literature. So maybe here's a hint, at least for Q1. The definition of $C^*(G)$ is that it's the completion of L^1(G) with respect to the biggest C*-norm. So if $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ is a continuous group homo, we immediately get a -homomorphism $\ell^1(G) \rightarrow \ell^1(H)$, and so by inclusion, a -homo $\ell^1(G) \rightarrow C^*(H)$. But this defines some C*-norm on $\ell^1(G)$, so the norm on $C^*(G)$ must dominate this, and hence we get a continuous extension to $C^*(G) \rightarrow C^*(H)$. For Q2, find a proof in the literature (I think this goes back to Godemont?) that $C^*_r(G) = C^*(G)$ if and only if the left-regular representation contains the trivial representation, if and only if G is amenable. Put another way, if G is not amenable, then the trivial homomorphism $G\rightarrow\{1\}$ doesn't induce a map $C^*_r(G)\rightarrow C^*(\{1\}) = \mathbb C$. 

You ask "In particular does it at all imply that the paper has little or no merit from a mathematical viewpoint?". Well, certainly not, in some sense. A book review, or an elementary survey article, might well contain interesting mathematics, and might well be useful to read (which also one can clearly understand why they wouldn't get a review-- a "review of a review" would be quite silly). As to my case (2.) above-- yes, perhaps this is Math Reviews (or an editor, or someone who was sent the paper to review) making that judgement. This does seem to be a grey area, as it's not covered by the "Editorial Statement" I linked to (except maybe in the word "elementary"). It would be interesting to get more information about this... 

When teaching Measure Theory last year, I convinced myself that a finite measure defined on the Borel subsets of a (compact; separable complete?) metric space was automatically regular. I used the Borel Hierarchy and some transfinite induction. But, typically, I've lost the details. So: is this true? Are related questions true? What are some good sources for this sort of questions? As motivation, a student pointed me to $URL$ where it's claimed (without reference) that (up to a slight change of definition) the result is true for finite Borel measures on any metric space. (I'm normally only interested in Locally Compact Hausdorff spaces, for which, e.g. Rudin's "Real and Complex Analysis" answers such questions to my satisfaction. But here I'm asking more about metric spaces). To clarify, some definitions (thanks Bill!): 

A link to the literature: I think of $C^*(G)^*$ as being $B(G)$, the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra, realised as a (non-closed) algebra of continuous functions on $G$. Any member of $C^*(G)^*$ can be realised as the composition of a representation $\pi$ on $H$ with a vector functional $\omega_{\xi,\eta}$ on $H$. The resulting function in $B(G)$ is $g\mapsto (\pi(g)\xi|\eta)$. Then $W^*(G)$ is $B(G)^*$. As the tensor product of representations corresponds to the product in $B(G)$, it follows that $G_{\otimes}$ is actually just the collection of characters on $B(G)$, namely algebra homomorphisms $B(G)\rightarrow\mathbb C$. Such things were explored by Walter in his paper "On the structure of the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra" It's shown that $G_{\otimes}$ is not a group, and that it contains proper partial isometries and projections; it is a semigroup though. 

This is really an extended comment, at least at the moment. As you mean "algebraically irreducible", for any $x_0\in E$ the orbit of $x_0$ by $A$ is exactly $E$, and so: 

Yes, I'm sorry, this is definitely a mistake. I don't know where that claim came from. As $X''' = X'$ for any set $X$, it follows that $CV_p = CV_p''$, and so also that $PM_p'' = CV_p$ if and only if $PM_p' = CV_p' = \rho_p(G)''$. As trivially $PM_p \subseteq \rho_p(G)'$ (as you note) we need only show that $PM_p' \subseteq \rho_p(G)''$. Spelling this out, if $T\lambda_p(g) = \lambda_p(g)T$ for all $g$, and $S\rho_p(g) = \rho_p(g)S$ for all $g$, then we want $ST=TS$. Like Yemon, I can prove this claim if $G$ is discrete. Edit: You can now find a full proof here: $URL$ 

If you are happy to work with the Operator Algebra approach to quantum groups, then Woronowicz's definition of a Compact Quantum Group admits a perfect analogue of the Peter-Weyl theorem (looking at unitary corepresentations). The Wikipedia page doesn't give any references, but a good (and freely available) survey is: arXiv:math/9803122v1 [math.FA]. But maybe this isn't what you're after... 

It seems to me that the problem is insisting upon contractive morphisms. In the proof above, if we just need, for each $\epsilon>0$, to find $g$ with $\|g\|<1+\epsilon$, then this is no problem. Is anything known in this generalised setting? (It's easy to see that then $\ell_1(\Gamma)$ is always projective, if I allow myself this wiggle-room). 

I can show the following (which Anton was asking about in comments). Let $X$ be locally compact and Hausdorff, and $U\subseteq X$ open. Let $X_\infty$ be the one-point compactication, so $U$ is still open in $X_\infty$. By the universal property of the Stone-Cech compactification, there is a continuous map $\phi:\beta X\rightarrow X_\infty$ which is the identity on $X$. Then $\phi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $\beta X$, and is just the canonical image of $U$ in $\beta X$. So $U$ open in $X$ shows that $U$ is open in $\beta X$. (This fails for general closed sets. If $F\subseteq X$ is closed, then $F$ is only closed in $X_\infty$ if $F$ is also compact.) I'll now use that $\beta X$ is the character space of $C^b(X)$. Let $U\subseteq X$ be open. 

Let $T:\ell^2\rightarrow\ell^2$ be the backwards shift operator, $T(a_n) = (a_2,a_3,\cdots)$. This is a contraction. For any $\lambda\in\mathbb C$, consider the sequence given by $a_n = \lambda^n$. Thus $(a_{n+1}) = (\lambda^2,\lambda^3,\cdots) = \lambda(\lambda,\lambda^2,\cdots)$ and so, if $(a_n)\in\ell^2$, then $(a_n)$ is an eigenvector of $T$, for eigenvalue $\lambda$. Of course, $\sum_n |\lambda^n|^2 = \sum_n |\lambda^2|^n <\infty$ if and only if $|\lambda|<1$. So even a bounded operator can have a continuum of eigenvectors. 

I more or less agree with Sheikraisinrollbank, but for the sake of argument... I've always found it slightly hard to fully separate "Is this paper interesting" from "Is this paper correct". It seems like mathematics (especially towards the pure end) is full of interesting, plausible "facts" we don't have proofs of. Isn't part of the point of maths to find rigourous proofs for things? So if I want to claim that a paper is interesting, it seems a priori necessary to have some faith in the paper being correct! Similarly, the "interest" of a paper, to me, is often bound up in the methods of proofs being used, not just the statements of the theorems (is this proof something which I would have tried if I'd thought hard, or is it completely from left-field?) So I'd want to read the proofs carefully, even if I wasn't "checking" them. So, if had to advise: Yes, you should read the proofs, closely. But checking every line? Perhaps not, unless something looks very off. 

Here is a counter-example. Which is sadly rather long. I use Haagerup's original paper for the definition of $T$ below. Let $M$ be the $\ell^\infty$ direct sum of the matrix algebras $\mathbb M_n$ with $\tau_M$ being the sum of the un-normalised traces on $\mathbb M_n$. Let $N$ be the subalgebra of all diagonal matrices, and give $N$ the ``weighted'' trace $$ \tau_N(x) = \sum_n \frac{1}{n} \sum_i x^{(n)}_i. $$ where $x = (x_n)\in N$ and each $x_n$ has diagonal entries $(x^{(n)}_i)$. Below I'll regard $N$ as the direct sum of $\ell^\infty_n$. Let $T:M_+\rightarrow \widehat{N_+}$ be the operator valued weight, so $$ \tau_M(y^{1/2}xy^{1/2}) = \tau_N(y^{1/2} T(x) y^{1/2}) \qquad (x\in M, y\in N). $$ In general, $T(x)$ is not bounded, so a little care is needed to define the right-hand side. However, it follows from this that $T$ must respect the direct-sum decomposition, and so we obtain maps $T_n:\mathbb M_n \rightarrow \ell^\infty_n$ which satisfy $$ \sum_i y_i x_{i,i} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i y_i T_n(x)_i \qquad (x=(x_{i,j})\in \mathbb M_n^+, y=(y_i)\in(\ell^\infty_n)^+) $$ Thus $T_n(x)_i = n x_{i,i}$, that is, project onto the diagonal and multiply by $n$. Suppose we can find positive matrices $a_n, b_n$ in $\mathbb M_n$ so that $\|a_n\|\leq 1, \|b_n\|\leq 1$, with the diagonal entries bounded by $1/n$, but with $n |a_n - b_n|$ having diagonal entries which are unbounded, as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Set $a=(a_n) \in M$ and $b=(b_n)$. By the assumptions on $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ we see that $a,b \in \mathfrak{m}_T^+$ but that $|a-b|\not\in\mathfrak{m}_T^+$. This is equivalent to $x=a-b \in \mathfrak{m}_T$ but $x_+\not\in\mathfrak{m}_T^+$. How do we find $a_n,b_n$? Here's one construction. Let $(\delta_i)_{i=1}^n$ be the usual orthonormal basis of $\mathbb C^n$ and let $$ \xi = \frac{1}{\sqrt n} \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_i, \qquad \eta = \frac{1}{\sqrt n} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \delta_i. $$ Let $a_n = a = \theta_{\xi,\xi}$ the rank-one positive operator, and let $b_n = b = \theta_{\eta,\eta}$. As matrices, $a$ has all entries $1/n$ and $b$ has all entries $1/n$ except for the last row and column which are 0. We claim that $|a-b|$ has diagonal entries of size order $\sqrt n$, to be precise, $|a-b|_{n,n}$ is about $\sqrt n$. I don't see an easy way to show this. I spent ages working out a formula for $|\theta_{\xi,\xi} - \theta_{\eta,\eta}|$ for arbitrary vectors $\xi,\eta$ in a Hilbert space, and then performed the particular calculation here. If anyone has a nice argument, I'd like to see it. 

For any bounded net $(a_j)$ in $E^*$ which is weak$^*$-convergent to 0, we have that $\|T(a_j)\| \rightarrow 0$. $S$ is a compact operator. $T$ is a compact operator. 

Well, maybe this is barely worth more than a comment. But... We always have a canonical map $\kappa:X \rightarrow X''$ which is always an isometry onto its range (thanks for Hahn-Banach). Then $X$ is reflexive if $\kappa$ is an isomorphism, that is, $\kappa$ surjects. Any standard book on Banach spaces will prove the slightly non-trivial fact that $X$ is reflexive if and only if $X'$ is. So, it doesn't really make sense to ask if $X^{(n)} = X^{(n+1)}$. However, we can ask if ever $X^{(n)} = X^{(n+2)}$. If so, then as Willie says, $X^{(n)}$ would be reflexive, and so $X^{(n-1)}$ would be, and so... and so $X$ is reflexive, so actually $X=X^{(2)}$ already. A famous example of James ($URL$ provides a Banach space $J$ such that $\kappa:J\rightarrow J''$ is not surjective, but we have some other map giving $J\cong J''$ (a slight modification even gives $J$ isometric to $J''$). Maybe you could ask for an isomorphism $X^{(n)} \cong X^{(n+1)}$. I'm not sure about that... 

As covariant representations biject with representations of the crossed product $A \rtimes_\alpha \mathbb R$, it seems that in principle knowing $A \rtimes_\alpha \mathbb R$ should be enough. But this seems terribly abstract! 

I don't see how to "solve this", unless you have some sort of "commutes" condition. (By "solve this" I mean give some sort of non-trivial characterisation.) Given that the easiest case seems intractable, I'm not sure the general case will be possible, unless you have further conditions. 

I think this is only true if $G$ is discrete. As $\pi$ is assumed normal, it's pre-adjoint would give a map $$ \pi_*: A(G) \rightarrow A(G_{disc}) $$ between the associated Fourier algebras. As $\pi(\lambda_{G_{disc}}(g)) = \lambda_G(g)$, the map $\pi_*$, considered as a map of function spaces, would be the formal identity on functions. But for any group $H$, there is an inclusion $A(H) \rightarrow C_0(H)$ which has dense range. So for $\pi_*$ to exist, we need that every $f\in A(G)$ is a member of $c_0(G)$. That's only going to be true if $G$ is discrete. Or another way: If $\pi$ existed then composing $\pi$ with a normal functional would show that every coefficient of $\lambda_G$, when viewed as a function on $G_{disc}$ would vanish at infinity, which holds only when $G$ is discrete.
