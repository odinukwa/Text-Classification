Hi, Can one define a Fubini-Study metric/Kaehler metric on the projective space of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, i.e. using the formula $\partial \bar{\partial} \log |Z|^2$? This should be very well-known to the experts. Anyhow I don't have much experience with infinite dimension and worried that something may go wrong. I appreciate any comments or references. 

Let $X_\sigma$ be an affine toric variety for an action of a torus $T$ and let $\mathcal{P}$ be a toric principal $G$-bundle over $X_\sigma$ where $G$ is an affine algebraic group (here base field $k$ is algebraically closed and characteristic $0$, in fact I am content with $k = \mathbb{C}$). By a toric principal $G$-bundle $\mathcal{P}$ we mean $T$ acts on $\mathcal{P}$ lifting its action on $X_\sigma$ and the $T$-action and $G$-action on $\mathcal{P}$ commute. My question is wether $\mathcal{P}$ is $T$-equivariantly trivial. By this, we mean the following: there exists a homomorphism $\phi: T \to G$ such that $\mathcal{P}$ is $T$-equivariantly isomorphic to $X_\sigma \times G$ where $T$ acts on this product diagonally by acting on $G$ via $\phi$ and left multiplication, that is, $t \cdot (x, g) = (t \cdot x, \phi(x)g)$. It is well-known and not difficult to show that this is true when $G = GL(n)$ (that is, one has a toric vector bundle). As far as I know by a result of Biswas-Dey-Poddar (2015) which itself relies on an earlier result of Heinzner-Kutzschebauch (1995), this is true for when $X_\sigma$ is complex affine space. I was wondering if this is known for other affine toric varieties. 

Hi, Let $I$ be an ideal in a polynomial ring $S = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Fix a term order on $S$ (e.g. a lexicographic order) and let $in(I)$ denote the initial ideal of $I$, that is, the monomial ideal generated by all the initial terms of elements of $I$. It is clear that for any $k > 0$ one has $in(I)^k \subset in(I^k)$, with equality if $I$ itself is a monomial ideal. 

Let $G$ be a connected reductive group acting on a projective variety $X$. Let $L$ be a $G$-linearized (very) ample line bundle on $X$, and let $R$ be the ring of sections (or homogeneous coordinate ring of $(X, L)$). Let $R_k = H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$ denote the $k$-th graded piece of $R$, and $R_{k, \lambda}$ its $\lambda$ isotypic component where $\lambda$ is a dominant weight. Consider the GIT quotient $X //_\lambda G$ i.e. $Proj(\bigoplus_k R_{k, k\lambda})$. Then one can define the volume of this GIT quotient $f(\lambda) = vol(X //_\lambda G)$ say as the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial of the graded algebra $\bigoplus_k R_{k, k\lambda}$ times $d!$ where $d = dim(X //_\lambda G)$. By homogeneity one can extend f to rational values of $\lambda$. (When $X$ is smooth $f$ is just the Duistermaat-Heckman function in symplectic geometry on the moment/Kirwan polytope.) Question: Under what conditions is f continuous at 0, i.e. as \lambda approaches $0$, $f(\lambda)$ approaches $f(0)$ (we consider $f$ as a function on the moment polytope and we assume that $0$ in on the boundary of the moment polytope)? Little bit weaker questions is: when can we find a sequence of regular dominant $\lambda_i$ approaching $0$ such that $f(\lambda_i)$ approaches $f(0)$? Clearly a sufficient condition for continuity of $f$ is that $X$ is smooth and $0$ is a regular value of the moment map. For example, is $f$ continuous under the assumption that generic orbits of the action of $G$ on $Spec(R)$ (cone over $X$) are closed? 

Suppose that we do not obtain a tree with distance matrix $M$ after running the algorithm, but that such a tree $T$ exists. Let $uv$ be the first inserted (weighted) edge such that $uv$ does not belong to $T$ (observe that if $uv$ belongs to $T$, its weight must be correct). Let $F$ be the forest obtained from the algorithm before inserting $uv$, and for a vertex $x$, denote by $C(x)$ the connected component of $F$ containing $x$. Note that $C(u) \neq C(v)$. Now, let $z$ be the neighbour of $u$ on the path from $u$ to $v$ in $T$. We have $d(u, v) = d(u, z) + d(v, z)$, implying $d(v, z) < d(u, v)$ (assuming strictly positive weights). If $C(v) \neq C(z)$, the algorithm would have chosen the $vz$ edge instead of $uv$, so assume $C(v) = C(z)$. But then, $C(u) \neq C(z)$ and $d(u, z) < d(u, v)$, again contradicting the choice of the algorithm. Therefore the $uv$ edge is correct. Of course, there is no guarantee that the algorithm reflects the distances of $M$, but if that's the case, it means that no tree exists for $M$. 

The following greedy algorithm should reconstruct the tree corresponding to a given distance matrix $M$, assuming it exists. Beforehand, one must show that $T$, if it exists, is unique, but unless you insist I will skip these details (informally, you can use induction on $n$: from a tree $T$ for $M$, remove a leaf $l$, use induction to get the unique tree for $M$ with the $l$ row/column removed, then show that there is only one unique place to plug back $l$). 

For some tournament $T$, let $\gamma(T)$ denote the cardinality of a smallest dominating set of $T$. Denote by $f(k)$ the minimum number of vertices of a tournament $T$ having $\gamma(T) = k$. From what I've been able to find, not much is known about $f$. We know $f(2) = 3, f(3) = 7$ and $f(4) = 19$. Past that we're lost. Results from Erdos and Szekeres-Szekeres showed that $$(k + 1) 2^{k - 2} - 1 \leq f(k) \leq (k - 1)^2 2^{k -1} C$$ (for suitable constant $C$) some 50 years ago, and I haven't any refinement of those bounds (except that $f(5) > 47$, showing the lower bound is not exact). I'm interested in the structural properties of a tournament $T$ of order $f(k)$ having $\gamma(T) = k$, but I can't find much except this paper : Domination and irredundance in tournaments and its references. Any references that describe $T$ would be helpful. In particular, I'm interested in the existence/non-existence of a constant $c$ that satisfies this statement for any $k$ (and for a large enough tournament) : 

Say we have a labeled, binary unrooted tree $T$, i.e. each node has either 1 or 3 neighbors. Denote by $L(T)$ the set of leaves (degree-one nodes) of $T$. For some $L \subseteq L(T)$, denote by $t(L)$ the smallest subtree of $T$ containing $L$. That is, $t(L)$ is the minimal (in terms of nodes) connected induced subgraph of $T$ that contains $L$. A $k$-partition $P = \{L_1, \ldots, L_k\}$ of $L(T)$ is called valid if for any distinct $L_i, L_j \in P$, $t(L_i)$ and $t(L_j)$ are vertex-disjoint. The question is : how many valid $k$-partitions of $L(T)$ does $T$ have ? Denote by $p(T)$ the number of such partitions. I'd like to know if this problem is known/has been addressed previously. I'd be happy with lower and upper bounds on $p(T)$. I'd also like to know if the structure of $T$ is relevant, or is $p(T)$ only dependent on $|L(T)|$ ? NOTE : this originates from this thing called the Perfect Phylogeny Problem, which has been studied for some time - but no one seems to have bothered with counting $p(T)$. 

Define a piecewise linear manifold that surrounds a component of the red set. Define an appropriate notion of curvature for piecewise linear manifolds. Show that if the sensitivity at a point is below a certain threshhold, the curvature must vanish there. Show that if the curvature vanishes everywhere, then the manifold has a geometric structure that is inconsistent with the nontriviality condition. 

The rest of this is devoted to fleshing this out a bit. Let $V = ({\mathbf Z}_N)^d$ for some integer $N$. (We don't work in ${\mathbf Z}^d$ because, for the time being at least, we don't want to worry about the possibility that the manifold we will construct is not compact.) Let $G = (V,E)$ be the cubical lattice, which is to say that it is the graph with vertex set $V$ whose edge set $E$ is the set of pairs $\{v,v'\}$ with $v_i \ne v'_i$ for exactly one $i$, for which we have $v'_i = v_i \pm 1$. Geometrically we will think of this as embedded in the torus $(\Re/N{\mathbf Z})^d$, which we endow with the obvious (flat) Riemannian metric. Suppose $V = R \cup B$ where is $R$ and $B$ are nonempty and disjoint. We can assume that subgraph of $G$ induced by $R$ is connected because we can replace $R$ with one of its components. We now want to wrap $R$ in piecewise linear cellophane, which is to say that we will construct a PL hypersurface $M$ that has $R$ on one side and $B$ on the other. The vertex set $W$ of this hypersurface will have one point in each edge in $E$ whose two endpoints have different colors. We now need to say what the simplices of positive dimension are. Let ${\mathbf e}_1, \ldots, {\mathbf e}_d$ be the ``standard unit basis''; we will think of these both as group elements and particular points. To be completely concrete, suppose that the origin is in $R$ and ${\mathbf e}_1$ is in $B$. Then $w_1 = \tfrac13 {\mathbf e}_1$ will be the point in the edge between these points where this edge intersects $M$. We need to define a neighborhood of $w_1$ in $M$. Let's first define the neighbors of $w$ in the 1-skeleton of $M$. Consider $j = 2, \ldots, d$. If ${\mathbf e}_j$ is in $B$, let $w_j = \tfrac13 {\mathbf e}_j$. If ${\mathbf e}_j$ is in $R$ and ${\mathbf e}_1 + {\mathbf e}_j$ is in $B$, let $w_j = \tfrac13 {\mathbf e}_1 + {\mathbf e}_j$. If ${\mathbf e}_j$ and ${\mathbf e}_1 + {\mathbf e}_j$ are in $R$, let $w_j = {\mathbf e}_1 + \tfrac23 {\mathbf e}_j$. Let $w_{-j}$ be what we get from this construction with ${\mathbf e}_j$ replaced by $-{\mathbf e}_j$. We would like to define $M$ to be the union over all such $w_1$ of the union the $(d-1)$-simplices obtained by taking the convex hull of $w_1, w_{i_2}, \ldots, w_{i_d}$ where each $i_j \in \{j,-j\}$. Of course we should verify that $M$ so defined is in fact a manifold, but I want to leave this aside and move on to the question of curvature. (If this construction doesn't work, maybe it can be fixed, or something similar does work.) There are of course many notions of curvature in differential geometry. For many of these it should be possible to define some analogue in the piecewise linear case, but any such project is likely to be tedious, and we would like to find some simpler way. For a surface in three space, the Gaussian curvature can be thought of as the determinant of the Jacobean of the map taking each point in the surface to the unit normal vector in the two sphere. If this curvature vanishes everywhere in some open set, then in this set the surface is locally isometric to flat two space. (This is a special case of Gauss' theorema egregium.) This suggests that we define the $dimension\; of\; flatness$ at $w_1$ to be the dimension of the largest linear subspace (I know we are inside a torus, but you know what I mean) $L$ such that near $w_1$, $M$ agrees with the sum of $L$ and a manifold $N$, and the sum of the dimensions of $L$ and $N$ is $d-1$. We would now like to study the relationship between the dimension of flatness at $w_1$ and the sensitivities at the origin and ${\mathbf e}_1$. Also, the dimension of flatness of the $M$ derived from the Rubinstein example may be a very useful guide to how to proceed. The general idea is that low sensitivity implies a high dimension of flatness, which in turn will have the implication that $M$ is the cartesian product (or a sum, algebraicly) of an $n$-manifold $N$ and a $(d - n - 1)$-dimensional torus. And of course there might be various other ideas to pursue in this general direction.
