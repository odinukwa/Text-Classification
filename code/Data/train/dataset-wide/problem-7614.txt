By Classical I mean something that could have been found before 1900 (say). A well known consequence of Bezout's theorem for plane curves is Pascal's theorem $URL$ . I am curious if there are some other statements that you find pretty that can be formulated (almost) as elementarily as Pascal's theorem and proven using higher dimensional Bezout's theorem? For example, is there some statement that involves quadrics, planes and lines (cubics?...)? Motivation. I ask this question since I want to finish to teach my (introductory) course in algebraic geometry by higher-dimensional Bezout theorem (using Hilbert polynomials, ect), and I would be extremely happy to give some pretty application :). To give you an idea of the level of the course, it is based on some bits of Harris book "Algebraic geometry first course", Disclaimer. I don't doubt the usefulness of Bezout theorem and am sorry if the original question sounded like I doubt it. On the contrary I based the elementary course in algebraic geometry that I teach on this theorem. Namely, the course starts with Bezout for plane curves (using resultants), intorduces projective spaces and varieties, goes through Hilbert basis theorem and Hylbert polynomials (last section of Atiyah-Macdonald) and then as an applications we get a proof of a simplest version of Bezout's theorem in high dimension. Also, It would be difficult for me to explain what I mean by pretty in math (for myself) but still I feel that the using of this word is justified, because we, mathematicians use this word... Sometimes we disagree on what is pretty, but personally I find pretty huge amount of facts in algebraic geometry. In other words I will be happy to see any application that can be stated in the language on the level of my course. In the comment I put the link to the question on stackexchange 

Let G be a p-adic group, U a (n appropriate) unipotent subgroup and I an Iwahori subgroup. Then there are Iwahori decompositions I\G/I=U\G/I=W where W is the affine Weyl group. I suspect that $$Uw_1Iw_2I=Uw_1w_2I$$ whenever $\ell(w_1)+\ell(w_2)=\ell(w_1w_2)$. Is this true? 

The dimensions of the stalks of Lusztig's sheaves give the coefficients when a canonical basis element is expanded in a PBW basis. These stalks satisfy a parity vanishing condition. For these positive results, see Corollary 10.7 of Lusztig's "Canonical Bases Arising from Quantized Enveloping Algebras". The first example of a 2-dimensional stalk at zero occurs in type A2, in dimension vector (2,2). If X is the variety of 2x2 matrices of rank at most 1, then it is not hard to see (e.g. using the Deligne construction) that IC(X) is one of Lusztig's sheaves and has a 2-dimensional stalk at zero. Alternatively the canonical basis computation can be carried out, which is implemented in GAP via the package QuaGroup. 

The answer is no. Here is an explicit example. Let $R=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$. Consider the matrix $$\left(\begin{array}{cc}1+\sqrt{-5}& 2\\ 2& 1-\sqrt{-5}\end{array}\right).$$ It represents an element of $PGL_2(R)$ that is not in the image of $GL_2(R)$. The motivation for this example is that the ideal $(2,1+\sqrt{-5})$ is not principal in $R$ and this should be relevant because the next term in the long exact sequence is $H^1(R,\mathbb{G}_m)$ (and so the sequence written in the question will be exact whenever this $H^1$ vanishes). I would love to see a more conceptual proof of the failure of $GL_2(R)\to PGL_2(R)$ to be surjective. 

Let Uq be a quantised enveloping algebra of type affine ADE (untwisted). By the loop presentation of Uq, we see that for each vertex of the finite Dynkin diagram, there is an inclusion Uq($\hat{sl_2}$)→Uq. Now let us restrict to the positive part U+ of Uq. It is well known how to construct U+ from the representations of the affine Dynkin diagram (given some orientation so that it becomes a quiver). This proceeds either by the Hall algebra approach or Lusztig's geometric approach with perverse sheaves. My question is: Can we see the appearance of the vertex embeddings discussed in the first paragraph via the quiver perspective? The obvious approach of trying to choose an orientation of our affine quiver so that it has a full subcategory (with objects of the correct dimensions) equivalent to the category of representations of the Kronecker quiver doesn't seem to work (eg look at E7 and the vertex of valence 1 closest to the central node). 

I am aware that the following result is a classical one (by now). But I am not able to understand who proved it. What should be a proper reference to this statement? Theorem. Let $M^4$ be a compact symplectic manifold with $\pi_1\ne 0$ and let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be two symplectic spheres embedded in it with $S_1^2=S_2^2=0$. Then $S_1$ and $S_2$ are symplectically isotopic in $M^4$. In other words, is there an article/book (say pre 2000) claiming that any two symplectic spheres with zero self-intersection in an irrational ruled (non-minimal) surface are symplectically isotopic? 

Take a convex polyhedron $P$ in $\mathbb R^3$ and remove all the faces, i.e. leave only the edges. Call this graph $E$. Let us now try to continuously deform $E$ in $\mathbb R^3$ so that all the edges of $E$ keep their length and remain straight (like metal sticks), but allow the change of angles between the edges. Question. Is it true that $E$ admits non-trivial deformations (not globally isomteric) if at least one face of $P$ is not a triangle? Note that if all the faces of $P$ are triangles it is not deformable by Cauchy's rigidity theorem: $URL$ 

Let $M$ be a compact connected manifold with an $S^1$-action. Suppose that $S^1$ has a fixed point in $M$. Is it true that $\pi_1(M)=\pi_1(M/S^1)$? I is there some reference or a short proof of this fact? PS. I am sorry for amending the question. In reality I only want to know that the kernel of the map $\pi_1(M)\to \pi_1(M/S^1)$ is finite. Is at least this fact true? 

This is not an answer to the question, I just decided to give for completeness a standard proof of the above statement that uses (a version of) Hilbert-Serre theorem. In this proof we need to use Hilbert basis theorem. In the above statement $S^G$ is clearly a finitely generated graded module over the ring of polynomials $\mathbb C[x_1,...,x_r]$, so it is sufficient to prove: Theorem (Hilbert, Serre). Suppose that $S=\sum ^{\infty}_{j=0}S_j$ is a commutative graded ring with $A_0=\mathbb C$, finitely generated over $\mathbb C$ by homogeneous elements $x_1,...,x_r$ in positive degrees $d_1,...,d_r$. Suppose that $M=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} M_j$ is a finitely generated graded $S$-module (i.e., we have $S_iS_j\subset S_{i+j}$ and $S_iM_j\subset M_{i+j}$). Then the Hilbert series $P(M,t)$ is of the form $$\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}dim(M_j)t^j=P(M,t)=\frac{F(t)}{\Pi_{j=1}^r(1-t^{d_j})}, \;\; F(t)\in \mathbb Z[t].$$ Proof. We work by induction on $r$. If $r=0$ then $P(M,t)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, so suppose $r>0$. Denote by $M'$ and $M''$ the kernel and cokernel of the multiplication by $x_r$, we have an exact sequence for each $j$ $$0\to M'_j\to M_j \to^{x_r}M_{j+d_r}\to M''_{j+d_r}\to 0.$$ Now $M'$ and $M''$ are finitely generated graded modules for $K[x_1,...,x_{r-1}]$, and so by induction their Hilbert series have the given form. From the above exact sequence we have $$t^{d_r}P(M',t)-t^{d_r}P(M,t)+P(M,t)-P(M'',t)=0.$$ Thus $$P(M,t)=\frac{P(M'',t)-t^{d_r}P(M',t)}{1-t^{d_r}}$$ has the given form. Where did we use Hilbert basis theorem? We use it when we say that $M'$ is finitely generated. 

This image is a bijection between the puzzle rule and the semistandard tableau rule for Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. It is taken from this paper of Ravi Vakil, where it is attributed to Terry Tao. The picture generalises to a bijection between rules in K-theoretic Schubert calculus, but I haven't seen a picture and don't currently have the patience to create one. 

I assume all groups are discrete and ignore Q3. Also I assume that π comes from a group homomorphism from H to G. By Poincaire-Verdier duality π! is the same as π*. Both of these are identified with restriction. Then π* is the right adjoint of restriction, hence is what I would call coinduction, while π! is the left adjoint of restriction, hence induction. In some contexts (e.g. p-adic groups), I've seen the right adjoint be called induction. The dualising sheaf is the same as the constant sheaf, hence corresponds to the trivial representation. 

I can give a general solution under the additional assumption that the long word acts by -1 on the root system. Let $\alpha_i$ denote the simple roots and $\beta_i$ be a vector orthogonal to all $\alpha_j$ with j different from i. Let (,) be a W-invariant inner product. The point: For any vector v and any w in the maximal proper parabolic corresponding to i, we have $(v,\beta_i)=(wv,\beta_i)$. A simple Lemma: If $(\gamma,\beta_i)=(\alpha_i,\beta_i)$, $(s_i\gamma,\beta_i)=-(\alpha_i,\beta_i)$ and $||\gamma||=||\alpha_i||$, then $\gamma=\alpha_i$. Since rank at least two, there exists a root $\alpha'_i$ with $(\alpha_i,\beta_i)=(\alpha'_i,\beta_i)$. and $||\alpha'_i||=||\alpha_i||$ Now if $w_0=w_1s_iw_2$ with $w_1,w_2$ in the max. parabolic, lets act on $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_i$. Since $w_1,w_2$ can't change value of inner product with $\beta_i$, and applying $w_0$ must multiply this product by -1, by our lemma we must have $w_2\alpha_i=w_2\alpha'_i=\alpha_i$, a contracition. 

Yves's answer explains why $BS(n,\pm n)$ is virtually (a free group) x $\mathbb Z$. In particular, it is linear over $\mathbb Z$, and so may be generated by automata. This is the statement in the article [BS]. 

The standard definition of computability, for a sequence $s\in\{0,1\}^\omega$, is that there is a Turing machine outputting $s[i]$ on input $i$. I'm looking for strengthenings of this notion; for example, in the above definition it's not decidable whether there is a $1$ in $s$; or, given $i$, whether there is a $1$ in $s$ at position $\ge i$. I would be happy to be shown a "natural" definition of computability that makes these predicates computable. To the above: if there were an algorithm that, from the Turing machine producing $s$, tells us whether $s$ contains a $1$ then I could do the following: from any Turing machine $M$, program a Turing machine outputting $s[i]=1$ if $M$ stops after $\le i$ steps. This sequence $s$ is obviously computable --- I said how to compute it --- but an algorithm determining if the sequence contains a $1$ would solve the Halting problem. A search through the literature didn't show anything, so links and references are most welcome! 

Irreducible representations of the symmetric group Sym$(n)$, and degree-$n$ algebraic representations of SL$_d(\mathbb C)$ for $d\ge n$, can both be classified by Young diagrams with $n$ boxes. Consider now a degree-$n$ irreducible representation of SL$_d(\mathbb C)$ with $d\ge n$, and restrict it to the subgroup of permutation matrices Sym$(d)$. What is its decomposition in irreducibles? Is there a nice way of listing those Young diagrams (with $d$ boxes) which occur, constructed out of the Young diagram with $n$ boxes of the original representation? 

Leclerc (arXiv:math/0209133) has given us an algorithm for computing the dual canonical basis of the upper part of a quantised enveloping algebra. Now presumably this algorithm has been implemented by someone somewhere. I am wondering if there are any precomputed tables of dual canonical basis vectors out there (or the software to compute my own). I do know that the quagroup package in GAP computes the canonical basis. I can't see an easy way to extract from that the dual basis. For immediate purposes, I believe I'd be most interested if the dual canonical basis vectors were given as elements of the quantum shuffle algebra, under the standard embedding of Uq(n)* into the shuffle algebra. EDIT. Leclerc (personal communication) informs me that he implemented this algorithm, but it is in an obsolete format. And also that one is likely to run up against size issues in trying to perform this task, since elements of a shuffle algebra have a lot of terms. 

Suppose f:X→Y. If I decorate that first sentence with appropriate adjectives, then I get a pushforward map in cohomology H*(X)→H*(Y). For example, suppose that X and Y are oriented manifolds, and f is a submersion. Then such a pushforward map exists. In the de Rham picture, we can see this as integrating a form over fibres. In the sheaf cohomology picture, we can see this via the explication of the exceptional inverse image functor. The question is how else can we think of this pushforward map. I'd be particularly interested in an answer from the algebraic topology point of view, because I'm hoping that such an answer would eludicate the appropriate level of generality in which a pushforward in cohomology exists (perhaps not only answering the question of for which maps f, but also answering the question of in which cohomology theories can we carry out such a construction).
