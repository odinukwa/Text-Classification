Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a toric variety, with $T$ a torus embedded as an open set in $\mathcal{X}$ (and where the algebraic action of $T$ extends to $\mathcal{X}$). As I am not a toric specialist at all, I was wondering if there is a simple description of the "boundary," that is, the closed subvariety $C_T := \mathcal{X} \setminus T$. Example: if $\mathcal{X} = \mathrm{Spec}(k[x,y])$ and $T \cong (k^\times)^2$, then $C_T$ consists of two intersecting (affine) lines. 

Is there a similar connection between non-closed points of $\chi$ and $\overline{\chi}$ ? Is there a similar connection between the other closed sets of $\chi$ and $\overline{\chi}$ ? 

Let $K_0(Var_k)$ be the Grothendieck ring of $k$-varieties for a field $k$. Let $\mathbb{L}$ denote the class of the affine line over $k$. Let $S$ be a $k$-variety and $[S] \in \mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{L}]$, say $[S] = P(\mathbb{L})$ with $P(\mathbb{L})$ a polynomial in $\mathbb{L}$. Then if $k = \mathbb{F}_q$ is a finite field, one has that $\vert S \vert_q = P(q)$. Call elements of $\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{L}]$ ''virtual Tate motives." I have read many times that ''after the Tate conjectures,'' if $\Delta$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-variety such that there exists a polynomial $P_{\Delta}(X) \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ for which $\vert \Delta \otimes_{\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})} \mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{F}_q) \vert_q = P_{\Delta}(q)$ for every finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, then for each finite field $k$, the class $[\Delta_k]$ is given by $P_{\Delta}(\mathbb{L})$. (Here, $\Delta_k := \Delta \otimes_{\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})} \mathrm{Spec}(k)$.) I have two questions on this subject. 

the case where $A$ and $B$ are affine schemes over $\mathrm{Spec}(k)$ with $k$ a field, or specific examples which behave good/bad ? 

I was wondering what the connection is between the notion of "prime congruence" on a monoid, and the notion of "prime ideal" in a monoid. Starting from a prime ideal $P$ in a monoid $M$, one can naturally define a congruence $\sim_P$ from $P$ (the Reese congruence), but that doesn't seem to be a prime congruence. Is there another connection ? Thanks ! 

Suppose $A$ is a $k$-algebra, with $k$ a field, and let $\ell$ be a field extension of $k$. Is there an easy way to see/recover $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ in/from $\mathrm{Spec}(A \otimes_k \ell)$, using the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(\ell/k)$ ? Important special case: $\ell$ is an algebraic closure of $k$. To illustrate my question, let $\ell$ be an algebraic closure of $k$. Then a maximal ideal $\frak{m}$ of $A$ corresponds to an $\mathrm{Aut}(\ell/k)$-orbit of maximal ideals in $A \otimes_k \ell$ (the maximal ideals in $A \otimes_k \ell$ ''over $\frak{m}$''). Is such a thing true for the other prime ideals (and for any field extension $\ell$, not ''just'' algebraic closures) ? Is there a similar way (so using the $\mathrm{Aut}(\ell/k)$-action as above) to describe the closed sets of $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ ? 

The Homology package for GAP (by Dumas, Heckenbach, Saunders, and Welker) doesn't sound exactly like what you want, as it focuses on simplicial homology, but the techniques it uses might be helpful for you to look at. It uses the LinBox C++ libraries for handling the linear algebra, and this might be useful in rolling your own. Available at $URL$ . 

Here's a short answer, assuming only that $C$ is an abelian $p$-group and $\vert D \vert$ is relatively prime to $p$. Remember that $G \cong H\rtimes K$ iff normal subgroup $H$ has a complement in $G$ isomorphic to $K \cong G/H$. A theorem of Gasch√ºtz says that a normal abelian $p$-group $C$ has a complement in $G$ if and only if $C$ has a complement in a Sylow $p$-subgroup $P$ containing $C$. Since $( \vert D \vert, p)=1$, we have that $C$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $A$. If $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $B$, then by counting we get that $CP$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Then $P$ is a complement to $C$ in $CP$, hence $C$ has a complement in $G$, as desired. $\square$ 

UPDATE 2: By combining my argument for solvable groups with Alireza's argument for (certain) finite simple groups, we can prove the conjecture for all groups having a quotient satisfying a certain condition. This very likely holds for all finite groups, but as I'll explain, a little bit of work remains on the group theory side. Theorem 1: If $G$ is a finite group with a normal subgroup $N$ such that $G/N$ is generated by (at most) two elements of prime power order, then $G$ satisfies the Frankl condition. Proof: A routine argument shows that we can pick $g,h \in G$ of prime power order such that $g$ and $h$ project in the quotient to generators of $G/N$. (If $G/N$ is cyclic, assume $g=h$.) Let $K = \langle g, h \rangle$, and notice that $KN = \langle N, g, h\rangle = G$. Then wlog there are at least as many subgroups containing $h$ as containing $g$ (else switch $h$ and $g$). This gives an injection $\varphi_1$ from the set of subgroups containing $g$ but not $h$ to the set of subgroups containing $h$ but not $g$. Moreover, if $H$ is a subgroup containing both $h$ and $g$, then $H \supseteq K$. It then follows from the Dedekind identity that $K (H \cap N) = H \cap KN = H$, hence the map $\varphi_2$ sending $H \mapsto H \cap N$ is an injection from $[K,G] \rightarrow [1,N]$. Since the intervals $[\langle h \rangle, G]$ and $[1,N]$ are disjoint, combining the two maps gives an injection from $[\langle g \rangle, G]$ to its complement, and we see the Frankl condition to hold. $\square$ Remark 1: The solvable case (above) is the case when $G/N$ is cyclic -- here, $K = \langle g,h \rangle = K$. The case where $N=1$ solved by Alireza has $K = G$, in which case we map $G$ to $1$ and all other subgroups containing $g$ to a subgroup containing $h$. Remark 2: The proof has a particularly pleasing explanation if we can take $g$ and $h$ to be conjugate. In this case, the intervals $[\langle g \rangle, G]$ and $[\langle h \rangle, G]$ are isomorphic lattices, with the isomorphism given by conjugation of subgroups. As we shall see below, this stronger conjugacy condition often does seem to occur. Now, if $N$ is a maximal normal subgroup, then $G/N$ is simple, so to verify the conjecture for all groups it suffices to verify that every finite simple group is generated by two elements of prime-power order. I managed to put together the following from results in the literature: Theorem 2: All but possibly finite many of the finite simple groups are generated by two elements of prime power order. The two elements may be taken to be conjugate. Any exceptions are classical groups. The conjugacy part will come from the following lemma: Lemma: If a finite simple group $G$ is generated by $x$ and $g$, where $x$ has order 2, then $G = \langle g, g^x \rangle$. Proof (of Lemma): Suppose not, and let $H = \langle g, g^x \rangle$. Then $H$ is easily seen to permute with $\langle x \rangle$, hence $H$ has index 2, contradicting simplicity of $G$. $\square$ We say a group is $(2,q)$-generated if it is generated by an element of order 2, together with an element of order $q$. To prove Theorem 2, it suffices to show that (modulo possible exceptions) every finite simple group is (2,$q$)-generated for some prime-power $q$. We go through the list of groups from the Classification Theorem. 

$f$ is confromal on $H$ $f(\bar{z}) =\overline{f(z)}$ thus $f(x+i0)$ is real, $f(z)$ constrained the the positive real axis is a decreasing function, $$\Im f(z)\le 0 \quad\text{and}\quad \Im \frac{df}{dz}\ge0\qquad \forall y\ge0$$ $$|\frac{df}{dz}| < \Re \frac{f(z)}{x}$$ 

As you can see in the right hand figure (in this case, the Gaussian, but the picture is similar for the uniform and triangle) $1/f(L)$ seems to be bounded in a strip. The heavy black line is the inequality $$ 1 \le \Re\frac{1}{f(1+i y)}$$ which is easy to prove. The dashed line, not so much. So the question: 

I have tried a variety of approaches, but i seem to need some stronger relationship between the real and imaginary parts of $\frac{df}{dy}$. From a distributional standpoint, picking $g$ to be a Cauchy distribution with the same modal height actually produces the dashed line, and picking $g$ to be the Dirac delta function produces the heavy black line.Maybe in some sense we can think of the space of unimodal distributions and identify the Cauchy and Dirac distributions as extremum. Any references/thoughts/suggestions would be muchly appreaciated. Cheers, Pete 

As far as literature goes: "From Kuramoto to Crawford..." - S Strogatz: $URL$ "Synchronization in Complex Networks" - Arenas et al $URL$ However, The special case you mention can be reduced to the mean field kuramoto model by introducing a complex order parameter. $ re^{i \Psi} = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^n e^{i\theta_j} $ So $\dot\theta_i = \omega_i + K_ir\sin(\Psi - \theta_i)$ Also, if you let $\omega_i \rightarrow \Omega + \Delta\omega_i$ and $\theta_i \rightarrow \theta_i + \Omega t $ where $\Omega$ is your mean frequency you get $\dot\theta_i = \Delta\omega_i + K_ir\sin(\Psi - \theta_i)$ with the mean of all $\Delta\omega_i$ are zero and most importantly, $\dot\theta_i = 0$ now corresponds to that oscillator running at your mean frequency. Now if $K_i >\frac{2}{\pi g(0)} \forall i$ with $g$ the p.d.f for your $\Delta\omega_i$'s, then you'll definately get a large proportion of oscillators synching to your mean frequency. (Strogatz' paper covers this derivation for constant $K$) How many is a tough question, depending on your p.d.f. For general $K_i$ i think Arenas' paper should provide a starting point. 

I'm trying to find information on the eigenvalues of an $n \times n$ matrix A such that $A = D + J$ Where $D$ is some complex valued diagonal matrix, and $J$ is an matrix consisting of all $1$'s. When $D$ has identical values, the problem is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues of $J$. So my question is this: If $D$ has non-identical values (specifically, non-identical imaginary components), is there an elementary way to compute the eigenvalues of $A$ ? The problem comes from linearising about the origin of a system of $n$ near identical coupled resonators. $D$ relates to the behaviour of each resonator, $J$ relates to the coupling process. 

The 1st question seemed interesting just because all of the main constructions (barycentric subdivision, CL-shellings) that give a shellable flag complex seemed to give a vertex-decomposable complex. On the 2nd question: A complex $\Delta$ is 1-decomposable if we can find either a shedding vertices $v$ or shedding edges $e$ such that respectively ($\Delta \setminus v$ and $\operatorname{link}_\Delta v$) or ($\Delta \setminus e$ and $\operatorname{link}_\Delta e$) are both shellable. The conditions for a shedding edge are similar to those for a shedding vertex ‚Äî see e.g. Provan and Billera [2] or Jonsson [1] or my own [3]. In a pure $d$-dimensional complex, it suffices that deleting the edge preserves pure $d$-dimensionality. There are also definitions of $k$-decomposability for higher $k$. Since deleting either a vertex or an edge from $\Delta$ preserves the property of being flag, a positive answer to Question 2 would say that you can always shell flag complexes in the framework of $k$-decomposability, without needing to leave the world of flag complexes. (This would be some kind of partial dual result to the fact that every shellable pure $d$-dimensional complex is $d$-decomposable.) Your complex I found the details of how $\Delta = \Delta(C_{16}(1,4,8))$ failed to be vertex-decomposable somewhat surprising. Any vertex (and thus every vertex) is a shedding vertex, and of course links are shellable (and presumably vertex-decomposable). But deleting a vertex leaves a non-shellable complex. Perhaps the easiest way to see the non-shellability of the deletion is to compute the $h$-vector, which (assuming I didn't make a mistake) is $[ 1, 11, 31, 18, -1 ]$. Since a Cohen-Macaulay complex must have a positive $h$-vector (and since $\Delta \setminus v$ is pure), this gives that $\Delta \setminus v$ is not shellable. The same doesn't immediately give a proof that $\Delta = \Delta(C_{16}(1,4,8))$ isn't 1-decomposable. Indeed, deleting the edge $\{0,3\}$ from $\Delta$ (or equivalently adding the edge $\{0,3\}$ to $C_{16}(1,4,8)$ and taking the independence complex) preserves pure 3-dimensionality, and leaves a shellable complex. You can continue this process with edges $\{3,6\}$ and $\{6,9\}$, but once you've deleted these 3 edges, $\{9,12\}$ is not a shedding edge. I suspect that you can continue this process somehow to show the complex is 1-decomposable, but I haven't checked it and don't know for sure. (I hear you have an undergraduate working on this, and it might be an interesting project for her/him to check this carefully).
