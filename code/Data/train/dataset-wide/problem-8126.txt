I would like to know if one can weaken conditions of Proposition 2.8 in $URL$ The proposition says that if an ideal $a$ in a ring $A$ is contained in the union of ideals $p_1,...,p_r$ with $p_2,...,p_r$ prime, then $a$ is contained in one of $p_i$. Why do we need to require that $p_2,...,p_r$ are all prime? What would be the simplest example where some of $p_i$ are non-prime and the proposition does not hold? It seems to me at least that if $A$ is a polynomial ring $\mathbb C[x_1,...,x_n]$ then one does not need to require that $p_i$ are prime. Am I wrong? 

Suppose $M$ is a connected smooth manifold with a smooth $S^1$-action that fixes a point in $M$. Let $X$ be a $K(\pi,1)$-space and let $\varphi: M\to X$ be a continuous map. Question. How to prove that $\varphi$ can be homotoped to a map $\varphi': M\to X$ that sends each orbit of the $S^1$ action to a point in $X$? I would be grateful for a short proof or a reference. Remark. I can prove the statement when $X$ is a negatively curved manifold, but I am confident that the statement holds as well when $X$ is $K(\pi,1)$. 

For one family of fractals there is a fairly straightforward method: If the set $G$ is the fixed point set of a number of similitudes $S_1,\ldots,S_n$ with contraction factors $s_1,\ldots,s_n$ then the Hausdorff dimension $D$ satisfies $$\sum_{i=1}^n s_i^D=1.$$ A bit more explanation may be in order: Each $S_i$ is an affine map on the form $S_i=a_i+s_iR_i$ where $R_i$ is a rotation (mirror symmetries allowed). These produce a map $S$ on the set of nonempty compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$, say, given by $$S(F)=\bigcup_{i=1}^n S_i(F).$$ This map is a contraction in the Hausdorff metric on the space, and $G$ is the unique fixed point of the map. There is one caveat: The sets $S_i(G)$ must be mutually disjoint, or almost so. For example the Sierpinski triangle: It is generated by three similitudes each mapping a given triangle to one half as big, so we should get $3\cdot(1/2)^D=1$. But the three subtriangles meet in three different points; however, these points are corners, and this counts as negligible. I apologize for not having a reference handy. I learned this from a handwritten note which likewise lacked references, and I haven't had the fortitude to go and chase one down. If you can read Norwegian, there is a proof in my small note here. The main idea of the proof is fairly simple, however: It's a question of covering $G$ by small balls and seeing how these covers scale under $S_i$. 

Consider the following classical construction (which is called Pfaffian representation as Sasha indicates): Let $ V^4\subset \Lambda^2 \mathbb R^6$ be a four-dimensional subspace of the space of alternating two-forms. Then the equation $a\wedge a\wedge a=0$, $a\in V^4$ is homogeneous of degree three and hence defines a cubic surface in ${\mathbb P}V^4$. Question. Can every real cubic surface be obtained by the above construction? If yes, is the set of corresponding representations for each cubic connected? I would be grateful for a reference if there is one. I am primarily interested in real case but if you only can comment on the complex case, this would be interesting for me as well. As Sasha says, such cubics are called Pfaffian cubics. 

Suppose $C_g$ is a smooth compact complex curve (of genus $g$), and let $J$ be its Jacobian. Recall that the Jacobian $J$ of a curve $C_g$ is a complex torus that can by obtained by contractions of all rational curves on the $g$-th symmetric power of $C_g$, e.i., $Sym^g(C_g)$. Recall also that there is a theta divisor $\Theta$ in $J$, depending on a point $p\in C_g$. The divisor $\Theta$ is the image in $J$ of the set of points $(p,p_1,...,p_{g-1})$ with $p$ fixed. Question. How to calculate the dimension of the set of divisors on $J$ linearly equivalent to $\Theta$? In other words, what is $dim( H^0(J,\cal O(\Theta)))$? 

a Lipschitz(1) hypersurface if for every $x\in S$ there is a hyperplane $H$ so that the orthogonal projection onto $H$ is a bi-Lipschitz map from a neighbourhood of $x$ in $S$ onto an open subset of $H$, and a Lipschitz(2) hypersurface if for every $x\in S$ there is a bi-Lipschitz map $\psi$ from $B\times(-1,1)$ onto a neighbourhood of $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ so that $\psi^{-1}(S)=B\times\{0\}$, where $B$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. 

In fact, the standard proof of Krein–Milman first proves the existence of an extreme point. Note (or recall) that a face $F$ of a convex set $K$ is defined by the requirement that, if $tx+(1-t)y\in F$ for $0<t<1$ and $x,y\in K$, then $x,y\in F$. Hence an extreme point is just a singleton face. The existence of an extreme point is shown by using Zorn's lemma (or Hausdorff maximality lemma) to show the existence of a minimal, nonempty, closed face. Use Hahn–Banach to show the minimal face is a singleton: If a continuous linear functional separates two points in $F$, then the set where it achieves its maximum in $F$ is a smaller face. (And to get started, note that $K$ is a face in itself, so faces do indeed exist.) 

This question is prompted by a great talk of Beauville: $URL$ The talk is called "Luroth problem". In this talk Beauville considers in particular Fano three-folds and says how one can prove that some of them are not rational. Still I was not able to figure out the following: is there any example of a rational (smooth of course) complex projective three fold that admits a deformation that is not rational? If yes what is the simplest example? 

Let $X$ be a smooth complex projective variety and $V$ be a holomorphic bundle on $X$. Suppose we have an algebraic $\mathbb C^*$-action on $X$. Is it true that the bundle $V$ can always be deformed to a holomorphic bundle $V'$ so that the $\mathbb C^*$-action can be lifted to an action on $V'$? UPD. It is not quite clear to me now if there is no some type of topological obstruction for such a lift, i.e., that the $\mathbb C^*$-action can not be lifted even to an action on $V$ as a topological complex vector bundle. I would of course be interested to see such an example if it exists, but then would be definitely interested to know what happen in the situation when the action can be lifted topologically. 

Just about every form of compactification. The compactification of a compact space is itself, and a compactification had better be compact or it shouldn't be called a compactification. The same thing goes for completion of metric spaces, of course. (I know, shouldn't post two answers in one for this kind of list, but they're closely related and trivially known for everybody. I put them here for completeness' sake (no pun intended).) 

For what it's worth (it's been a while), the treatments I have seen take the fundamental properties of equality (reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, plus axioms stating that you cannot tell the difference between equal objects) as axioms, though not really as axioms of logic. Rather, there are first order theories, and among them are first order theories with equality, meaning they have a binary relation “=” and associated axioms. Then one spends just a page or two working out the consequences of this, and later, set theory is just another example of a first order theory with equality. I wonder, though: If you drop equality and the axiom of extensionality, treating equality just as an abbreviation as you suggest, how do you prove that, if every member of x is equal to a member of y and vise versa, then x=_y_? 

Let $X$ be a smooth complex variety. Is it always possible to find an embedding $\varphi: X\to \mathbb CP^n$ for some $n$, such that the blow up of $\mathbb CP^n$ at $\varphi(X)$ is a Fano variety? Let us call the above class of varieties $F$-embeddable. How large is this class? How large is its complement? 

I would like to share one picture which shows how flexibility of polyhedrons with faces removed can be tested. This is an illustration for the polytope proposed by Joseph: 

The notion of orbifold is quite well established by now. I would like to ask how one should call a point of an orbifold with non-trivial stabilizer? Should one call this a singular point? Of something else? For some reason, I was not able to find any text that fixes this innocent bit of terminology concerning orbifolds. Comment. I would like to stress, that I want to know how to call A point (i.e. one point) that has a non-trivial stabilizer. Indeed, as Ryan says in his comment, there is some terminology to define the union of all points with non-trivial stabilizer, but this is not what I am looking for (for example, in algebraic geometry there is a canonical way to call a point that is not smooth, it is called a singular point)
