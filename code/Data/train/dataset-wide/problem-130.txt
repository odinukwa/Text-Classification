1 And then leave you there to fend of the xenophobic Krikkiters by yourself. I'm just joking - unlike Krikkit, this planet is uninhabited. 

You'd need a lot of calcium and vitamin D, but it's possible you could adapt to life on Earth. Muscle Atrophy: Something similar happens to muscles. In space, they aren't used to maintaining effort by keeping the body up. Therefore, they become weak. This would also be a problem for someone going from Mars to Earth. Their muscles would only be useful in relatively weak gravity. Wikipedia suggests the following: 

The page you linked says that they're about 5.7 meters (18.8 feet) tall. My immediate thought is that this height advantage should be used. The operator of the drone would need to use it to face enemies that are pretty big. Potential victims: 

Given that they're 2.2 kilometers underground, it looks like they can take advantage of the water table, the place where rocks are saturated with stored groundwater. The water table often holds aquifers, which can be accessed with only a bit of drilling. Is groundwater accessible 2.2 kilometers down? Well, they're certainly below the water table. I've found a map of the water table depth of Wisconsin (chosen at random), and it shows that the water table is seldom more than 50 feet below the surface: 

Well, it might. But only a little, for now. As others have pointed out, we only get a small portion of our energy from solar power. However, the Sun is indirectly related to other methods of producing electricity: 

1. Orbit a high-mass planet In the Solar System, two moons are covered with ice and have subsurface oceans: Europa and Enceladus. Europa orbits Jupiter; Enceladus orbits Saturn. In the case of the latter, jets of water vapor were observed, indicating an underground source. For both moons, the oceans survive through tidal heating by the giant planets they orbit. Energy is transferred to the moons, which heats up their interiors, keeping them warm enough for liquid water to exist below the surface. Now, you've described the home planet as having "heavier gravity". If the planet's mass is anywhere near the level of that of, say, Saturn, then you should be able to come up with some pretty good tidal heating. You just need to have the right parameters for the moon's orbit, composition and structure. 2. Snowball Earth RonJohn beat me to the idea of a snowball Earth, but I'll talk about it nonetheless, because it's a good option - and doesn't involve another body. Moreover, it may have happened, at multiple periods in our planet's history, and so it's quite feasible. Essentially, you need a terrestrial planet with a good supply of water - oceans. You then need some sort of mechanism that will cool the planet and lead to more cooling - a feedback mechanism. (We see something similar in global warming, where increasing temperatures unlock more greenhouse gases, such as through the melting of ice.) This means that the cooling will continue, rather than being damped and eventually stopped. This mechanism could be as simple as drastic snow buildup, which would lead to less heat being absorbed. Alternatively, some sort of mass reduction in greenhouse gases could reduce the heat trapped by the atmosphere. Both of these would be self-reinforcing, leading to a true snowball planet. They're better than one-time events, like an asteroid impact, because those effects will end on relatively short timescales (e.g. when dust dissipates). 

It's clear that the government would be more wary of sending troops directly into combat, or "putting boots on the ground" where people could die. The rich are powerful. They already influence politicians (well, maybe not Bernie Sanders) through "campaign contributions" and Super PACs, giving them more money to do things that will benefit them. One thing that will benefit the rich is to have their kids come back home - alive, not in a body bag. There will absolutely be this reluctance to send in troops, but I can guarantee you that it will only apply to certain troops. As you acknowledged, even the poor will have an incentive to serve, so it seems likely that there will be many more troops and G.I.s signing up. This means that the military will have more troops than it needs (except in times of war) and can afford to hold some back. Guess which troops will be held back, and guess how many zeros are before the decimal point on their parents' annual paychecks. The rich kids will get the safer jobs1 - remote surveillance, piloting UAVs from home base, gathering intelligence via satellite, etc. Chances are good that they'll have had great education, if they go to college before serving, and will be fit to do more than grunt work. So they'll get the safe jobs, while the poor suffer and die on the front lines. What emerges from this is a segregated military, in a way. The jobs that involve no actual fighting or danger will go to the rich. They'll control remote intelligence, cyberwar, remote surveillance, and the like. They'll rise to top positions so they can command from behind, while the troops will be made of poor blokes who are literally worth nearly nothing. The rich parents put pressure on politicians to give their kids cushy jobs, and the kids soon command the military, creating an even greater class divide, and maybe resentment towards the top of the heap in the military. Alienation between the front line troops and the generals, as well as between branches of branches of service, will lead to less unification and a less effective military. 

Image in the public domain. Most people probably won't notice the date. However, bank tellers will, as might cashiers and others who handle money on a regular basis. Various commenters have suggested that an exponential distribution is a more accurate representation of age: $$P(a)=\lambda e^{-\lambda a}$$ for some parameter $\lambda$. I'm inclined to trust them; I clearly was not thinking when I suggested a Gaussian distribution. I made the (incorrect) connection of mean lifetime $=$ most probable lifetime. 

Currently, the greatest tidal ranges, of about 16 meters, occur in the Bay of Fundy. Why is this the case? Resonance is apparently created by an alignment of the shape of the bay and the Moon, which happens in very few places (see also this paper). Without the coastline to interact with the water, the tides wouldn't be nearly so drastic. In your world, you would need tidal ranges roughly 187.5 times greater - actually, double that, since the depth of three kilometers is presumably from the mean water level. With no land above water, you won't see any tides nearly as significant. 

These are simulations that result in material being ejected into orbit, thus forming a moon - the same thing that happened with Earth. In a completely direct impact, this may not happen; the two bodies could be destroyed. However, your scenario will most likely lead to a glancing blow and a disk. Note that in the first simulation only, each planet is spinning in the opposite direction as the other. See also Stevenson (1987) for a thorough theoretical treatment, which also explains how collision timescales differ based on different impactor masses: 

Either way, it doesn't seem too conducive for life. Pre-planet-forming materials have been found around other brown dwarfs, though. As the first article said, 

The formula for the force experienced on an person with a mass $m_p$ from a second body $m_b$ is $$F=m_pg=G\frac{m_bm_p}{r^2}$$ Cancelling out the $m_p$s leads us to $$g=G\frac{m_b}{r^2}$$ We have $g$, $G$, and $r$. Let's find $m_b$: $$m_b=\frac{gr^2}{G}$$ Plugging in our values, we get $$m_b=\frac{1.6249 \times (0.711)^2}{6.673 \times 10^{-11}}=1.23096219 \times 10^{10} \text{ kilograms}$$ The volume ($V$) of the MMU is $$V=0.846 \times 0.711 \times 1.27=0.76391262 \text{ meters}^3$$ Density ($\rho$) is $\frac{M}{V}$, so we have $$\rho=\frac{M}{V}=\frac{1.23096219 \times 10^{10}}{0.76391262 }=1.611391353 \times 10^{10} \text{ kilograms/meter}^3$$ That's roughly 10 times as dense as a white dwarf. Not doable by humans. 

This is supposed to be a test of the hard-science tag. All answers to this question should be backed up by equations, empirical evidence, scientific papers, other citations, etc. Speculative or unreferenced answers, as well as those not supported by strong scientific theory, are not welcome. Long, comprehensive answers are desirable, but length and quality aren't always correlated. 

Traditional core collapse. In stars with masses ~8-100 solar masses, fusion of heavy elements will take place, eventually stopping at iron. Iron fusion is possible, but it consumes more energy than it releases, so it does not take place in nature. There is no outwards pressure - a star is in hydrostatic equilibrium, where the pressure from fusion balances the force of gravity - so the star begins to collapse. Electron degeneracy pressure starts to slow the collapse, but it is not enough. The core continues to collapse in on itself. Photodisintegration produces high-energy gamma rays, and inverse beta decay produces neutrinos. The core continues to collapse, while outer layers are pushed outwards in a "bounce" that is not yet fully understood. From here on, the mass of the star determines whether or not its core will become a neutron star or a black hole. The two main ways to detect a supernova of this sort are to detect the light from it or the neutrinos produced. The neutrinos typically arrive shortly before the light does, but the difference is not significant, often on the order of a few hours. By the time the neutrinos or the light reach the planet, its occupants will be toast. For excellent related analyses, see Lieb & Yau (1987) and Heger et al. (2002), which also discusses the type of supernova explored in the next section: a pair-instability supernova. Pair-instability. For stars with masses great than ~100 solar masses, gamma rays provide additional pressure against the massive outer layers. However, certain compressions can cause an increase in pair production, the creation of electrons and positrons from gamma rays. This reduces core pressure, leading to a total collapse. The star is virtually destroyed. Pair-instability supernova typically give no warning ahead of time. In fact, they are difficult to differentiate from normal core collapse supernovae. Careful analysis after the fact is the only way to make a constructive argument to this effect, often dependent on the amount of energy produced (see Smith (2007)). 

It's quite possible, and some animals already have them. Some arachnids have what are known as book lungs - small respiratory cavities that actually are not lungs, but different respiratory organs. They formed separately (in terms of evolution), but have taken the place of lungs in these arachnids. Some organisms with book lungs have them in two pairs, while others have anywhere from one pair to four pairs. The reason for this many is simple: The book lungs are small. That said, arachnids are (in general) quite small, but some of them are still too big to be sustained by only one pair (or one book lung). 

It really depends on when the crew discover the stowaway. I would bet, though, that they'll choose to restrain the person, report the incident to Mission Control, and then, after talking with Mission Control, abort the mission. Reasons for aborting: 

Open land, however, also draws people. Sure, Mesopotamia was the poster child for settlements by the water, but it wouldn't have succeeded without agriculture - which resulted from a lot of open land. Plains are helpful, as are valleys - which are often created by glaciers, which eventually melt to become rivers. Wherever it is, open land draws people. There are primary uses for it: 

I would think so! The clouds can really only go in circles. And because the artificial heat source could be controlled (yes?), perhaps the colonists could manipulate it to move the clouds in a certain direction. They could - to a certain extent - control the weather! Perhaps other apparatuses high in the "sky" could also exert influences to control the weather and keep it regular. Machines could seed clouds or release or capture moisture. I would think, though, that even without this, the weather would be regular. Either it would be stagnant - not a good thing - or it would travel in loops, depending on which way the wind (artificial?) was blowing. I'm not sure this entirely answers your question, but hopefully it's a start.
