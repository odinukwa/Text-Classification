So it seems the answer to your question, at least according to this paper, is that no, there are no observations of NTFs in other galaxies at this point in time. Are there non thermal filaments outside our Galaxy? I interpret this to mean, could there exist NTFs in other galaxies, and not so much have we actually seen NTFs in other galaxies. I think the answer to this, despite being a total guess with no proof to back it up, is a resounding yes. There's no reason to think our galaxy and it's structure/evolution is unique. Very likely NTFs exist in many other galaxies which formed under similar processes. This article by the NRAO details an attempt to explain where these NTFs originate from and the proposed solution is that they are a result of starburst activity. To quote from the article: 

I think the reason you're suffering from conflicting sources is that you're mixing both new and old, out-of-date pieces of information. First off, the book you cited was published in 2001 - 15 years ago - and the other article you cite was published in 1999 - 17 years ago. There's been a lot of work done in the past 15 years, often under the term "precision cosmology", in an attempt to really nail down the precise content, shape, size, etc. of our Universe. By the early 2000's we pretty much knew the science behind everything (we knew about dark matter, dark energy, had well-developed theories on the Big Bang, etc.) but what we didn't have, were good, solid, believable numbers to put into these theories, explaining why the flatness of the universe was still contested in your sources. I'll direct you to two incredibly important observatories which have been paramount in achieving our goal of having "good numbers". The first is the Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe (WMAP), launched in 2001, and the second is the Planck satellite, launched in 2009. Both missions were designed to stare intently at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation and try to sort out the treasure trove of information which can be gleaned from it. In this vein, you might also come upon the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), launched in 1989. This satellite had a similar purpose as the other two, but was not nearly as precise as the later two missions as to provide us with good numbers and definitive statements by the early 2000's. For that reason I'll mostly focus on what WMAP and Planck have told us. WMAP was a hugely successful mission which stared at the CMB for 9 years and created the most detailed and comprehensive map of its day. With 9 years of data, scientists were really able to reduce the observational errors on various cosmological quantities, including the flatness of the universe. You can see a table of their final cosmological parameters here. For the flatness, what you want to do is add up $\Omega_b$ (the baryonic matter density), $\Omega_d$ (the dark matter density), and $\Omega_\Lambda$ (the dark energy density). This will give you the overall density parameter, $\Omega_0$, which tells you the flatness of our universe. As I'm sure you know from your sources, if $\Omega_0 < 1$ we have a hyperbolic universe, if $\Omega_0 = 1$ our universe is flat, and $\Omega_0 > 1$ implies a spherical universe. From the results of WMAP, we have that $\Omega_0 = 1.000 \pm 0.049$ (someone can check my math) which is very close to one, indicating a flat universe. As far as I know, WMAP was the first instrument to give a truly precise measurement of $\Omega_0$, allowing us to say definitively that our universe appears flat. As you say, the BOOMERanG experiment also provided good evidence for this, but I don't think the results were nearly as powerful as WMAP's was. The other important satellite here is Planck. Launched in 2009, this satellite has provided us with the best high precision measurements of the CMB to-date. I'll let you dig through their results in their paper, but the punchline is that they measure the flatness of our universe to be $\Omega_0 = 0.9986 \pm 0.0314$ (calculated from this result table), again extremely close to one. In conclusion, recent results (within the past 15 years) allow us to definitively state that our Universe appears flat. I don't think, at this time, anyone contests that or believes it is still uncertain. As it usually goes with science, answering one question has only resulted in more questions. Now that we know $\Omega_0 \simeq 1$, we have to ask why is it one? Current theory suggests it shouldn't be - that it should be either enormously small or enormously large. This is known as the Flatness Problem. That in turn delves into the Anthropic Principle as an attempted answer, but then, I'm getting out of the scope of this question. 

The first thing you need to recall is that electromagnetic waves do carry momentum as well as energy. This shows up in effects like light pressure. Specifically a photon of wavelength $\lambda$ carries momentum $h/\lambda$. In and of itself, that doesn't answer your question though, since you are asking about the rotation of the pulsar, and changed to its linear momentum don't affect that. However, there are two ways this can happen. First imagine a rotating sphere which is emitting radiation from its equator. Consider a point on that equator. The radiation it is emitting "forwards" (in the direction towards which it is rotating) will be blue shifted (as seen by a stationary distant observer) while the radiation emitted "backwards" will be correspondingly red-shifted. Since the blue-shifted radiation has shorter wavelength, it has more momentum, the net effect is a force on the source which tends to slow the rotation. (interestingly, the same effect is used at much lower energy levels to trap ultra-cold atoms in what is called "optical molasses"). The second effect is a bit more technical. The radiation which is emitted towards the poles of the pulsar has a property called "circular polarization" and a beam of circularly polarized light carries away angular momentum. 

I'd caution that absolute statements are not good things in science. When Sagan says a natural satellite cannot be hallow, it is an absolute statement, but there's no way to 100% prove it true. That being said, everything we know about planet/satellite formation tells us that the chances of a satellite forming as a hollow structure (or becoming hollow afterwards) is pretty much nil. There is still much debate on the specifics of planetary formation, but the general process seems to be that small rocks and particles start to form, then they coalesce into bigger chunks and slowly that planetesimal grows in size. This type of formation process does not allow for the center to be hollow since it is the center which forms first! You cannot form the "edges" of your hollow planet and have those edges come together. Moons and satellites can potentially have a different formation path. Look at our own moon for example. It is hypothesized that a Mars-sized proto-planet crashed into the Earth, flinging out a large amount of material. Much of this material then coalesced into our current Moon. Again, this process doesn't really allow for making something which is hollow. Aside from the difficulty in forming a hollow satellite, you also have the challenge of maintaining the structure. Gravity constantly pulls everything to the center of the body. If there's nothing at the center, there's nothing preventing the outer shell from collapsing. It is technically possible that the satellite could not collapse, but that would require it to be fairly small and be perfectly structured such that the structural integrity of the rock forming the shell could withstand the crushing gravitational forces. Really though, such an object would have to be intelligently designed as the chances of it forming perfectly like that are non-existent. There's no possible way an object like Phobos could maintain itself without collapsing if it were hollow. 

As has already been said, the major sources of change to Earth's orbit are interactions with other planets and passing stars. We're ruling out mass loss of the Sun, so the next consideration is probably tidal interactions between the Earth and Sun. This paper suggests that the Earth is receding from the Sun by about 15cm/yr for this reason. This is 150 km per million years, so over a trillion years or so, would move Earth quite a bit further from the Sun. The effect would reduce as the Earth got further away from the Sun, but I think it would always be slowly receding. I haven't done the calculation, but I'm not sure it would ever reach tidal lock -- the angular momentum of the Sun is too high. Independently of this, though, orbital energy and angular momentum would slowly be lost by gravitational radiation. This wikipedia page gives a formula $$t={\frac {5}{256}}\,{\frac {c^{5}}{G^{3}}}\,{\frac {r^{4}}{(m_{1}m_{2})(m_{1}+m_{2})}}.$$ for the time to collision ignoring tidal effects. We can plug in known values for the parameters $r = 1.5 \times 10^{11} m$, $c = 3\times 10^8 m/s$, $G = 6.7 \times 10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$, $m_1 = 6\times 10^{24} kg$, $m_2 = 2 \times 10^{30} kg$ and get about $3.3\times 10^{30} s$ as the time to collision. I suspect that's the time until the centres of the Earth and Sun coincide, so the actual collision would be a bit earlier, but probably not enough to notice at this precision. So that's about 10 million million times the lifetime of the universe so far. I can't find enough information to work out how these two effects would interact. Clearly in the first $10^{12}$ years tidal evolution would be more important, but that conserves angular momentum and slows as the Suns rotation slows, whereas gravitational radiation actually carries angular momentum away, so might dominate in the long term. On the other hand the radiation drops as a high power of the separation, so we might have the Earth moving ever more slowly away from the Sun, while radiating gravitational waves of ever weaker strength, and never reaching tidal lock or starting to move back in. 

Overall, and this is entirely opinion based and from my calculations above, but I'd say the chances of the inter-planetary tidal heating having significant effects on the interior heat of of these planets is negligible. More than likely the biggest contributing factor is radioactive decay, followed by tidal heating from the star (but this is amplified by the eccentric orbits induced by planetary gravitational perturbations) 

The meteor hits the ground with such force and energy that it mostly destroys itself and you wind up with just a crater. Such an example is the meteor crater in Arizona - in a stroke of brilliance called Meteor Crater. I would hazard a guess that almost all meteor impacts are of this form, be it on Earth or elsewhere. 

This is the H-R Diagram representing the path of an intermediate mass star as it leaves the ZAMS. Most of the description I provided above is applicable here, in that the intermediate mass star follows the same process. There are only a few differences in the details. The major difference you may pick out is that as the star moves along the SGB, it actually decreases in luminosity towards the end before venturing up the RGB. This is simply due to the fact that after the core contracts and releases energy into the envelope, the envelope is so much larger than the low mass case, that it can absorb a lot more energy before needing to re-equillibrate. For a time, the core contracts, dumping energy into the envelope, and the overall star luminosity decreases because the core's energy has not found its way out of the star yet, but the star is now smaller. Once the envelope reaches its peak energy consumption it then expands, just as in the low mass state $-$ it simply takes more time and energy to reach this point. 

It's spread out in time. If a source emits a 1W pule of energy lasting 1 second and the receiver is receding so fast that it is Doppler shifted to a frequency which means the power is just 0.5W, then the pulse will take 2seconds to arrive (since the end of it had further to travel). 

Firstly do not confuse the event horizon with the singularity. Wikipedia gives the formulae for the Kerr metric. There are a number of places where this formula appears to break down because you appear to be dividing by zero, essentially whenever $\Sigma = 0$ or $\Delta = 0$, in the notation of that page, corresponding to the ergosphere and the event horizon respectively. There are two event horizons and two ergospheres but they all have the topology of spheres, one inside another (with some touching at the poles). However those are not singularities in general because you can choose other coordinates for space and time where the division by zero goes away. However you can't do this at points on the equator of the inner ergosphere, which makes those points a ring singularity. It is a ring with zero thickness (at least until quantum effects come in) .There is a helpful picture Flow of liquids doesn't really enter the picture here. One can think of the properties of this metric as a "flow" of space-time, but that's an analogy at best. There seems to be considerable doubt about what really happens inside a rotating black hole, or even, given that no information can escape from the black hole, about whether this is even a meaningful question. 

I'll just fill in the blanks with the math that Rob Jeffries alluded to. There's a variety of scenarios you can consider, but I'll just run through the basics of two binary stars, where both stars are distinctly visible. Such an example is Antares, a well known and rather bright star in the northern sky. Such a star system is usually referred to as a Visual Binary. If you want to solve for the masses of both stars, you'll need two equations. If algebra has taught you anything, it's that you need as many equations as you have unknowns if you want your system to be completely determined. Mass Ratio To start with, consider two binary stars of mass $M_1$ and $M_2$ which are located at positions $\vec{r}_1$ and $\vec{r}_2$, respectively. The center of mass for that system, $\vec{R}$, is defined to be $$\vec{R} = \frac{\vec{r}_1 M_1 + \vec{r}_2 M_2}{\vec{r}_1 + \vec{r}_2}$$ Now, you'll notice I'm defining the positions of the stars without setting up a coordinate system. Currently $\vec{r}_1$ and $\vec{r}_2$ have no physical meaning. I'm going to choose a convenient coordinate system such that the origin is at the center of mass. This means that $\vec{R}=0$ and we find that $$\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{\vec{r}_2}{\vec{r}_1}$$ This basic concept gives you the mass ratio, if only you can measure the ratio of the physical distance each star is from the center of mass. This is easily achieved by noting that a physical distance is related to the angular distance, $\alpha$, (something quite measurable with a telescope) by the relation $r=\alpha d$, where $d$ is the distance to the binary system. This allows us to say that $$\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_1}$$ As stated, $\alpha$ is an easily measurable parameter (more or less) by simply imaging the binary system with a telescope over a long enough time period. There's a bit more involved in this since I haven't talked at all about the inclinations of the orbits, but this is the basic premise. Mass Sum Now that we have a way of getting the mass ratio, the other equation we'll look for is the sum of the masses. Anytime you hear sum of masses, you should immediately think Kepler's third law. $$P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G(M_1+M_2)}a^3$$ In this equation $P$ is the orbital period, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $a = r_1 + r_2$ is the semi-major axis of the reduced mass system (there's some more math and assumptions behind this, but let's roll with it for now). This problem is as simple as solving for the sum of the masses. However, we'll also note that $a = \alpha d$, where $\alpha = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2$. Solving for the sum of masses gives us $$M_1 + M_2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GP^2}\alpha^3d^3$$ As stated in the mass ratio section, it is a bit more involved than this because I haven't said anything about the inclination of the system. If the system has an inclination, it will tend to muck up the math and make it more difficult, but the principle concepts will be the same. Putting it together You now have two equations and two unknowns. Let's solve for the masses. $$M_1 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GP^2}d^3\alpha^2\alpha_2$$ $$M_2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GP^2}d^3\alpha^2\alpha_1$$ 

While I agree with all the other answers here that no satellite flare has any chance of being bright enough to damage eyes or instruments there are concerns about them wrecking observations. Wikipedia reports that Iridium flares can reach magnitude -8 or brighter (Venus can be -4, the full moon is -12) and that could certainly be bright enough that scattered light from it would drown out some dim star or galaxy that you were trying to observe. If the flare can be predicted then you can always shut off the detectors for a short period, but some flares come from out of control satellites that are tumbling unpredictably. 

The short answer is "yes" -- the property of being a black hole. Assuming the collision is at a reasonably low relative velocity, the black hole would consume most of the mass of the star, so that eventually you would be left with a much bigger black hole and a certain amount of matter and radiation heading away from the site where the collision took place. The details of how long this would take, how much matter and energy would escape and so on will vary depending on the exact structure of the star and the details of the collision. Essentially you can't disrupt a black hole much by throwing matter into it (if the matter you throw in is VERY dense, like another black hole or a neutron star there will be some temporary disturbance to the event horizon, but it will settle down in a fraction of a second), all it does is absorb the matter and get bigger. Even if the matter is super-hot dense fusing plasma from the centre of giant star. In the course of falling in, the matter gets distorted and heated (much hotter than the interior of even a large star) and sometimes whirled around the black hole, and this can appear as a huge explosion, but in the middle of it, the black hole is sitting there absorbing matter, largely unperturbed.
