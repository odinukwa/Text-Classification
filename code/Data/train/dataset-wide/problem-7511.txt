Let $H$ be a Hilbert space and $T$ be a bounded and positive operator on $H$. Define a real function $f$ on positive real numbers by $$f(r):=\|(r+T)^{-1}\|^{-1}-r\quad(r\in\mathbb R_+).$$ Does the image of $f$ contain a positive number? 

Let $B(m,n)$ be the Burnside group on $m$ generators of exponent $n$. Suppose the class number - the number of conjugacy classes - of $B(m,n)$ is finite. Does it imply that $B(m,n)$ is finite? 

Is the norm on a unital semi-simple commutative Banach algebra with $\|I\|=1$, unique? ($I$ denotes the identity element) 

Let $\beta$ be a Hilbert basis for $H$. If $\tilde\beta$ is a finite subset of $\beta$ and $f:\beta\rightarrow \beta\setminus\tilde\beta$ is a bijection, then $$U:H\rightarrow H,\quad v\mapsto f(v)$$ introduce a partial isometry in $B(H)$ whose initial projection is $I$ and its final projection is $I-P$, where $P$ is a projection on the closed subspace generated by $\tilde\beta$. So $I\sim I-P\neq I$ and that mean $I$ is infinite. Also, if we choose disjoint subsets $\beta_1,\beta_2$ such that $\beta_1\cup\beta_2=\beta$ and $\beta$, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ have same cardinals, the argument like the one above shows that $I$ is properly infinite projection. 

update: I had thought you just consider the Künneth case.To give the relationship between the cohomology for general closed subscheme Z and the $pr_{1*}Z$ $pr_{2*}Z$ is related to Motives and algebraic correspondences.In the case that $Z=Z_1\times Z_2$，Künneth formula can expressed in the form $H(Z)=Hom(H(Z_1),H(Z_2))$ by Poincare duality (transfer tensor to hom),When Z is not as this form and $H_C(X,A)$ corresponds to$c^!RHom(p_1^*A_2,p_2^!A_2)=RHom(c_1^*A_1,c_2^!A_2)$ by kunneth theorem (c.f SGA5 III), in the case that Z corresponds to the graph of a morphism,it is isomorphic to$RHom(f^*A_1,A_2)$,we can calculate the $H_C(X,A)$ by Fubini-like theroem in SGA5 III proposition 3.4.But I don't really know how wide can this theorem apply 

I learn from SGA4$\frac{1}{2}$ Dualité Proposition 3.4 that Tr($\phi$(u)$\cup x$)=$\phi (x)$,where $\phi$ is a homomorphism $\phi$: $H^1_c(X,\mu_n) \to \mathbb{Z}/n$ and u is the (1,1) part of diagonal class $H^2_{\Delta}(X\times \bar{X},j_!\mu_n)$ which can be proved agrees with "de son image réciproque par $f_0$:$X\to Pic_D^0(\bar{X})$"in $H^1_c(X,Pic_D^0(\bar{X})）$ . Maybe we can assume that $\phi$ is $\frac{g(X+S)}{g(X)}$ where g is the function associate with the point $T\in A[n]$ used to define Weil-pairing.My question: How to prove $\phi(u)$ is the divisor corresponding to T and the agreement of the pairing？ 

We may say that two finitely generated groups $G$ and $H$ are generating-bijective when there exist homomorphisms $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ and $\psi:H\rightarrow G$ such that, for each ordered generating sets $\mathfrak g$ and $\mathfrak h$ of $G$ and $H$, resp. we can find ordered generating sets $\mathfrak h'$ and $\mathfrak g'$ of $H$ and $G$ resp. such that $$\phi(\mathfrak g')=\mathfrak h,\quad \psi(\mathfrak h')=\mathfrak g$$ Do there exist finitely generated groups $G$ and $H$ along with epimorphisms $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ and $\psi:H\rightarrow G$, such that $G$ and $H$ aren't generating-bijective? 

Having $\overline{\text{Im}M^2}=\overline{\text{Im}M}=\overline{\text{Im}M^\frac12}$, we obtain that $M\overline{\text{Im}M}$ is a dense subset of $\overline{\text{Im}M^2}=\overline{\text{Im}M}=\overline{\text{Im}M^\frac12}$, so \begin{align} \text{The norm of}\,S&=\sup\{\|y\|^{-1}_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}\|Sy\|_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}: 0\neq y\in \overline{\text{Im}M^\frac12}\}\\ &=\sup\{\|y\|^{-1}_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}\|Sy\|_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}: 0\neq y\in M\overline{\text{Im}M}\}\\ &=\sup\{\|Mx\|^{-1}_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}\|SMx\|_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}: 0\neq x\in \overline{\text{Im}M}\} \end{align} 

Denote by $\precsim$ the order comes from "Murray-von Neumann" equivalence in the projection lattice of a von Numann algebra. Let $e$ and $f$ be two projection in a von Numann algebra $\mathfrak M$. Why is there a central projection $p$ such that $$ep\precsim‎ fp\quad \text{and}\quad (1-e)(1-p)\precsim‎(1-f)(1-p).$$ 

The equality follows directly from the definition of a connection, and is independent of the context of lifting structure groups, or degree three cohomology. Recall that a connection on a principal $G$-bundle $\pi:P \to M$ is a 1-form $\omega \in \Omega^1(P,\mathfrak{g})$ such that $$ p_2^{\ast}\omega = Ad_g^{-1} (p_1^{\ast}\omega) + g^{\ast}\theta $$ over $P \times_M P$, where $p_1,p_2: P \times_M P \to P$ are the two projections, and $g: P \times_M P \to G$ is the difference map defined by $g(p,p')\cdot p=p'$. Here $g^\ast\theta=g^{-1}dg$, whatever notation is preferred. Now, if $b: P \to G$ is a smooth map, it induces a map $$ \tilde b: P \to P \times_M P: p \mapsto (p\cdot b(p),p). $$ Pullback of above defining equation along $\tilde b$ produces $$ \omega = Ad_b(b_{\ast}\omega)+b^*\theta. $$ If $b$ is central, this is your equation. This works of course also, if $b:M \to G$ is defined on the base (you didn't say clearly where $b$ is defined). Then use $b' := b \circ \pi$ instead. 

Let $G$ be a l.c. group and $f$ belong to $C_c(G)$, the space of continuous functions with compact support. Define an operator$T_f$ on $L^2(G)$ by $T_f(g)=f*g$ (the convolution product). If $T_f$ is positive and invertible, could $\|T_f\|$ belong to the point spectrum of $T_f$? 

Do there exist an amenable Beurling algebra that is neither Arens regular nor strongly Arens irregular? In his memoir "The second duals of Beurling algebras", A. T. Lau proved that there exists a weight $\omega$ on $\mathbb Z$ such that $\ell^1(\mathbb Z,\omega)$ is neither Arens regular nor strongly Arens irregular, but this algebra is not amenable. 

For Banach spaces $E$ and $F$ we denote the approximate operators by $\mathcal A(E,F)$ and projective tensor product by $\hat\otimes$. Consider the natural map $$\Delta: \mathcal A(\ell^q,\ell^p)\hat\otimes\mathcal A(\ell^p,\ell^q)\rightarrow \mathcal A(\ell^p), \quad S\otimes T\mapsto ST$$ Can we write elements in image of $\Delta$ in form of $TS$ where $T\in\mathcal A(\ell^q,\ell^p)$ and $S\in\mathcal A(\ell^p,\ell^q)$? 

In Freitag and Kiehl's etale cohomology book p206,$H(X_e,Rj_*(\Lambda|_{X_{\eta}}))\to H(X_{es},i^* Rj_*(\Lambda|_{X_{\eta}})$is a isomorphism,where X is a proper scheme and smooth over the base scheme S at all the point of Y, the complement of the scheme $X_e$. If $X_e$ is proper,it is easily derived from the proper base change theorem.In this book,authors argue that,when F is locally constant,the $R\Gamma_Y F$ has the base change property,but I don't understand how they do this(The purity theorem is only proved in the case that X and Y are both smooth.)So how to prove this formula? 

It's well known the relationship between Poincare duality and Thom isomorphism（I mean cohomology purity $R^q i^! F=0$ if $q\neq c $ ) $\quad $ $Rf_!Ri_!=R(f|_Z)_!$ where f is $P_k^n\rightarrow k$ and Z is a close subscheme of P,i the closed immersion so Verdier duality $R(f|_Z)^! \tilde {=}Ri^!Rf^!$,and the cohomology purity can be proved by smooth base change, cohomology ring of$P^n_k$ can be calculated as well. My question is：can we bulid up Poincare duality in this way? 

Let $E$ be a reflexive Banach space. Let $\{x_n\}_n$ be a bounded sequence of linearly independent elements of $E$. Does there exist a sequence $\{\phi_n\}_n$ of elements of $E^*$ (the dual of $E$) such that $\langle x_n,\phi_m\rangle=\delta_{mn}$ and $\sum\|\phi_n\|<\infty$. As Nate Eldredge's argument below shows, there is not such sequence $\{\phi_n\}$. Indeed I have a bounded sequence $\{y_n\}$ and I want to know if there is a bounded operator $T\in\mathcal L(E)$ such that $Tx_n=y_n$ for a bounded sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $E$. I thought if $\{x_n\}$ is a bounded linearly independent sequence, then one can define $T=\sum y_n\odot \phi_n$ which $\{\phi_n\}$ is as above. So my main question is that if there is such an operator $T$? 

Let $H_0:=(\ker M)^\perp$ and $E$ be the projection on $H_0$. Then $$[\xi,\eta]:=\langle M\xi,\eta\rangle\quad(\xi,\eta\in H_0)$$ define an inner product on $H_0$. Assume that $H$ is a completion of $H_0$ w.r.t. the norm, $\||\cdot\||$ induced by $[\cdot,\cdot]$. It is easy to show that for $S\in\mathcal B(F)$, $S\in\mathcal B_M(F)$ iff $ES|_{H_0}\in\mathcal B(H)$ and $\|S\|_M$ is just the norm of $ES|_{H_0}$ in $\mathcal B(H)$. So the result you want follows from the fact you mentioned ($r(T)\leq w(T)$). 

The problem is the gluing axiom for this stack. To state it, you have to decide for a Grothendieck topology on the category of smooth manifolds. Here you have again the two choices 1 and 2, and some more. According to the calculations I just did (and I should add that it's late and I am tired), all four possible combinations work. So it's again up to you! Personally, I have a preference for the submersions. If you require fibre bundles, it seems that the manifolds in a "connected component" of the stack are all diffeomorphic, whereas it should be possible to smoothly change the diffeomorphism type. 

gives a definition of the de Rham-homomorphism (§ 6.74). For a general diffeological space, there is no chance that it is an isomorphism. Note that the usual proof one gives for smooth manifolds uses that smooth manifolds are paracompact. The topology of a general diffeological space, however, does not have to be paracompact. Already for infinte-dimensional manifolds (still a subclass of diffeological spaces) one has to require "smooth paracompactness" separately (see Theorem 34.7 in: Kriegl, Michor: The convenient setting of global Analysis). 

I saw it as an exercise (E1.4.2) in the book "Analysis Now" by "Gert. K. Pedersen" with slight difference; $f$ is defined by $$f:\mathbb R\rightarrow\mathbb R,\quad x\mapsto\limsup\frac1n{\sum_{k=1}^nx_n}$$ where $x-\lfloor x\rfloor=0.x_1x_2\dots$ is the binary expansion of the fractional part of $x$. 

Denote by $U(M)$ the group of unitary elements of a von Neumann algebra $M$. $\rho|_A$ is inner iff $u\in U(A)U(A')$. Assume first that $u\in U(A)U(A')$, so there are $v\in U(A)$ and $w\in U(A')$ with $u=vw$. Then for $a\in A$ we have $$\rho(a)=uau^*=vwaw^*v^*=vav^*$$ On the other hand, if there exist $v\in U(A)$ such that $uau^*=\rho(a)=vav^*$, then $v^*ua=av^*u$, $a\in A$, whence $v^*u\in U(A')$ and $u=v(v^*u)\in U(A)U(A')$ 

It is obvious that for a Banach space $E$, $E$ is reflexive iff $\ell^2(E)$ is reflexive. Let $\mathcal U$ be an ultrafilter. Is the reflexivity of $(E)_\mathcal U$ equivalent to refelxivity of $(\ell^2(E))_\mathcal U$? 

Let $A$ be a Banach algebra and $E$ be an irreducible Banach $A$-module. Is there a countably incomplete ultra filter $\mathcal U$ on $\mathbb N$, the set of natural numbers, such that the ultra power $(E)_\mathcal U$ becomes an irreducible Banach $A$-module? (The Banach $A$-module, $E$, which I work with is reflexive, also $E'$ is an irreducible $A$-module.)
