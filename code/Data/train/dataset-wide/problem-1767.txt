No anti-gravity to be seen here. Really, learn the basics of physics if your interested and hopefully you'll find that not only is it interesting, but it can explain things without the need to invent other explanations. Usually. :-) 

You understand wrong. It is considered the weakest of the fundamental forces. This Physics SE answer explains why. It appears to be strong only because on average, over a large scale, matter is generally neutrally charged, whereas mass (and energy) just gets bigger the more space you have (a little simplistic, but that's the general idea). As for "consistent", well all the forces behave consistently or we would not be able to model them with mathematics. 

I think one of the most important things you missed in this article is the bit where they say the energy requirements are "unphysical". This is no different from saying it's impossible from our point of view. A couple of quotes from the article : 

The moon has dark and bright areas. When it is visible in the daytime the bright areas appear roughly as bright as clouds, but the dark areas have no light to add to the scene and we are just left with the blue light from the sky generally. The sky blue is not as bright as the clouds or the moon, at least when it's visible like this (typically near the end of day and early morning) so it does not conceal the bright clouds or the moon's brighter parts. 

What they're saying is that, if you accept the hypothesis of their theory and data, there must exist a minimum of about 2000 objects of planet mass per star. There's no way to identify any individual object and no means to verify their claims that I know of. 

You might want to consult this Wikipedia page on the formation and future of our solar system and galaxy. Two events to note : 

Long before we had any serious science of astronomy, we had seasons. We defined a year as being four seasons. All you need to do that is long term memory. Once you can count and record events in some way, you start counting days. As we accumulated knowledge of the stars, we noticed that the changes of positions of the stars in the heavens followed very regular cycles. That gave us a way to relate a year to an exact number of days ( and in fact to a fraction of a day ). When we developed physics enough to be able to associate the yearly cycle with an orbital cycle we changed our definition of year to be exactly that cycle ( and we even allow for slight changes in that's cycle's length ). So we invented the approximate year first and then refined it to match our understanding of physics. 

Very pessimistic idea. We lack the technology to tell if a planet orbiting another star could be lived on by humans. We barely have the technology to detect some planets orbiting a small number of other stars (compared to the number of stars in the galaxy). The term for these planets is exoplanet and Wikipedia says we have detected about 3750 to date orbiting about 2800 stars. As there are somewhere between 100 and 400 billion stars in the galaxy, we only know a tiny fraction of what's out there. We have a very limited basis for listing some planets as possible candidates for supporting some form of life, but, with all respect to the serious scientists doing this work, this is nowhere near knowing if they really can support life at all, let alone humans. So your question's answer is : we don't know. We cannot travel fast or far enough at present to reach another star in a reasonable time frame and we also could not do it with enough people. We do not currently have any reasonable expectation that we will be able to do that in the future. So even if we knew of a suitable planet, it would be unlikely we could ever travel there to e.g. colonize it. So we're stuck here so keep recycling. :-) 

With respect to the Sun, the Earth rotates once every 24 hours. But because the Sun's apparent position changes in the sky due to Earth's revolution around the Sun, the Earth rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds with respect to the stars. Because of this 3 minutes, 56 seconds difference, all stars rise and set 3 minutes, 56 seconds earlier each succeeding day. This applies to the time of a star passing through the meridian as well. So, on the next day, April 29, Arcturus will pass the meridian at 22:56:04. 

For the same reason as (1), the path of totality would vary from a maximum amount down to nothing. For annular eclipses there would be a similar path of annularity instead. But whichever path it is would always be centered on the equator. 

You just found the difference between the sidereal year and the tropical year, and that was no coincidence. Addition The number of sidereal months in a sidereal year is one more than the number of synodic months in a sidereal year. That is because the Earth goes around the Sun once of year (of course), leading to one less synodic month than sidereal month. Here, $P_{syn}$ is the synodic period and $P_{sid}$ is the sidereal period, and $Y_{sid}$ is the sidereal year, all in days. $$\frac{Y_{sid}}{P_{sid}} = \frac{Y_{sid}}{P_{syn}} + 1$$ Dividing both sides by $Y_{sid}$ yields: $$\frac{1}{P_{sid}} = \frac{1}{P_{syn}} + \frac{1}{Y_{sid}}$$ Solving for $Y_{sid}$... $$\frac{1}{P_{sid}} - \frac{1}{P_{syn}} = \frac{1}{Y_{sid}}$$ or $$P_{sid}^{-1} - P_{syn}^{-1} = \frac{1}{Y_{sid}}$$ Multiplying both sides by $Y_{sid}$ and dividing both sides by $P_{sid}^{-1} - P_{syn}^{-1}$ yields $$Y_{sid} = \frac{1}{P_{sid}^{-1} - P_{syn}^{-1}}$$ 

Over the course of an entire year, about 365 days and 6 hours, these 3 minutes and 56 seconds adds up to an entire day, so that exactly one year later, the same star will pass through the meridian at the same time of day. For Arcturus to pass the meridian exactly 22 hours earlier, it should be 22/24 of a year before then, or about 335 days later, or about 30 days earlier, or March 29. 

The average angular diameter of the Moon, as seen from the Earth, is about 31 arcminutes. The angular diameter depends on the distance between the two objects and the diameter of the object being viewed. Specifically, for small angles, it is the diameter divided by the distance. When the distance is the same, the angular size is proportional to the diameter. The distance remains the same when viewing the Earth from the Moon, but the Earth is larger. According to NASA, the diameter of the Moon is 3,476 km, and the diameter of the Earth is 12,756 km. So, because it's proportional, the angular diameter can be calculated as follows: $a_{Earth} = a_{Moon} \times {d_{Earth}\over d_{Moon}}$ $ = 31 arcminutes \times {12,756 km \over 3,476 km}$ $ \approx 114 arcminutes$, or just under 2 degrees. This is approximate, because not only is this valid only for small degrees, where the tangent of an angle can be approximated by the angle itself (in radians), the Earth-Moon distance varies because the Moon's orbit around the Earth is an ellipse. 

Any bacteria present in a meteor would not necessarily burn. According to the Bad Astronomer's "Bad Addendum" to another unrelated point, "A Meteoric Rise", meteors sure do get extremely hot, but that outside part usually ablates away, leaving the inner part that was extremely cold for who knows how long, which may not have warmed up much during the fall. 

I think for people who want to believe the Jupiter link to solar cycles it will be impossible to disprove. They'll cling to it forever. I think in a practical sense the "link" is little more than numerology. The force Jupiter can exert on the Sun's atmosphere and internal structure is a minute fraction of the magnetic forces at work generated by the Sun itself. A simple model helps. Place two magnets a foot apart. Now place a magnet a thousand feet away from both. The effect of the distant magnet is one millionth that of the two close together. That gives you a feel for the relationship between magnetic forces within the Sun's atmosphere and Jupiter's distant influence. And gravity is an even weaker force. As I understand it the current daring of models is the Double Dynamo, but certainly the dynamo type models ( all relating to electromagnetic fields generated by the Sun ) are the main contenders. With people who propose the Jupiter link ( often extended to include Saturn ), there is a tendency to do a lot of algebra to find ways to relate various periods without actually justifying the supposed link on the basis of forces at work ( i.e. doing a simulation or a model based on real physics ). This is why I call it numerology. The dynamo models actually are based on real physics and make predictions, both past and future, which can be tested. This also means the details of these theories can be refined in a proper scientific manner to tease out the truth. 

Given the huge number it's hard to imagine not one of those binary systems being, for all intents and purposes, near identical stars and even near identical G-type stars. The only really similar stars in a binary system I'm personally aware of are Mizar Aa and Mizar Ab. These are A-type stars, not G-type stars, but they illustrate the idea is possible. 

Given that we have very few examples, we could not, statistically, draw any significance from any apparent bias. It's also hard to see any theoretical basis for expecting a bias, so my gut feeling would be there probably is no bias. It's also worth remembering that human observations of these things are essentially a very brief snapshot in a huge period during which we have no idea about what may have been happening. So again the statistical significance of what happens at the moment needs to be carefully considered. 

The model you're discussing is really best thought of as a mathematical exploration, rather than a practical proposal of any kind. I would suggest the authors are disproving the viability of Krasnikov tubes rather than anything else. What was done was to try and fix problems with the previous model, but in doing so the authors ( to their credit ) show that they cannot bypass the fundamental problems making such a system unrealisable in practice. 

Planets in general can have internal heat sources (like radioactive breakdown or a complex hot core). During planetary formation there are thought to be multiple collisions with large proto-planets before things settle down to a more-or-less stable set of orbits and planets. These collisions add energy to the planets as they develop and increase temperature (a lot), as does ongoing bombardment from boring-old asteroids. Now all of this energy does basically come from gravitational sources, but as you can see it's a complex (messy) business and there are many significant events that can alter temperature. It might be instructive for you to read about existing theories on the formation of Solar system as well as material related to the structure of the Earth.
