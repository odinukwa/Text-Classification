THOUGHTS Several possible explanations present themselves:- (1) Something is wrong in my assumptions/reasoning/maths and so eqtn [8A] is incorrect. (2) In case A, equation [3] does not apply but equation [8A] does - in which case (i) models of the Solar System using equation [1A] will only predict 50% of the observed non-Newtonian planetary precessions; (ii) models such as that used by Shaid-Saless & Yeomans - see my answer here which use the $\frac{3 GM}{c^2 r^2}$ extra-acceleration term along with other rotation-inducing terms will be affected pro-rata. (3) In case A, equation [3] applies to non-circular orbits while equation [8A] applies to circular orbits. If true it seems strange to me that there is such a marked discontinuity between the circular and non-circular orbit rotation rates. Surely when the orbit is extremely-close to circular the rotation rate should be close to the circular-orbit rotation rate? Perhaps this would be resolved by conducting a more-detailed (higher-order) perturbation analysis which would show a transitional pattern, at low orbital eccentricity, between equations [3] and [8A]? I would be grateful for any explanations or suggestions on how to resolve this apparent discrepancy. (I am not competent to carry out perturbation analysis myself). 

THE DISCREPANCY Inserting expressions for $\frac{Vt_A}{Vt_N }-1$ , $\frac{Vt_B}{Vt_N }-1$ derived from equations [4A], [4B] into equations [7A],[7B] respectively, produces:- $$ \epsilon_A = \frac{3 GM}{2 c^2 P} ...[8A]$$ $$ \epsilon_B = \frac{3 GM}{ c^2 P} ...[8B]$$ Clearly equation [8B] agrees with equation [3] whereas equation [8A] gives a value of $\epsilon$ which is only 50% of that given in equation [3]. Note that orbital rotation rate formulae derived from General Relativity by Wells and other authors cited by him (Part 7, p.28) agree with equations [3] and [8B]. Some of those derivations were based on an Alice model and others were based on a Bob model. Thus it is equation [8A] (derived here for a circular, Alician orbit) which is the anomalous result. 

PREDICTING PERIASTRON TIMES We can obtain an expression for CPTS by copying Stan Liou's approach , but using phase ($\Phi$) instead of Mean Anomaly ($M$). Write the phase at time $\tau$ as a Maclaurin series (a Taylor series with $a=0$): $$\begin{eqnarray*} \Phi(\tau) \equiv \int_{t=0}^{t=\tau} \dot{\Phi}(t)\,\mathrm{d}t &=& \Phi(0) + \dot{\Phi}(0) \tau + \frac{1}{2}\ddot{\Phi}(0) \tau^2 + \mathcal{O}(\tau^3)\\ &=& 0 +\frac{1}{P_0}\tau - \frac{\dot{P}}{2P_o^2}\tau^2+\mathcal{O}(\tau^3)\text{.} \end{eqnarray*}$$ Dropping the third order and residual error terms (Stan Liou's answer explains justification for this) we get $$ \Phi(\tau) \approx \frac{1}{P_0}\tau- \frac{\dot{P}}{2P_o^2}\tau^2. $$ Let $N$ count the number of completed orbits at some time $\tau_N$. Then the phase at the end of orbit number $N$ is given by $\Phi(\tau_N) = N$. In a steady system (A) the orbital period $P_o$ stays constant $\dot P=0$ and so the time $\tau_{NA}$ at which the $N$th orbit completed is given exactly by $\tau_{NA} = NP_o$ and thus $N=\tau_{NA}/P_o$. In a decaying-period system (B) the Nth orbit completes at time $\tau_{NB}$ when $\Phi(\tau_{NB}) = N$ but with $\Phi(\tau_{NB})$ depending on a non-zero value of $\dot P$. $$ \begin{align} &\Phi(\tau_{NA}) = N = \frac{1}{P_0}\tau_{NA}\\ &\Phi(\tau_{NB}) = N \approx \frac{1}{P_0}\tau_{NB}- \frac{\dot{P}}{2P_o^2}\tau_{NB}^2. \end{align} $$ We can obtain a formula for $\Delta t_{N}$ which is the difference in time between $\tau_{NB}$ (the epoch of the decaying system $N$th periastron) and $\tau_{NA}$ (the epoch of the steady system $N$th periastron) as follows. Note that following Weisberg & Taylor we define $\Delta t_{N}\,(=$ CPTS $)=\tau_{NB} - \tau_{NA}$. The $N$th periastron in the decaying period system occurs earlier than the $N$th periastron in the steady system. Therefore $\Delta t_{N}$ (=$ CPTS $) will become increasingly negative as time passes (as $t$ increases). $$ \frac{\tau_{NA}}{P_o} = N \approx \frac{\tau_{NB}}{P_0}- \frac{\dot P}{2P_o^2} \,{\tau_{NB}}^2 $$ $$ {\tau_{NA}} \approx {\tau_{NB}} - \frac{\dot P}{2P_o} \,{\tau_{NB}}^2 $$ $$ \Delta t_N = \tau_{NB} - \tau_{NA} \approx + \frac{\dot P}{2P_o} \,{\tau_{NB}}^2 $$ which is Stan Liou's approximation for $\Delta t_N$. So what value is this equation? In general assume that we have determined the time $t_0$ of the $0$th periastron and measured accurately an initial orbital period $P_o$ and we keep track of the observed periastra. Case 1 - we observe that the $N$th periastron occurs at a particular time ($\tau_{NB}$). Using $\tau_{NA}=N P_o$, we can easily calculate $\Delta t_N = \tau_{NB} - \tau_{NA}$. Then, using Stan Liou's approximation of $\Delta t_N$ we can obtain an empirical estimate of $\dot P$ from $$ {\dot P} = \frac{2 P_o \,\Delta t_N} {\tau_{NB}}^2. $$ Case 2 - we have a theoretical formula which, given our measurement of $P_o$ predicts the value of $\dot P$. Given various values of $N$ and using $\tau_{NA}=N P_o$ we can easily calculate the hypothetical epochs ($\tau_{NA}$ for various $N$) of the hypothetical steady-system periastra. Now we wish to plot a curve showing the theoretical values of $\Delta t_N$ at various hypothetical periastron epochs ($\tau_{NA}$). But Stan Liou's equation for $\Delta t_N$ uses $\tau_{NB}$ not $\tau_{NA}$. We need to find $\Delta t_N$ as a function of $\tau_{NA}$. Therefore we would need to solve the following quadratic equation for $\Delta t_N$ in terms of $\tau_{NA}$ and $K$, where $K=\frac{\dot P}{2 P_o}$: $$ \Delta t_{N} = K {\tau_{NB}}^2 = K ({\tau_{NA}}^2 + 2 \tau_{NA}\Delta t_{N} +{\Delta t_{N}}^2) $$ $$ 0 = (K{\tau_{NA}}^2 + 2K \tau_{NA}\Delta t_{N} +K{\Delta t_{N}}^2) -\Delta t_{N} $$ $$ 0 = (K){\Delta t_{N}}^2 +(2K \tau_{NA} -1)\Delta t_{N} +(K{\tau_{NA}}^2) .$$ 

I am trying to get a list of all of Mercury's Perihelia and Aphelia over a period of multiple decades. For each event I need X,Y,X and Vx,Vy,Vz data. Knowing the time of the first event it is easy to obtain approximate times of the subsequent events using the known orbital period. I have managed to acquire values using the manual web interface to JPL Horizons. Working on one event at a time I can get data for an epoch within one minute of each event. But I want (a) timings to the nearest second and (b) to obtain a whole series of apsides events in one go. The JPL Horizons email interface seems to be the way to go. Using this I have been able to obtain data for a particular time range and step interval. But, as with the web interface, it is not possible (in one go) to cover the whole multi-decade period at the desired resolution (1s). So now I want to use the TLIST facility to specify a list of individual event times (times at 1s intervals within a range from several seconds before and after the approximate time of each apsides event). The documentation - see how to get Horizons email documentation mailed to you - includes this section on TLIST:- 

But I am having a problem in formatting the TLIST input data in a way that the program will accept. Every attempt so far has returned an error message of the form "BATVAR: cannot read TLIST value: --F4F5E805D2040CE6C2". I have emailed the system manager but have had no response so far. Below is a copy of the email text which I have been sending (format = To: horizons@ssd.jpl.nasa.gov Subject: JOB ****** ). I would be grateful if anyone can suggest what needs to be done with the data format for the TLIST command. 

TWO CLAIRAULTIAN GRAVITATIONAL FORMULAE Wells 2011/2016 refers to two well-known patterns of centripetal acceleration which (when applied in a Euclidean-Newtonian orbital system) produce "perihelion precession" aka "apsidal rotation" of the rate observed for the non-Newtonian precession of the orbits of Solar System planets in particular Mercury and Mars. The formulae, (following the names used by Wells: "A: Alice" and "B: Bob") are expressed by Wells in terms of gravitational potential (in rotating frames of reference) but they can also be expressed in terms of gravitational acceleration by differentiating wrt distance $r$, giving (in an inertial frame of reference):- $$ \frac{F}{m} = a_A = \frac{GM}{r^2} \left( 1 + \frac{K_A}{r^2} \right) = \frac{GM}{r^2} \left( 1 + \frac{3 GM P}{c^2 r^2} \right) ...[1A],$$ and $$ \frac{F}{m} = a_B = \frac{GM}{r^2} \left( 1 + \frac{K_B}{r^2} \right) = \frac{GM}{r^2} \left( 1 + \frac{6 GM }{c^2 r} \right) ...[1B].$$ and, for comparison, the standard Newtonian formulae is:- $$ \frac{F}{m} = a_K = \frac{GM}{r^2} ...[1N],$$ where $F$ is the centripetal attractive force and $a$ is the centripetal acceleration of the target test-particle (contra convention I show positive towards the source), G is Newton's Universal Gravitational Constant, $M$ is the (large) mass of the attracting body, $m$ is the (infinitessimal) mass of the orbiting test-particle, $c$ is the speed of light and $r$ is the distance between the centres of the two bodies. Note: Here, and subsequently throughout, the formulae given apply for an inertial frame of reference (rather than a rotating frame of reference). Historical note: Formulae of this pattern $ a = (GM/r^2) (1 + K/r^n) $ are sometimes labelled "Clairaultian" after the formulae proposed in 1745 by the French astronomer Clairault in attempts to explain anomalous features of the Moon's orbit. Similar formulae had been considered by Newton in his Principiae in the C17th in seeking an explanantion of the Lunar orbit. The rate of apsidal rotation $\epsilon$ (in radians per complete periapse-to-periapse cycle) in cases A and B is given by the Einstein 1915 formula see this earlier question. $$\epsilon = \frac{24 \pi^3 A^2}{T^2 c^2(1-e^2)} = \frac{2\pi *3 *4 \pi^2 A^3}{T^2 c^2A(1-e^2)} ...[2]$$ which, using the Keplerian equality $ GM = {4\pi A^3}{T^2} $ can be re-written in units of (extra) revolutions per periapse-to-periapse cycle as:- $$\epsilon = \frac{3 * 4 \pi^2 A^3}{T^2 c^2A(1-e^2)}= \frac{3 GM}{c^2 P}...[3]$$ where $A$ is the orbit semi-major axis, $e$ is orbit eccentricity and $P$ is the orbit semi-latus rectum. 

I understand how Solar Parallax calculation determines the Earth-Sun distance using measurements of (a) the baseline distance between two widely-separated terrestrial telescopes and the (b) two angles - one at each telescope - between the baseline and the line from telescope to the centre of the Sun's visible disc. How is it that observations of the transit of a planet across the face of the Sun give better results than simply pointing (simultaneously) each telescope at the centre of the Sun's visible disc? Is the Solar Transit method also superior (in terms of accuracy) to the method of determining Earth-Planet distances by measuring parallax angles relative to 'fixed' background stars? If so, why?
