A rural landowner can deposit his savings in a commercial bank and receive an annual interest rate of 8%. Alternatively he can lend to villagers who need credit. If all loans are of the same size and only sixty per cent of them are repaid, the how much interest rate would make his earnings the same as from depositing his savings in a bank? I took the case that suppose landowner has 100 dollars and he is landing to one villager for one year, then if he deposits in bank for a year he gets 108 after one year, but if he gives it to villager, he gets 60 dollars back as given and to compensate he must have charged 48%, so that total is 108 dollars. But answer given for this question is 80%? Why is that? 

I am mathematics background student and just for interest, I have started to self read/learn economics. I have chosen a cartoon book to start with, which is very good. The book is "The Cartoon Introduction to Economics: Volume One: Microeconomics" by Klein. In that book in chapter three, a lottery problem is mentioned. The problem asks if you win a lottery which says either take $10 million today or take 1 million dollars at the end of each year for next 20 years (in total 20 million), which one you should choose? Then he talks about Present Value of money, and says that bottom line is "Money Today is more highly valued than money Tomorrow". The formula for Present value given is $$PV=\frac{x}{(1+r)^n}$$ where $x$ is the amount of money to be received at the end of $n$ years and $r$ is the interest rate. For ex- If I put 100 dollars in bank on 5% interest I ll get 105 dollar at the end of year. So PV of 105 dollars next year is 100 dollars, right? But our second option is an annuity, and for that formula given is $$PV=x[\frac{1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}}{r}] $$ where $x$ is the amount of money to be received at the end of each year for $n$ years at interest $r$. For our problem $x=1$ and $n=20$, thus with 5% interest rate i.e. $r=0.05$, PV of annuity is 8.5 million dollars and with rate 10%, PV is $12.5 million. It turns out if $r=7.76$% or more the annuity will have a PV less than 10 million, and I should accept the lump sum option i.e. taking 10 million dollar today. I am not getting this, I don't know why? Here is my doubt- If $r$ is 10%, PV is 8.5 million, then doesn't it mean that if I have 8.5 million dollars today and put them in bank on 5 percent interest rate for next 20 years with compounding frequency 1, then by compound interest formula I should get that ultimately I will get 20 million dollars at end of 20 years and thus I should take lump sum money i.e. 10 million dollar (> 8.5m) and put them in bank on 10% for 20 years. But by computing compound interest on $8.5$ million for 20 years on 10 % is giving me about 9.3 million only. What is it that I am getting wrong? If someone can help me understand this problem better, it will be a huge help. 

The first of these is just an asset reallocation and weakens sovereign bond prices relative to other assets in the economy. Your argument about government financing is true and the GDP output would be expected to decline, further as confidence also becomes a factor. The second would weaken the spot FX rate and the cross-currency basis swap levels. Indirectly this threatens to increase inflation since import prices will be affected by the currency movement. However, a weaker currency might tempt outside speculators at some equilibrium point. The third is difficult; no asset manager will deposit funds unprotected with a bank (particularly a domestic one) and the alternative of receiving back sovereign bond collateral is unappealing, so the repo rates will probably be increased in line with the rates on the bonds themselves, although this is another form of interest rate that does have significant impact and is not necessarily the same the bond rates. Indeed there will also be curvature to this as well. As an example in 2017 the German government bond curve had 0-1Y yields at -70bps, and a repo rate often at similar levels. But the 20y-30y bond yields were at +100bps whilst the repo rate might be at -100bps. This may sound like arbitrage is possible, but it actually isn't - there is no scenario you can gain without running risk, and those different risks were considered and deemed to be worth the values potentially attainable by those who dared. Finally I will point out to you the transmission mechanism. A central bank presides over its own currency and attempts to influence its economy by changing its deposit rate. However, a central bank is inherently connected to the government. I do not consider it wise to treat the two as separate entities. As a national bank, whose fortunes are intimately tied to the government, you would probably be better off buying and holding the sovereign debt if the short dated bonds offered considerably more interest than the central bank deposit rate, since from their point of view a government failure or a central bank failure might be one and the same. If you consider the holdings of Italian sovereign debt by Italian banks you will recognise this strategy as a kind of moral hazard. So the transmission mechanism is likely to remain in place for the short dated bonds and be ultimately tied to the deposit rate. I appreciate there is no general conclusion to this thread, and some ideas are not necessarily coherent or consistent. I just found it an interesting question and thought I would explore my own thoughts in raw form. Possibly you find them useful.
