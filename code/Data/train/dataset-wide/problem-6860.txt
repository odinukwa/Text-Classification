I cannot directly answer your question, but I think I can shed some light. What I seem to show is that under some restrictions, the unconditional variance is finite. However, I am not sure how to relate my answer to the notion of volatility clustering. Note that if we assume stationarity, then $\sigma^2=E(\epsilon_t^2)$ for all $t$ and it follows by the law of total expectations that $$\sigma^2=E(E(\epsilon_t^2|I_{t-1}))=E(h_t)=\alpha_0+\alpha_1\sigma^2+\alpha_2\sigma^2$$ using your expression for $h_t$. Thus, $\sigma^2=\frac{\alpha_0}{1-(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)}$ is a solution whenever $\alpha_1+\alpha_2<1$. Now, by the law of total variance, \begin{align*}V(Y_t)&=E(V(Y_t|I_{t-1}))+V(E(Y_t|I_{t-1}))\\ &=E(\epsilon_t^2)+V(\mu_t)\\ &=\sigma^2+a_1^2V(Y_{t-1}) \end{align*} using your results, where $\mu_t=a_0+a_1 Y_{t-1}$. Assuming stationarity, and thus that the variance is constant for all $t$, it follows that $$V(Y_t)=\frac{\sigma^2}{1-a_1^2}$$ is a solution for $a_1\neq\pm 1$ and $\alpha_1+\alpha_2<1$. I encourage you to clearly note my assumptions. I cannot further assess this answer as I know next to nothing about time series. (Also note that we from the assumption of stationarity have that $E(Y_t)=a_0+a_1E(Y_{t-1})$ implies that $$E(Y_t)=\frac{a_0}{1-a_1}$$ is a solution.)

I am a bit unsure about how the "trend growth rate" is defined in macroeconomics. Is it to correct to say that if a time series $\{y_t\}$ may be decomposed as $$y_t=d_t+c_t,$$ where $d_t$ is a deterministic trend and $c_t$ a cyclical component, then $$(d_{t+1}-d_t)/d_t$$ is the "trend growth rate", i.e. the growth rate in $y_t$ assuming $c_t=0$? And if it can be decomposed as $$\log(y_t)=d'_t+c'_t,$$ with another trend and cyclical component, then $$[\exp(d'_{t+1})-\exp(d'_t)]/\exp(d'_t)$$ is the "trend growth rate", i.e. the growth rate in $y_t$ assuming $c'_t=0$? Sometimes I feel that the definition is $(d_{t+1}-d_t)/d_t$ and $(d'_{t+1}-d'_t)/d'_t$ in the two cases, referring to the growth rate in the trend component and not to the growth rate in the dependent variable $y_t$ ignoring the cyclical component (i.e., setting $c_t=0$ for all $t$). That is, I interpret "trend growth rate" as the growth rate in $y_t$ ignoring the cyclical component. Is that a correct interpretation? 

In the Wikipedia article on annuity, different formulas are given, and their difference is due to whether the first payment is made in the first period or not, whether we compute the present or future value, whether the annuity is a perpetuity or not, etc. In macroeconomics, e.g. page 8 here, I often recognize something of the following terminology: "If the interest rate is $r$, then the annuity of $x$ (which may be initial wealth) is $\frac{r}{1+r}x$." Now, the problem is that I do not understand why we would say that the annuity of $x$ is $\frac{r}{1+r}x$ in any sense given in the article on Wikipedia. What am I missing here? Let me mention some examples. 

You cannot find $\partial \ln\frac{q(\omega)}{q(\omega')}$, it has no well defined meaning here. However, by the first relation you mention, it follows that $$\ln(q(\omega)/q(\omega'))=-\sigma\ln(p(\omega)/p(\omega')).$$ Taking the partial derivative on both sides with respect to $\ln(p(\omega)/p(\omega'))$ gives $$\frac{\partial \ln\frac{q(\omega)}{q(\omega ')}}{\partial \ln\frac{p(\omega)}{p(\omega ')}}=-\sigma.$$ 

Critique 2. The link directs you to McCloskey's critique of economics. She criticizes how economists focus too much on assumptions and mathematical proofs and too little on empirical facts. In this sense, if microeconomics or mathematical economics is to be about general properties of consumer behaviour, then the assumption of convex preferences is not always suitable from a methodological perspective, as non-convexity may hold in a given economy. Also, following McCloskey, one may say that the assumption of convex preferences, while it may guarantee that certain mathematical propositions are true (i.e., one may deduce them from the assumption of convex preferences and simpler axioms), does not by itself say something about economic behavior. It surely implies certain economic behavior $\mathcal B$, but we cannot from the observation of such economic behavior $\mathcal B$ draw the conclusion that economical agents' preferences are such that they are convex over economical entities like goods. Critique 3. Instead of assuming convex preferences, one may study the wants and sentiments of individuals, as Adam Smith does in his Theory of Moral Sentiments and later in his Wealth of Nations, or study cognitive biases, like Daniel Kahneman does in his best-selling Thinking, Fast and Slow. These two authors does not, to my knowledge, directly criticize the concept of convex preferences, but they show how economic analysis performed in another way may lead to other conclusions about the economy. If their conclusions do not agree with conclusions derived from axioms like that of convex preferences, then there is implicit criticism in the sense that there is a mismatch in theoretical conclusions. 

From reading a selection of writings by Marx, I have come to understand the following three as the core elements of Marxian economics. 

Hence, if $TC(q)$ is the total cost for the given level of quantity $q$, then $FC=TC(0)$ is the fixed cost, which is a constant independent of $q$; and $VC(q)=TC(q)-FC$ is the variable cost. For example, if $TC(q)=10+q$, then $FC=TC(0)=10$ and $VC(q)=TC(q)-FC=q$. 

If we are using nonlinear regression, then we take the nonlinear least squares (NLLS) estimate of $a$ and $b$ by solving $$\min_{a,\, b}\sum_i\big(F_i-L_i^aK_i^b)^2.$$ Numerical computing softwares (which uses algorithms such as the Gauss-Newton algorithm) may assist you when finding the NLLS estimate. 

The labour theory of value. It asserts that the exchange value of a commodity $x$ (what quantities of $x$ that can be exchanged for another commodity) is determined by that labour time which is socially necessary to produce $x$. Surplus value theory of profit. I.e., capitalists derives profit from their exploitation of workers. Suppose a capitalist purchases labour power from a worker for one day. To Marx, then, the value of one day's usage of this labour power is the value of the commodities which is necessary for the worker to live through one day. Say that it takes one fourth of a day to produce this amount of commodities, the value of which will be equivalent to the wage paid to the worker by the capitalist. This one fourth of a day is called necessary labour. Any work above this level is surplus labour from which the capitalist derives profit. The theory of alienation. In the following I quote a passage from Marx's Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844. Relating this passage to the above core elements, I note that Marx somehow seems to think that the institution of capitalism structures parts of the social world. 

So, in no case do I get $\frac{r}{1+r}x$. I feel there is something I am missing in my understanding of the concept of an annuity. Looking at 5, I think that they mean by the "annuity value of $x$" the annuity value of some present value $x$. So in 5, the present value is $x=y\frac{1+r}{r}$ for some other rent $y$, and thus the annuity value of $x$ is $y=\frac{r}{1+r}x$? 

Consider a set of consumption bundles $X$, which is convex and let $\succeq$ denote 'at least as good as', then convex preferences may be defined mathematically as follows. Convex preferences. For any $x,y,z\in X$ and $\lambda\in[0,1]$ we have that $$x\succeq z\text{ and }y\succeq z\Rightarrow \lambda x+(1-\lambda)y\succeq z.$$ Informally we may say that convex preferences captures the concept of averages being at least as good as extremes. Critique 1. Below is an excerpt from the direct link where the author points out the fact that under certain circumstances, the assumption of convexity may not be adequately assumed as a property or preferences. 

If the interest rate is $r$, then the present value of an annuity-immediate for $n$ periods with "rent" $x$ is $x\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}$. If $n=1$ here, then we have $x\frac{1}{1+r}$ (I pick $n=1$ to somehow get the expression $\frac{r}{1+r}x$). For the future value way of writing an annuity-immediate, we have $x\frac{(1+r)^{n}-1}{r}$ which is $x$ for $n=1$. For an annuity-due, we have the former expressions in 1 and 2 multiplied by $(1+r)$. For a perpetuity I get $x\frac{1}{r}$ for first payment in second period. For a perpetuity I get $x\frac{1+r}{r}$ for first payment in first period. 

In the right-to-manage model the collective bargaining is modelled as a symmetric Nash bargaining solution with $\gamma$ as the relative bargaining strength of the union, given that the firm maximizes its profits with respect to employment. I.e., it is the solution to $$\max_w\Omega(w)$$ such that $$\frac{\partial \Pi(w,L)}{\partial L}=0,$$ where $\Omega(w)=\big(\nu(w)-v(b)\big)^{\gamma}\Pi(w,L)^{1-\gamma}$ is the Nash bargaining product. Now, when reading about this scenario/optimization problem I see two cases in the academic literature: The first one is called local (or firm-level) wage bargaining and the other is called central (or national) wage bargaining. Even though I have read about them, I do not understand the mathematical difference between them. So, what is the fundamental, mathematical difference between local (or firm-level) wage bargaining and central (or national) wage bargaining given that we apply the right-to-manage model (i.e., we let firms determine employment unilaterally)? How do I model the two situations? My guesses and thoughts so far (this will be updated as time goes by): 

In general, a steady state in discrete time is that the first difference is zero at some $t=t_0$, and that it remains so: $$y_t-y_{t-1}=x_t-x_{t-1}=0$$ for all $t\geq t_0$. Hence, in a steady state, $y_t$ and $x_t$ are constant at some values $y$ and $x$. Thus, $y=\beta(y+\gamma z)$, which implies $$y=\frac{\beta\gamma z}{1-\beta},$$ and $x=\rho x+y$, which implies $$x=\frac{y}{1-\rho}=\frac{\beta\gamma z}{(1-\rho)(1-\beta)}.$$ 

Unions and firms agrees on some wage $w$. In this case, the expected utility of a representative member is $\nu(w)$. The profits to the firm are $\Pi(w,L)$. Unions and firms do not agree on any wage $w$. In this case, the expected utility to union members is $v(b)$ and profits to the firm is $0$. 

It depends. Hessian gives a good answer, but I think we can say something more. A utility function $u(x)$ assigns to each bundle of goods $x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ a real number. Along an indifference curve, we have \begin{equation}u(x)=u_0\tag{1}\end{equation} for some real constant $u_0$. Now, the marginal rate of substitution $MRS_{ij}$ of good $i$ for good $j$ exists at a given point $x$ whenever $u_i(x)\neq 0$, for then the implicit function theorem implies that $(1)$ implicitly defines a function $f^i$ such that $x_i=f^i(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n)$, and that we have $$u(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},f^i(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n),x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n)=u_0.\tag{2}$$ Differentiating $(2)$ with respect to $x_j$ where $j\neq i$ gives us $$-\frac{\partial f^i}{\partial x_j}\Big|_{u\text{ constant at }u_0}=\frac{u_i(x)}{u_j(x)}=MRS_{ij}.\tag{3}$$ Note that the partial derivatives $u_i(x)$ and $u_j(x)$ are dependent on the bundle of goods $x$, so it is logically possible that $MRS_{ij}$ varies with $x$. If $MRS_{ij}$ does not vary with $x_j$ and is thus constant with respect to $x_j$ at some level $k$, it follows from $(3)$ by integration with respect to $x_j$ on both sides that $$f^i(x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n)=-kx_j+m$$ for some real constant $m$ independent of $x_j$. Thus, in this case, the indifference curve in $(x_i,x_j)$-space is a straight line. 

As no one has answered, I will give this a try. To begin with, together with compactness, and of course nonemptiness, of $X$, which you have assumed, you need $f(x,y)$ to be continuous in $x$ in order to ensure, via Weierstrass extrem value theorem, that $$\theta(y)=\text{argmin}_{x\in X}f(x,y)\tag{1}$$ exists for any $y$. It is good, as you do, to assume strict convexity in $x$, for this gives us a unique solutions to the minimization problems, and thus $(1)$ is a singleton. Under these assumptions, I will try to show that $(1)$ is continous in the following sense, where I am essentially using the definition of continuity in terms of limits of sequences. The fact that the argmin is a set makes it complicated to directly apply the notion of continuity of function which seldom, in elementary calculus, maps elements to some set of sets. Theorem. Consider a nonempty compact set $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and a continuous function $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$. Furthermore, suppose that $$\theta(\bar{y})=\{z|z\text{ minimizes }f(x,\bar{y})\text{ over }x\in X\}$$ is the singleton $\{\bar{z}\}$ (to ensure this, assume strict convexity in the first argument of $f$). Then, for sequences $z_n\in \theta(y_n)$, where $\{y_n\}_{\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence converging to $\bar{y}$, we have $z_n\to \bar{z}$. Proof. I will give a short proof. It is by contradiction, and is a variant of the proof of Lemma 6.3.2. in Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms, 3rd Edition, 2006, by Bazaara et al. So suppose $z_n\to\bar{z}$, $z_n\in \theta(y_n)$, and suppose $|z_n-\bar{z}|>\epsilon>0$ for all $n\in I$ where $I$ is some index set. Since $X$ is compact and $z_n\in X$, the sequence $\{z_n\}_I$ has a convergent subsequence $\{z_n\}_{I'}$ with limit $z_0$ in $X$. By assumption, $|z_0-\bar{z}|\geq\epsilon>0$ and thus $z_0\neq \bar{z}$. In addition, for $\{y_n\}_{I'}$ it holds that $$f(z_n,y_n)\leq f(\bar{z},y_n)\tag{2}$$ since $z_n$ minimizes for $y_n$, but $\bar{z}$ does not minimize for $y_n$ necessarily. Now, use continuity of $f$ in both of its arguments, and take the limit over $I'$ in $(2)$, to get that $$f(z_0,\bar{y})\leq f(\bar{z},\bar{y})\tag{3}.$$ But as $z_0\neq\bar{z}$ and $\bar{z}$ minimized $f(x,\bar{y})$, it follows that $z_0$ is another, distinct minimizer of $f(x,\bar{y})$ over $X$. Hence, $\theta(\bar{y})$ is not a singleton. But this contradicts the fact that $\theta(\bar{y})$ was a singleton. QED. Reference suggestion. The Theorem of the Maximum. This theorem is more general and "provides conditions for the continuity of an optimized function and the set of its maximizers as a parameter changes". It involves the concept of a multivalued function (note that the assumption of the argmin being a singleton simplified the proof of the theorem above). 

The New Keynesian Philips Curve (NKPC) may be derived using price settings frictions introduced by Guillermo Calvo. The NKPC can under such conditions be written as you write it, i.e. $$\pi_t=\beta E_t\pi_{t+1}+\kappa x_t,$$ and where $\kappa=0$ if no firm change their prices, and $\kappa=\infty$ if all firms change their prices. (Technical note: Here I allow myself to work with the extended real line, viewing $\pm\infty$ as entities and not concepts.) The background given above, then, does not seem to say anything about the output gap $x_t$. If $\kappa=0$, then inflation follow its trend, i.e. $$\pi_t=\beta E_t\pi_{t+1},$$ and if $\kappa=\infty$ then $\pi_t=\infty$ (given that the expected inflation is bounded below). This, at least, answer your first question: If fully flexible price setting is interpreted as the case when all firms change their prices, then $\pi_t=\infty$, which is understandable, but not realistic. What we may say, though, is the more firms there are who change their prices, the closer to hyperinflation we are. To me it seems that we can not from the NKPC alone say whether the output gap will be zero if $\kappa=\infty$. Often we have to supplement the NKPC with the DIS $$x_t=E_tx_{t+1}-\frac{1}{\sigma}(r_t-r^n_t),$$ where $r_t$ is the real interest rate and $r^n_t$ is its natural level, and add some additional information on whether we have random shocks in e.g. the output gap. 

Regarding you first question, the answer is 'yes', at least in your model. For if the real interest rate, $r_t=i_t-E_t\pi_{t+1}$, is equal to its natural level $r^n_t$, then in your model $x_t=E_tx_{t+1}$ and $x_t=0$ for all $t$ is a solution which is consistent with the dynamic equation. (Note that other solutions are consistent with the dynamic equation in the case $r_t=r^n_t$ for all $t$, such as $x_t=1$ for all $t$.) According to my experience, the natural level of real interest rate is usually defined as the level of real interest consistent with output being at its 'natural', 'long-run', 'equilibrium' or 'potential' level, given stable inflation, absence of shocks to demand, etc. I.e., natural real interest rate, $r^n_t$, is such that whenever $r^t=r^n_t$ and certain stability/regularity conditions are fulfilled, then $x_t=0$. Read a FRBSF Economic Letter for more information. We may also view the natural level of real interest rate as the real interest rate at which the output gap $x_t$ is following its trend $E_tx_{t+1}$, i.e. $x_t=E_tx_{t+1}$. This definition is similar to the one given by Knut Wicksell. Regarding your two last questions, I may say the following. In your model, a ceteris paribus increase in $r^n_t$ increases $x_t$ by $\frac{1}{\sigma}$. (Just take the partial derivative with respect to $r^n_t$ on both sides in the dynamic equation, holding everything else constant.) This means that either output, $y_t$, is increasing, or the natural level of output, $y^n_t$, is increasing. However, if such ceteris paribus changes cannot be made, then taking the partial derivative holding all else constant is not meaningful. Indeed, in new keynesian models, the natural real interest rate is often a function of $y^n_t$, and in such cases we cannot increase the natural real interest rate without affecting the natural level of output. One such case is when $r^n_t=\rho+\sigma(E_ty^n_{t+1}-y^n_t).$ More concrete examples may be provided, I will see if I can find some.
