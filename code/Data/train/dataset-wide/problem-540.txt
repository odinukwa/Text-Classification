The page goes on to describe various extremophiles that would have survived. But I would think this expedition should be okay. They could grow their own plants and use them for food, get power from the Sun, and live as good a life as you can live when you're living on a giant snowball. 

1 The AIP is certainly not strong enough at present to pull off something like what is described, but the movement is comparatively strong, and given that the question simply asks for the most probable states, the point should be valid. 

One member gets jealous and kills the others The group uses the formula together but hides it from the public Some moron in the group messes up, and the company finds out about it. The company finds out about it anyway, without the moron's help. 

He says something that isn't true ("I am a green stegosaurus!"). He says something that could be interpreted in different ways ("Good morning!"). 

Nobody wanted to do the dirty work, so to speak. Everyone theoretically had good leadership traits, and they could do high-level jobs, but they couldn't do grunt labor. Consider this when thinking about your story. 

This isn't possible without a huge uptick in technology. You certainly can't go back in time, because that would violate, among other things, causality. Also, going back in time wouldn't help, because you'd still have the past you screwing up the answers to those questions. The alternative, by the way, is to kill your past self - but then that would kill your current self, and so we enter yet another paradox. So let's get creative. There has been talk of turning people's biological bodies into mechanical ones, and turning brains into computer hard drives. I think this is possible within, say, 50 years - for perhaps a handful of brain cells. On a scale as large as the human brain, it's going to take us a lot longer. However, if you devoted all the resources in the world to this task, you could speed up the process a lot. So let's say that all the relevant people in this scenario have computers storing their memories, emotions, and personalities. But they still, for some reason, have normal bodies. Creepy. If you mess something up (although at this point, the question would be more like, "Honey, does this new chip make me look slower?"), there's an easy solution: Modify the hard drives storing the person's memories. Make them unconscious, then use some programming to turn that memory into whatever you want it to be. It won't change your actions for the rest of the world, but you can "change" your actions for all who observed it. 

I still have to take into account the other factors you mentioned. I'm not sure if I can finish it all up now, but I'll try. I should be able to finish within the next day or so, depending on when I'm free. 

Yes - well, maybe. Abalone armor is pretty tough.1 While not bulletproof, they're certainly strong, and comparable to some body armor designs currently used by humans (see Lin & Meyers (2005)). Their shells are made from interlocking tiles of calcium carbonate, reminiscent of certain tiled arrangements for bulletproof vests (the ones made of ceramic). However, the tiles are arranged irregularly, in a way that makes it harder to penetrate them. They're bound together with a coating of protein "glue". Abalone armor could be mimicked to create new types of bulletproof vests, or the creatures could develop a stronger version of it. So, I think that some sort of bulletproof armor is possible, if it is based on a system like this. I'm aware that there's an ongoing debate in the paleontological community as to whether the armor of ankylosaurs and related dinosaurs was bulletproof. As far as I know, the evidence does not support or destroy the hypothesis that it was. 

and found that you can get extremely high number densities in the center, if you so desire, which makes sense. 

For lack of more information, though, I'm going to have to stick to the original estimate. Your article states that the initial surface temperature of the star is ~2230 K, prior to entering the blue dwarf phase. It then rises to ~5810 K, a change of a factor of about 2.5 The luminosity of a blackbody is proportional to its temperature to the fourth power (see the Stefan-Boltzmann law), so the inner and outer radii of the habitable zone are proportional to the temperature squared. This means that the final outer edge will be ~6 times as far out as it originally was - way beyond the initial frost line, about three times as far out. This seems pretty good, but what about the inner edge of the final habitable zone. Where will that be? According to the same site that provided the formula for the outer edge, the inner edge will be $$r_i=\sqrt{\frac{L_*}{1.1}}\text{ AU}\approx0.70r_0$$ This is about twice as far out as the frost line originally was. So, yes, from at least these estimates, the scenario is quite plausible. 

On to the question. I would suggest using, instead of $2^n$, a logistic function to model population growth. In this case, population ($P$) is a function of time ($t$): $$P=\frac{L}{1-e^{-k(t-t_0)}}$$ where $L$ is the maximum value of the function and $k$ is some constant. The reason for using this model is that even though these ants have a, um, unique digestive system, there are limiting factors to their population, such as predators and death by other natural causes. The change in population at a given time is $$\frac{dP}{dt}=kP \left(1-\frac{P}{L} \right)$$ To figure out how the total input of matter is at a given time, we can write $$\frac{dM}{dt}=\frac{dP}{dt} \frac{dM}{dP} = kP \left(1-\frac{P}{L} \right) (0.001 \times P)$$ and then integrate from $0$ to $M_{\text{Earth}}$. The time will be in seconds. $k$ and $L$ must be empirically determined. 

Each of those items you listed requires certain people with expertise in different fields. Here's who you'd need for each one: 

to the program. Now, I would also have to transfer some of the intermediate steps, too, such as calculating the Christoffel symbols. Let's say, though, I didn't use the concept of Einstein summation notation but did everything out by hand. Let's also say that while I translated (in spherical coordinates) $$\frac{1}{2}\Gamma _{abc}=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^c}g_{ab}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x^b}g_{ac}-\frac{\partial}{\partial x^a}g_{bc}+\right)$$ correctly for $\Gamma_{ttt}$, $\Gamma_{tt r}$, $\Gamma_{tt \theta}$, and so forth, I made a mistake for the case of, say, $\Gamma_{rt \phi}$. This would mean that the computer would make weird calculations that it shouldn't have, that could throw everything off. Now, the reason I said that this might not count as a bug would be that this program is like The Game of Life: you write up the laws and click 'start'. So that error would simply become part of the physical laws in the simulation. It wouldn't make sense, but it would be a law nonetheless. 

It takes days to get to the Moon, and months to get to Mars. Do you really want to have to send a ship all that way just to make a payment for spaceship insurance, or to pay taxes, or to pay someone to mine for you on another planet? Of course not. That's slow and inefficient, and carries dangers. What if the ship crashes, or explodes? For planet-to-planet transactions, this is a terrible mode of payment. Use cryptocurrency instead, sent through signals in radio transmissions. Data in the transmissions can encode how much money is being sent from whom to whom. When you're on planets, you can just carry a card - like a credit card - and swipe that. The card contains money connected to your "Bitcoin" digital supply. A government - governments, really - would need to endorse the currency, to ensure its stability. That's one issue that Bitcoin has faced for a long time. In fact, you'll definitely need international approval. I highly doubt that only one country is involved in this space exploration. Cooperation is the only viable option. 

Have followers go to orphanages. There are quite a lot of children without anyone to care for them, and, unfortunately, that number is growing all the time. Adoption is relatively easy; most people would probably pass the background checks to be eligible to adopt someone. In other words, the people in this religion leave the sex to other people, and take the offspring that are unwanted or no longer have parents. Make it part of the central religious text that at least once every five or so years, a married couple must go an adopt a child. They will be rewarded in the afterlife if they adopt more. This is, in part, how the Shakers grew. Children left on doorsteps were taken in. 

In the nation of Xenqu, a hereditary monarchy has ruled for centuries. The Xenquan society is in a medieval period, although the recent invention of paper and the increasing use of gunpowder may signal the start of a period of relative industrialization. One day, everyone aged 25 years or more drops dead. The frightened remnants of society see that the dead show no signs of any injuries. Magic? Perhaps. That is the only conclusion they can make. Over the next few months, people suddenly keel over the instant they turn 25 years old. It quickly becomes apparent what the cut-off age is. People are anxious to find a way to combat this plague, whatever it may be. In the meantime, some form of government is needed. The problem is, most people are relatively uneducated, given that the average age has now plummeted to somewhere in the mid-teens, and will slowly rise as the birth rate inevitably drops. The son of the monarch at the time of the collapse was 22 years old, and so he now regains the throne. But there are no other members of the royal family left, and he has only three years to live. What form of government will the people choose? It seems incredibly difficult for the uneducated population to make critical decisions in a democracy, and yet any monarch old enough to properly rule will die before any lasting policies can be implemented. Other forms of government suffer from the same flaws. Additionally, should the government be on a national level, or would splitting up the kingdom into independent states (think of nations the size of states in the Holy Roman Empire) and allowing local government power be a more effective choice? Here are the factors I'd like to focus on:
