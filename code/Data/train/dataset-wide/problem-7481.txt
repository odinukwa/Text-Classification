David Harbater wrote a paper devoted to this ring (denoted by $\mathbf{Z}\{t\}$) and similar ones, see "Convergent arithmetic power series", Amer. J. Math., 106 (1984), no. 4, pp. 801-846. In particular, in Lemma 1.5, he proves that for each $r \in (0,1)$ and each $\lambda \in \mathbf{C}$ of absolute value at most $r$, there exists $f\in \mathbf{Z}\{t\}$ with a zero of order 1 at $\lambda$ and $\bar\lambda$ and no other zero on the closed disk of center 0 and radius $r$. 

The basic idea is that it is possible to extract $k^\mathrm{th}$-roots of elements of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ that are close enough to 1. This is because you can compute explicitely the radius of convergence of the series $(1+X)^{1/k}$ (because you know the $p$-adic valuation of the factorials, hence of the binomial coefficients). Let us say that the radius of convergence is greater that $p^{-r}$. Now you can write $x= n + yp^r$, with $y\in \mathbb{Z}_p$ and $n$ invertible in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, since $v(x)=0$. Then $x/n = 1+ n^{-1}yp^r$ has a $k^\mathrm{th}$-root. 

I suggest that you look up the Mittag-Leffler decomposition in Fresnel and van der Put's book "Rigid analytic geometry and its applications". It gives you unique representations for elements of the algebra of an affinoid space that is the complement of finitely many open disks in a closed disk (in terms of the sum of a power series in your variable $x$ and of power series in $1/(x-a)$ with one $a$ for each disk you remove). I am not sure that it is exactly what you are looking for though since it is not explicitly in terms of $P$. 

I do not know how to prove the result you want in full generality, but here is a way to do it when $A = K$ is a non-archimedean valued field and $M,M',N,N'$ are Banach spaces over $K$ (and with completed tensor products). First, remark that the composition of two admissible maps is still admissible whenever the first map is surjective or the second injective. Using this and writing the map you want as the composition $$M'\hat{\otimes}_K N' \to \mathrm{Im}(\varphi)\hat{\otimes}_K N' \to \mathrm{Im}(\varphi)\hat{\otimes}_K N \to M \hat{\otimes}_K N,$$ you see that it is enough to prove that an admissible map remains admissible after tensor product by a single Banach space. Then, you can find this result for instance in [Poineau - Pulita, The convergence Newton polygon of a $p$-adic differential equation IV : local and global index theorems, arXiv:1309.3940, Proposition A.3.8 i]. (The language is different since we try to do more general things. What you call admissible is there called strict in $\mathrm{Ban}^b_{M,K}$ and in our case $M$ is a singleton.) The strategy is the following. It comes from [Gruson, Théorie de Fredholm $p$-adique, Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France 94 (1966)] and you can also find a short and nice account of it, especially in you do not read French, in [Rémy - Thuillier - Werner, Bruhat-Tits theory from Berkovich's point of view. I: realizations and compactifications of buildings. Ann. Sci. École Norm. Sup. 43 (2010), proof of Lemma A.5]. Now to the point. Say we start with an admissible morphism $M'\to M$ and want to tensorize with $N$. Remark that the result is clear if $N$ is finite-dimensional since it is then isomorphic to some $k^n$ with the sup-norm by a well-known result. Then you write $N$ as an direct limit of finite-dimensional subspaces and check that direct limits preserve admissibility (direct computation) and commute with tensor products (right-exactness). Playing a little with completion, you should get the same result for normed spaces and usual tensor products. Maybe it also works with semi-normed spaces and separated completions but I do not have the time to do the computations right now. On the other hand, at the very basis of this strategy lies the fact that norms of finite-dimensional vector spaces are all equivalent. So it is not going to work this way when $A$ is not a valued field. 

I cannot say that I am familiar with étale homotopy types, but I hope that the following remark is relevant: over a field $k$ of mixed characteristic $(0,p)$, with $p>0$, a closed disc will have non-trivial étale covers of degree $p$. Consider for instance the cover defined by $Y^p = 1+X$ over a closed disc (with coordinate $X$) of center 0 and radius $r<1$ close enough to 1 (so that the cover is not split). 

Let $(k,|.|)$ be a complete non-archimedean valued field. Let $D$ be the open unit disc over $k$. (Anything I write could be adapted to the case of an open annulus.) The ring $\mathcal{O}(D)$ of analytic functions on $D$ admits an explicit description: it consists of the series $\sum_{n\ge 0} a_n T^n$ such that for any $r<1$, the sequence $(|a_n|r^n)_{n\ge 0}$ tends to 0. If such a function is bounded, its uniform norm is precisely $\sup_{n\ge 0}(|a_n|)$. For some purposes, it is convenient to consider smaller rings: the ring of bounded functions or the ring of analytic elements, for instance. Let me recall that this latter ring $\mathcal{H}(D)$ is defined as the completion of $k(T) \cap \mathcal{O}(D)$ (i.e. rational functions with no poles in $D$) for the uniform norm on the disc. Remark that this definition depends on the choice of a coordinate $T$ on $D$. Those functions have nice properties: for example, they only have a finite number of zeros on $D$. We refer to Gilles Christol's book (chapter I) for a more detailed account. Consider the disc $D$ inside the affine line $\mathbf{A}^1$. Let $X$ be an affinoid domain of $\mathbf{A}^1$ that contains $D$. One may check that any function on $X$ restricts to an analytic element on $D$, whatever the choice of the coordinate (because the approximation property actually holds for any function on $X$). The question is the following: if $D$ is embedded inside an arbitrary affinoid space $X$, do functions on $X$ still restrict to analytic elements? The issue is that the choice of a coordinate in the definition of $\mathcal{H}(D)$ makes it difficult to use outside the affine line. I would appreciate any idea that helps recognizing analytic elements on a disc inside an arbitrary curve. 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p\ge 0$. Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $k$. Is it possible to find a map $C \to \mathbb{P}^1$ that is tamely ramified at every point of $C$, i.e. such that the ramification index at every point of $C$ is prime to $p$? A result of Fulton says that, if $k$ is (algebraically closed) of characteristic $p\ne 2$, then it is possible to find a morphism $C \to \mathbb{P}^1$ that is a simple cover: only double points may appear and at most one in every fiber. (This is theorem 8.1 in "Hurwitz schemes and the irreducibility of moduli of algebraic curves", Ann. of Math. 90, 1969. He says it is classical and dates back to Severi.) Fulton's result gives a positive answer for fields of characteristic $p\ne 2$. But what about characteristic 2? Does the result still hold? I would already be interested in answers in particular cases (elliptic curves for instance). EDIT: I added the hypothesis that the field is algebraically closed in order to focus on what I am really interested in. Still, I would also appreciate comments on how relevant this hypothesis is. 

Let me begin with the absolute interior. Let me fix first a complete non-archimedean field $k$ (take $k=\mathbb{C}_p$ if you like). For a closed disk $D^+(0;r_1,\dots,r_n)$ (center 0, polyradius $(r_1,\dots,r_n)$), I will call ``naive interior'' the open disk $D^-(0;r_1,\dots,r_n)$. Now, let $Y=\mathcal{M}(B)$ be a $k$-affinoid space. By definition, you may realize it as a Zariski-closed subset of some closed disk $D^+$. The first idea one could have is to define the interior of $Y$ as the set of points that belong to the naive interior of $D^+$. Actually, this depends on the chosen presentation. So you are led to define the absolute interior Int$(Y/k)$ of $Y$ as the set of points that belong to the naive interior of a closed disk $D^+$ for some presentation of $Y$ as as Zariski-closed subset of $D^+$. Let us consider a simple example where $k=\mathbb{C}_p$ and $B =\mathbb{C}_p\{T\}$. Topologically, this disk is a tree. The root (i.e. the Gauss point), I will denote $\eta_1$. If you write $Y=D^+(0;1)$, you see that $D^-(0;1)$ belong to the interior of $Y$. This is an open branch out of the point $\eta_1$. Changing coordinate gives you another presentation and another open disk $D^-(a;1)$ (i.e. another open branch) in the interior. This way, you show that $Y\setminus\{\eta_1\}$ belongs to the interior of $Y$. It is actually equal to it. As regards the relative interior, you just have to replace $k$ by a $k$-affinoid algebra $A$, $B$ by an $A$-affinoid algebra and disks by relative disks over $A$. In your situation, by the same kind of arguments, you will find that the relative interior is the complement of the point $\eta_r$. Actually, Berkovich shows more generally that if $Y \to X$ is the inclusion of an affinoid domain, then Int$(Y/X)$ coincides with the topological interior of $Y$in $X$. 

For all those kind of properties, I recommend looking at Ducros's paper "Les espaces de Berkovich sont excellents" (Ann. Inst. Fourier 59 (2009), no. 4, 1407-1516, $URL$ It is written in the language of Berkovich spaces, so it is even slightly more general than what you want. More precisely, théorème 8.1 tells you that the product of two geometrically reduced spaces is geometrically reduced. Note also that in your case (and more generally over a perfect field), reduced and geometrically reduced are equivalent (see proposition 6.3 and remarque 6.5). Finally, to answer precisely your question, you also need to know that an affinoid algebra $A$ is reduced if, and only if, the associated affinoid space $\mathcal{M}(A)$ (or whatever notation you like best depending on which theory you use) is. In one direction, this is clear: if the space is reduced, then so is its ring of global functions. The other direction is more difficult and relies on the excellence of the affinoid algebra $A$ (thanks to nfdc23 for pointing out that I had forgotten this condition). Using this, in the strictly analytic case (which is the one you want to consider in the setting of rigid geometry), you can deduce that the completions of the analytic local rings at rigid points are reduced because those completions coincide with that of the algebraic local rings (and that the algebraic local rings are reduced and excellent). From this, you deduce that the analytic local rings at rigid points are reduced, hence that the algebras of the affinoid domains are reduced, hence that every analytic local ring is reduced, since it is a colimit of the latter (see theorem 2.2.1 in Berkovich's IHES paper). 

If you are familiar with Berkovich spaces, you can do the following construction. Let $X$ be an affinoid space of positive dimension and pick a point $x$ in $X$ that is not a rigid point. Consider the inclusion map $i\colon x \to X$. Then the sheaf $F = i_*\mathbb{Z}$ does the job. Since the space $X$ is Hausdorff, the point $x$ is closed and the sheaf $F$ has no section on the open set $X\setminus \{x\}$. Let me try to rewrite this example purely in terms of rigid geometry in a simple case: $X$ is the closed unit disc over an algebraically closed field $k$ and $x$ is the point at its boundary (the Gauss point). The previous sheaf may then be described as follows: for an affinoid domain $V$ of $X$, we have $F(V)=0$ if every connected component of $V$ is contained in an open unit disc (with any center) and $F(V)=\mathbb{Z}$ otherwise. 

In both cases, the henselization $A^h$ of your ring $A$ is its algebraic closure in its completion $\hat{A}$.This follows for instance from Artin approximation (Algebraic approximation of structures over complete local rings, Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS, 36, 1969, p. 23-58): any system of polynomial equations that has a solution in $\hat{A}$ has a solution in $A^h$ (and you may find a solution as close as you want to the original one). 

I am quite surprised by the attribution to Kiehl that you saw. Anyway, I think the result is due to Ursula Köpf (not only over a field $K$ but actually over an affinoid space): "Über eigentliche Familien algebraischer Varietäten über affinoiden Räumen", Schriftenreihe Univ. Münster, 2 Serie, Heft 7 (1974). Brian Conrad gave another proof as an application of his results of relative ampleness in the rigid analytic setting (see "Relative ampleness in rigid geometry", Ann. Inst. Fourier (Grenoble) 56 (2006), n° 4). I also learned a proof from Antoine Ducros in the setting of Berkovich spaces. I wrote in down in an appendix to my paper "Raccord sur les espaces de Berkovich", Algebra & Number Theory 4 (2010), n° 3). It is very close to Serre's proof in the complex analytic setting and probably very close to Köpf's proof too, but I cannot say for sure since I never saw her paper. 

There are different answers to your questions depending on what you have in mind. If you want to compare the spaces themselves, then Berkovich spaces and rigid analytic spaces are very close. I would say that it is similar to the relation between schemes of finite type over $\mathbb{C}$ and complex varieties in a naive sense, i.e. with only $\mathbb{C}$-points. You can have a look at Berkovich's book "Spectral theory etc.", section 3.3, for precise statements. Fix a non-archimedean complete valued field $k$ with non-trivial valuation. Then, there is a functor from the category of strictly $k$-analytic spaces (Berkovich spaces) to rigid spaces with good properties: it preserves cohomology, for instance. At the level of points, the functor is easy to describe: you keep the points whose residue field is a finite extension of $k$. As for the essential image of the functor, I am not sure what to say, but you can at least build a Berkovich space from a quasi-compact and quasi-separated rigid space in a satisfactory way (see Conrad's notes mentioned in Colin McLarty's answer). (There are technical points that show that Berkovich's theory is actually more general. First, trivial valuation on $k$ is allowed. Second, the basic algebras of rigid geometry are the Tate algebras $k\{T_1,\dots,T_n\}$ that contain power series with radius of convergence at least 1, whereas Berkovich allows any radii.) So the spaces are more or less the same, but I think the way you think about them is different. For example, Berkovich spaces are true topological spaces (as opposed to the Grothendieck topology of rigid spaces), which makes it easier to adapt the local methods from complex analytic geometry. In my mind, rigid analytic spaces look more algebraic. As regards formal schemes, they are quite different objects. The relation is that the rigid spaces and Berkovich spaces are their generic fibers. So a formal scheme has more information. Raynaud's theory (see his paper in Mémoires de la S.M.F 39-40 (1974), p.319-327) actually tells you how to pass from a model to another (by blowing-ups ideals supported on the special fiber), which makes it possible to recover the category of rigid spaces purely in terms of formal schemes (by a suitable localization). This makes the analytic theory very much algebraic! A big gain is that you may now use everything that has been developed in the algebraic setting and push it on the analytic side. For example, you can show the coherence of proper direct images of coherent sheaves this way (see Lütkebohmert, Math. Ann. 286 (1990), p.341-171). I hope this helps. If you have more specific questions, please ask!
