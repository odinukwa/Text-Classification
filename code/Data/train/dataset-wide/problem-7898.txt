Not quite what you asked for, but possibly useful if you haven't yet read it, is Baraniuk et al, A Simple Proof of the Restricted Isometry Property for Random Matrices. This was one of the most readable introductions that I found when I was learning about CS. For the basics of Kolmogorov Complexity you could do worse than Cover and Thomas, Elements of Information Theory. 

I'm assuming, since you don't say, that the balls are drawn with uniform probability. Number and order the balls then, for fixed i, the probability of picking the i-th ball last, after picking the other N-1 balls at least twice each is no greater than $1/N^2 \times 1/N$. Likewise for the other N-1 balls, so the probability you're after is no greater than $N \times 1/N^2 \times 1/N = 1/N^2$ and no less than zero, so $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} P_{N} = 0$ by squeeze rule. 

Hi Jose, it's in the British library collection: $URL$ Haven't checked what the fees are, but you could order it from there. Alternatively, you could try the LMS: $URL$ A good chance they will have the procs in their library, and you can get photocopies for a nominal fee. Several other similar alternatives too. 

I can see why your professors would be keen to lead you away from false intuitions based on visualization, but even false intuitions can be useful as they often suggest a possible proof (which you then find doesn't hold in general) so you can at least get started on a problem. For me linear algebra is a `visual' subject - there are nice geometric interpretations of linear transforms (preserve lines, parallelism, intersections, etc.) that I personally find extremely useful in my work. You asked for practical advice - here is mine: Do what works for you to solve problems, do what your professors say to pass the course. 

Is it too abstract to motivate complex numbers in terms of the equations we can solve depending on whether we choose to work in ${\mathbb N, \mathbb Z, \mathbb Q, \mathbb R, \mathbb C}$? The famous "John and Betty" ($URL$ takes such an approach. 

"Is there a good book which takes a very streamlined (if perhaps hard to understand) approach to proving the existance of bases" Michael Artin's Algebra Ch 3, S 3 does what you are asking for in under four pages (and is not hard to understand). 

Question: Are these “obvious” candidates for the stable limit correct? If so, would seem that to determine the topological type of the stable limit, once it is assumed to exist, that often no blowing up and down or base change is needed. And since Milnor’s book appeared in 1968, this presumably would have been known for a long time. Historical references: Although I had long ago read the original sources: Mayer: $URL$ and Mumford: $URL$ and Deligne and Mumford: $URL$ I was discouraged by the apparent complexity of computing examples, and did not notice the connection with Milnor fibers until recently, while watching an expert (Joe Harris) explain some simple cases. He was using the method of blowing up, but his answers sparked this question. How much truth is there in this simple topological intuition? Is this something one learns on day 1 nowadays, or is it too optimistic? One reservation is that Milnor’s theory was apparently proved by him only in the case of hypersurfaces, curves on smooth surfaces. Remark It seems that to answer this in the affirmative, one only needs to know that the part of the stable reduction residual to the normalization, i.e. the "tail", is connected and meets the normalization once at each branch of the singularity. I.e. then it seems to follow that after smoothing all the nodes of the tail except the ones where it meets the normalization, one has an irreducible smooth tail of precisely the genus given by the Milnor number calculation. I want to express my gratitude for a recent conversation with Enrico Arbarello, who observed that this method should also apply to degenerations of pointed curves. Moreover he remarked the usefulness of examining morphisms between various manifestations of such curves, such as the normalization morphism. As a consequence, it seems normalization should commute with stable degeneration, and hence the Milnor method should apply as stated to pointed curves. E.g. consider a 2 pointed curve where the 2 points are coming together. A neighborhood of the limit is a disc containing the two points. Hence the limit should have as a limiting tail, the sphere obtained by shrinking to a point the circular boundary of the disk. Thus the tail is a sphere with 2 marked points. 

Let $G$ be a l.c. group and $f$ belong to $C_c(G)$, the space of continuous functions with compact support. Define an operator$T_f$ on $L^2(G)$ by $T_f(g)=f*g$ (the convolution product). If $T_f$ is positive and invertible, could $\|T_f\|$ belong to the point spectrum of $T_f$? 

Let $H$ be a Hilbert space and $T$ be a bounded and positive operator on $H$. Define a real function $f$ on positive real numbers by $$f(r):=\|(r+T)^{-1}\|^{-1}-r\quad(r\in\mathbb R_+).$$ Does the image of $f$ contain a positive number? 

Let $A$ be a Banach algebra and $E$ be an irreducible Banach $A$-module. Is there a countably incomplete ultra filter $\mathcal U$ on $\mathbb N$, the set of natural numbers, such that the ultra power $(E)_\mathcal U$ becomes an irreducible Banach $A$-module? (The Banach $A$-module, $E$, which I work with is reflexive, also $E'$ is an irreducible $A$-module.) 

It is obvious that for a Banach space $E$, $E$ is reflexive iff $\ell^2(E)$ is reflexive. Let $\mathcal U$ be an ultrafilter. Is the reflexivity of $(E)_\mathcal U$ equivalent to refelxivity of $(\ell^2(E))_\mathcal U$? 

Denote by $\sim$ the "Murray-von Neumann" equivalence in the projection lattice of a von Numann algebra. Let $e$ be a projection in a properly infinite factor. Is it always true that $e\sim 1$ or $1-e\sim 1$? 

Having $\overline{\text{Im}M^2}=\overline{\text{Im}M}=\overline{\text{Im}M^\frac12}$, we obtain that $M\overline{\text{Im}M}$ is a dense subset of $\overline{\text{Im}M^2}=\overline{\text{Im}M}=\overline{\text{Im}M^\frac12}$, so \begin{align} \text{The norm of}\,S&=\sup\{\|y\|^{-1}_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}\|Sy\|_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}: 0\neq y\in \overline{\text{Im}M^\frac12}\}\\ &=\sup\{\|y\|^{-1}_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}\|Sy\|_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}: 0\neq y\in M\overline{\text{Im}M}\}\\ &=\sup\{\|Mx\|^{-1}_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}\|SMx\|_{\text{Im}(M^{1/2})}: 0\neq x\in \overline{\text{Im}M}\} \end{align} 

Do there exist an amenable Beurling algebra that is neither Arens regular nor strongly Arens irregular? In his memoir "The second duals of Beurling algebras", A. T. Lau proved that there exists a weight $\omega$ on $\mathbb Z$ such that $\ell^1(\mathbb Z,\omega)$ is neither Arens regular nor strongly Arens irregular, but this algebra is not amenable. 

For $T\in B(F)$, we have $\ker T=\ker T^*T$ and $\ker T=(\text{Im} T^*)^\perp$, so for a positive operator $M$ we obtain $\ker M^{1/2}=\ker M$, whence $$F=\ker M\oplus\overline{\text{Im} M}=\ker M^{1/2}\oplus\overline{\text{Im} M^{1/2}}$$ If $P$ denote the projection on $\overline{\text{Im} M}=\overline{\text{Im} M^{1/2}}$,then $$\langle M^{1/2}x,M^{1/2}y\rangle=\langle M^{1/2}Px,M^{1/2}Py\rangle=\langle MPx,Py\rangle=\langle Px,Py\rangle_M$$ so $F/\ker M=\overline{\text{Im} M^{1/2}}$ and the product defined on $F/\ker M$ is just the one defined on $\overline{\text{Im} M^{1/2}}$. 

Let $E$ be a reflexive Banach space. Let $\{x_n\}_n$ be a bounded sequence of linearly independent elements of $E$. Does there exist a sequence $\{\phi_n\}_n$ of elements of $E^*$ (the dual of $E$) such that $\langle x_n,\phi_m\rangle=\delta_{mn}$ and $\sum\|\phi_n\|<\infty$. As Nate Eldredge's argument below shows, there is not such sequence $\{\phi_n\}$. Indeed I have a bounded sequence $\{y_n\}$ and I want to know if there is a bounded operator $T\in\mathcal L(E)$ such that $Tx_n=y_n$ for a bounded sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $E$. I thought if $\{x_n\}$ is a bounded linearly independent sequence, then one can define $T=\sum y_n\odot \phi_n$ which $\{\phi_n\}$ is as above. So my main question is that if there is such an operator $T$? 

In regard to your request to link the intuition to the concept of stalk space, recall that a sheaf can be regarded as a presheaf with two special properties: i) elements which are locally equal are in fact equal, and ii) families of local elements which agree on local overlaps come from a globally given element. The first property is characteristic of presheaves of FUNCTIONS, i.e. given any property P, assigning to an open set U the set of functions on U with property P is a presheaf with the first property. Then further assigning to each open set U the set of functions on U having the property P locally in U is actually a presheaf with both sheaf properties. Thus a sheaf can be viewed as a presheaf of functions defined by a local property. In the setting of (etale') spaces, to sheafify a presheaf one first defines the stalk at each point, and for each element defined over U, its germ in the stalk at each point of U. Then the first step of sheafification is to equate two elements ("sections") of the presheaf over U if they have the same germs at each point of U. This makes the presheaf into a sheaf of functions (an element takes x to its germ at x) with values in the set of stalks. the second step adds in all functions from U to the stalks over U that are locally of this form, i.e. locally given by taking germs of elements defined in open subsets of U. This two step process sheafifies the presheaf into a sheaf of locally defined functions. ( Maurice Auslander taught it this way in 1965 at Brandeis in first year graduate algebra.) 

As an alternative to Francesco's nice geometric argument, the answer to question 1 is no, by definition of "hyperelliptic". I.e. a curve is hypereliptic if it has a line bundle of degree 2 with more than one section. If g = 3, any effective even theta charcteristic is such a line bundle. As to the subvariety M(1,g), this was (mostly) understood already by Riemann. I.e. if we look at the image of M(g) in the space of prin.pol. abelian varieties, then M(1,g) is just the intersection of Jacobians with the ample divisor defined by the vanishing of the theta function, hence it has pure codimension one, and is non empty. If g-1 is twice an odd number, the presence of hyperelliptics in this locus avoids the use of ampleness. 

For Banach spaces $E$ and $F$ we denote the approximate operators by $\mathcal A(E,F)$ and projective tensor product by $\hat\otimes$. Consider the natural map $$\Delta: \mathcal A(\ell^q,\ell^p)\hat\otimes\mathcal A(\ell^p,\ell^q)\rightarrow \mathcal A(\ell^p), \quad S\otimes T\mapsto ST$$ Can we write elements in image of $\Delta$ in form of $TS$ where $T\in\mathcal A(\ell^q,\ell^p)$ and $S\in\mathcal A(\ell^p,\ell^q)$? 

Let $B(m,n)$ be the Burnside group on $m$ generators of exponent $n$. Suppose the class number - the number of conjugacy classes - of $B(m,n)$ is finite. Does it imply that $B(m,n)$ is finite? 

Let $H_0:=(\ker M)^\perp$ and $E$ be the projection on $H_0$. Then $$[\xi,\eta]:=\langle M\xi,\eta\rangle\quad(\xi,\eta\in H_0)$$ define an inner product on $H_0$. Assume that $H$ is a completion of $H_0$ w.r.t. the norm, $\||\cdot\||$ induced by $[\cdot,\cdot]$. It is easy to show that for $S\in\mathcal B(F)$, $S\in\mathcal B_M(F)$ iff $ES|_{H_0}\in\mathcal B(H)$ and $\|S\|_M$ is just the norm of $ES|_{H_0}$ in $\mathcal B(H)$. So the result you want follows from the fact you mentioned ($r(T)\leq w(T)$). 

Denote by $U(M)$ the group of unitary elements of a von Neumann algebra $M$. $\rho|_A$ is inner iff $u\in U(A)U(A')$. Assume first that $u\in U(A)U(A')$, so there are $v\in U(A)$ and $w\in U(A')$ with $u=vw$. Then for $a\in A$ we have $$\rho(a)=uau^*=vwaw^*v^*=vav^*$$ On the other hand, if there exist $v\in U(A)$ such that $uau^*=\rho(a)=vav^*$, then $v^*ua=av^*u$, $a\in A$, whence $v^*u\in U(A')$ and $u=v(v^*u)\in U(A)U(A')$ 

We may say that two finitely generated groups $G$ and $H$ are generating-bijective when there exist homomorphisms $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ and $\psi:H\rightarrow G$ such that, for each ordered generating sets $\mathfrak g$ and $\mathfrak h$ of $G$ and $H$, resp. we can find ordered generating sets $\mathfrak h'$ and $\mathfrak g'$ of $H$ and $G$ resp. such that $$\phi(\mathfrak g')=\mathfrak h,\quad \psi(\mathfrak h')=\mathfrak g$$ Do there exist finitely generated groups $G$ and $H$ along with epimorphisms $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ and $\psi:H\rightarrow G$, such that $G$ and $H$ aren't generating-bijective? 

Is the norm on a unital semi-simple commutative Banach algebra with $\|I\|=1$, unique? ($I$ denotes the identity element) 

I saw it as an exercise (E1.4.2) in the book "Analysis Now" by "Gert. K. Pedersen" with slight difference; $f$ is defined by $$f:\mathbb R\rightarrow\mathbb R,\quad x\mapsto\limsup\frac1n{\sum_{k=1}^nx_n}$$ where $x-\lfloor x\rfloor=0.x_1x_2\dots$ is the binary expansion of the fractional part of $x$.
