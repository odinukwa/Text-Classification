Let G be a finite solvable group. If p,q,r are distinct primes dividing |G|, then G contains an element of order the product of two of these three primes. This is lucido's three prime lemma. I encountered it in a paper. Could not solve it yet, but also had a thought that will there be a bigger class of finite groups for which it holds, a class which contains all solvable groups. Can somebody give a proof of original, and tell me has there been some research in the direction of classes for which it is true? 

The zero divisor conjecture implies the idempotent conjecture as $1$ and $0$ are the only idempotents in a ring with unity and no zero-divisors, nothing sure about the other way around 

By the way, my above proof shows in fact the following: if k is a non-trivially valued field, if A is a strictly affinoid k-algebra and if X is a finitely generated A-scheme of pure (Krull) dimension d, then X^an is also of pure dimension d. 

Yes, there is a good notion of dimension, due to Berkovich and developed in my article, as mentioned in the two answers above. Concerning your question about GAGA principle for pure dimension, the answer is positive. I do not know whether it is explicitly written down in the litterature (I did not write it in my paper, for instance), but I can sketch the proof here. Since everything is invariant under ground field extension, you may assume that your ground field is not trivially valued. Now in order to prove that a strict analytic space is purely d-dimensional, it is sufficient to check that the dimension of O_X,x is equal to d for every rigid point x. But this can be checked after completion, and at a rigid point the analytic and algebraic local rings have the same completions, QED. Remark: there is certainly also GAGA for irreducible components (an irreducible scheme has an irreducible analytification) but it is not so easy to prove to my knowledge. Using normalization it can be reduced to GAGA for connectedness, for which I do not know any easy proof: one can compactify and use projective GAGA+Hartog's theorem, or use Berkovich's comparison theorem for étale cohomology at the H^0 level (!). Maybe there is a simpler one using Noether's normalization? 

Similarly, a two unique product group , (t.u.p group) is a group $G$ such that if given any two finite non empty subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G$ with $|A|+|B| > 2$, there exist at least two elements $x$ and $y$ which has a unique representations $x=ab$ and $y=cd$ where $a,c \in A$ and $b,d \in B$. 2) Also Is there a u.p. group which is not t.u.p, as clearly, every t.u.p. group is a u.p. group. As every $RO$ (right ordered)-group is a t.u.p. group which in turn is u.p. group, it was a natural question that came to my find, i.e. does there exist any u.p. group (or t.u.p) which is not $RO$? 

I am looking for an example of a u.p (unique product) group which is not Right ordered. Almost any group I pick up (obviously torsion free, as u.p. group cannot have torsion element, so no use looking in groups with torsion ) turns out to be $RO$, whether it be easy groups like integers, modulo n etc, or groups on matrices, or free groups , etc. Also I have not seen any example of a non- $RO$ group(torsion free), yet. Which is the easiest example of a non-$RO$ group (torsion free)? A group $G$ is said to be u.p., if given any two finite non empty subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G$, there exist at least one element $x$ which has a unique representation $x=ab$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. 

Maybe this question is not suitable for this platform, I already put that same question in math.stackexchange and I find only vague answers. I'm studying the book of Rick Miranda; Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces. I'm studying about degree of projective curves and I find a term used very often and that is very important by the amount of times it appears: "general hyperplane $H$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$" I need to understand what this means, but in the context of the subject. I searched all over Rick Miranda's book, but I could not find it. I read Geometry of Algebraic Curves-Volume I, I often encounter the placement "Let $H$ be a general hyperplane in $\mathbb{P}^n$. Important facts follow from this fact, as for example the calculus of the degree of the map of Gauss constructed from the divisor theta, for the demonstration of the Theorem of Torelli. So it may seem trivial, but it's quite important the meaning of: "general hyperplane $H$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$". It turns out that I can not find it in any book. Everyone just uses it, but I need to know. So I am also grateful for references. Thank you! 

Here $\Delta(G) = \{ g \in G : |G:C_G(g)| < \infty \}$ and $U_1(\mathbb{Z}G) $ is the set of normalized units of the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z}G$ i.e. units with augmentation $1$ In the proof, author first reduces to the case that $G=\Delta(G)$ (which is fine) but after that he says that as we are assuming $G= \Delta {G}$, there is no loss in generality in taking $G$ to be finitely generated. Now for $G=\Delta(G)$, why we do not lose any generality by proving it only for finitely generated groups. Is there some result like, there is no infinitely generated group which has all its conjugacy classes of finite cardinality? I do not think I am aware of any such result. Also $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \dots$ being abelian has only singelton conjugacy classes. Title of Paper- "Trivial Units in Group Rings" Authors- Daniel R. Farkas and Peter A.

If you want to think of $f$ in a way not too far from complex intuition, you should rather consider the induced morphism $\varphi$ from $X$ to the Berkovich affine line. If $x\in X$ then $\varphi(x)$ is the semi-norm $P\mapsto |P(f)(x)|$. 

I think that any quasi-compact, non-empty sober topological space has a closed point (a topological space $X$ is sober if every irreducible closed subset of $X$ has a unique generic point; any scheme is sober). So, let $X$ be such a space. Let $\mathscr F$ be the set of irreducible closed subsets of $X$, ordered by reverse inclusion. The set $\mathscr F$ is inductive; indeed, let $(F_i)_{i\in I}$ be a totally ordered family of irreducible closed subsets of $X$. Let's first prove that its intersection is non-empty. If it were empty then by quasi-compactness (in its dual version, involving intersection of closed subsets), they would exist a finite subset $J$ of $I$ such that $\bigcap _{i\in J}F_i=\varnothing$. But then we get a contradiction: if $J=\varnothing$, then $\bigcap _{i\in J}F_i=X$ and the latter is non-empty by assumption; and if $J$ is non-empty, $\bigcap _{i\in J}F_i=F_i$ for some $i\in J$, hence is non-empty. Now if $x$ is a point in $\bigcap F_i$, then $\overline{\{x\}}$ is an irreducible closed subset of $X$ contained in all the $F_i$'s. Therefore $\mathscr F$ is inductive. It thus has a maximal element $G$. Since $X$ is sober, its closed irreducible subset $G$ has a unique generic point $\eta$. Let $x\in G$. By maximality of $G$ one has $\overline{\{x\}}=G$, and $x=\eta$. As a consequence, $G=\{\eta\}$ and $\eta$ is closed.
