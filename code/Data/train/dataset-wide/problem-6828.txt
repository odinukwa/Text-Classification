(a) Price elasticity is $\eta_d=\frac{\partial Q}{\partial P} \cdot \frac{P}{Q}$. Therefore you get $\eta_d=-2 \cdot \frac{2}{10-2\cdot2}= -\frac{2}{3}$. (b) $Q=10-2 \cdot 3 = 4$. Total expenditure is $3 \cdot 4 = 12$. At a price of 5 units, there is no demand. The consumer surplus for linear demand functions follows $\frac{1}{2}\left(p_{max}-p\right)\cdot x$ with $p_{max}$ as the price where there is no demand. Consumer surplus therefore is $\frac{1}{2}\left(5-3\right)\cdot 4=4$. (c) Total expenditure $TR$ follows $TR=p \cdot x$. For maximizing $TR$ just derive it (and set it to zero) and you get $\frac{\partial TR}{\partial p}=\frac{\partial 10p-2p^2}{\partial p}=10-4\cdot p = 0$. This gives the value $2.5$ for $p$. On how to calculate elasticity see (a). (d) Total expenditure for $p=1$ is $8 \cdot 1 = 8$, for $p=2$ it is $6 \cdot 2 = 12$. If price increases from 1 to 2, $TR$ increases. Look the result in (c), that $p=2.5$ maximizes $TR$. Therefore from $p=1$ to $p=2$, $TR$ has to increase. In equivalent, $TR$ has to decrease when price rises from $p=3$ to $p=4$. 

What you address (and what is done in your referred paper) is called Model Calibration Many economic models use this method to determine one or more parameters: 

An important field in current research is the yet unexplained Equity premium puzzle originally published by Mehra, Prescott (1985). Considere a multiperiod investment consumption equilibrium model (CCAPM) with its important result: $$E_t\left[m_{t,j}\right]=\frac1{\left(1+R_{F,t+j}\right)}$$ where $E_t\left[m_{t,j}\right]$ donates the expected value of a stochastic discount factor (sometimes also referred to as a pricing kernel) and $R_{F,t+j}$ a riskless rate of return. The model states, that the maximized Sharpe-Ratio $SR_{max}$ can be represented as the ratio of the standard deviation of the optimal stochastic discount factor $\sigma_{m^*}$ to its mean: $$SR_{max}=\frac{\sigma_{m^*}}{\overline m}$$ Linking this result with common time separable power utility function shows, that the above equation is approximately the risk-aversion coefficient times the standard deviation of the logarithm of consumption. The problem The average risk premium of the market measured in units of risk is far too high to be explained by any consumption-based representation of the stochastic discount factor. As Cochrane(2001) notes, the Sharpe ratio measured in real terms has been about 0.5 on the basis of the past fifty years (in the US). This implies, that investors are very risk averse, with a coefficient of risk aversion at least 50. What does that number mean? Suppose an individual faced with a 50-50 gamble of doubling or halving his savings. With a level of risk aversion of 50, he would pay 49% of his savings to avoid the loss of 50%. This individual would forgo a 50% chance of doubling his money and accept a certain loss of 49$ to avoid losing an additional 1% more. 

Roughly every 5 years since 1972, The Limits to Growth folks (AKA the Club of Rome) have released a new update to their 1972 book, each time explaining why they had been correct all along (of course) and sometimes pushing back their predictions about when the eventual collapse will set in. In their 30-Year Update, they make no mention whatsoever of gold. The following is the response by two critics to The Limits to Growth, also quoted by Robert Solow in a Newsweek article: 

Further analysis of GVT's Table 4. Many (e.g. @scerwin below) have — without bothering to read GVT (1985) — expressed disbelief that any "trained statistician would ever" take an average of averages in this context. But that is exactly what GVT (1985) did in their Table 4. See their Table 4, columns 2-4 and 5-6, bottom row. They find that averaged across the 26 players, 

I am told very firmly by an economist that a pegged exchange rate is NOT the same thing as a fixed exchange rate. So what, if any, is the difference between the two? Addendum: Here's one webpage about the difference. I am looking for simple explanation of the difference and ideally also some good and simple contrasting examples. Add2: Robert Mundell has a lengthy classification here, but it seems to me that his distinction is not one of kind, but merely one of degree. 

What did he mean by "put them into the paper"? Was this just some sort of paper packaging for the pins? (By the way, my understanding is that pins are what we'd today call nails. Please correct me if I am mistaken.) 

As monthly savings plans are often due at the end of the month, a financial institution buys the underlying assets within the first days of a month. This demand would drive stock prices at the beginning of a month, but this effect is not observable in empirical research. Financial institutions spread the buying of underlying assets. Therefore, they bear market-risk, as the claim of monthly savers on these assets is not covered by the bank/fund by actually holding these assets. I know, that this risk can be managed, but on aggregate, not all institutions can hedge their offered investment plans without holding any underlying asset. 

Make use of your economic model and calibrate t to your data. Thats exactly what the authors do in order to see the dynamics. Lets assume you have the following three observations: 

Although your description is very detailed, there is plenty of research on this topic. I think you are looking for this current published paper: Starmans, Christina & Sheskin, Mark & Bloom, Paul. (2017). Why people prefer unequal societies. Nature Human Behaviour. 1. Article number 0082. doi:10.1038/s41562-017-0082. This paper covers the latest research about inequality. If its not the specific one you are searching for, please look at its 102 references and let us know. 

Let us construct a simple model to explain some dependent variable $y$. The only independent variable to explain $y$ is $x$. The only restriction in our model is, that $\frac{dy}{dx}=1$ must hold for any observation. The steady state Without any further requirements, it is simple to derive the whole model: $$y=x + \mathbf{t}$$ What can be seen, is the appearance of an unknown variable t. As our model contained a differential equation, such additional variables occur. How to deal with them? Calibration 

Collective decision-making is not really a term used by economists. Collective choice theory = social choice theory (SCT). (Sen's 1970 book was titled Collective Choice and Social Welfare, but I think social choice theory is now the more standard term.) 

There is an analogy here to voting. In a simple single-seat, first-past-the-post election, all votes ostensibly count equally. But persuading an additional voter to vote for you the day before election day when the vote is very close, is more important than persuading an additional voter on the first day of campaigning, when the outcome is very uncertain. 

My tentative view is thus that the so-called Concorde Fallacy may itself be a fallacy and yet another academic urban legend — an influential academic makes a mistaken assertion that is then picked up, repeated, and converted into gospel over the subsequent years, without anyone bothering to check if it was ever true in the first place. I am however not an expert on the history of Concorde and am therefore looking for any evidence to the contrary. In particular, at each juncture in the project's history, did any British/French government official cite sunk costs as a reason for continuing with the project? (So far, my reading of the history of the Concorde project is that at every critical juncture, the British/French government may have chosen to plod ahead for a variety of reasons that one could label "foolish". But at no point did anyone argue that they should continue "because they had already sunk so much into the project".) 

Monthly savings plans in stocks or funds are typical investments for many people. On aggregate, these plans generate a large demand on the underlying assets, often around the end/beginning of a month. How do banks or fund managers handle these investments? I assume two strategies, wich both seems to have problems: 

Calibration finds an optimized solution for our yet unknown parameter t. For the three observations above, t would have a value of $2$. Now, you have your full model given with the formula: $$y=x+2$$ Further information I recommend to read this paper, which discusses the use of calibration techniques in economic models. The authors discuss concrete various macroeconomic models on their critical use of calibration and offer more details and best practices on this technique. 

Another unsolved puzzle in economics is the Dividend puzzle studied first by Fischer Black(1976), which evolves from the Modigliani-Miller theorems. Considere well known models for equilibrium in capital markets like the CAPM or the Fama-French 4-factor model. In the latter, return $r_i$ of any asset $i$ is explained by the risk of $i$ towards given portfolios: $$r_i=R_f+\beta_3(K_m-R_f)+b_s\cdot\mathit{SMB}+b_v\cdot\mathit{HML}+\alpha$$ where $R_f$ is the risk-free return rate, and $K_m$ is the return of the market portfolio. $SMB$ and $HML$ are given portfolios (for futher information see here). Besides these models for equilibrium, return $r_i$ can be calculated by Discounted Dividend Models (DDM) like the Gordon-Groth-Model, which do not aim on the whole market. The valuation of a single share is determined by discounting all further dividends, taking into account increasing dividends in the future: $$ P_i= \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} {D_0} \frac{(1+g)^{t}}{(1+r_i)^t}$$ where $P$ is the observable stock price, $g$ the infinite growth rate of dividend payments and $D_0$ the value of current dividend payment (absolute value). Adjusting the formula gives the adequate $r_i$. The problem The dividend a corporation pays, should not affect its valuation. Its clear for equilibrium models, since there is no term in the formula representing dividend payments. Lets look at the Gordon-Growth model: Dividends (and their growth rate) are included within the formulas, but what happens around the payment day? The price of the share drops on the ex-dividend date exactly by the amount of the dividend (besides transaction costs or taxes). It just drops the whole range of possible stock prices by that amount. Empirical studies show (a good overview can be found here), that investors reward dividend-paying companies with higher valuation. Its evaluated by many researchers in the fields behavioral finance, asymmetric information, or taxes, but its not fully explained yet.
