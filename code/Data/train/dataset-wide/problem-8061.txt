Where/when did the convention originate of marking pullback (and/or pushout) squares by that little right-angle symbol in the corner? 

Looking at it this way, the two conditions in Makkai and Paré’s definition say that the canonical map $\underset{i}{\varinjlim} Hom(X,F(i)) \to Hom(X,\underset{i}{\varinjlim} F(i))$ is 

I’ll give first a simplicial definition of univalence, and then a type-theoretic one, and discuss the equivalence between them as we go. The first thing to know is that univalence is a property that can be defined for any family of types, or in models, for any fibration. The Univalence Axiom then says that a particular family of types — a “universe” — is univalent. I’ll come back to the universe at the end. So: what is univalence for a fibration? Roughly, a fibration is univalent just when the map from “paths in the base” to “equivalences between fibers” is itself an equivalence. Precisely: given two fibrations $Y_1, Y_2$ over a common base $X$, write $\newcommand{\Hom}{\mathcal{Hom}}\Hom_X(Y_1,Y_2)$ for the fibred mapping space between them, i.e. the exponential in $\newcommand{\SSet}{\mathbf{SSet}}\SSet/X$, which represents maps between (pullbacks of) $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, and write $\newcommand{\Eqv}{\mathcal{Eqv}}\Eqv_X(Y_1,Y_2)$ for the subobject of $\Hom_X(Y_1,Y_2)$ that represents equivalences between them. So an $n$-simplex of $\Eqv(Y_1,Y_2)$ over a simplex $x \in X_n$ corresponds to an equivalence of fibers $(Y_1)_x \to (Y_2)_x$ over $\Delta[n]$. Now, given a single fibration $Y$ over $X$, we can consider maps between different fibers of $Y$ by first pulling it back to $X \times X$ along the two projections $\pi_1$, $\pi_2$. So $\pi_1^*(Y)_{(x_1,x_2)} \cong Y_{x_1}$, and $\pi_2^*(Y)_{(x_1,x_2)} \cong Y_{x_2}$. Now consider the fibred space of equivalences between these: $\Eqv_{X \times X}(\pi_1^*Y,\pi_2^*Y)$. So an element of this over $(x_1,x_2)$ represents an equivalence $Y_{x_1} \to Y_{x_2}$ between fibers of $Y$. There’s always a map $i : X \to \Eqv_{X \times X}(\pi_1^*Y,\pi_2^*Y)$, living over the diagonal $\Delta_X : X \to X \times X$, where $i(x)$ represents the identity map $Y_x \to Y_x$. Then we define: the fibration $Y \to X$ is univalent if this map $i : X \to \Eqv_{X \times X}(\pi_1^*Y,\pi_2^*Y)$ is a weak equivalence. Some easily equivalent forms: 

$\DeclareMathOperator{\rk}{rk}$If I’m not mistaken, there’s a rather easy crude bound: $o(P) < (\omega \cdot (\rk P))^+$, where $(-)^+$ is cardinal successor. Since $o(P)$ is the order-type of some linearisation, it’s clear that $|o(P)| = |P|$, and so $o(P) < |P|^+$. So if we can bound the cardinality of $P$ based on its rank, then we get a bound on its type. On the other hand, for each $\alpha < \rk P$, the elements of rank precisely $\alpha$ form an antichain. So there are only finitely many elements of each rank; so $|P| \leq \omega . |\rk P|$. (Thanks to @Sylvain for pointing out an unnecessary overcomplication in my original answer.) 

If you are taking a universes-based approach, i.e. fixing some universe (e.g. a Grothendieck universe $U$ or an inaccessible cardinal $\alpha$) and calling sets in this universe “small”, and defining a category to have an arbitrary set of objects but small hom-sets, then no, there is no universal category. A “universal category” would have to contain an embedded copy of every ordinal; that would force an injection from every set into its set of objects. But that’s impossible, if its objects are to form a set, since for any set $X$, its power-set $\mathcal{P(X)}$ doesn’t embed into $X$. If you are taking a universes-based approach as above and taking category to mean small category, then again no, there is no universal category, essentially by the same argument. It would have to contain an embedded copy of every small ordinal, hence an injection from every small set, so since small sets are closed under taking power-sets, its objects can’t form a small set. If you are taking the approach that a category may have a proper class of objects, and that only the individual hom-sets are required to be sets, then I’m not sure whether there can exist a universal category. 

This now makes it all work again! But, this relied on all basic relations $R$ taking at least one argument. In any language with this property, we're good. The one thing we can't generally deal with is theories with nullary relation symbols, aka propositional constants — although we can sometimes still handle them like we handled $\top$ and $\bot$ in $ZFC$. (Actually, I'm not quite sure what you mean by “how would ZFC and PA be weakened if we changed the definition of a defining formula” – since I don't know axiomatisations of those theories that involve this term. But the standard axiomatisation of ZFC does involve functions (in the replacement axiom), which are just defining formulas $f(x,y)$ with an extra free variable $y$, so I guess what you have in mind might be something like strengthening the definition of function allowed in there? But I think the above construction should answer the question, in any case!) 

As other commenters have mentioned, powers and copowers (aka cotensors and tensors) are an alternative direction in which you can generalise finite products and coproducts. However, I don't know a way to see your example $\mathbb{B}$ as an instance of these. 

It’s grammatically ugly, but mathematically transparent and unambiguous, and rolls off the tongue reasonably well. I’ve heard it used by and among set theorists, category theorists, and homotopy theorists, without confusion — I’m pretty sure it’s as widely understood as anything will be for this distinction. 

Edit: I originally missed the part where you say you want “special isomorphisms” to correspond to “natural isomorphisms $\newcommand{\Hom}{\mathrm{Hom}} \Hom(X,-) \to \Hom(Y,-)$, where $\Hom(X,-)$ is viewed as a functor on the whole category, not just the special morphisms”. This is a bit ambiguous, so let’s take some notation: call the larger category $\newcommand{\C}{\mathcal{C}}\newcommand{\D}{\mathcal{D}}\newcommand{\sp}{\mathrm{sp}}\C$, and the special subcategory $\C^\sp$. If by $\Hom$ you mean $\Hom_\C$, then the Yoneda lemma says that natural isomorphisms $\Hom_\C(X,-) \to \hom_\C(Y,-)$, considered as functors on $\C$, will always correspond to isomorphisms in $\C$ (not generally special ones as you want). Similarly, natural isos $\Hom_\sp(X,-) \to \hom_\sp(Y,-)$, as functors on $\C^\sp$, always correspond to isomorphisms in $\C^\sp$. We can restrict $\Hom_\C(X,-)$ to a functor on just $\C^\sp$. Considered as such, there may be more natural isomorphisms $\Hom_\C(X,-) \to \Hom_\C(Y,-)$ (natural just w.r.t. special maps) that don’t correspond to any isos in $\C$, special or otherwise. (Consider the case where $\C$ is a group, viewed as a one-object category, and only the identity is designated as special; then any automorphism of the underlying set will give a natural isomorphism of this form.) It sounds most like what you want is to consider $\Hom_\sp(X,-)$ as a functor on the whole of $\C$. But this is not possible: the functorial action doesn’t extent, because when you compose a special arrow with an arbitrary map, it doesn’t generally stay special (except in the trivial case where all maps are special). 

The question of local toposes and similar categories was discussed a couple of years ago on the categories list by Peter Johnstone and others, if I recall correctly. I don't know anywhere that they appear in print, but I don't know the topos theory literature nearly well enough to be an authoratitive source on this. 

A quotation from J.L. Doob, on Paul Lévy, used as an epigraph by Tom Leinster in A survey of definitions of n-category. Lightly amusing on first reading; more seriously so when one recalls it while going through that pain; most serious, and less amusing, when one tries to write with one’s readers’ pain in mind. 

I'd think of it as being the pushout functor along $a$, between co-slice categories: $$a_* \colon\ c\backslash C\ \longrightarrow\ e\backslash C$$ Mac Lane CWM gives a nice treatment of pullback functors, which iirc contains statements dual to everything you mention here. (So this construction is a lot more general than the example: all that matters is that the diagram involved has an initial object $c$, hence can be seen as living not just in $C$ but in $c \backslash C$. The “joins are colimits” condidition isn't needed; and the pushouts don't have to be computed “successively” — the “two pushouts lemma”, or equivalently the functoriality of $a_*$, shows that computing them successively or all-at-once gives the same result.) (answer jointly written with Michael Warren) 

Such sets are interesting — they're known as Quine atoms. As Dan says, they're forbidden in ZFC by the axiom of foundation (or equivalent axioms such as regularity), but they can exist in various nonstandard set theories. Under Aczel's anti-foundation axiom, there's a unique Quine atom. On the other hand, with neither foundation nor anti-foundation assumed, lots of things are consistent iirc: there can be any number of Quine atoms you want, even a proper class (and there's a very cute consistency proof for this, using permutation models, which I can't quite recall). Everything I used to know about Quine atoms, I learned from Thomas Forster, who is rather keen on them! I don't think he's on MO, but I'll see if he has anything to add on the matter… 

[1]: The two main definitions of $\|X\|$ I know are “the least ordinal bijective to $X$” (elegant, but requires choice to be defined for all $X$), or “$\{ Y \in V_\alpha\ |\ Y \cong X \}$, where $\alpha$ is minimal such that this is non-empty” (less transparent but more robust). [2]: I first heard this definition from Voevodsky, though I’m pretty sure it had been considered by others before as well. He calls this property being a set, but I want to make unambiguous that it’s a restriction of categorical dimension not of size. 

Many people would say this is a terrible suggestion, I think, but depending on your tastes and style, Peter Johnstone’s 1971 book “Topos Theory” might be good. …true, it’s exceedingly dry, and has been described as “famously impenetrable”, and I certainly wouldn’t recommend it as an only text to try to learn about toposes from. But I actually found it very helpful when I was first learning Topos Theory — first and foremost because it has really, really excellent exercises, with a big range of subjects and difficulties. Secondarily, I also found that once I’d struggled tooth and nail to understand a construction elsewhere, I could come back to Johnstone and appreciate a really clear, neat, perfectly tuned presentation — albeit one I wouldn’t have been able to get anywhere with on its own.
