Many arguments I presented here also return in the paper that can be found following this link: $URL$ 

The question refers to the double-entry bookkeeping principle used in balance of payments accounting. Each transaction must appear twice in the balance of payments, once as debit and once as a credit. An imported good can be paid for by (1) transferring money from a bankaccount in the importing country to a bank account in the exporting country, (2) cash can be transferred or (3) the importing country may be incurring a liability (the obligation to pay for the goods), while the exporting country acquires an asset (the receiving of a future payment). These transactions are, without any doubt, registered somewhere in the financial account. I am not entirely sure, but I believe all three situations would be registered as portfolio investments. The sixth IMF BoP manual says the following: 

In the paper cited at the end of this answer, the incentives for all three parties involved are discussed. Not only did the creditors suffer from a lower return after the conversion, they also faced longer maturities and, given the strong heterogeneity in lending terms across bonds, also a destruction of bond specific information. Nevertheless, conversions in line with your description were beneficial for the owners of the converted bonds since the conversion increased liquidity (the liquidity of the shares highly contrasted the illiquidity of government bonds) and reduced the probability of government default. In addition, the shares represented claims on rents of the company. Though, for the specific case of the South Sea Company, there have never been any rents involved. 

The technique described in the question is almost correct. Consider a panel data set consisting of three cross-sections ($a$, $b$, and $c$) and three time-periods ($1$, $2$, and $3$). Let y denote the column vector with the observations of the dependent variable, x the column vector with observations of the first explanatory variable, and z the column vector with observations of the second explanatory variable. They take these forms respectively: $\textbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} y_{a1} \\ y_{a2} \\ y_{a3} \\ y_{b1} \\ y_{b2} \\ y_{b3} \\ y_{c1} \\ y_{c2} \\ y_{c3} \end{bmatrix}$ ; $\textbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_{a1} \\ x_{a2} \\ x_{a3} \\ x_{b1} \\ x_{b2} \\ x_{b3} \\ x_{c1} \\ x_{c2} \\ x_{c3} \end{bmatrix}$; $\textbf{z} = \begin{bmatrix} z_{a1} \\ z_{a2} \\ z_{a3} \\ z_{b1} \\ z_{b2} \\ z_{b3} \\ z_{c1} \\ z_{c2} \\ z_{c3} \end{bmatrix}$. Let $\bar{y}_{i} = \frac{1}{3}(y_{ai} + y_{bi}+y_{ci})$, with $i = 1, 2, 3$, and equivalently for $x$ and $z$: $\bar{x}_{i} = \frac{1}{3}(x_{ai} + x_{bi}+x_{ci})$ and $\bar{z}_{i} = \frac{1}{3}(z_{ai} + z_{bi}+z_{ci})$, both for $i = 1, 2, 3$. This is the correct way to get the CCEP estimator allowing for one common factor, as in the model described in the question: \begin{equation*} \begin{split} \begin{bmatrix} y_{a1} \\ y_{a2} \\ y_{a3} \\ y_{b1} \\ y_{b2} \\ y_{b3} \\ y_{c1} \\ y_{c2} \\ y_{c3} \end{bmatrix} = \beta_{1} \begin{bmatrix} x_{a1} \\ x_{a2} \\ x_{a3} \\ x_{b1} \\ x_{b2} \\ x_{b3} \\ x_{c1} \\ x_{c2} \\ x_{c3} \end{bmatrix}+\beta_{2}\begin{bmatrix} z_{a1} \\ z_{a2} \\ z_{a3} \\ z_{b1} \\ z_{b2} \\ z_{b3} \\ z_{c1} \\ z_{c2} \\ z_{c3} \end{bmatrix}+ \gamma_{a} \begin{bmatrix} \bar{y}_{1} \\ \bar{y}_{2} \\ \bar{y}_{3} \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} +\gamma_{b} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \bar{y}_{1} \\ \bar{y}_{2} \\ \bar{y}_{3} \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + \gamma_{c} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \bar{y}_{1} \\ \bar{y}_{2} \\ \bar{y}_{3} \end{bmatrix} \\ - \beta_{1}\gamma_{a} \begin{bmatrix} \bar{x}_{1} \\ \bar{x}_{2} \\ \bar{x}_{3} \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} - \beta_{1}\gamma_{b} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \bar{x}_{1} \\ \bar{x}_{2} \\ \bar{x}_{3} \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} -\beta_{1} \gamma_{c} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \bar{x}_{1} \\ \bar{x}_{2} \\ \bar{x}_{3} \end{bmatrix} -\beta_{2} \gamma_{a} \begin{bmatrix} \bar{z}_{1} \\ \bar{z}_{2} \\ \bar{z}_{3} \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} -\beta_{2} \gamma_{b} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \bar{z}_{1} \\ \bar{z}_{2} \\ \bar{z}_{3} \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} -\beta_{2} \gamma_{c} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \bar{z}_{1} \\ \bar{z}_{2} \\ \bar{z}_{3} \end{bmatrix} \\ + \phi_{a} + \phi_{b} + \phi_{c} + \mu_{it} \end{split} \end{equation*} Here, $\phi_{a},\ \phi_{b},$ and $\phi_{c}$ are cross-sectional fixed effects and $\mu_{it}$ a well-behaved error-term that does not require any restrictions. An interesting remark is that if the six $\beta$s that appear together with the $\gamma$s are not restricted to be equal to each other and equal to the first two $\beta$s, more than one common factor is allowed. 

I intend to use Pesaran's (2006) common correlated effects pooled (CCEP) estimator. However, I'm not yet very familiar with advanced econometrics and advanced use of eviews. More specifically I want to estimate this model: \begin{equation} y_{it} = \alpha_{i} + \beta_{1}x_{1,it} + \beta_{2}x_{2,it}+\gamma_{i}F_{t}+\epsilon_{it} \end{equation} in which $F_{t}$ is an unobserved common factor and $\gamma_{i}$ is a country-specific factor loading. We were taught that $F_{t}$ can be proxied by: \begin{equation} F_{t}=\frac{(\bar{y_{t}}-\bar{\alpha}-\beta_{1} \bar{x}_{{1,t}} -\beta_{2} \bar{x}_{{2,t}}-\bar{\epsilon}_{{t}})}{\bar{\gamma}}, \end{equation} in which $\bar{y_{t}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{it}$, and $\bar{\gamma_{}}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \gamma_{i}$, with $N$ the number of cross-sections. Substituting the second equation into the first yields: \begin{equation} y_{it} = \alpha_{i}-\frac{\gamma_{i}}{\bar{\gamma}}+\beta_{1} x_{1,it} +\beta_{2} x_{2,it} +\frac{\gamma_{i}}{\bar{\gamma}}\bar{y_{t}} - \beta_{1} \frac{\gamma_{i}}{\bar{\gamma}} \bar{x}_{1,t} -\beta_{2}\frac{\gamma_{i}}{\bar{\gamma}}\bar{x}_{2,t}+\epsilon_{it}-\frac{\gamma_{i}}{\bar{\gamma}}\bar{\epsilon_{t}} \end{equation} or with $\alpha_{i}-\frac{\gamma_{i}}{\bar{\gamma}}=\alpha'_{i}$ and $\frac{\gamma_{i}}{\bar{\gamma}}=\gamma'_{i}$: \begin{equation} y_{it} = \alpha'_{i} +\beta_{1} x_{1,it} +\beta_{2} x_{2,it} +\gamma'_{i}\bar{y_{t}} - \beta_{1} \gamma'_{i} \bar{x}_{1,t} -\beta_{2}\gamma'_{i}\bar{x}_{2,t} +\epsilon_{it}-\gamma'_{i}\bar{\epsilon_{t}}. \end{equation} To estimate this in eviews, I had the following idea The cross-sectional averages $\bar{y_{t}}$, $\bar{x}_{{1,t}}$, and $\bar{x}_{{2,t}}$ can be easily calculated from the dataset. I would use cross-sectional fixed effects to estimate all $\alpha'_{i}$. Next, I would need $N$ terms to estimate all $N$ $\gamma'_{i}$. To do this, I would include these $N$ terms: $\gamma'_{A}\bar{y}_{t}dum_{A} + \gamma'_{B}\bar{y}_{t}dum_{B} + ... + \gamma'_{N}\bar{y}_{t}dum_{N}$, in which each capital letter denotes one of the $N$ cross-sections and the dummy variable takes the value of $1$ once for each cross-section. Then, for each averaged explanatory variable, $\bar{x}_{1t}$ and $\bar{x}_{2t}$, I would include these $2 \times N$ terms: $\beta_{1}\gamma'_{A}\bar{x}_{1,t} + \beta_{1}\gamma'_{B}\bar{x}_{1,t}+ ... + \beta_{1}\gamma'_{N}\bar{x}_{1,t}$ and $\beta_{2}\gamma'_{A}\bar{x}_{2,t} + \beta_{2}\gamma'_{B}\bar{x}_{2,t}+ ... + \beta_{2}\gamma'_{N}\bar{x}_{2,t}$. So, to sum up, my suggested input for eviews (to estimate with cross-sectional fixed effects) is the following: . In this equation: 

This question is closely related to the debate on secular stagnation. Recently Larry Summers reintroduced this term after it had been used for the first time in the 1930s by Alvin Hansen. A period of secular stagnation is characterised by low aggregate demand. In the market for loanable funds, this is reflected by high supply of savings and low demand for investment. Consequently, this results in low, and possible negative, (natural) real equilibrium interest rates. As low demand suppresses inflation it may be possible that the equilibrium real interest rate is out of reach due to the zero lower bond on nominal interest rates. At the prevailing real interest rate, savings exceed investments so that the economy operates below potential. This is a first interpretation secular stagnation. A second interpretation of secular stagnation is about low growth of potential, rather than growth below potential. Low or declining $observed$ real interest rates are a good argument in favour of secular stagnation since they may reflect low or declining (and eventually too low) $natural$ real interest rates. In this context, answering the question of why secular stagnation may occur, automatically answers your question of why countries tend to have low nominal and real interest rates. Vox published a freely available e-book (see link below) entirely dedicated to the subject of (the first interpretation of) secular stagnation. Several prominent economists briefly give their opinion or elaborate on one specific element in the discussion. The main arguments in favor of secular stagnation draw on (more or less permanent) shifts in the loanable funds market to explain the low observed real interest rates. On the one hand savings (supply of loanable funds) may have increased (shift to the right) due to: 

A higher than expected interest rate in the US would result in a higher than expected interest rate differential with other currencies. This will drag more money to the US as investors will try to benefit from this higher interest rate. Moreover, a faster tightening may create the perception that the Fed is more confident about the economic environment. This good news for the US can translate in dollar appreciation. An appreciated currency makes imports cheaper, which negatively affects inflation. 

Taking logs of the equation $MV=PY$ gives: $ln(M) + ln(V) = ln(P) + ln(Y)$. Next, differentiating with respect to time yields $\frac{dln(M)}{dt} + \frac{dln(V)}{dt} = \frac{dln(P)}{dt} + \frac{dln(Y)}{dt}$. Or, using $\frac{dln(X)}{dt} = \frac{\dot{X}}{X}$, with $\dot{X} = \frac{dX}{dt}$, the derivative of a variable $X$ with respect to time, you can immediately derive $\frac{\dot{M}}{M} + \frac{\dot{V}}{V} = \frac{\dot{P}}{P} + \frac{\dot{Y}}{Y}$, which equals $\%\Delta M + \%\Delta V = \%\Delta P + \%\Delta Y$. 

This depends on the exchange rate regime. For a floating exchange rate, the balance of payments is always in equilibrium, that is, the financial account always offsets the current (and capital) account. A hypothetical deficit is avoided by a depreciating exchange rate, a hypothetical surplus is avoided by appreciation. For a fixed exchange rate regime, the central bank will offset the exchange rate adjustments that guarantee the equilibrium under floating exchange rates. In order to offset these adjustments, the CB has to intervene in the exchange markets. To prevent a currency from depreciating, the CB has to use its foreign reserves to buy its own currency. To avoid an appreciation, the CB has to buy foreign currency and icrease its foreign reserves. To sum up, as an answer to your question: BoP imbalances only occur in a fixed exchange rate regime and are caused by foreign exchange interventions of the CB. Therefore, the imbalance is equal to the settlements balance, or the change in the CB's reserve assets. 

In the ECB's press conference of October 22, Draghi and his vice-president responded to the question of why the ECB is fighting low inflation so fiercefully. Their answer provides a nice overview of why a low level of inflation is desired, and therefore should answer your question. These were their main arguments: 

It should be noted that in the e-book the effects of demographics and income inequality are considered as arguments in favor of shifts to the right in the supply of loanable funds whereas some papers in the literature (unrelated to the discussion on secular stagnation) do not share that view. On the other hand, investment demand (demand for loanable funds) may have decreased (shift to the left). The main arguments are the following: 

Intuitively, this is the story: The interest rate on inflation-linked bonds (which means that the coupon payments are adjusted for inflation) can be seen as a real interest rate, because one is always exactly compensated for the realized inflation. Subtracting this real interest rate ($r$) from a nominal interest rate ($i$) gives the average inflation expectaction ($\pi^e$) over the period remaining before maturity. Just use the fisher-equation to see this: $r=i−π^e$. 

The LM-curve is completely independent from the loanable funds market. This is because the loanable funds market is entirely determined by the real side of the economy. Therefore, it is linked to the IS curve, not the LM curve. Even more, equilibrium in the loanable funds market for given $Y$ allows you to derive the IS curve, just as the keynesian cross allows you to do. To see this, consider both relationships in the loanable funds market. The demand side of loanable funds is given by the demand for investment (negatively related to the real interest rate $r$) and the supply side is given by all savings available (positiveley related to $r$). For equilibrium it is required that $S=I$ holds. Which is exactly the equilibrium condition represented by the IS curve: what are the combinations of $r$ and $Y$ for which savings equals investment. To derive the negative IS-relationship from the loanable funds market, just go through the following reasoning. Suppose that the loanable funds market is in equilibrium. This equilibrium holds for a given $Y$. If $Y$ increases, and the marginal propensity to consume is smaller than unity, the level of savings will increase for each $r$, so that the savings curve shifts to the right. More income does not affect investment, so that a new equilibrium requires a lower $r$. Conclusion: if $Y$ increases, a lower $r$ is needed for $S=I$ to hold. This is the IS-curve. 

To clarify the first scenario: you assume Joe can buy this car. However, Joe has to either earn an income (and therefore, produce something himself) or he has to dissave. In the first case, Joe has produced 500 output and earned an income of 500. He spends his income on a car, but Amanda saves the money. As is clarified in other answers, Joe's output goes to inventories (because not purchased by Amanda), which are counted as (unplanned) investments. S = I = 500, C = 500, Y = S + C = 1000. You mention in a comment that most consumers do not produce something. In fact, they do. At work, when earning their income (with which they buy the car), they created added value (this is the production (500) that goes to the inventory when Amanda does not buy it). Think of the income they earn at work as their part in the created added value, their contribution to real production. Consider the second case when Joe does not work. In the case Joe dissaves to buy the car instead of working and using his income (he just drives around, without producing), 500 savings have to be deducted from your final result for the first scenario, so that S = I = 0, C = 500, Y = S + C = 500. In the second scenario, forget about Joe's 500 for a while. Assume Amanda invests 250 (one car) in inventory, which means she has produced 250 (one car) first (and sold nothing), so that I = Y - C = 250, C = 0. Consumption is zero because Amanda sold nothing and Joe bought nothing. An income can only be earned when value added was produced. Therefore, the 500 Joe has received cannot be seen as an income, and since only income can lead to consumption or saving, Joe had neither consumed nor saved. The 500 Joe received is an expansion of money supply (and has no real interpretation) and will increase prices proportionally (assume V and Y to be constant in the fisher equation (MV=PY)). The 250 that Amanda produced has now increased in value, but in real terms her investment in inventory will still refer to the 250 (one car). This actually illustrates the importance of distinguishing nominal and real variables in the economy. The macro-economic identity you refer to is only about real variables.
