Consider the surface in $\mathbb{R}^4$ with equations \begin{align*} x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2 &=1 \\ (3x_3^2-2)x_4-\sqrt{2}(x_1^2-x_2^2)x_3 &=0. \end{align*} 

Let $G$ be of order $2$, and let $V$ be the nontrivial one-dimensional representation. I'll write $S(V)$ for the unit sphere in $V$ (which is just $G$); the one-point compactification of $V$ is then the unreduced suspension of $G$, which I'll call $S^V$. We can only form spectra from $G$-spaces with fixed basepoint, so we need to consider $S(V)_+=G_+$ rather than $S(V)$ itself. There is a cofibration $G_+\to S^0\to S^V$, and $S^0$ is its own dual, so the question for $S^V$ is equivalent to the question for $G_+$. In the category of genuine $G$-spectra, $G_+$ is its own dual, which means that there are unit and counit maps $S^0\xrightarrow{\eta}G_+\wedge G_+\xrightarrow{\epsilon}S^0$ making certain diagrams commute. In the naive category, $\{S^0,G_+\wedge G_+\}^G$ is the colimit of the unstable mapping sets $[S^n,S^n\wedge G_+\wedge G_+]^G$, which are trivial because $S^n\wedge G_+\wedge G_+$ is free away from the basepoint. Thus, we cannot construct the required map $\eta$, and $G_+$ is not self-dual. The same applies if we replace one of the $G_+$'s by something else, so $G_+$ is not dualisable. 

The $2$-primary parts of the first few groups are as follows: $$\begin{array}{ll} n & \pi_{4n}(S^{2n}) \\ 1 & \mathbb{Z}_2 \\ 2 & \mathbb{Z}_2^2 \\ 3 & \mathbb{Z}_2\\ 4 & \mathbb{Z}_2^4\\ 5 & \mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4\\ 6 & \mathbb{Z}_2^2\\ 7 & \mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_8\\ 8 & \mathbb{Z}_2^4\\ 9 & \mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4\oplus\mathbb{Z}_8. \end{array}$$ These are all in Toda's book "Composition methods in the homotopy groups of spheres". As you can see, there is no obvious pattern, and no general description is known. The difficulty of describing $\pi_i(S^j)$ is primarily controlled by $i-j$; the fact that $i=2j$ and $j$ is even is not going to help very much. 

A few years ago I made a fairly serious effort to simplify the proof, but did not succeed very well. I think one can say that if the base is covered by a well-ordered family of open sets over which we have specified path-lifting functions and we also have a corresponding partition of unity, then we can produce a global path-lifting function without further appeal to the Axiom of Choice. 

Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional complex vector space, let $A$ be a subspace, and let $\alpha:V\to V/A$ be the projection. The blow-up of $PV$ along $PA$ can then be identified with $\{(L,M)\in PV\times P(V/A): L\leq \alpha^{-1}(M)\}$ Now suppose we have another subspace $B$. I think that the blow-up along $PA\cup PB$ is just the fibre product of the blow-ups along $PA$ and $PB$, namely $X=\{(L,M,N)\in PV\times P(V/A)\times P(V/B) : L\leq \alpha^{-1}(M)\cap\beta^{-1}(N)\}$ We have $PA\cap PB=P(A\cap B)$, and this intersection is transverse iff $A+B=V$. If so, then the map $(\alpha,\beta):V\to V/A\times V/B$ is surjective, so the spaces $\alpha^{-1}(M)\times\beta^{-1}(N)=(\alpha,\beta)^{-1}(M\times N)$ form a vector bundle over $P(V/A)\times P(V/B)$, whose associated projective bundle is $X$; this shows that $X$ is smooth. Thus, the question has an affirmative answer at least for linear subspaces of projective space. 

$\pi_1(X)$ is the pure braid group $Br_n$ on $n$ strings. Moreover, the higher homotopy groups are trivial, so $X$ is the classifying space $BBr_n$. $X$ has an equivariant deformation retract $X_0$ that is a finite simplicial complex of dimension $n-1$. This means that $H^k(X)=0$ for $k>n-1$. The cohomology of $X$ is completely known, together with the action of $\Sigma_n$. In particular, the top group $H^{n-1}(X)$ is the module known as $\text{Lie}(n)$ (or maybe the dual of that?). As a $\mathbb{Z}[\Sigma_{n-1}]$-module this is free of rank one, but the $\Sigma_n$-action is harder to describe. The standard description also implies that all Steenrod operations in $H^*(X_0;\mathbb{Z}/p)$ are trivial. 

Let $\mathcal{A}$ have objects $0$ and $1$, with morphisms $u_i:i\to i$ for $i\in\{0,1\}$ satisfying $u_i^2=1_i$, and no other non-identity morphisms. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a group $G$, regarded as a category with one object. Then for each pair $g=(g_0,g_1)\in G^{2}$ with $g_0^2=g_1^2=1$, we have a functor $F_g:\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$. Moreover, $F_g$ is isomorphic to $F_h$ iff ($g_0$ is conjugate to $h_0$ and $g_1$ is conjugate to $h_1$). On the other hand, $F_g$ is related to $F_h$ by autoequivalences if and only if there is an auomorphism $\alpha$ of $G$ with (($h_0=\alpha(g_0)$ and $h_1=\alpha(g_1)$) or ($h_0=\alpha(g_1)$ and $h_1=\alpha(g_0)$)). Now suppose we have elements $u,v\in G$ where $v$ is conjugate (but not equal) to $u$. We find that $F_{(u,u)}$ is isomorphic to $F_{(u,v)}$, but is not related to it by autoequivalences. 

Consider the ring $$ R = (\mathbb{Z}/2)[y_0,y_1,y_2,\dotsc]/ (y_0^3+y_0y_1,\;y_1^3+y_1y_2,\;y_2^3+y_2y_3,\dotsc). $$ This is also generated by the elements $x_n=\sum_{i\leq n}y_{n-i}^{2^i}$. It can be shown that the nilradical is generated by the elements $x_nx_m$ with $n\neq m$, and that it is not finitely generated. One can also give $R$ a grading with $|y_i|=2^i$. It can be shown that $R$ is coherent in the graded sense: any homogeneous ideal with a finite set of homogeneous generators has a finite homogeneous presentation. I am not sure whether it is coherent as an ungraded ring. All of this is in the paper "Large self-injective rings and the generating hypothesis", by Leigh Shepperson and myself (Theorem 1.6). 

As others have said, there are plenty of examples of spectral sequences that have a third grading such that each $d_r$ preserves the grading up to a shift depending only on $r$. This is all fairly straightforward. However, there are some more interesting questions along the same lines. When Ravenel was trying to disprove the Telescope Conjecture he had certain spectra with a doubly-indexed filtration, say $X_{ij}$. Given a slope $m>0$ one can define a singly-indexed filtration by $F_kX=\bigcup_{i+mj\geq k}X_{ij}$, and using this we obtain a spectral sequence converging to $\pi_*(X)$ (the "localised parametrised Adams spectral sequence"). Ravenel's approach was to analyse how this changes when we vary $m$. For a long time he was asking whether there was some kind of spectral-sequency gadget that incorporated all values of $m$ at the same time. I don't think anyone ever had a satisfactory answer to that. 

There is a survey of the NIEP (by Egleston, Lenker and Narayan) at $URL$ This cites Suleĭmanova but immediately says that a simple proof of her main result was subsequently given by Perfect ($URL$ Note that this is a different paper by Perfect than the one mentioned by Misha. I presume that people decided that Suleĭmanova's work was hard to get hold of and/or not reliable, but that the results that they needed had been proved properly by Perfect. Given this, the line of least resistance is to cite both Suleĭmanova and Perfect, but in practice rely on Perfect only. That's not ideal, but it's easy to see why people do it. 

Suppose that $C$ is given by a homogeneous Weierstrass equation $f(x,y,z)=0$. Then there is a unique series $\xi(x)=\sum_{k>0}\xi_kx^k$ such that $\xi(x)=x^3+O(x^4)$ and $f(x,1,\xi(x))=0$. This can be found quite efficiently by successive approximation. Now put $$\chi(x_0,x_1,x_2)=\sum_{i,j,k\geq 0}\xi_{i+j+k+2}x_0^ix_1^jx_2^k.$$ This is $x_0+x_1+x_2\pmod{(x_0,x_1,x_2)^2}$, and one can check that $$ \det\left|\begin{array}{ccc}x_0&x_1&x_2\\1&1&1\\\xi(x_0)&\xi(x_1)&\xi(x_2)\end{array}\right|=(x_0-x_1)(x_0-x_2)(x_1-x_2)\chi(x_0,x_1,x_2).$$ Recall that addition in the elliptic curve is defined in terms of triples of collinear points, and collinearity forces the relevant determinant to vanish. From this we see that the series $G(x_0,x_1)=[-1]_F(x_0+_Fx_1)$ is characterised by $\chi(x_0,x_1,G(x_0,x_1))=0$. This can again be solved quite efficiently by successive approximation. Finally, we have $[-1]_F(x)=-x/(1+a_1x+a_3\xi(x))$, and $x_0+_Fx_1=[-1]_F(G(x_0,x_1))$. There are a few more details in Appendix B of the paper "Elliptic spectra, the Witten genus and the Theorem of the Cube" by Ando, Hopkins and myself.
