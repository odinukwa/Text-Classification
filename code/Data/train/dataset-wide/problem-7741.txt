I can't resist referring to the paper R. Brown and P.J. Higgins, ``On the connection between the second relative homotopy groups of some related spaces'', {\em Proc. London Math. Soc.} (3) 36 (1978) 193-212, which gives some explicit calculations with pushouts of crossed modules, but which is little referred to, and further examples are in (with C.D.WENSLEY), `Computation and homotopical applications of induced crossed modules', J. Symbolic Computation 35 (2003) 59-72. The key to the proof of the theorem is the notion of homotopy double groupoid of a based pair. The paper arXiv:0909.3387v2 gives applications of higher van Kampen theorems to homotopy groups of spheres. January 22, 2016 Tom refers to "an extra bit of structure". This structure is crucial for applications of a colimit theorem (see the above 1978 paper, and the 2011 book partially titled 2011 book Nonabelian Algebraic Topology, NAT, pdf available); altering the structure alters the colimits. Part I of this book gives lots of explicit calculations, for example showing how for $A$ connected, and $f:A \to X$ a pointed map, the crossed module $$\pi_2(X \cup _f CA,X,x) \to \pi_1(X,x)$$is determined by the morphism $f_*:\pi_1(A) \to \pi_1(X)$. This is a generalisation of a theorem of JHC Whitehead in "Combinatorial Homotopy II" on free crossed modules, which is the case $A$ is a wedge of circles. There is a general assumption that we most want to calculate the second homotopy group $\pi_2$; but this, even as a module over $\pi_1$ is but a pale shadow of the 2-type. One of the problems in homotopy theory is that identifications in low dimensions have influence on high dimensional invariants. So part of the aim is to study this influence using algebraic structures which have information in a range of dimensions, and to develop and apply nonabelian colimit theorems in higher homotopy. Tim Porter refers to the nonabelian tensor square, which generalises to tensor products. I have kept up a bibliography on this topic; the idea arose from considering pushouts of crossed squares, and the bibliography currently has 144 items, dating back to 1952. January 23,2016 I thought of another point which maybe answers the question better, namely as to the import of these crossed module rules on this boundary map for second relative homotopy groups. The situation becomes clearer if you work with the homotopy double groupoid of a pointed pair of spaces, see the NAT book and also the presentation at Galway on my preprint page. In terms of double groupoids, the first rule is a boundary rule for a certain subdivided square, and the second rule is equivalent to the interchange law for the two compositions. So if you draw the right pictures, then these rules become necessities. The emphasis on homotopy groups is part of the "squashing" of 2-dimensional situation into a single dimension, on a line. Then some natural rules become obscure, and it becomes impossible to do the 2-dimensional compositions which are necessary for the proof of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem for homotopy double groupoids and so for the homotopy crossed module of the question. 

@Tyler Lawson: I just saw this question. Our book published in 2011 and advertised on Nbonabelian Algebraic Topology does exactly that. No (or little) singular homology, no simplicial approximation. It gives many calculations of nonabelian second relative homotopy groups not available by traditional methods. It also gets to the Relative Hurewicz Theorem and the calculation of certain homotopy classes of maps, including the non simply connected case. It is in a sense a rewrite of algebraic topology on the border between homotopy and homology, using functors defined in terms of homotopy classes of maps, and establishing their main properties directly. Of course there is a lot of homotopy and homology theory it does not do, for example Poincare duality: I've put that as one of a number problems to solve in the style/techniques of the book! There are on my preprint page several relevant presentations, and also a recent paper entitled "Modelling and computing homotopy types:I". 

Just a comment on the role of the Higher Homotopy Seifert-van Kampen Theorems: they should be regarded as an extra tool in algebraic topology. There are quite severe conditions on their applicability but when they apply they compute quite a lot. Just as the 1-dimensional theorem, in its groupoid formulation, is about calculating 1-types, so the 2-dim theorem is about computing 2-types, in the form of crossed modules (over groupoids). However computing the second homotopy group from this 2-type may not be straightforward. But then the situation is the same for the 1-dim theorem, as is evidenced by the complications of theorems such as the Kurosh subgroup theorem, which can be seen to be about the fundamental group(s) of a cover of a wedge of $K(G_i,1)$'s. As a taster, based on the 2-d theorem, work with Chris Wensley enabled the computation of the crossed module representing the 2-type of the mapping cone of a map $Bf: BG \to BH$ induced by a morphism $f: G \to H$. Of course. the second homotopy group, even as a module over the fundamental group, is but a pale shadow of the 2-type. You can see some of this in our book (pdf available from my web page on the book). R. Brown, P.J. Higgins, R. Sivera, Nonabelian algebraic topology: filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids, EMS Tracts in Mathematics Vol. 15, 703 pages. (August 2011). November 8, 2013: As a taster, let $X$ be the homotopy pushout of the classifying spaces of the two maps of groups $P \to P/M, P \to P/N$ where $M,N$ are normal subgroups of the group $P$. The the homotopy 2-type of $X$ is determined by the crossed module $M \circ N \to P$, the coproduct of the two crossed $P$-modules, which is given by the pushout of crossed modules $$\begin{matrix} (1 \to P) & \to & (N \to P) \cr \downarrow && \downarrow \cr (M \to P)& \to & (M \circ N \to P) \end{matrix} $$. It follows that $$ \pi_2(X) \cong (M \cap N)/ [M,N]. $$ (Of course we know $\pi_1 X$ by the 1-dimensional van Kampen Theorem.) This result is applied in Bardakov, Valery G; Mikhailov, Roman; Vershinin, Vladimir V.; Wu, Jie, "Brunnian braids on surfaces". Algebr. Geom. Topol. 12 (2012), no. 3, 1607â€“1648. 

I would like to confuse matters, perhaps, by bringing in a higher dimensional viewpoint. The following type of example was given by John Baez. The diagram $$\matrix{||| & |||||\cr ||| & |||||}$$ can be expressed symbolically by $$2\times (3+5)= 2\times 3 + 2 \times 5.$$ But the symbolic "on a line" expression involves many conventions which have to be learned. Which expression is "simpler"? Current computers work serially, on a line, as I understand it, and $2$-dimensional, or higher, rewriting has not been computerised, but is used in knot theory, higher category theory, and higher dimensional group theory. The term "simplify" depends on the use, as others have observed above. The "simplest" description of a vector space over a given field is its dimension, but that does not mean we want to remove vector spaces from the literature. In my own field, a common statement has been that "groupoids reduce to groups", but the group description in a given case may be more complicated, since it requires choosing base points and trees (Ugh!). See my Grothendieck quote. This reflects perhaps that mathematical understanding is about understanding structural implications, so "simplicity" depends on the background structure, and the way this is expressed. A "bigger" structure may make things look simpler! 

The ncatlab entry on the "Blakers-Massey Theorem" gives more information, and references below are to the papers cited there. Blakers and Massey wrote three papers on this subject, and paper III (1953) gave conditions for an algebraic determination of the "critical group", that the map $$\pi_m(A,C) \otimes \pi_n(B,C) \to \pi_{m+n-1}(X;A,B)$$given by the generalised Whitehead product is an isomorphism. Note that the tensor product given is zero if one of the factors is zero; this is why the algebraic result implies the connectivity result. So there is a case for referring to the previous two papers as giving the "Blakers-Massey connectivity theorem". One of the conditions for their result is that $C$ is simply connected. This condition is relaxed in a paper of Brown-Loday (Proc LMS 1987) by using a nonabelian tensor product announced here and developed in Brown-Loday (Topology, 1987). For the connectivity result, the book by Munson and Volic has a prepublication pdf available here. This could come under the heading of "intuitively clear", though it is quite a lot of work. The meaning of the algebraic result is to my mind "intuitively clear" and immediately believable, but the proof of the main "van Kampen theorem" in Brown-Loday Topology (1987) uses advanced methods of algebraic topology. The paper by Ellis-Steiner (JPAA, 1987) uses the methods of the above Brown-Loday papers to solve the old problem of the critical group for $(n+1)$-ads, for which the connectivity part is explained in the book by Munson and Volic. There seem to me to be prospects of developing further the methods of the B-L Proc LMS paper. 

The essential geometric content of the proof uses transversality and knot theory, and was in his paper 1. The definition of crossed module was given in his paper 2. Finally the definition of free crossed module was given in his paper 3, together with an outline of the proof, referring back to paper 1. You can find my own exposition of the proof here. The referee wrote that: "The theorem is not new. The proof is not new. But the paper should be published since these papers of Whitehead are notoriously obscure." I explained the proof once to Terry Wall, and he said it was a good 1960's type proof! What my paper does is repackage Whitehead's proof for a modern audience, and with pictures and consistent notation. It seems to me pretty good to give the essence of a proof years before you have the right definitions for the theorem! The notion of crossed module has over recent years become more widespread, partly because of its relation to $2$-groupoids and double groupoids. This is discussed a little in a seminar I gave in Chicago last year. See also the Wikipedia entry and that from the nlab. 

This result has a long history. Keith Dakin in his 1976 thesis defined the notion of simplicial $T$-complex as a simplicial set with in each dimension $n \geqslant 1$ a set $T_n$ of elements called thin such that 

Try the wikipedia entry on sequential spaces. I quote: "Many conditions have been shown to be equivalent to $X$ being sequential. Here are a few: $X$ is the quotient of a first countable space. $X$ is the quotient of a metric space. For every topological space $Y$ and every map $f : X \to Y$, we have that f is continuous if and only if for every sequence of points (xn) in X converging to x, we have (f(xn)) converging to f(x). The final equivalent condition shows that the class of sequential spaces consists precisely of those spaces whose topological structure is determined by convergent sequences in the space." The point is that given a set of test maps from $I$ to a set $X$ you can put a topology on $X$ as the quotient of the disjoint union of copies of $I$ one for each test map. And then $X$ will be the quotient of a first countable space. 

In the end it became "mathematics and knots", but knots were used to show to the general public some methods of mathematics, namely: 

There are at least two advantages of the approach via universal morphisms. One is that it relates to the idea that one studies a particular object by its relation to all other objects. The other is that it allows for generalisations: an example is that from tensor products of abelian groups to the nonabelian tensor product of groups which act on each other. In fact this suggest another advantage: replace a complicated map by a simpler one, in this case a morphism. In particular a morphism of abelian groups has a kernel, whereas a biadditive map does not have that notion. However the isomorphism theorems in group theory arose from the need to systematise facts on particular examples, and these are the, or a, main delight of basic group theory. I confess I did not get round to doing calculations in group theory till I was 50 - I had previously missed out on this.
