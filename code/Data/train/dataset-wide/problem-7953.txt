Consider the wave equation $$ u_{tt} = \Delta_x u - q(x)u, \quad x \in\mathbb R^d, \; t > 0,\tag{1}\\ u(0,x) = u_0(x) \in H^1_\text{comp}(\mathbb R^d),\\ u_t(0,x) = u_1(x) \in L^2_\text{comp}(\mathbb R^d), $$ where $q \in L^\infty_\text{comp}(\mathbb R^d,\mathbb R)$. It is known that in odd dimensions $d$, if the operator $H=-\Delta+q(x)$ has no discrete spectrum and $0$ is not a resonance, then the solution $u$ decays exponentially on any compact set: $$ \|u(t,\cdot)\|_{H^2(\Omega)} \leq C_\Omega e^{-\gamma t}\bigl(\|u_0\|_{H^1(\mathbb R^d)} + \|u_1\|_{L^2(\mathbb R^d)} \bigr), \quad t \geq T, $$ for any bounded domain $\Omega$, for some $C_\Omega$, $\gamma$, $T > 0$. This follows, in particular, from the resonance expansion of the solution $u$ (see, e.g., Thm. 3.9, p. 99 of these notes by Dyatlov-Zworski) and from the absense of real non-zero resonances due to Rellich's uniqueness theorem. But what is the situation in even dimensions? Do we still have exponential decay when zero is not a resonance and the discrete spectrum of $H$ is empty? 

Let $\alpha$ be a positive constant, $\mu$ be a Borel nonnegative measure in $\mathbb{R}^n_+$. We can define a transform $$ \tilde{L}\[\mu\](p) = \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^n_+} e^{-(p_1 x_1 + \ldots + p_n x_n)^{\alpha}} \mu(dx). $$ This is a simple generalization of the Laplace transform for which $\alpha = 1$. Is there something in literature on this transform? I'm interested in questions of inversion, characterisation e.t.c. 

There are two tools, generalizing a concept of a volume to the case of submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^n$, namely the Hausdorff measure $H^k$ and the volume form. The question is how to show that if $M$ is an orientable $k$-submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with a volume form $dV$ then $$ \int\limits_{M} f(x) dV = \int\limits_{M} f(x) H^k(dx) $$ if the integrals exist. P.S. Maybe the question is sufficiently silly for mathoverflow.com and a more suitable for math.stackexchange.com, but I have 2 reasons to post it here: 

If $f$ is a compactly supported bounded variation function on the real line $\mathbb R$, its Fourier transform $\widehat f$ can be estimated as $|\widehat f(\xi)| = O(|\xi|^{-1})$, $|\xi|\to\infty$. This estimate is exact: for a function $f$ which is a sum of a jump and an absolutely continuous function we have $\widehat f(\xi) \sim C |\xi|^{-1}$ at infinity (due to the jump). If the function $f$ is BV and absolutely continuous, we have $|\widehat f(\xi)| = o(|\xi|^{-1})$, $|\xi| \to \infty$. But what if $f$ is continuous and BV but not absolutely continuous? Do we have $o(|\xi|^{-1})$ or the general estimate $O(|\xi|^{-1})$? 

There exists a unitary bundle isomorphism $F \colon E \to E$ such that $F = Id$ on $E|_{\partial M}$ and $\nabla^1 = F^* \nabla^2 F$. Let $\gamma_1$, $\ldots$, $\gamma_M$ be non-homotopically equivalent loops in $M$, non-homotopically equivalent to any boundary component and let $\omega_1$, $\ldots$, $\omega_M$ be a dual basis of $H^1(M,\partial M)$, i.e. $\int_{\gamma_i} \omega_j = \delta_{ij}$. Then $$ A_1 - A_2 = 2\pi \sum\limits_{k=1}^M n_k \omega_k + df, \quad f|_{\partial M} = 0, \; n_k \in \mathbb Z. $$ 

Consider an integral transform of Borel measures supported on $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ given by $$ f(z) =\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^n_+} x^{z}\frac{\mu(dx)}{x} $$ where $z = (z_1,...,z_n) \in \mathbb{C}^n$, $x^z = x_1^{z_1}...x_n^{z_n}$ and $\frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{x_1...x_n}$. This transform generalizes the classical Mellin transform. Is there some literature where I can read about it? Is there an inversion theorem for this case? 

In books on geometric integration theory (Krantz, Parks; Federer) I failed to find an answer. I've already posted the question on math.stackexchange.com and on one more forum, but I didn't receive any response. 

The Gibbs lemma is broadly used in games theory and in mathematical economics (optimal distributions of resourses, Cournot competition e.t.c.). Here it is: Lemma (Gibbs). $f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_n$ be differentiable functions on $[0,A]$. Consider the optimisation problem $$ f_1(x_1)+\ldots+f_n(x_n) \to \max, \; x_1+\ldots+x_n = A, \; x=(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in \mathbb R^n_+. $$ The if $x^\ast = (x_1^\ast,\ldots,x_n^\ast)$ is the solution of this problem then there exists $\lambda \in \mathbb R$ such that $$ \begin{array}{c} x_i^\ast > 0 \implies f_i'(x_i^\ast) = \lambda, \newline x_i^\ast = 0 \implies f_i'(x_i^\ast) \leq \lambda. \end{array} $$ The proof is easy but the further specification seems nontrivial. My question is if it is possible to specify constant $\lambda$? Using rude calculations involving Lagrange's function I've obtained the following. If we define $\varphi(A)$ to be an optimal value of functional in the above problem then if all $x_i^\ast > 0$ we will have $\varphi'(A) = \lambda$. But is it possible to say the same in the general case? Maybe this specification of the Gibbs lemma is well known? The question may be reformulated in terms specific to convex analysis: is it true that derivative of infimal convolution (supremal convolution) of smooth functions is always equal to mimimal (maximal) of derivatives of functions to be convolved in optimal point? If it isn't true in general, is it true in the case of functions $f_i$ for which $f_i' \geq 0$, $f_i'' > 0$? 

Let $A = F^{-1}\sigma F$ be a pseudodifferential operator acting on functions on $\mathbb R^n$, where $F$, $F^{-1}$ are the direct and inverse Fourier transforms respectively and $\sigma$ is the symbol of $A$. I'm interested in such symbols $\sigma$ that for any function $u$ in the domain of definition of $A$ we have $\rho(\mathop{\mathrm{supp}} u, \mathop{\mathrm{supp}} Au) < \varepsilon$ for some fixed $\varepsilon > 0$, where $\rho$ is the Hausdorff distance. Are there some known results about such symbols, necessary and sufficient conditions on $\sigma$ to possess the desired property? Any references are very welcome. 

Consider a $C^{\infty}$ nonnegative function $f(x,y,z)$, $x,y,z>0$ and let $\lambda f(\lambda x, \lambda y,\lambda z) \equiv f(z,y,z)$ for any $\lambda > 0$ (positive homogenity). Define $$ g_{\alpha}(x,y) := f(x^{\alpha},y^{\alpha},z). $$ I'm interested in such numbers $\alpha>0$ that $g_{\alpha}(x,y)$ is a completely monotone function for any $z>0$, i.e. $$ (-1)^{m+n}\frac{\partial^{m+n} g_{\alpha}(x,y)}{\partial x^m \partial y^n} \geqslant 0. $$ I denote a set of such $\alpha$ by $A_{f}$. In other words, $A_{f}$ is a set of such $\alpha$ that $f(x^\alpha,y^\alpha,z)$ is a completely monotone function of $(x,y)$ for any $z$. For example, $A_{0} = (0,+\infty)$. The easiest question that arises here and seems very nontrivial for me is if it is possible to find a function $f(x,y,z)\neq0$ such that $|A_{f}| \geqslant 2$? I'm not sure that one can find something in literature precisely on this topic but I think that somebody could encounter related things in its work. In this relation any help is very appreciated. 

The main question is if there is some literature on the similar generalisation? If there is some other multidimensional generalisation of Gamma function? If there are some special types of $q(x)$ for which we can represent $\Gamma_{q}(z)$ in terms of well-known functions? 

Let $f(x)$ be a smooth function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$. Let $\mu$ be a compactly supported Borel measure (not necessarily positive) on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Define $$ \tilde{\mu}(\xi) = \int e^{i (\xi_1 f(x_1) + \ldots + \xi_n f(x_n))} \mu(dx). $$ I have estimates of the form $|\tilde{\mu}(\xi)| \leq C(\xi)$ for any $\xi \in \mathbb{C}^n$. My question is if it possible to find the similar estimates on Fourier transform $$ \hat{\mu}(\xi) = \int e^{i \xi x} \mu(dx) $$ using given estimates on $\tilde{\mu}(\xi)$? 

Reading an article I faced with the following theorem, please give me a reference to a proof of the fact which is stated without any reference in the article. Is it a well-known fact? Theorem. Let $E \overset{\pi}{\to} M$ be a complex line bundle over a Riemann surface $M$ with boundary $\partial M$. Let $\nabla^1$ and $\nabla^2$ be connections on $E$ with connection 1-forms $A_1$ and $A_2$. Then the following statements are equal: 

The proof of the theorem involves multiplications by smooth functions with compact supports. This is why I can't directly generalize the proof of the abovementioned theorem to the case of the real-analytic category (the only real analytic function with compact support is zero). On the other hand, I think that the theorem is still valid for real-analytic Fourier Integral Operators and for analytic wavefronts but uses some more subtle proof. Please tell me, if you have encountered the mentioned theorem (or some variants) in the real-analytic case in some paper. 

Consider the equation $$ Lu = -\Delta u+v(x)u = Eu, \tag{1} $$ where $x = (x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb R^2$, $v \in L_2(\mathbb R^2)$, $E>0$. Is it known that for almost any $E>0$ and for any fixed $k \in \mathbb R^2$ with $k_1^2+k_2^2 = E$ there exists a solution of (1) with asymptotics $$ u(x,k) = e^{ikx}+A\biggl(k,|k|\frac{x}{|x|}\biggr) \frac{e^{i|k||x|}}{\sqrt{|x|}} + o(|x|^{-\frac 1 2}), \quad |x| \to \infty \quad ? $$ For sufficiently smooth and rapidly decaying potentials $v$ it is true but in my question $v$ is an arbitrary $L_2$-potential. For the case of smooth and rapidly decaying potentials the following formula holds: $$ A(k,l) = C \int\limits_{\mathbb R^2} e^{i(k-l)x} u(x,k)v(x) \, dx. $$ If the answer to my first question is positive is it possible to say that in the $L_2$-case the analogical formula holds where we only need to add $p.v.$ before the integral sign? 

Gamma function is defined as $$ \Gamma(z) = \int\limits_{0}^{+\infty} x^{z-1} e^{-x} \; dx $$ I'm looking for multidimensional generalisation of this definition. I consider the class $Q$ of positive, concave and positively homogeneous of order one functions from $\mathbb{R}^n_+$ to $\mathbb{R}_+$. Examples of such functions are linear function $q(x) = \langle p, x \rangle$ for $p > 0$ and CES function $$ q(x) = \left( \alpha_1 x_1^{-\rho} + \ldots + \alpha_n x_n^{-\rho} \right) ^{-\frac{1}{\rho}}, \;\;\; \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{i} = 1, \;\;\; \alpha_{i}, \rho > 0 \; (i = 1,\ldots, n) $$ I try to define $$ \Gamma_{q}(z) = \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^n_+} x^{z-1}e^{-q(x)} \; dx \equiv \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^n_+} x_1^{z_1-1}\ldots x_n^{z_n-1} e^{-q(x_1,\ldots,x_n)} \; dx_1 \ldots dx_n $$ If $n = 1$ then $\Gamma_{q}(z) = \Gamma(z)$ for any $q \in Q$. 

The Mittag-Leffler function $E_{\alpha}(x)$ has an important property: $$ \frac{\partial^{\alpha}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} E_{\alpha}(x^{\alpha}) = E_{\alpha}(x^{\alpha}). $$ I tried to find an analogue of such function that satisfies $$ \frac{\partial^{\alpha}}{\partial t^{\alpha}} G_{\alpha}((a+bt)^{\alpha}) = CG((a+bt)^{\alpha}). $$ I looked through some papers on fractional differentiating but didn't find such analogue. Then I tried to construct it myself. I found fractional derivative of order $\alpha$ of $(a+bt)^{n \alpha}$. If it was something like $$ (a+bt)^{\alpha(n-1)} F(n,\alpha,b)H(t) $$ I'll be able to construct a power series with convinient coefficents like in the case of the Mittag-Leffler function. But in general this fractional derivative is a series, that can't be represented in such manner. Then I think there may exist some pseudodifferential operator $F_{\alpha}$ (PsDO) for which there exists a series by powers of $(a+bt)^{\alpha}$ invariant under action of $F_{\alpha}$. I would be very happy if you can help me to find such series and such operator that generalize both Mittag-Leffler function and fractional differentiation operator. Edited This problem is related to specification of PsDO that sends $(a+bt)^{\alpha n}$ to $(a+bt)^{\alpha(n-1)} F(n,\alpha,b) H(t)$. 

The coarea formula in its simple form states that $$ \int\limits_{A} f(x) \; dx = \int\limits_{\mathbb{R}} \int\limits_{g(x) = r} f(x) \; \omega \; dr $$ for a Gelfand-Leray form $\omega$ (i.e. $dg \wedge \omega = dx$), for any $f(x)$ and $g \colon A \to \mathbb{R}$, where $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, with appropriate properties. Is there a generalisation of this result to the case of an arbitrary measure on the left-hand side? In other words is there some similar representation for the integral $$ \int\limits_{A} f(x) \; \mu(dx) $$ where $\mu$ is not an absolutely continuous measure? 

Let $X \subset \mathbb C^2$ be a Riemann surface with boundary $\partial X \subset \mathbb C^2$ and without compact components. Let $\bar X = X \cup \{p_1,\ldots,p_N\} \subseteq \mathbb CP^2$ be its compactification. Is it known how to find $N$ given $\partial X$ and is it possible? 

Let $X$ be a compact smooth surface in $\mathbb R^d$ with smooth boundary $\partial X$. Is it possible to find another smooth surface $Y$ in $\mathbb R^d$ such that $\partial X = \partial Y$ and $Y$ is isometric (resp. conformally equivalent) to $X$? The metric is supposed to be induced from $\mathbb R^d$. The same question for holomorphic chains (in particular, for complex curves with boundary) in $\mathbb C^d$ has the negative answer: if two compact holomorphic chains have the same boundary, they are equal. Locally it is the statement of the Cauchy integral formula from complex analysis and globaly it is the result of Harwey-Shiffman 1975 ( Proposition 3.5). 

In M.Taylor's book "Partial differential equations II" it is shown that the fundamental solution $E(x,y)$ of the Laplacian equation gives rise to an elliptic pseudodifferential operator $S$ on the boundary $\partial \Omega$ of a domain $\Omega$ (for simplicity, let $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^3$ and $\partial \Omega$ be smooth) by the formula: $$ Sf (x) = \int_{\partial \Omega} E(x,y)f(y) \, dS(y), \\ E(x,y) = \frac{1}{4\pi|x-y|}, $$ where $dS(y)$ is the surface measure. The fact $S \in OPS^{-1}(\partial \Omega)$ follows from $E \in OPS^{-2}(\mathbb R^3)$ and from the representation formula $$ Sf(x) = \lim_{y \in \Omega, y\to x} \int_{\mathbb R^3} E(x,y)(f\delta_{\partial \Omega}) dy, \quad x \in \partial \Omega, $$ where $\delta_{\partial \Omega}$ is the delta-function concentrated on $\partial \Omega$. Ellipticity follows from the explicit expression for the symbol of $S$ (the symbol of $E$ restricted to $\partial \Omega$ and integrated along conormal direction). Here is my question. Consider, instead of $E$, the limit value of resolvent $R_+(\lambda)=R(\lambda+i0)$, $\lambda > 0$, for the operator $-\Delta$. Its integral kernel is $$ R_+(x,y,\lambda) = \frac{e^{i\sqrt \lambda |x-y|}}{4\pi |x-y|}. $$ In analogy with $S$ we can define $$ S_+(\lambda)f(x) = \int_{\partial \Omega} R_+(x,y,\lambda)f(y) \,dS(y). $$ Is it true that $R_+(\lambda) \in OPS^{-2}(\mathbb R^3)$? If yes, what is its symbol? Is it true that $S_+(\lambda) \in OPS^{-1}(\partial \Omega)$ and is elliptic? 

Let $E_{\alpha}(x^{\alpha})$ be a Mittag-Leffler function, $\alpha \in (0,1)$. It is an eigenfunction for nonlocal fractional derivative, defined as a convolution with $$ \Phi_{\lambda}(x) = \frac{x_{+}^{\lambda-1}}{\Gamma(\lambda)} $$ when $\lambda = -\alpha$ (Gelfand, Shilov, "Generalized functions"). We can define a local fractional derivative of order $\alpha$ by $$ \tilde{D}^{\alpha}f(x) = \lim\limits_{\delta \to +0} \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1)(f(x+\delta)-f(x))}{\delta^{\alpha}} $$ Then for any $x>0$ we will have $\tilde{D}^{\alpha}E_{\alpha}(x^{\alpha}) = 0$ and $E_{\alpha}(x^{\alpha})$ is not invariant under action of local fractional derivative. I would like to know which function is an eigenfunction of local fractional derivative. If this function is well-known, is there a representation of such function that depends on $x$ through $x^{\alpha}$ like the Mittag-Leffler function? I think that the main advantage of such function is that $f(x+a)$ will still be an eigenfunction for any $a$ because of locality of operator. This property doesn't hold for nonlocal fractional derivative defined above, so $E_{\alpha}((x+a)^{\alpha})$ is not an eigenfunction for nonlocal fractional derivative if $a > 0$. 

Let $K$ be a continuous linear operator on $C[0,1]$ (more, precisely, it is a linear integral operator). Then $K$ defines a continous linear operator $\widehat K$ on $\mathcal L(C[0,1])$ by the rule $$ \widehat KA=KAK, \quad A \in \mathcal L(C[0,1]), $$ with norm $\|\widehat K\| \leq \|K\|^2$. My question is what is a reasonable framework to study properties of $\widehat K$ in terms of operator $K$? I recall that $K$ is the integral operator so, for example, I would like to be able to formulate conditions of invertibility of $\mathrm{Id} - \widehat K$ in terms of integral operator $K$. In the case of matrices, operator $\widehat K$ corresponds to Kronecker product of matrices $K^T \otimes K$ so that invertibility of operator $\mathrm{Id}-\widehat K$ corresponds to invertibility of matrix $\mathrm{Id} - K^T \otimes K$. Is it possible to find some analogue of this contruction in the case of operators on $C[0,1]$? I know that in the case of Banach spaces there are many ways to naturally define the tensor product, so I'm not sure that the above construction generalizes well. 

Consider a smooth function $q \colon \mathbb R^2_+ \to \mathbb R_+$ such that $q(\lambda x) = \lambda q(x)$ for any $\lambda > 0$. Denote $x \circ y$ the elementwise product of $x,y \in \mathbb R^2_+$. Let $\Gamma$ be some curve in $\mathbb R^2_+$, transversal to any level curve $[ x \in \mathbb R^2_+ \mid q(x \circ y) = t]$, $y \in \mathbb R^2_+$, $t > 0$ that it intersects. My question is if it is possible to find continuous (or maybe only Lebesgue integrable) functions $f_1(y,t)$ and $f_2(y,t)$ from $ \Gamma \times \mathbb R_+ \to \mathbb R_+$ such that $$ x_{1}^{n_1}x_2^{n_2} = \int\limits_{\Gamma} f_1(y,q(y \circ x))dy_1+f_2(y,q(y\circ x))dy_2 $$ where $n_1$, $n_2$ are fixed natural numbers. If it isn't possible maybe it is possible to find a sequence $f_1^n$, $f_2^n$ for which such integrals converge to $x_1^{n_1} x_2^{n_2}$ in $\mathbb R^2_+$?
