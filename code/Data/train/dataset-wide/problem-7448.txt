First of all, the functor $Rf_\ast$ is a red herring. Take an injective resolution $I^{\bullet,\bullet}$ of $F^\bullet$ and apply $f_\ast$; then you just have two questions regarding double complexes. E.g. in the first case you're asking about double complexes whose columns have cohomology concentrated in a single degree. Let $C^\bullet$ be a cochain complex. Recall that there are wise truncation functors $\tau_{\geq i}$, $\tau_{\leq i}$ with canonical maps $C^\bullet \to \tau_{\geq i}C^\bullet$ and $\tau_{\leq i}C^\bullet \to C^\bullet$, which are quasi-isomorphisms if $C^\bullet$ has no cohomology below (resp. above) degree $i$. If $A^{\bullet,\bullet}$ is a double complex, let $\tau^V_{\geq i}$ be the double complex obtained by applying $\tau_{\geq i}$ to each column separately (V is for "vertical"). Then there is a zig-zag $$ A^{\bullet,\bullet} \to \tau_{\geq i}^V A^{\bullet,\bullet} \leftarrow \tau_{\leq i}^V\tau^V_{\geq i} A^{\bullet,\bullet}.$$ If all columns have cohomology concentrated in degree $i$ then both these maps are quasi-isomorphisms of double complexes. This answers your first question affirmatively, since $\tau_{\leq i}^V\tau^V_{\geq i} A^{\bullet,\bullet}$ can be identified with the cochain complex you wrote down. (Remark: I slightly disagree with anon's comment that the case $i>0$ is identical to the case $i=0$, since in the latter case we don't need to apply $\tau_{\geq i}$. So in that case we don't even need a zig-zag, there is just a quasi-isomorphism staring us in the face.) The second requires a bit more fiddling, I think, but maybe I'm missing an easy argument. But the following should work. First do a truncation argument similar to the one above to reduce to the case when $A^{p,q} = 0$ unless $p\leq a$ and $q=1$, or $p \geq a$ and $q=0$; moreover, $A^{a,0} \to A^{a,1}$ is an isomorphism. Now let $B^{\bullet,\bullet}$ be the double complex with $B^{p,q} = A^{p,q}$ for $p \neq a$, but $B^{a,0} = B^{a,1} = A^{a-1,1}$. The differentials in $B$ are given by letting $B^{a-1,1} \to B^{a,1}$ and $B^{a,0} \to B^{a,1}$ be the obvious isomorphisms and $B^{a,0} \to B^{a+1,0}$ the map given by the $E_2$ differential in the spectral sequence for $A^{\bullet,\bullet}$. There is a natural map $B^{\bullet,\bullet} \to A^{\bullet,\bullet}$, and also a natural map from $\mathrm{Tot}(B^{\bullet,\bullet})$ to the cochain complex which you wrote down, both of which are quasi-isomorphisms. 

The possible automorphism groups of a curve of genus two are known very classically, this is usually attributed to Bolza. In his list we find only three prime factors in the orders of the groups: 2,3 and 5. So this is the only possible torsion. I haven't read Benson and Cohen, "Mapping class groups of low genus and their cohomology", but the Mathematical Review suggests that it is exactly what you are looking for. They compute the ring structure on the mod 3 and mod 5 cohomology and the Poincar√© series of the mod 2 cohomology. 

According to Deligne's "yoga of weights", the cohomology of an algebraic variety should have a weight filtration. For concreteness we can consider the rational cohomology of complex varieties, with their mixed Hodge structure. It seems to me that in the yoga of weights there is a kind of duality between singularities and non-compactness. The simplest example should be: 

The inclusion $H \to G$ induces a map of classifying stacks $f \colon BH \to BG$ (note that these are stacks, not the "topologists $BG$"). As remarked in the question you linked to, induction and coinduction correspond to the functors $f_\ast$ and $f_!$ respectively. These functors will be equal if $f$ is proper. The fiber of $f$ is the quotient $G/H$, so a sufficient condition is that $H$ is cocompact in $G$. 

I haven't read Kirwan's thesis but I think this is what you are after. If $U \subset V$ is an open subvariety (no conditions on the variety $V$) then there is a long exact sequence (Thom-Gysin) $$ H^\bullet_c(U) \to H^\bullet_c(V) \to H^\bullet_c(V \setminus U) \to H^{\bullet+1}_c(U). $$ Let's now declare a stratification of $X$ to be a collection of disjoint locally closed subvarieties $X_\alpha$ ("strata") whose union is $X$, and such that the closure of a stratum is a union of strata. Then for every such stratification the above LES can in principle be used to inductively study the compactly supported cohomology of $X$, one stratum at a time: start with the smallest strata and in each step let $V \setminus U$ be what you have already computed and $V$ the union with one more stratum. If the stratification is actually a filtration by closed subvarieties, $$ X = T_d \supset T_{d-1} \supset \cdots \supset T_0,$$ then there is a spectral sequence $$ E_1^{pq} = H^{p+q}_c(T_p\setminus T_{p-1})\implies H^{p+q}_c(X)$$ which encodes this procedure. So one needs almost no conditions at all on the stratification. A slogan is that compactly supported cohomology always behaves better w.r.t. stratified spaces. But probably you are interested in ordinary cohomology; one should add hypotheses relating compactly supported and usual cohomology. For instance if $X$ is compact then $H^\bullet_c(X) = H^\bullet(X)$, same for all closures of strata, and if all strata are smooth varieties then their cohomology with compact support is determined from the usual cohomology by Poincare duality. This covers many cases of interest. 

One example is a bialgebra. An operad only has operations taking several inputs and one output, so there is no room for comultiplication. On the other hand this is not a serious obstacle. A small modification of the defining axioms will accommodate also this example: bialgebras are algebras over a properad, rather than an operad. A better example is maybe then a field. There is no possibility of encoding the existence of the inverse in the language of operads. More generally, operads and their relatives are all about encoding operations and relations which are multilinear, and inversion is just the simplest example of something nonlinear.

This answer has been corrected per Torsten's remark. If $V/G = Y$ is a complex torus, i.e. $G$ has maximal rank, then Hodge symmetry says $H^1(Y,\mathcal O) = \overline{H^0(Y,\Omega)}$. But the cotangent bundle of $Y$ is trivial by translation on the group, so $H^0(Y,\Omega) = H^0(Y,\mathcal O) \otimes (T_0 Y)^\ast$ (the cotangent space at the identity). Now $T_0Y \cong V$, so $H^1(Y,\mathcal O) \cong \overline V^\ast$. If $Y=V/G$ is an algebraic torus, i.e. a product $(\mathbf C^\ast)^p$, then $H^1(Y,\mathcal O)$ is trivial. One way to see this is through the exponential sequence and the triviality of the Picard group of $Y$. This also takes care of any product of complex tori, algebraic tori and affine spaces. But in general I see no reason that a quotient $V/G$ couldn't be a nontrivial extension of a complex torus by an algebraic torus. (In the algebraic setting this would be a semiabelian variety.) I don't know what happens to the cohomology then. 

Regarding Question 1: the case that one of the two algebras has vanishing differential is proven as one of the main theorems of the following paper of Bashar Saleh: "Noncommutative formality implies commutative and Lie formality", Algebr. Geom. Topol. Volume 17, Number 4 (2017), 2523-2542. In other words, a cdga over $\mathbf Q$ which is formal as a dga is also formal as a cdga. 

In Katz's review of $\ell$-adic cohomology in the first "Motives" volume, this isomorphism is stated without any smoothness assumptions, with a reference to SGA4, XVI 4.1 (which I don't have easily available). 

Yes, pick $x_0$ to be a Weierstrass point, i.e. a fixed point of the hyperelliptic involution. Let $\sigma$ denote the hyperelliptic involution on $X$. Under the Abel-Jacobi map we have $x \mapsto [x-x_0]$ and $\sigma(x) \mapsto [\sigma(x) - x_0]$. Now $[x + \sigma(x) - 2x_0]$ is the divisor of a function, since it is the pullback under the hyperelliptic map of a degree zero divisor on $\mathbf P^1$. Hence $AJ(x)$ and $AJ(\sigma(x))$ are inverses. 

Let $N_d$ denote the number of rational curves in $\mathbf P^2$ passing through $3d-1$ points in general position. Maxim Kontsevich discovered a famous recursion for these numbers: $$ N_d = \sum_{k+l = d} N_k N_l k^2 l \left( l \binom{3d-4}{3k-2} - k \binom{3d-4}{3k-1}\right).$$ The proof of this recursion goes by interpreting $N_d$ as a Gromov-Witten invariant: one looks at the moduli space $\overline{M}_{0,3d-1}(\mathbf P^2, d)$ and pulls back the class of a point along each evaluation map. Taking the product of all these classes in the Chow ring produces a number. Using that $\mathbf P^2$ is homogeneous one can show that this number actually counts the number of stable maps where the markings are sent to the given points, and it is not hard to see that counting stable maps is the same thing as counting rational curves. Finally, the associativity of the quantum product can be translated to the WDVV differential equations for the Gromov-Witten potential, i.e. the generating function of all Gromov-Witten invariants. These differential equations translate into the above recursion. At least, this is how the proof is stated in Kontsevich's "Enumeration of rational curves via torus actions" and Konstevich-Manin "Gromov-Witten classes, quantum cohomology and enumerative geometry", which seem to be the earliest published sources. However, there is also a beautiful streamlined proof which avoids the use of the quantum product. Here one instead works with $\overline M_{0,3d}(\mathbf{P}^2,d)$ (one more marking) and takes the pullback of the classes of two lines in $\mathbf P^2$ along the first two markings and $3d-2$ classes of points for the remaining. The intersection of these are a curve in the moduli space and one then computes the intersection of this curve with two different linearly equivalent boundary divisors. These two intersection numbers can easily be computed by hand, producing the recursion. The proof that these two boundary divisors are linearly equivalent uses the forgetful map to $\overline{M}_{0,4}$ which is also used in the proof of the WDVV equations so in some sense it seems like this proof inlines the particular case of WDVV that is needed in a very clever way. This latter version of the proof appears for instance in the book of Kock and Vainsencher, in Abramovich's "Lectures on Gromov-Witten invariants on orbifolds", and in the lecture notes I found here. But where is it from originally? All these sources just refer to it as "Kontsevich's proof" without attribution. Did Kontsevich also come up with this streamlined version but did not see it as worth publishing? 

It is indeed true that a holomorphic map $\mathbb C \to \mathcal E'$ is constant. This is because it must factor through the universal cover of $\mathcal E'$, since $\mathbb C$ is simply connected. But the universal cover is a product of two copies of the complex unit disk, so the result follows by the maximum principle. Nevertheless I don't think that this is what he meant. My guess is that he accidentally left out the word "Spec", so that he meant to say that maps $\mathrm{Spec}\,\mathbb C \to \mathcal E'$ are canonically in bijection with pairs $(E,x)$ of an elliptic curve and a non-identity point. 

I see no reason to cite it when the proof is so easy! The homology of the associated total complex can be computed using the spectral sequence of a double complex in two different ways: either you start by taking homology of rows or of columns. In both cases the sequence obviously collapses, and the homology of $E^\infty $ is given by the homology of the bottom row and the leftmost column respectively. 

Let $V$ be a finite dimensional complex vector space. According to the Peter-Weyl theorem there is a decomposition $\mathcal O(\mathrm{GL}(V)) \cong \bigoplus_\lambda V_\lambda \otimes V_\lambda^\ast$ of the algebraic coordinate ring of $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ into a direct sum indexed by partitions, where $V_\lambda$ denotes the representation of highest weight $\lambda$. According to Schur-Weyl duality there is a decomposition $T(V) \cong \bigoplus_{\lambda} V_\lambda \otimes \sigma_\lambda$ of the tensor algebra on $V$, where $\sigma_\lambda$ now denotes the Specht module associated to a partition $\lambda$. The two statements look very similar. Is there a direct relation between the commutative ring $\mathcal O(\mathrm{GL}(V))$ and the associative algebra $T(V)$? E.g. a map between them that behaves nicely w.r.t. the decompositions? 

(Not an answer, too long for a comment.) Is it even clear that there was a refereeing system in place? As opposed to, say, the editors looking through each submission and giving a thumbs up/thumbs down. There is an interesting story about a 1936 paper of Einstein and Rosen on gravitational waves, which suggests that even that recently, peer review worked very differently. Einstein and Rosen had discovered an erroneous argument proving mathematically that gravitational waves couldn't possibly exist, and they submitted it to Physical Review. The handling editor, John Tate Sr., had usually accepted Einstein's papers without any refereeing process, but felt skeptical about the result. So he sent it to Howard P. Robertson for review, who wrote a ten-page report explaining why the argument didn't hold water. Einstein was not happy about this, and wrote the following letter in response: 

The answer is yes. First off, the map $\mathrm{Conf}_l M \to M^l$ induces an isomorphism on $H^1$ if $M$ is an oriented manifold such that $\dim M > 2$, or such that $\dim(M)=2$ and $M$ has positive genus. See my answer to a previous question fundamental group of configuration spaces of ordered points on open Riemann surfaces. Secondly, if $X$ is a smooth projective variety, then $X \setminus \{pt\}$ is a formal topological space. This is because the mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology of $X \setminus \{pt\}$ is pure. See e.g. Dupont's paper $URL$ So all the triple or higher Massey products of classes in $H^1(\mathrm{Conf}_l (X \setminus \{pt\})) = H^1((X\setminus \{pt\})^l)$ vanish, because the Massey products are functorial and they vanish in the cohomology of $(X\setminus \{pt\})^l$. The same holds for the jacobian. So the result follows from what you've already said about the case $l=1$ and the Kunneth formula. 

There is a version of the Hodge conjecture for open and singular varieties using Borel-Moore homology, which can be formulated without using the word "mixed motive". Let $X$ be any complex algebraic variety. Let $H_i(X)$ be its Borel-Moore homology. It carries a mixed Hodge structure with weights in the interval $[-i,0]$. This version of the Hodge conjecture says that the image of the cycle class map $\mathrm{CH}_i(X)_{\mathbf Q} \to H_{2i}(X,{\mathbf Q})$ is exactly the subspace $W_{-2i}H_{2i}(X,\mathbf Q) \cap F^{-i}H_{2i}(X,\mathbf C)$. It is known that this conjecture is equivalent to the usual Hodge conjecture. There is also an analogue of the generalized Hodge conjecture in this setting. If $X$ is smooth but noncompact, one can use ordinary cohomology instead of Borel-Moore homology, and consider instead $W_{2i}H^{2i}(X,\mathbf Q) \cap F^{i}H^{2i}(X,\mathbf C)$.
