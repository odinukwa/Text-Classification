The question still feels a bit vague to me, but this started to get too long to be a comment. There are a number of issues: There's the question of the definition of $\mathbb C[G_q]$, and say an analogue of the Peter-Weyl theorem, and there is also the issue of doing this at a root of unity case, or better studying things integrally. For this say, a recent paper of Lusztig gives a definition of a quantum coordinate ring for any (finite type) root datum, which specializes to the Kostant-Chevalley form. Andersen-Polo-Wen and others have studied studied quantum induction functors which correspond to taking global sections on the classical flag variety, and these might be what you want (Ryom-Hansen also proved a version of Kempf vanishing in this context for example). This was also more recently taken up by Kumar and Littelmann in the context of studying Frobenius splitting. Finally there's the issue of understand quantum flag varieties as noncommutative spaces as in the previous comment, for which along with the Lunts-Rosenberg paper, there is also more recent work of Backelin and Kremnizer. 

The fusion product for affine Lie algebras is closely related to the existence of "evaluation homomorphisms" from the loop algebra to the finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra g, which split the natural inclusion of g as the subalgebra of constant loops. In the quantum case there is no evaluation map from the quantum affine algebra to the finite-type quantum algebra outside of type A (this is proved - at least for Yangians - in Drinfeld's original paper I'm pretty sure). You see consequences of this in lots of places: e.g. for representations of g, the evaluation homomorphisms mean any irreducible representation for g can be lifted to an irreducible representation of the affine Lie algebra Lg. On the other hand, irreducible representations of the associated quantum groups do not (necessarily) lift to representations of quantum affine algebras, and so one asks about "minimal affinizations" -- irreducible finite dimensional representations of the quantum affine algebra which have the given irreducible as a constituent when restricted to the finite-type quantum group. That said, the "ordinary" tensor product for finite dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras is pretty interesting -- it's not braided any more for example. 

It's perhaps in the "second step" category of references, but the book by Gelfand and Manin is a classic reference for derived categories. (Later editions have fewer typos I think). 

In general it is not possible to embed the Weyl group $W$ in the group $G$: already you can see this for $SL_2(\mathbb C)$, where the Weyl group has order $2$: if the torus fixes the lines spanned by $e_1$ and $e_2$ respectively, you want to pick the linear map taking $e_1$ to $e_2$ and $e_2$ to $e_1$, but this has determinant $-1$. A lift of $W$ to $N(T)$ must be an element of order $4$ not $2$, say $e_1 \mapsto -e_2$ and $e_2 \mapsto e_1$. In fact, Tits has shown that this is essentially the only obstruction: the Weyl group can always be lifted to a group $\tilde{W}$ inside $G$ which is an extension of $W$ by an elementary abelian $2$-group of order $2^l$ where $l$ is the number of simple roots. If I recall correctly, this lift is then unique up to conjugation. 

The geometric Frobenius is an isogeny of the algebraic group to itself, since it clearly has finite kernel. A mild extension of the "isomorphism theorem" for algebraic groups of arbitrary characteristic classifies isogenies in terms of their action on root data, as you require. The theorem says that an "isogeny" of root data corresponds, uniquely up to conjugation, to an isogeny of groups. The cases you are interested in occur via Frobenius morphisms and hence those morphisms are determined by their action on root systems. This is all discussed in Steinberg's paper, so hopefully that's a sufficient reference. 

I'm not sure this is an answer, but it got too long to be a comment! The projectivity of $G/B$ seems to me to follow from two facts: a) a homogeneous space $G/H$ is always a quasi-projective variety (which is due to Chevalley), and b) the variety $G/B$ must be complete. The first fact clearly has nothing to do with Borel subgroups but it would be maybe interesting to ask about how many proofs we have of it. The idea of the construction is clear: find a representation of $G$ which contains a line $L$ which has $H$ as its stabilizer and then take the orbit of $L$ in $\mathbb P(V)$, but to see that you get a categorical quotient this way takes some more care: you need to use some infinitesimal properties, (which you can tidily say using the Lie algebra of course). The second fact perhaps depends on what you're willing to assume, but it must come down to the Borel fixed point theorem in some form or other, since this tells you that if $G/H$ is complete, then any solvable subgroup will be contained in a conjugate of $H$, thus Borel subgroups are the only solvable subgroups with a chance of having an associated homogeneous space which is complete. The argument from Humphreys' book uses the strategy of picking first a maximal solvable subgroup of largest dimension so as to show the orbit has to be closed (essentially because the stabilizer is largest so the orbit has smallest, but even then you use the Borel fixed point and the theorem for $GL_n$ if I remember correctly). I don't know how Onishchik and Vinberg get around this (if they do). Then, as the question says, you get the general result from the Borel fixed point theorem. The proof for $GL_n$ shows that $G/B$ is projective if you take $B$ to be the subgroup of upper triangular matrices, but one still needs to show that this subgroup is a Borel, which again I only know how to do using the Borel fixed point theorem in some form. (And of course you can use the same strategy for other classical groups if you can eyeball a candidate Borel subgroup). Given that, it's maybe worth pointing out that in all of this you can get away with a weak version of the Borel fixed point theorem: namely if $V$ is a representation of a solvable group $H$, and $X$ is an $H$-stable closed subvariety of $\mathbb P(V)$ then $X$ has an $H$-fixed point. This can be shown just using the Lie-Kolchin theorem (that is, that a representation of a solvable group contains a one-dimensional subrepresentation), which can be proved directly. Since the standard proof of the general Borel fixed point requires you to use something like Zariski's main theorem, this is maybe a noticeable saving. All of this leads me to wonde how many proofs do we know for i) the fact that for any closed subgroup $H$ the homogeneous space $G/H$ has to be quasi-projective and ii) the Borel fixed point theorem (or some variant)? 

The difference operators (as you presumably know) are defined in a paper of Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand on Schubert cells etc. which is probably roughly as old as you can get. The fact that the $r_i + c\partial_i$ satisfy the Coxeter relations is implied by (equivalent to, pretty much) the fact that the graded/degenerate affine Hecke algebra is isomorphic as a vector space to $\mathbb C[W]\otimes \mathbb C[x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n]$ (the operators give the action of the $\mathbb C[W]$ subalgebra on the polynomial representation of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra). The first references for the degenerate affine Hecke algebra are Drinfeld's paper on Yangians and degenerate affine Hecke algebras (for type A) and Lusztig's paper on cuspidal local systems and graded Hecke algebras (part I), and the Lusztig paper that Stephen references, which is pure algebra. I think it also arises in some form in Cherednik's paper on Gelfand-Tzetlin bases. The connection to the equivariant cohomology of the Steinberg is examined in Lusztig's cuspidal local systems papers (it is the easiest "Springer theory" case, i.e. where you don't have to worry about cuspidal local systems). 

Good question, but perhaps a little unfairly stated? With a topic like group theory, for example, it is true that, historically speaking, topics such as Galois theory played a crucial motivating role in the development of the theory, however, a posteriori, Galois theory is a more sophisticated topic than (elementary) group theory, and a student can profitably learn about groups as natural mathematical incarnations of symmetry, before he/she learns about Galois theory. Therein lies, I think, a core issue: while explanation of the motivation behind a part of mathematics is very enlightening to those who have a rich enough background to appreciate it, it is not so clearly helpful to be given that motivation as one is first learning the subject: to be able to appreciate torsion as a phenomenon in the homology of manifolds, for example, requires considerably more sophistication than I would require of someone to explain (rigourously) what a finite (abelian) group was. To put it another way, if I have thought hard about a piece of mathematics, and over time realized a good way to describe it, then it's not at all clear to me that telling you all the motivations I had, and the failed attempts I made, will ease your path to understanding what I have figured out, and therefore why should I burden you with all that baggage? The same verdict is I expect made more brutally by people who clean up the work of those that have come before them.
