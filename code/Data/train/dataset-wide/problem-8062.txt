A simple example from this paper illustrates the idea. Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent standard normal random variables. What is the conditional distribution of $X$ given that you are on the (measure-zero) line where $X = Y$? The answer will vary depending on if you condition on $Z_1 = 0$ where $Z_1 \equiv X - Y$ or $Z_2 = 1$ where $Z_2 \equiv X/Y$, to give just two of an infinite number of examples. So in a given situation which $Z$ is the "right" one to use? My question is not about the Borel paradox or modeling random phenomena per se. 

To expand a bit on Arthur B.'s comment that you can use samples even if they are dependent, consider this quote from Andrew Gelman and Kenneth Shirley: 

Specifically, what can you infer about where your pace lies wrt the population of runners on the loop? Are you in the top 5%? Are you above average? Etc. Of course, you'd need to make assumptions about many of these things, fixing $P_d$ for instance. And as a modeling exercise there are several interesting elaborations, such as letting the random variables $D_i$ and $S_i$ be correlated. There obviously isn't one right answer, hence the 'soft' tag. But I'm interested in hearing if others have thought about it, how they might set up the problem and what sorts of assumptions would make the conclusions most interesting. As you take $L$ smaller and smaller so that you have to contend with the possibility of lapping people and getting lapped, things become harder, and in different ways depending on whether or not we allow registering getting passed by the same person. We could also let people go around clockwise or counterclockwise with some probability. It seems so obvious that this information imparts qualitative information about your relative fitness, but quantifying it isn't straight forward. The data is well defined, the question is pretty easy to ask, but the modeling part leaves a lot of flexibility. I'm interested in hearing how the creative brains here at MO would set up the problem to interpret the evidence (or if there is a fun paper on this sort of problem somewhere). 

There is a large literature on the cohomology of restricted Lie algebras in characteristic $p>0$, see the link to the PhD-thesis of Tyler J. Evans and the references given therein. Also the book "Representations of Algebraic groups" by J. C. Jantzen is a good reference, not only for the cohomology of restricted Lie algebras (although it is not in the references of Evans thesis). As for the complex, just as taking $H^n(\mathfrak{g},M)=H^n(U(\mathfrak{g}),M)$ with the universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$, one can use $H^n(\mathfrak{g},M)=H^n(u(\mathfrak{g}),M)$ for the restricted universal enveloping algebra, if $\mathfrak{g}$ is restricted. On the other hand, for Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ of a semisimple algebraic group $G$ in prime characteristic one can also consider the representation theory of $G_1$, the first Frobenius kernel of $G$. In fact, the representation theory of $G_1$ and $\mathfrak{g}$, considered as restricted Lie algebra, can be identified. In this setting the low-dimensional cohomology groups have been computed explicitly for minuscule representations (e.g., the first cohomology groups for classical Lie algebras by J. C. Jantzen, in Progress in Mathematics, Vol. 95, 1991). 

There is a whole theory of functional equations (or functional identities) in algebras. It was used for instance to obtain solutions to some of Herstein's problems on Lie homomorphisms. An overview of the theory is given in the book Bresar, Chebotar, Martindale, Functional identities The area has its own entry in the 2010 MSC (16R60). 

Given an arbitrary countable group $H$ containing an element of large enough order but no involutions, there exists a two-generator simple group $G$ such that $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$ and $G=\bigcup \limits _{g\in G} gHg^{-1}$. This is Theorem 17 of S.V. Ivanov and A.Y. Ol'shanskii, Some applications of graded diagrams in combinatorial group theory, Groups—St. Andrews 1989, Vol. 2, London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser., vol. 160, Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 1991, pp. 258–308. 

Lie algebras over rings (Lie rings) are important in group theory. For instance, to every group $G$ one can associate a Lie ring $$L(G)=\bigoplus _{i=1}^\infty \gamma _i(G)/\gamma _{i+1}(G),$$ where $\gamma _i(G)$ is the $i$-th term of the lower central series of $G$. The addition is defined by the additive structure of $\gamma _i{G}/\gamma _{i+1}(G)$, and the Lie product is defined on homogeneous elements by $[x\gamma _{i+1}(G),y\gamma _{j+1}(G)]=[x,y]\gamma _{i+j+1}(G)$, and then extended to L(G) by linearity. There are several other ways of constructing Lie rings associated to groups, and there are numerous applications of these. One of the most notorious ones is the solution of the Restricted Burnside Problem by Zelmanov, see the book M. R. Vaughan-Lee, "The Restricted Burnside Problem". There's other books related to these rings, for example, Kostrikin, "Around Burnside", Huppert, Blackburn, "Finite groups II", Dixon, du Sautoy, Mann, Segal, "Analytic pro-$p$ groups". 

There have been written many books and articles on this subject (see for example the book "Sturmfels, Bernd, Solving systems of polynomial equations. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2002"). It is not the fact that the polynomials are quadratic which helps, but rather other restrictions which will sometimes result in a more effective solution. If the Groebner basis of the corresponding ideal in $K[x_1,\ldots ,x_n]$ can be computed, and has triangular form, then we can usually solve the system. However, Groebner bases have large exponential complexity and cannot solve in practice systems with, say, more than $15$ variables. For some overdetermined systems there are other techniques than Groebner bases. One of these is called "relinearization". The exact complexity of this algorithm is not known, but for sufficiently overdetermined systems it is expected to run in polynomial time (see papers by Nicolas Courtois; Alexander Klimov, Jacques Patarin, and Adi Shamir). 

The two definitions do never agree for a non-trivial nilpotent Lie algebra, as Ben has remarked. Indeed, if $\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent then $\mathfrak{s}=[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{r}]=[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]$, whereas $\mathfrak{n}=\mathfrak{g}$. Since $\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent, $\mathfrak{g}\neq [\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]$. For non-trivial abelian Lie algebras we have in particular $\mathfrak{s}=0$ and $\mathfrak{n}=\mathfrak{g}$. If $\mathfrak{g}$ is solvable, then $\mathfrak{s}=[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]$ and $\mathfrak{s}\subseteq \mathfrak{n}$, and both equality and strict inclusion can happen. For equality consider the $2$-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebra. 

I was able to find a reasonably good approximation using bounds given in a tech report of Jim Pitman. Starting on page 13 an example is worked out which computes bounds on ratios of row-adjacent Stirling numbers using stable and efficient polygamma evaluations; see expressions (33) and (34) specifically. 

Now the question reads: for $k > 1$ and for any $F \in \mathcal{P}$ does there exist $\mathcal{G_q} \subset \mathcal{P}$ with $G_{\theta^*}^{-1}(q_j) = F^{-1}(q_j)$ for all $j = 1, \dots, k$ ? (Here $G^{-1}$ denotes the inverse cumulative distribution function of the distribution $G \in \mathcal{G}$ with density $g(x)$, and similarly for $F$.) Further, to get to the heart of the issue, I need $\mathcal{G_q}$ to be computable given $q$ as input. I suspect there is a non-existence result of some kind to be had here. Note that for $k = 1$ this is actually doable, which is the motivation behind the use of the asymmetric Laplace density for this purpose. The trick used there is that the likelihood is maximized at the sample quantile, which is consistent for the true quantile. This does not work naively in the case of $k>1$ because the normalizing constant messes things up so that the parameters are still consistent for the quantiles but they no longer "represent" the corresponding quantiles of the density being used. 

A bit too long for a comment, so I write it as an answer. $(1)$ Let $L$ be the Galois closure of $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. We can apply $\sigma\in Gal(L,\mathbb{Q})$ on $P+N$ and $PN$, which lie in $L$. $(2)$ Since either $\sigma(P)=P$ and $\sigma(N)=N$ or $\sigma(P)=N$ and $\sigma(N)=P$, it always follows that $\sigma(P+N)=P+N$ and $\sigma(PN)=PN$, for $\sigma\in Gal(L/\mathbb{Q})$, where $L$ is the Galois closure of $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. $(3)$ So $P+N$ and $PN$ are fixed under elements of $Gal(L/\mathbb{Q})$, hence in $\mathbb{Q}$ by definition.

Hirschhorn and Hunt have published a note M. D. Hirschhorn; D. C. Hunt, A simple proof of the Ramanujan conjecture for powers of 5, J. Reine Angew. Math., 326 (1981), 1-17., where they give a proof (what they call "a simple proof") for the formula for the generating function of $p(5^{\alpha}n+\delta_n)$, with $\alpha\ge 1$ and $\delta_n$ being the reciprocal modulo $5^{\alpha}$ of 24; see Theorem $1.4$. 

There is another description of $H_2(G)$ due to Miller: Miller, Clair The second homology group of a group; relations among commutators. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 3, (1952). 588--595. In modern terminology, let $x,y\in G$ and denote ${}^xy=xyx^{-1}$. Let $G\wedge G$ be the group generated by the symbols $x\wedge y$, $x,y\in G$, subject to the following relations: $$ xy\wedge z = ({}^xy\wedge {}^xz)(x\wedge z),\quad x \wedge yz = (x\wedge y)({}^yx\wedge {}^yz),\quad x\wedge x = 1, $$ for all $x,y,z\in G$. The group $G\wedge G$ is also known as the nonabelian exterior square of $G$. There is a commutator homomorphism $\kappa :G\wedge G\to [G,G]$ given by $x\wedge y\mapsto [x,y]$. Miller essentially proved that $\ker \kappa$ is naturally isomorphic to $H_2(G)$. This is closely related to the answers of Henry Wilton and Richard Kent. Namely, $G\wedge G$ is isomorphic to the derived subgroup of a covering group $\hat{G}$ of $G$, and it is not difficult to find an isomorphism between $\ker\kappa$ and $(R\cap [F,F])/[F,R]$. 

One can also show with Fermat's last theorem that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational - the answer of mt did $2^{1/n}$ for $n\ge 3$. Suppose that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then there is a right-angled triangle with rational sides $(a,b,c)=(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2},2)$ and area 1. Hence $1$ would be a congruent number. This contradicts Fermat's last theorem with exponent $4$.
