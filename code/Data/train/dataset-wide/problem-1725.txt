I think the key point is how the velocity dispersion in a given structure compares with the velocity dispersion you would expect from the difference in the Hubble flow across the linear extent of the object. Or, equivalently, what range of distances (according to Hubble's law) are implied by the velocity dispersions and how does this compare with the actual size of the structure in question. Fingers of God effects in clusters are produced because the velocity dispersions ($\sim \pm 1000$ km/s) would imply a front-to-back distance of $\pm 14$ Mpc (for $H_0 = 70$ km s$^{-1}$/Mpc), compared with the actual size of a cluster that typically only has a diameter of $2$ Mpc. Galaxy clusters may themselves be part of superclusters. These superclusters may have sizes of order 100 Mpc or more. However, the peculiar velocities of clusters at similar distances (that can be judged from the average recession velocities of their members) is actually smaller than the peculiar velocities of individual galaxies. Thus the change in Hubble flow velocity across a supercluster is much larger than the peculiar velocities of the individual members (andthey are not bound together). So I would not expect a Finger of God effect in the members of a supercluster. 

You really need a full-blown stellar evolution model to answer this precisely and I'm not sure anyone would ever have done this with an oxygen-dominated star. To zeroth order the answer will be the similar to a metal-rich star - i.e. about 0.075 times the mass of the Sun. Any less than this and the brown dwarf (for that is what we call a star that never gets hot enough at its centre to initiate significant fusion) can be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. A star/brown dwarf with the composition you suggest would be a different. The composition would be thoroughly and homogeneously mixed by convection. Note that other than a thin layer near the surface, the water would be completely dissociated and the hydrogen and oxygen atoms completely ionised. Hence the density of protons in the core would be lower for the same mass density than in a "normal star". However, the temperature dependence is so steep I think this would be a minor factor and nuclear fusion would be significant at a similar temperature. Of much greater importance is that there would be fewer electrons and fewer particles at the same density. This decreases both the electron degeneracy pressure and normal gas pressure at a given mass density. The star is therefore able to contract to much smaller radii before degeneracy pressure becomes important and can thus reach higher temperatures for the same mass as a result. For that reason I think that the minimum mass for hydrogen fusion of a "water star" would be smaller than for a star made mainly of hydrogen. But how much smaller? Back of the envelop time! Use the virial theorem to get a relationship between perfect gas pressure and the temperature, mass and radius of a star. Let gravitational potential energy be $\Omega$, then the virial theorem says $$ \Omega = -3 \int P \ dV$$ If we only have a perfect gas then $P = \rho kT/\mu m_u$, where $T$ is the temperature, $\rho$ the mass density, $m_u$ an atomic mass unit and $\mu$ the average number of mass units per particle in the gas. Assuming a constant density star (back of the envelope) then $dV = dM/\rho$, where $dM$ is a mass shell and $\Omega = -3GM^2/5R$, where $R$ is the "stellar" radius. Thus $$\frac{GM^2}{5R} = \frac{kT}{\mu m_u} \int dM$$ $$ T = \frac{GM \mu m_u}{5k R}$$ and so the central temperature $T \propto \mu MR^{-1}$. Now what we do is say that the star contracts until at this temperature, the phase space occupied by its electrons is $\sim h^3$ and electron degeneracy becomes important. A standard treatment of this is to say that the physical volume occupied by an electron is $1/n_e$, where $n_e$ is the electron number density and that the momentum volume occupied is $\sim (6m_e kT)^{3/2}$. The electron number density is related to the mass density by $n_e = \rho /\mu_e m_u$, where $\mu_e$ is the number of mass units per electron. For ionised hydrogen $\mu_e=1$, but for oxygen $\mu_e=2$ (all the gas would be ionised near the temperatures for nuclear fusion). The average density $\rho = 3M/4\pi R^3$. Putting these things together we get $$h^3 = \frac{ (6m_e kT)^{3/2}}{n_e} = \frac{4\pi \mu_e}{3}\left(\frac{6 \mu}{5}\right)^{3/2} (Gm_e R)^{3/2} m_u^{5/2} M^{1/2}$$ Thus the radius to which the star contracts in order for degeneracy pressure to be important is $$ R \propto \mu_e^{-2/3} \mu^{-1} M^{-1/3}$$ If we now substitute this into the expression for central temperature, we find $$ T \propto \mu M \mu_e^{2/3} \mu M^{1/3} \propto \mu^2 \mu_e^{2/3} M^{4/3}$$ Finally, if we argue that the temperature for fusion is the same in a "normal" star and our "water star", then the mass at which fusion will occur is given by the proportionality $$ M \propto \mu^{-3/2} \mu_e^{-1/2}$$ . For a normal star with a hydrogen/helium mass ratio of 75:25, then $\mu \simeq 16/27$ and $\mu_e \simeq 8/7$. For a "water star", $\mu = 18/11$ and $\mu_e= 9/5$. Thus if the former set of parameters leads to a minimum mass for fusion of $0.075 M_{\odot}$, then by increasing $\mu$ and $\mu_e$ this becomes smaller by the appropriate factor $(18\times 27/11\times 16)^{-3/2} (9\times 7/5\times 8)^{-1/2} = 0.173$. Thus a water star would undergo H fusion at $0.013 M_{\odot}$ or about 13 times the mass of Jupiter! NB This only deals with hydrogen fusion. The small amount of deuterium would fuse at lower temperatures. A similar analysis would give a minimum mass for this to occur of about 3 Jupiter masses. 

The horizontals curve down, and because of this the position changes. The photon in its gedanken mirror-box falls down. Then if you were to throw it fast past the Sun you'd say it was deflected - it's moving fast from left to right, but it falls down too. But note that the verticals are not affected. Only half the light path is curved by the Sun. The electron is affected in a similar fashion because of the wave nature of matter. This is why the deflection of matter is half the deflection of light. 

I wouldn't say it's stupid. But I would say it's presenting hypothesis as some kind of fact. For all we know our universe does have a centre and an edge. 

It's a billion miles to Saturn. Well actually the distance varies with the orbits, but see this Space.com article: "At their most distant, when they lie on opposite sides of the sun from one another, they are just over a billion miles (1.7 billion km) apart". The Andromeda galaxy is circa fifteen billion billion miles away. Or circa fifteen quintillion miles. 

Correct. StephenG gave the expression: $F=\frac {G M_1 M_2} {r^2}$. If the masses are greater the force is even greater. 

It certainly makes sense to me! Edit 13/09/2017 : as Dave points out in the comments, there are other motions, including the motion of the solar system around the galaxy, which is circa 514,000 mph. (See the Wikipedia Galactic Year article). And the motion of galaxies isn't neat and tidy either. 

No, and no. At least as far as I know. But most of what I know came from Frozen Star by George Greenstein. The first half of the book is all about neutron stars. It dates from 1984 and it could be a little out of date. But as far as I know there's not much wrong with it, and it's a good read regardless. Note that you can buy a second hand copy fairly cheaply. 

It's simpler than you think. Imagine you have two Earth-sized objects A and B. Object A will "fall" towards object B at 9.8m/s². In addition object B will "fall" towards object A at 9.8m/s². So their closing acceleration is 19.6m/s². It's more than 9.8m/s². The net effect is that the two objects fall together faster. However if your two objects are apple-sized and Earth-sized, object A will "fall" towards object B at 9.8m/s², but object B experiences no measurable "fall" towards object B. An apple is just too small. It's the same if you have a melon-sized object and an Earth-sized object. It's also the same if you have a melon+apple-sized object and an Earth-sized object. You measure an acceleration of 9.8m/s². Your melon+apple needs to be very very big before you measure a closing acceleration of more than 9.8m/s². 

By doing experiments. Pela mentioned the Michelson-Morley experiment. That's what got Einstein thinking. That's why he came up with the theory of relativity. However other experiments will prove that the speed of light is not the same for every observer. It's the same for every inertial observer, because of the wave nature of matter. But see Is The Speed of Light Everywhere the Same? on the PhysicsFAQ website. It's written by Don Koks, a physicist in Adelaide. He says this: "That the speed of light depends on position when measured by a non-inertial observer is a fact routinely used by laser gyroscopes that form the core of some inertial navigation systems. These gyroscopes send light around a closed loop, and if the loop rotates, an observer riding on the loop will measure light to travel more slowly when it traverses the loop in one direction than when it traverses the loop in the opposite direction. This is known as the Sagnac Effect. The gyroscope does employ such an observer: it is the electronics that sits within the gyro. This electronic observer detects the difference in those light speeds, and attributes that difference to the gyro's not being inertial: it is accelerating within some inertial frame. That measurement of an acceleration allows the body's orientation to be calculated, which keeps it on track and in the right position as it flies". Your measurement of the speed of light is not totally constant, it depends on your acceleration. If you were in a room in an accelerating rocket, you would be what Koks called the "global" observer, and you would say that light at the ceiling travels faster than light down near the floor. 

This very good question (I wondered myself the same 30 years ago! :-) has an important yet simple answer: because of inertia, in most cases they miss collision. In short, e.g. planets's trajectories are a compromise between their tendency to move on straight lines (inertia) and the gravitational pull applied by other objets. When the gravitational pull becomes stronger, velocity increases hence inertia increases, which typically allows the planet to zip next to the source of pull (it has gained so much velocity by then that it just overshoots). So, in practice, only a tiny set of initial conditions lead to actual collision. Those which hit have zero angular momentum to start with (so they are on a purely radial collisional orbit). 

PS: the expression spin up is unfortunate it seems because it is in fact spin conservation at the later stage of collapse of the proto halo which makes it rotate faster while preserving it spin (= total internal angular momentum). 

As an complement to the other answers, let me address the question of why planets tend towards tidal locking. In short, the torque applied by the differential gravitational force between both sides of the surface of the planet induces friction, which in turn dissipates aways the excess spin of the (proto) moon when it is not tidally locked. When locking occurs the dissipation is minimized. Another artifact is that the moon is also moving away from the earth (as it looses angular momentum). See e.g. $URL$ 

Your hypothesis is correct: it is the tidal interaction between neighbours which generates spin. Think of your proto halo (galaxy, stellar disc etc) as an ellipsoid (set by it's inertial tensor). Should the matter around it not be spherically distributed, it will apply a torque onto that ellipsoid and make it spin. The assumption in cosmology is that even though the primordial angular momentum you mention may be null, tidal interaction between neighbouring proto structures is sufficient to allow then to exchange (hence acquire individually) angular momentum, while preserving a zero sum. A Reference on this subject is given by this paper This diagram may enlighten the issue: it represents the tidal torquing of the blue ellipsoid by the tides represented by the pink ellipsoid. 

Galaxies are disc shaped because they are gas rich and dynamically young. Stars are also gas rich but they are dynamically old so they have had time to rid themselves of their discs. Young protostars (which are dynamically young) are surrounded by proto-stellar discs. The reason many young gas rich objects are disc shaped has to do the fact that circular orbits are compatible with no orbit crossing, hence no shocks. In some sense, many young astronomical objects are disc shaped because they contain(ed) gas which can radiate away non circular motion. But a disc is not the most likely state of a gravitational system: given time, torquing, instabilities or viscous processes it will tend towards a more likely compact state, where mass flows inwards and angular momentum outwards. This is why proto-stellar discs become stars. Galaxies on the other hand have not had time to turn themselves into gigantic black holes, or been given the opportunity to do so via torquing with their environment. When two gas poor disc galaxies collide they produce an elliptical which is not disc like. When two gas rich disc galaxies collide they produce a disc like galaxy with a bulge. Update Another way to think about this is to consider the ratio of angular momentum to total energy. Through shocks, if gas is present the system can radiate away some of its energy so that this ratio becomes larger. A high ratio will typically correspond to a disc-like system.
