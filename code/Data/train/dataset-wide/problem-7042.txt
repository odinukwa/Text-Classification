This model accounts for variability that can be present when a market does not have all information pertaining to $y_t$. combining this formula using a specification used with the Lucas supply function: $$\tilde{y}=\sum_{i=1}^N\lambda_iy_{t-i}$$ combining the two equations we get: $$y_t=\sum_{i=1}^N\lambda_iy_{t-i}+\sum_{i=0}^N\beta_i(X_{t-i}-X_{t-i}^e)+\epsilon_t$$ This model tells us that if rational expectations hold,the relationship of $y_t=\sum_{i=1}^N\lambda_iy_{t-i}$, thus providing validity for the use of uni variate models in economics. For more reading on this topic, below is posted links to the three chapters which helped me: 1)$URL$ 2)$URL$ 3)$URL$ UPDATE: Upon Contacting Dr. Paul Middleditch on Twitter he says that the RHS variables must be replaced with a proxy which is normally the value of the previous period. ARIMA methodology satisfies such constraints.2 

we can see all of these activities in a bee hive (other than trade I guess). It seems like it can work very well with alot of the inter-temporal models we see in intermediate macroeconomics. Practical questions for analysis include: 

I've been reviewing some of my microeconomics theory and have been reading up on Roy's Identity. Recall that Roy's identity is defined as: $$x^*_{i}(\text{p},m)=-\frac{\frac{\partial v}{\partial p_{i}}}{\frac{\partial v}{\partial m}}$$ being that the indirect utility function is just the utility function evaluated at the appropriate Marshallian demands, this result is not surprising. What is an important application of roy's identity that I wouldn't know from just solving for marshallian demands? 

No, this case is not true. A factor which both shifts supply and demand curves at the same time is an increase or decrease in population. This both adds consumers (increase in demand) to the economy and increases the workforce (increase in labor force, thus producing more and increasing quantity supplied). 

In Hal Varian's Book "Microeconomic analysis" on page 35 he gives the following description of a profit maximising firm. 

Im currently doing research using some macroeconomic data. I just want to know what are the pros and cons of using seasonally adjusted/non-seasonally adjusted data in terms of forecasting. 

How exactly do you measure human capital for a given country and what numbers are included in that measure. The reason why I ask is because im interested in simulating the Mankiw–Romer–Weil version of the solow Model. Links to where I can get the data will be appreciated. 

I actually found the answer in a paper called Subsidies, Hierarchy and Peers:The Akward Economics of Higher Education. by Gordon C. Winston. He goes on at length discussing the objectives of colleges, and concludes we cannot use the same methods by which we predict firm behaviour to predict the behaviour of colleges both public and private. In his conclusion he writes: 

If you dont want to used DID, a simple cross sectional analysis would do with the addition of a dummy variable to indicate whether the individual was treated in period $t+1$ or not (implying they were treated in period $t$ for example if you were trying to see if test scores of students change depending on when they have their class on monday or tuesday. your data set would be: $$ \begin{array}{c|lcr} n & \text{Test score} & \text{IQ} & \text{Class on monday} \\ \hline 1 & 60 & 80 &0\\ 2 &80 &65 & 1 \\ 3 & 90& 70 & 0 \end{array} $$ By the incorporation of dummies you can just use regression methods for cross sectional data. 

Increasing the amount of government paperwork (Tax forms, Licensing etc.) that is required to be filled out by a given firm in the industry in question, government inspection of work sites and an overall investment in the portion of the police force that handles civil law would seem to be the solution. This is what will make these industries formalised as they are now monitored by a government that will take action (ideally) when there is an issue. 

This is from the end of the first chapter in the book Public Finance in Canada 4th edition by Harvy Rosen. This book is a primer for welfare economics. The book states gives a list of: 

To get started note that there are three main types of utility functions/production functions in economics. for a multi-variable case I'll illustrate it below. Complements $$U(\mathbf{X})=\min\{x_i,...,x_n\}$$ Subsitutes $$U(\mathbf{X)}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_1x_i$$ where $a_i$ is a constant greater than zero (for normal goods). Cobb-douglas (as Matthew Gunn has already said). $$u(\mathbf{X}) = \prod_i^n x_i^{\lambda_i} $$ where each $\lambda_i$ is greater than zero (for normal goods). Hope this helps. 

I see no connection between an income tax and creation of jobs. Labour supply models would indicate that we will see changes in the amount of labour supplied by a given worker in the presence of income taxes and will end up with some deadweight loss. This is not fully explained but a clearer understanding of the effect of income taxes on welfare will come from reading up on labour economics models. Hope this helps. 

As already suggested in the comments of the OP, we find cases where the provision of essential services behave much like any other market when privatized. As suggested by Henry it was found that in the case of fire fighters, they simply let the homes burn down. On the London Fire Brigade's Website they discuss the issue in question with great detail. 

I'm doing some research on how education can change a consumers preference for a given good or service. Im looking for more research papers or books that discuss such a topic. I've looked around online a little bit and read The Effects of Consumer Education on Consumer Product Safety Behavior by Richard Staelin, however I'm looking for more sources on the topic. Any suggestions? 

Unsure if this is off topic but have there been any attempts to look at the "economics of nature"? I mean this in the sense of measuring the "economic activities" of the animal kingdom. From wikipedia 

1. $URL$ 2. the actual "quantity" of $A$ can be calculated by $$A=\left(\frac{Y}{L^{\beta_1}K^{\beta_2}H^{\beta_3}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\beta_0}}$$ 3. this is of course assuming that either $\beta_3>0$ and/or $\beta_0>0$. 

I was reading this article on power laws in economics. If you look at figure.5 on page 11, you come across an interesting note. 

What is the practical use of knowing a firms average cost curve? The reason why I ask is because computational problems that a firm faces are either with regards profit maximization or cost minimization and average cost curves are never used in computations. If I can refine the question, what economic theory is derived from the average cost curve that are not given by marginal cost curve? 

Classically the philosophy primarily advocates for changing the measures of how we view productivity to include house work. The benefits, which this philosophy argues, is that we would then make policies with reference to both men and women since we are including household labor as apart of our economic measures. Now, I've tried understanding how they avoid the issue of double counting and counting intermediate goods and services but have found anything. It seems like it can be analytical, however It is too incomplete and fraught with measurement issues to practically use. Hope this helps. 

Alex's preferences of sugar and lemons can be expressed in form of a utility function as: $U(x,y)=min(x/2,y) $ where $x$ is sugar and $y$ is lemons.This function tells us we need at least 2 spoons of sugar to consume 1 lemon. we need a minimum of 2 sugars initally so we can say $x=2$ for 1 lemon so $y=1$ Plugging those values into our budget constraint: $44=20x+y$ $44=20(2)+(1)$ $44>41$ Notice how we end up having 3 left over, however with the budget constraint and preferences provided our consumption bundle will be 2 sugars and 1 lemon. 

Based on the information you have, you would run a regression of log output on log-labor, log-capital and log-human capital. This would give you a model like this. $$\ln(Y)=\beta_0+\beta_1\ln(L)+\beta_2\ln(K)+\beta_3\ln(H)+\mu$$ in terms of a more "economic looking" equation, we take the expectation of this equation and take $e$ and raise it to the power of both sides giving us our production function. $$\mathbb{E}[\ln(Y)]=\mathbb{E[}\beta_0+\beta_1\ln(L)+\beta_2\ln(K)+\beta_3\ln(H)+\mu]$$ $$\ln(Y)=\beta_0+\beta_1\ln(L)+\beta_2\ln(K)+\beta_3\ln(H)$$ Recall that we view $\beta_0$s the co-efficient on omitted variable $\ln(A)$ as the rate of technological change1,2 $$\exp\{\ln(Y)\}=\exp\{\beta_0+\beta_1\ln(L)+\beta_2\ln(K)+\beta_3\ln(H)\}$$ $$Y=A^{\beta_0}L^{\beta_1}K^{\beta_2}H^{\beta_3}$$ Using this form you can more comfortably calculate elasticity of subsitution between $L$ and $K$. If your elasticity of substitution is greater than or equal to 1 you have a labor saving process, however if elasticity of substitution is less than 1, we either have a process which is either a Human capital augmented process of TFP augmented process 3. Hope this helps 

If you know Elasticity of average product you can identify how your output per worker or machine will change as $L$ or $K$ increases. Recall the definition of elasticity is: $$\mathcal{E}=\frac{\Delta y/y}{\Delta x/x}$$ average product of labor and capital: $$AP_L=\frac{Q}{L}$$ $$AP_K=\frac{Q}{K}$$ therefore the elasticity of average product of labor and capital is: $$\Gamma_L=\frac{\Delta AP/AP}{\Delta L/L}$$ $$\Gamma_K=\frac{\Delta AP/AP}{\Delta K/K}$$ This is useful for evaluating how existing worker or capital productivity will be impacted as a result of an increase in capital or labor.
