To expand a little. In stars of a certain mass range, helium builds up in the core until it reaches a specific mass, at which point the "Helium flash" occurs and burning of helium to carbon and oxygen starts throughout the core. When things settle down, helium burning is going on in the core, which is more or less the same size, independently of the original mass of the star. Since this is the main power source of these stars, they all have about the same luminosity. The variation across the branch comes from how much remaining gas there is outside the helium-burning shell -- more gas means a larger cooler star radiating the same total amount of energy 

Since we know from SN1987A that neutrinos from a supernova can be detected at that range, that seems to be a "yes". The biggest uncertainty seems to be how much gravitational wave energy would be emitted by the supernova, and at what frequencies, which depends on a relatively detailed understanding of exactly how the matter moves around in the explosion, one simulation of which is illustrated in the (rather awesome) video in the article. 

OK. Let's do the numbers. The Earth presents an circular "profile" of radius about 6 million meters to the Sun so it's cross-sectional area is about $10^{14} m^2$. The solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere is about 1400 $W/m^2$ so the total power received from the sun is about $10^{17}W$, by coincidence, more-or-less equal to $c^2$ in SI units. So the mass equivalent of the sunlight received by Earth is about $1 kg/s$ or about $3 \times 10^7 kg/year$. This is about one part in $10^{17}$ of the mass of the Earth per year, so even if were all absorbed and none of it re-radiated (which would be thermodynamically impossible) the increase in mass is so small that the orbital change would be unmeasurable. In fact as @James K has already pointed out in a comment, more or less the same amount of energy (and therefore mass) is radiated away as heat radiation, so even this tiny change does not really occur. 

One part of your question could be paraphrased "why do we measure altitude on Mars the way we do". As you observe we could redefine the ellipsoid of zero altitude to much more closely fit the planet by moving it South a bit. The answer is based on the gravity. 0 altitude is on a surface of constant gravitational potential energy, which was originally determined in terms of atmospheric pressure, but more recently by direct gravity measurement. The other part might ask why this is in terms of the history of Mars. I don't think there is a definitive accepted answer, but I'll leave that for someone else. 

So the peak spectral radiance (This from Wikipedia) is given by $$\displaystyle \nu _{\max }=T\times 1.04\times 10^{11}\ \mathrm {Hz} /\mathrm {K} $$ This works out to about $3\times 10^{12} Hz$. The and the spectral radiance will be given by Planck's Law: $${\displaystyle B_{\nu }(T)={\frac {2h\nu ^{3}}{c^{2}}}{\frac {1}{e^{\frac {h\nu }{kT}}-1}},}$$ giving about $3\times 10^{-15} W/m^2/Hz$ so total power emitted by the $300 m^2$ black body is about $10^{-12} W/Hz$. That is spread over a spherical surface of radius $D$ for an intensity of $10^{-13}/D^2 $ of which you are capturing $10^{-12}/D^2 W/Hz$ or about $10^{14}/D^2 Jy$. So you are fine if $D< 10^7 m$ more or less. 

Of course if you supply enough energy, you could destroy a planet. If it's applied efficiently enough then the energy you need is basically the gravitational binding energy of the planet. For the Earth that is about $2\times 10^{32} J$ (source) which is perhaps better though of as the energy equivalent of about 2 million million tons of mass. So if you could supply a million million tons of antimatter (roughly a 1km diameter asteroid) and get it into the centre of the Earth so that it could annihilate with the matter there, that would do it and you'd be left with a (hot, radioactive) asteroid belt where the Earth used to be. (see Greg Bear's "The Forge of God" for a fictionalised account of this. Alternatively, that is twelve days of the Sun's total output if you could somehow focus it on the Earth. 

There's a nice description here. Remember that a star is made of gas (well plasma if you want to be picky), so it doesn't have a fixed volume. Once fusion starts a star will expand until it reaches a size where it can balance the amount of energy being produced by fusion with the amount radiated away from the surface. If it's too small, it will heat up, causing expansion which (depending on which parts of the star are expanding) will reduce the energy produced and increase the amount radiated away. A more detailed understanding of this requires keeping track of how temperature and density vary with depth in the star. In a red giant, the energy is being produced not in the core, but in a spherical shell surrounding the core (because the core has more-or-less run out of fuel). This is actually a larger volume, so more energy is being produced. The star expands until it can radiate all that energy away. I found a description with only moderate amounts of maths especially around page 132. So one thing is that you have a helium core, with hydrogen fusion going on just outside it. That means there is less mass "above" the fusion layer, so fusion is actually happening at lower pressures than when it was happening in the core. That requires higher temperatures in that layer, and when you do the equations, a much higher total energy output. That flow of energy, whether as radiation or convection reaches the outer layers of the star, and initially heats them up, causing them to expand (since the stars gravity is more or less unchanged and so cannot pull them down any harder). In expanding, they cool, which means they trap radiation more (colder gas is less transparent) and radiate away less, and they are heated again and expand again. This continues until a balance point is found (or not, for stars much bigger than the sun which can blow off much of their mass this way) and when you do the numbers it turns out that this balance requires a very large star. Perhaps one way of thinking of it is that a star much less massive than the sun just slowly goes out. A star much more massive than the sub explodes. The Sun is poised between the two, so it "nearly explodes" but stops when it's outer layers have become very large. One additional remark is that the density in the upper parts of a red giant is pretty low -- by our standards it's a decent vacuum, contaminated with red-hot gas. However because the star is so big, it is still opaque, so we count that as part of the star. 

It's a question of pressure. When the hydrogen fuel in the centre of a star runs out, the helium "ash" starts to collapse under its own gravity, since there is no longer a source of energy within it to "hold it up". For a small star, that's that. You end up with a small ball of highly compressed helium sitting their slowly cooling down. For slightly bigger stars the process is a bit "messier" involving the helium fusing further to carbon and oxygen and other processes that may "blow off" the outer layers of the star. Nevertheless the outcome is basically the same, except that now its a ball of carbon and oxygen slowly cooling. It turns out though, that there is a limit to how much pressure any matter made up of nuclei and electrons in the usual way can support, and for stars more than a few times bigger than the Sun, that limit is reached. So, as fusion goes on, and the core of the star becomes larger and more and more compressed, it eventually collapses under its own gravity, driving the electrons into the nuclei where the combine with protons to form neutrons and becoming a neutron star. This happens rather suddenly and the resulting shock has a rather dramatic effect on the rest of the star, which is what we call a type II supernova. The ball of neutrons is a neutron star, and may become a pulsar or a magnetar for a while before it calms down. Even then, there is a limit to how much pressure a ball of neutrons can sustain, and if the star was very big the core may collapse further. If that happens it will become so dense that it will form a black hole and no further information will be able to escape it. Of course all of this is, in some sense theory. We can see some evidence of all of these types of object, and we can see supernovae happening far away, but it's a bit hard to do experiments on this scale, and the objects and events are a bit rare to quickly build up a certain picture by observing. It's also worth saying that there are some black holes that may never have formed from stars -- the really big ones at the centre of galaxies. They may just be the result of local density fluctuations in the early universe, which have subsequently grown.
