If it was not feasible, then the residents of the city would bid up the price of the services provided by the low-paying jobs until the induced rise in wages (and the fall in rents) would make housing affordable enough for people who are supposed to provide the "make the world go round" services. It's important to note that this process can't create housing units out of nothing; so the restricted supply of housing still leads to inefficiency - if no new houses are constructed, people who are dissatisfied with the lack of affordable basic services have to move out of the city until enough housing is freed up for workers who are going to provide these services. This leads to inefficient allocation of labor, etc etc. "Labor market corrections" or rent regulation don't solve the underlying problem, which is a shortage of housing units in areas which offer higher productivity to workers. Public transit could help, but how exactly do we make it "high quality"? The best way to improve the quality of public transit is probably to build more roads to alleviate traffic problems during peak times, and these construction projects usually run into the same barriers that housing construction projects do. The solution I would recommend is to reform some of the environmental regulation, zoning laws and the government's internal review processes which make it so hard to build new housing units, high-speed trains, roads, etc. If the problem is a lack of housing and transportation infrastructure, the correct response should be to remove the supply-side barriers which are contributing to the shortage. 

Intuitively, you test for cointegration because if two variables are cointegrated, they represent only a "one dimensional" family of data points - even if you have a million data points from that sample, they will all fall close to the same subspace, and in general that will mean that you will have many values of parameters for your regression problem which will give a good fit (spurious regression). Consider the linear regression case - say that you have $ y = Ax + \varepsilon $ as your regression problem, where $ x $ is a column vector, $ A $ is a row vector and $ y $ is a real number. Let's say further that the "structural" relationship we are looking for is $ y = Bx $, where $ B $ is also a row vector. Take an extreme case of cointegration - $ x $ is $ 2 $-dimensional, and we have a linear relationship between its coordinates, i.e $ x_2 = c x_1 $ for some constant $ c $. In this case, any linear functional $ A $ which is equal to $ B $ when restricted to the subspace spanned by $ (1, c) $ will give a perfect fit, and the regression won't be able to distinguish between them. (There's a one dimensional family of such functionals, i.e row vectors $ A $.) What VECM analysis does is to take advantage of deviations when the relationship is not perfect. In real econometric applications, you never have a relationship that's as clean as $ x_2 = c x_1 $ (or $ y = Bx $) for your entire dataset - cointegration allows for transitory white noise in the linear combination $ x_2 - c x_1 $. If the variance of the white noise is relatively small, a standard regression will still return similar $ R^2 $ values for many different operators. Instead, what you do is look at first differences: a good fit should also fit these, i.e we should have $$ Ax_{t+1} - Ax_t \approx y_{t+1} - y_t $$ where the subscripts denote the time of observation. Running the regression this way allows you to capture the white noise in the cointegration process and use it to your advantage - it's a way of capturing the information which a naive linear regression is going to miss. 

This is a sociology issues than WTO may solved. It is impossible to level the trade playing ground in culture, especially with the ambigous term such as "minimally trade-distorting". E.g. 

THIS IS INCORRECT. Even the debt ratio is same as 50%, you CANNOT make a direct equation. You cannot make it right by playing with this kind of ratio, e.g. 

A company valuation is merely in paper. It is similar to economist eating shit jokes. When the stock price of a big company drops, it "suppose to" hurts the shareholder who bought it on high. When I say "suppose", because intervention does happens to "too big to fail" company. In worst case, government hold too much "interest" in big company that might issue bonds(AKA print money) to bails out the entity, as what happens to Asian financial crisis, and USA subprime loan financial crash. 

Both base value are different, so you cannot put them inside any equation. Nevertheless, this is a common problem of people who practice economy attempt to apply mathematics rules. 

For plain accounting purpose, @bobu5678 is a common practice. If your intention is to justify something like Return On Investment(ROI), then this can be pretty tricky. E.g. 

So the mentioned quote is more serious than inequality in wealth distribution. Even today, there is too little exposure to public the dangers of such "pathologically cash hoarding". The stock speculation cycles, subprime loan derivation bubbles, Wallstreet various acquisition, is indirectly due to "pathologically cash hoarding" mentality. Ironically, what OP aunt think is not all wrong. But it doesn't fit very well to the big picture of the quote. Obsession in wealth hoarding is indeed the root of the government corruption, thus cause funds use to help minority in poverty vanish in the distribution channel. 

Exchange rates are NOT fix. It is volatile to the supply-demands during the trade. The stability is artificially buffered by various country policy maker stack of cache for each currency they hold. Unless particular currency are under heavy trade restriction, otherwise you will never be able to gain by introduce a "proxy currency". Money trades such as banks and money changer act as some sort of agent that connect buyer and seller, even though they keep a cache of currency for payout, they usually don't trade volatile currency, or slap an expensive trade fees to curb the risks. Nevertheless, in real work, a huge currency exchange can cheat their prominent customer during the trades by sneakily contact their counterpart trader, to jack up the agreeable rates to profit more from the marginal trade. But it is not easy as the world market will detect the fluctuation and supply will rush in. While in other extreme case is about international speculator that throw billions on short selling/future trade the currency(like commodities). I don't think OP is within that domain to perform such stunt. 

It depends on how you define "growth". Trade models have multiple goods in them, so there's no unique way to define "growth" - you are just moving along a fixed production possibility frontier. You can calculate nominal GDP, but then you have to come up with a measure of inflation so that you can deflate the nominal figure into something real. One of the results here is that if your economy which produces $ n $ goods has a production possibility frontier given by the zero set of a $ C^2 $ function $ Q : \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R $ (with the usual properties, i.e increasing in each coordinate and with positive definite Hessian at every point), then a simple application of the chain rule gives (here the $ dx $ notation denotes derivatives with respect to time, so we're assuming that the economy shifts continuously along the ppf instead of a unit step jump from one point to another - this assumption is important, otherwise we can't lose the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of $ Q $...) $$ 0 = dQ = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x_k} dx_k $$ if you're moving along the ppf, so that the value of $ Q $ is conserved. However, we also know from the first order conditions of producers in a competitive market that $$ \frac{\partial Q/\partial x_i}{\partial Q / \partial x_j} = \frac{p_i}{p_j} $$ where $ p_i, p_j $ are the nominal prices of good $ i $ and good $ j $ respectively. Substituting this into the above identity gives $$ 0 = \sum_{k=1}^n p_k dx_k $$ This is an important result: it says that if you calculate growth by looking at changes in production and hold the prices fixed, then you will detect no growth if the economy moves along a fixed production possibility frontier. Furthermore, this identity combined with the identity $$ NGDP = \sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k x_k $$ gives, using the product rule, that $$ d(\log(NGDP)) = \frac{1}{NGDP} \sum_{k=1}^n x_k d p_k = \textrm{GDP deflator} $$ In other words, if we deflate GDP by using the GDP deflator which is defined as the percent change in the price of a basket of goods weighted by the share of total production they represented in a given time period, we will measure zero RGDP growth so long as the economy remains along the same production possibility frontier $ Q(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = 0 $. The results hold true in autarky as well as in an environment of free trade, so in this sense free trade does not lead to "more growth", at least not due to the effects present in Heckscher-Ohlin. We can get away from this result if we choose to deflate nominal GDP by an alternative measure, but I think this should be enough illustration that you should be thinking about the welfare effects of trade and not about the "growth" effects. If you do come up with an appropriate notion of CPI inflation in a model, it will most likely be a "cost of living index" of the kind you find in Dixit-Stiglitz type models, so you will still indirectly be measuring welfare. The basic proof of the first welfare theorem carries over to the case of international free trade vs autarky, so under the usual assumptions (locally nonsatiated preferences and such) free trade outcomes are Pareto optimal, whereas autarky outcomes are in general not Pareto optimal. 

Housing is something subject to socio-economic events and policy, which may produce a variety of outcome. So this is not a simple "supply and demands" issue. First, somebody must afford the house, i.e. enough business and job activities to sustain house purchase. You can build tons of house in the middle of nowhere, but without a job nearby, nobody going to buy it. Second, a land is scarce, you cannot keep building houses/apartment on already used up land. Third, housing price can be speculated by subject to currency inflation. Fourth, there is housing ownership tax and policies to curb speculation. Fifth, Speculation on demands So you will see: - Hong Kong: expensive houses with builders monopoly, favourism and price fixing in place. - Germany: only scarce city center are expensive, suburban housing price is still stable. Little room for speculation. 

You can use conservative formula (interest rates x purchase cost)/write-off period + write off rates + operating cost + maintenance cost) / total usage Sometime you may need to add up tangible or intangible benefits. So in business, tools usage costing is not as simple as purchase and divide. 

(update) It is impossible to find example of institutional subsidies on monopoly subsidies that increase supply WITHOUT policy intervention. The argument of subsidies increase supplies is mostly bias argument. In fact, subsidies just increase the demands, make the good/services looks cheaper, which in fact has nothing to do with product efficiency. e.g. Many countries subsidies on utilities does not make production of electricity, water and gas more efficient. 

A rise in import and export can mean anything. For example, places like Hong Kong and Singapore, have extremely high import/export rate. Both both places are merely transit hub for neighbourhood area. Trade agreement may also increase both import and export dramatically. But there is a huge difference between an industrial country with the agricultural country; a highly advanced agricultural country versus a poor agricultural country. 

Falling oil prices may or may not lead to a lower price level depending on how you're measuring the price level and what measure of inflation the monetary authority is trying to target. Is the relevant inflation figure the GDP deflator? The PCE deflator? The CPI? The "core" CPI? Ignoring any nominal effects of falling oil prices if they exist at all, the mantra here is "never reason from a price change". Why is the price of oil falling? Is it because we've invented a new technology which allows us to synthesize oil at low cost, or is it because there was a recession in China which is leading to lower global demand? In the latter case, clearly the experience of the US and of China would be different. There's also the fact that higher productivity of the kind that would be caused by a new technology allowing easier production of oil may not necessarily translate into higher employment. In general, there are competing income and substitution effects in these situations - as you become wealthier you want to work less, but as wages are higher you want to work more. It's not clear a priori which effect would dominate. Finally, "unemployment" as used in "natural rate of unemployment" is meant to be a proxy for output gaps - if unemployment is higher than the "natural rate", then there's a negative output gap, and vice versa. In down-to-earth terms, we define "unemployment" as the state of not working but actively looking for a job, and the unemployment rate is the ratio of the number of such people to the size of the labor force. A change in the employment rate (the employment-to-population or employment-to-working age persons ratio) need not have any effect on the unemployment rate. Unemployment in a time of negligible output gaps is mostly the result of search frictions in the labor market. If a technological development made it easier to match potential employees with employers we would expect the "natural rate of unemployment" to fall, but it's not clear if or how an oil price change would lead to such an outcome. 

It is a gamble of randomness. (update) Extreme cases like Comcast and Enron show so call "public offering" are not immunized to information opacity and wrong doing. In addition, fake news, manipulation using various rumor mills or even human error may skew "market efficiency". In addition, so call "market analytical tools" are anything but hindsight self-fulfillment prophecy. Currently, there is little proof that so call market-analytical tools are able to produce reliable results when compare to solid information collected(e.g. whether the business is managed by competence hand ) 

It is difficult to what exposure that lead Lester B. Pearson giving out such statement, the quote itself is a metaphor. "people pathologically hoard so much cash that they impoverish the entire nation" does not apply directly to any "rich" person, but "people pathologically hoard so much cash". There is a few category of people that fit such criteria: 

One reason is to prevent hoarding bubbles. If there is such scheme, corporate start buying "asset" to avoid tax, which at the end, any "assets" with resales values will be hoarding items for those company. Even the asset subject to some tax during purchase. Repeating the cycle, the society will be full of unsold "assets", and company start trading this kind of "tax avoidance asset", and you start building up an "asset bubbles" similar to subprime loan + CDS swap disaster. In fact, such tax scheme are quite reasonable to convert asset as "cost" as incentive, and also to prevent hoarding behavior. If you believe in neo-liberalism jungle law economy that mentality, exploits will destroy capitalism long before any other crisis started. 

Let's talk about layman terms. Ambiguity is lack of explicit context. A cook are are given flours, eggs, sugar, salt, spices. If you ask the cook to "make food out of it", this is ambiguity. Uncertainty is random outcomes cause by ambiguous instruction/direction. E.g. Use above ambiguous instruction, the results can be a pasta, cakes, biscuit, charcoal, etc. The outcome is "uncertain". Risk is all possible tangible accessible "bad" outcome/events by probabilities associate to specific activities, depends on context. E.g. When you lies the flat ground, your chances of falling is low. But, that doesn't mean you can't fall : what if the earth below you break apart due to earthquake. (winks)
