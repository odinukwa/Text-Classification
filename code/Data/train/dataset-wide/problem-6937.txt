The reason the envelope theorem cannot be simply applied here, is becase $z(t,w)$, which consists of $l(t,w)$ and $e(t,w)$, does not only depend on $t$. It is true that these functions are optimized and first order conditions apply such that their total derivatives equal zero. However, since they are optimized with respect to two variables, we cannot necessarily set the partial derivatives with respect to t to zero. At first glance, it appears the answer should be $\frac{dW}{dt}= -(z + tz_t) + v'*(z + tz_t)$, as $l$ and $e$ are chosen optimally and the envelope theorem cancels these terms out. Furthermore, one could expect both $z_t$ terms in the final derivative to drop out due to the envelope theorem. However, one and only one $z_t$ term remains in the authors' calculations. The envelope theorem is just an application of first order conditions. In this case, it is better to simply use the first order conditions we know to derive the results, instead of using the theorem directly. I believe the authors invoke the term "envelope property" to concisely convey that they are using the previously found first order conditions. Taking the total derivative we arrive at: $\frac{dW}{dt}= wl_t -z - tz_t -c_ee' - \psi'l_t + v'*(z + tz_t)$ Inserting the expression for $z_t$ and grouping some terms we have: $\frac{dW}{dt}= l_t[w(1-t)-\psi'] + e'[t-c_e] - z + v'*(z + tz_t)$ Note that the terms in square brackets are the same as the first order conditions for $l$ and $e$ and hence equal to zero. This leaves us with: $\frac{dW}{dt}= - z + v'*(z + tz_t)$ 

Note that if you produce stuff you need to store it somewhere, which comes at a cost. This is explicitly included in the EPQ model via the holding cost variable 

In contrast with the previous system, the exchange is artificially maintained fixed by the government. The way they do it is pegging the local currency to a foreign currency (say USD) and compensate the supply/demand in order to keep the exchange fixed. A good example of this system was the Chinese Yuan, when the local demand of USD increased, the government had to release US Dollar into the market in order to mitigate the fluctuation In the curve bellow I show the exchange CHY/USD, you can immediately see that in the period 1998-2005 (for instance) the Yuan was pegged to the Dollar 

It is not very clear what you're asking, but if the model is of the form $$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i \tag{1} $$ Then the sample regression function (SRF) $$ \hat{y}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i \tag{2} $$ indeed only considers one value of $x_i$ at the time. If you have a situation in which several observations $y$ are associated with the same value $x_i$, then a linear model is perhaps not appropriate for describing your data 

In this system the rate is fixed by supply/demand. Roughly speaking: a currency is worth whatever buyers are willing to pay for it. So, for example if (for some reason) many people in US are buying Euro (EU) then the demand increases, and so will the price, the rate USD/EU will drop and you will get fewer Euro for each US Dollar. Conversely, for Europeans the Dollar will depreciate as more USD were supplied to the market. Usually countries with very mature/estable currencies have these systems (e.g. Canada, Switzerland, United States), allowing the exchange rate to adjust itself to local conditions (inflation, supply, demand, $\dots$). Although this may sound great, it actually has its drawbacks, for instance, lack of certainty may refrain some investors. One may argue that the fact that the economy is stable in these countries, then we're indeed certain of what's going to happen before an investment, but I guess that's a whole other story. Below there's a graph of the evolution of the exchange rate for the Swiss Franc to USD 

I would highly recommend Blanchard's Macroeconomics, especially for the short and medium run. Another book to look at, especially for the long run and growth is Burda and Wyplosz (2012) 

There is no universal definition of a modified IS-LM framework. There are several modifications out there. Some such modifications include adjusting the model to capture the last financial crisis or opening the economy with the BP curve as you said, or kore explicitly considering the role of banks. Another modification is the IS-MP model, which represents a more realistic version of monetary policy. 

Let $C(y)$ denote the cost function and $y$ the quantity. The average cost function is $AC=C/y$. This is increasing if its derivative is positive. Let $C'$ denote the derivative of $C$. The marginal cost function is $MC=C'$. We have: $\frac{\partial AC}{\partial y}= \frac{C'y - C}{y^2}>0$ by using the quotient rule. As $y^2>0$, the condition becomes: $C'y - C>0$. Rearranging yields: $C' > C/y$ Hence: $MC>AC$. 

I assume you are referring to first generation currency crisis models, a la Krugman. Before t0: Here there is of course no benefit to attacking and causing a currency crisis (by definition). That is, before the pegged currency is overpriced (i.e. it is not overpriced) there is no profit from attacking/short selling the currency as a drop in the value of the currency is not expected and therefore short selling is not profitable. So before it is profitable to cause a crisis there can be no crisis. After t0: It would be profitable to cause a crisis and short sell a currency as long as it has not happened yet. However perfectly rational agents would react immediately, why wait? Like with investing in stocks, once you find a mispriced stock, you can profit anytime, but why wouldn't you profit immediately? Or lets say you find 100USD on the ground. You can profit from picking it up anytime after you find it, but why wait and risk that it could be too late later? Hence it happens exactly at t0 as there is no reason to wait. An investor in currency would try to be faster than others to get arbitrage profits so others would try to be even faster than him and this goes on as much as possible. Its not possible to attack before (as its not possible to pick up 100USD found on the ground before its found there) so it happens as soon as it is possible, i.e. in t0. In a second generation crisis a la Obstfeld it would take a coordination of several investors attacking at once to cause the crisis, so you don't have the effect of everyone trying to be faster than the other as they must "work together" to be successful and thus the time of the attack/crisis is not so straightforward to predict. 

Eq. (2.64) can be written as (at first order) $$ k_{t+1} - k^* = \lambda (k_t - k^*) \tag{1a} $$ Define the quantity $\kappa_t$ as $$ \kappa_t \stackrel{\rm def}{=} k_t - k^* \tag{2} $$ So that $$ \kappa_{t+1} = \lambda \kappa_t \tag{1b} $$ This can be solved very easy by realizing that \begin{eqnarray} \kappa_1 &=&\lambda \kappa_0 \\ \kappa_2 &=&\lambda \kappa_1 = \lambda(\lambda\kappa_0) = \lambda^2\kappa_0 \\ &\vdots& \\ \kappa_t &=& \lambda^t \kappa_0 \tag{3} \end{eqnarray} So the dynamics is $\kappa$ is driven by the value $\lambda^t$. You can see that if $\lambda = 1$ then $\lambda^t=\lambda$ for each $t$ and $\kappa$ remains constant. However, if $\lambda > 1$ the values $k^t$ will become increasingly large (explodes) as $t$ increases, that is $$ \lim_{t\to \infty} \kappa_t \stackrel{\lambda > 1}{=} \infty $$ Similarly $$ \lim_{t\to \infty} \kappa_t \stackrel{0< \lambda < 1}{=} 0 $$ 

$\newcommand{\vect}[1]{{\bf #1}}$ Note that you can write the system in the form $$ \dot{\vect{x}} = A \vect{x} + \vect{b} $$ where $$ \vect{x} = \left(\begin{array}{c} x \\ y\end{array}\right), ~~~~ A = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 1 \\ 2 & -1\end{array}\right), ~~~~~ \vect{b} = \left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 5\end{array}\right) $$ A fixed point $\vect{x}^*$ is a point for which $A\vect{x}^* + \vect{b} = 0$, which in this case is $$ \vect{x}^* = \left(\begin{array}{c} -2 \\ 1\end{array}\right) $$ Now define the variable $$ \vect{z} = \vect{x} - \vect{x}^* $$ and note that $$ \dot{\vect{z}} = \dot{\vect{x}} = A\vect{x} + \vect{b} = A\vect{x} - A\vect{x}^* = A(\vect{x} - \vect{x}^*) = A\vect{z} $$ That is, $$ \dot{\vect{z}} = A \vect{z} $$ What you need to do now is to find the eigen-decomposition of $A$ 

If there are different companies offering with different prices, but not so many companies that it is perfect competition, then it is monopolistic and not a monopoly. 

For your first question, it is hard to say whether your graphs are valid, as you are more or less assuming random functional forms. More accurate graphs would derive the functions based on utility maximization of the taxpayer. Furthermore, you are wrong to think the validity of the Laffer curve depends on a perfect bell shape. The Laffer curve simply states that the revenue maximizing tax rate is less than 100%, i.e. there are tax rates where lowering the tax can increase revenue. The Laffer curve can more accurately be derived without explicit functional forms: 

In that case you would still have a problem showing the existence of a solution. Without existence, it makes little sense to think about uniqueness. The reason a continuous utility function (implied by some of those preference assumptions you gave) has a maximum at all is because a continuous function achieves a maximum somewhere on a compact set, which in this case is B. Luckily, we don't really have to imagine scenarios in which we have no information about the budget set. This is not some abstract set, but rather something very concretely defined as: $B(p,w)=\{x \in \Bbb R_{+}^{n}: px \leq w \}$, where $p$ is the price vector, $x$ is the demand, $w$ is the budget and $n$ is the dimension of the vector. Luckily, this is always compact. So, no, you cannot show there is a unique solution, because in that case you can't show there is a solution in the first place (using standard tools). However, you are correct in thinking that uniqueness itself does not hinge upon the compactness of the budget set. 

Technically you are changing the BDT/USD exchange rate, or at least you're one of the reasons. If supply/demand changes, the value of a particular currency is going to change as well. But there are other factors, interest rates and political climate also affects the rate. To give you an example, Venezuela is now going through some rough times, perhaps not many people are willing to buy their local currency (VEF) today because tomorrow it may be not be worth the original investment, as as consequence the exchange rate BDT/VEF will increase: you can buy a lot of Venezuelan Bolivar with a few Taka. Each county then has its own policy to set exchange rates, basically there are two of them 

Linear regression, despite its simplicity, it is actually a very powerful tool. That's why it's everywhere in econometrics, to give you an example you're maybe familiar with, consider an auto-regressive model, turns out you can write the future state of a variable that follows this model as a linear combination of previous states $$ X_t = C + \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \phi_2 X_{t-2} + \cdots + \phi_p X_{t-p} + \eta_t \tag{1} $$ so, if you know the weights $\{\phi_k \}_{k=1}^p$ you can predict what's going to be the future values of $X$. The interesting part is that these numbers are obtained through linear regression: just call $y = X_t$, $x_1 = X_{t-1}, x_2 = X_{t-2},\cdots$ and realize Eq. (1) can be written as $$ y = C + \phi_1 x_1 + \phi_2 x_2 + \cdots + \phi_p x_p + \epsilon \tag{2} $$ In this sense linear regression can be used for forecasting. But there are other tools, I will link you to this other thread where you can get an idea on how neuronal networks can be used for this task: forecasting time series. But forecasting can also be done with a plethora of methods: support vector machines are popular choices. 

There are no major models that come to the conclusion that idiosyncratic risk can drive positive returns. The reason is that idiosyncratic risk is diversifiable. The models, however, do in fact consider idiosyncractic risk. The theories don't forget or ignore them. It just turns out that this risk doesn't matter. In this sense, CAPM actually does consider idiosyncratic risk. In this model, if you are perfectly rational, you will diversify your portfolio to minimize risk. This leads you to hold the whole market portfolio, in which case idiosyncratic risks are diversified away in your portfolio and therefore no longer matter. In simple terms, market risk then is not diversifiable, because once you hold the market portfolio, there's no way to diversify further. What drives returns are risk, but rational investors can remove the idiosyncratic risk through diversification. Hence, what matters for returns in the CAPM therefore is just the market risk (which you refered to as systemic risk, but that term actually means something else). That's why under CAPM, the returns are driven by the asset correlation with the market. EDIT: The CAPM model does not put any explicit assumptions on the number of assets available, hence the model does not require an infinite number of assets. However, the derivation is based on the decision to add an asset to an already well-diversified portfolio, i.e. adding an asset to the market portfolio. Nevertheless, if only a handful of assets exist, then it might not be possible to diversify away all idiosyncratic risk. In that case, the CAPM does not work, because it implicity assumes enough assets exist, since it assumes a well-diversified portfolio exists to which you can add an asset. In such a case idiosyncratic risk may become relevant. Such considerations are unlikely to be relevant in practice though. It is difficult to put a number on how many assets are necessary for idiosyncratic risk to be diversified away completely. Often, a number that is mentioned is 30-40 assets. The number required in practice is usually very realistic and far below infinity. The number of assets required for idiosyncratic risk to be completely diversified away becomes larger if assets are more correlated with each other or very volatile. Lastly, an asset with such high idiosyncratic risk that no investor would want to add it to their portfolio cannot exist in equilibrium, because supply of the asset could never equal demand. 

After 2005 the model is changed, and they decide the exchange rate from a basket of external currencies. 

I have used gambit (python) in the past and could recommend it. It also includes a small GUI which makes things very intuitive. R also has GameTheory if you prefer this platform instead 

In practice all governments make local decisions to modify the exchange rates, for instance to help import/exports they can slightly provide supply/demand so that the rate is modified. 

You're right. Divide Eq (1) by Eq (2): $$ \frac{a L^{a-1}K^b}{bL^aK^{b-1}} = \frac{aK}{bL} = \frac{w}{r} ~~~\Rightarrow~~~ L = \frac{ar}{bw}K \tag{4} $$ Now use this in Eq. (3) $$ C = wL + rK = \left(\frac{a}{b} + 1\right)rK ~~~\Rightarrow~~~ K = \frac{C}{r(a/b + 1)} \tag{5} $$ Replace this in Eq. (4) to get $L$ 

I guess you already went trough the algebra below, but just for context, the problem you're trying to solve is $$ \max_{c}\sum_{t=0}^{+\infty}\beta^t u(c_t) \\ \text{s.t.}~~ f(k_t) + (1- \delta)k_t = c_t + k_{t+1} \tag{1} $$ where $f(k_t) = k_t^\alpha$ and $$ u(c_t) = \frac{c_t^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} - 1 \tag{2} $$ The problem in (1) can be cast into the two coupled equations \begin{eqnarray} u'(c_t) &=& \beta[1 + f'(k_{t+1}) - \delta]u'(c_{t+1}) \\ k_{t+1} &=& f(k_t) + (1-\delta)k_t - c_t \tag{3} \end{eqnarray} where $u'(x) = x^{-\gamma}$, and $f'(x) = \alpha x^{\alpha-1}$. These first of Eqns. (3) can be inverted to obtain an expression for $c_{t+1}$ in terms of $(k_t,c_t)$, leading to \begin{eqnarray} c_{t+1} &=& \beta^{1/\gamma}c_t [1 + \alpha[k_t^\alpha + (1-\delta)k_t - c_t]^{\alpha-1} - \delta]^{1/\gamma} \\ k_{t+1} &=& f(k_t) + (1-\delta)k_t - c_t \tag{4} \end{eqnarray} Which can be expressed as $$ {\bf x}_{t+1} = {\bf F}({\bf x}_{t})~~~\mbox{with}~~~ {\bf x}_t = \left(\begin{array}{c}c_{t}\\k_{t}\end{array}\right) \tag{5} $$ A fixed point ${\bf x}^*$ of the map ${\bf F}$ is such that $$ {\bf x}^* = {\bf F}({\bf x}^*) \tag{6} $$ that is, a point for which the system does not evolve. If you use $\gamma=2$, $\beta=0.9964$, $\alpha=0.36$, $\delta=0.025$ this point is (found by solving Eq. (6)), $$ {\bf x}^* = \left(\begin{array}{c}c^*\\k^*\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}2.84829\\52.2808\end{array}\right) \tag{7} $$ which is clearly different from zero! You can linearize ${\bf F}$ around ${\bf x}^*$ and write the result as $$ {\bf y}_{t+1} = {\bf J}{\bf y}_t ~~~\mbox{where}~~~ {\bf y}_t = {\bf x}_{t} - {\bf x}^*, ~~~ {\bf J} = \left.\frac{\partial{\bf J}}{\partial {\bf x}}\right|_{{\bf x} = {\bf x}^*} \tag{8} $$ Is this last system the one that has a saddle point at ${\bf y} = 0$ 

Competitiveness simply means how expensive goods of a country are when compared. To correctly compare we would need to transform everything into a(ny) single currency. To do this correctly we need two elements: a) the actual price of the good and b) its exchange rate. If a country has higher inflation, then nominal prices increase, the goods are more expensive, less desirable and therefore due to (a) competitiveness decreases. However over time purchasing power partiy (called PPP) holds. If it holds (typically does in the long run) then due to higher inflation in a country, the currency will likely lose value (depreciate) and competitiveness will increase due to (b), in which case it will eventually cancel the aforementioned effect (a) in which case your confusion is completely justified, there should be no effect. However since PPP does not always hold and especially not immediately, higher inflation reduces competitiveness. 

Tax revenue at a tax rate of 0 s 0. At a tax rate of zero, tax revenue must be increasing with the tax. A small marginal tax increase does not encourage the worker from generating income, if we evaluate his first order conditon (optimization problem) at a tax of zero. Tax revenue at a tax of 100% or more is also zero. A household that dislikes labor and gets no net income from labor will not work.
