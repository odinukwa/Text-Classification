It is shown in "On claw-free t-perfect graphs" by Bruhn and Stein that indeed $\lceil \chi'_f(G) \rceil = \chi'(G)$ holds for claw-free $h$-perfect graphs, see corollary $16$. This also holds for $h$-perfect line-graphs and $t$-perfect claw-free graphs, see the paper of Benchetrit, Theorem $3$ and Theorem $4$. However, Benchetrit says that it does not hold for $h$-perfect graphs in general (see the remark with references after Theorem $4$). So there are counterexamples (by Laurent and Seymour in 2003). 

If $L$ is a solvable Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, then the two invariants $$ \alpha(L) = \max \{\dim (\mathfrak{a}) \mid \mathfrak{a} \text{ is an abelian subalgebra of }L\},\\ \beta(L) = \max \{\dim (\mathfrak{b}) \mid \mathfrak{b} \text{ is an abelian ideal of }L\}. $$ coincide, see Proposition $2.6$ here. For an ideal, the question is easier to decide than for a subalgebra. However in general, to decide whether or not there is an abelian subalgebra of given dimension in $L$ the algorithms mentioned use Gröbner bases in one or the other way. On the other hand, for semisimple Lie algebras the maximal dimension of an abelian subalgebra is known, see the article "Abelian ideals in a Borel subalgebra of a complex simple Lie algebra" by R. Suter (2004) and the paper cited above. There it is also proved that the maximal dimension of an abelian ideal in the standard Borel subalgebra $B$ of a simple Lie algebra $L$ coincides with the maximal dimension of a commutative subalgebra of $L$. 

If the associated Lie algebra $A^{-}$ is nilpotent, then the question what $rad(A^{-})=A^{-}$ can be, seems related to the question, which nilpotent Lie algebras admit an associative algebra structure (where the Lie bracket is given by $[x,y]=x\cdot y-y\cdot x$ with some associative bilinear product $x\cdot y$ on the vector space). Let $G$ be a connected and simply connected Lie group. If $G$ admits a left-invariant and right-invariant affine structure, then its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ admits an associative algebra structure. If $G$ admits a left-invariant affine structure, then $\mathfrak{g}$ admits a so-called left-symmetric algebra structure. It is known that not all nilpotent Lie algebras admit an associative algebra structure. In fact, not even all nilpotent Lie algebras admit a left-symmetric algebra structure. Such examples have been given by Y. Benoist in his paper Une nilvariété non affine. See also the paper Affine structures on nilmanifolds. 

As we all know, for any homogeneous space $G/H$ we have that the equivariant vector bundles over $G/H$ are characterized by the representations of $H$. Thus, for the the complex projective line $CP^1 \simeq SU(2)/U(1)$, it must hold that all its line bundles are indexed by the integers $L_k$, for $k \in Z$, and more generally, its rank-$k$ (equivarian) vector bundles are of the form $$ L_{\bf z} = L_{z_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus L_{z_k}, {\text ~~~ for ~~~ } {\bf z} \in Z^k. $$ Does this then extend to all the total flag manifolds $F(n)$, ie the spaces of the form $$ F(n) := SU(n)/(U(1)^{\otimes n-1}). $$ Edit: I omitted the word equivariant by mistake and have now entered it as (equivariant) 

Let $M$ be a Kahler manifold, with metric $g$, fundamental form $\omega$, and dual Lefschetz operator $\Lambda$. Now $\Lambda$, and contraction with $\omega$, both map the two forms $\Omega^2(M)$ to $0$-forms, ie smooth functions. Are they equal? I think this is almost certainly true, but I can't see a clean argument. Do I need Kahler here? I would guess this works for all complex manifolds. 

For the real Grassmannian Gr$(N,k)$ we have the well-known isomorphism $$ \text{Gr}(N,k) = O(N)/(O(k) \times O(N-k)) $$ For the complex case, we have $$ \text{Gr}(N,k) = U(N)/(U(k) \times U(N-k)) $$ I would like to know if anything like this holds in the finite field setting, ie can the finite field Grassmannians be described as a homogeneous space of an algebraic group over a finite field, or something like this? 

Let $M$ be a smooth homogeneous $G$-space for a Lie group $G$, and let $J$ be a $G$-invariant almost-complex structure for $M$. Do there exist succinct sufficient (and neccessary) conditions for $J$ to be integrable? Besides the six sphere, what other examples of a non-integrable invariant almost-complex structure for a smooth homogeneous space are there? Do there exist non-integrable almost-complex structures for any flag manifolds? 

I can't see any qualifiers preceding or succeeding the statement. Am I missing something obvious here, or is this just plain wrong? Do there not exists kernels of coalgebra maps that are not coideals? 

I am not an expert, but I do not think so. The proofs I have seen use Dirichlet series $f(x)=\sum_{n\le x} a_n n^{-s}$, with $S(x)=\sum_{n\le x}a_n$, to consider $$ s^{-1}f(s)=\int_1^{\infty} S(x)x^{-s-1}dx. $$ This leads to information on sign changes of $\sum_{i=1}^N a_n$. For the $\mu$-function, this gives of course $f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu (s)n^{-s}=(\zeta(s))^{-1}$, and the formula $$ (s\zeta(s))^{-1}- C(s-\lambda)^{-1} =\int_1 ^{\infty} \lbrace M(x)-Cx^{\lambda}\rbrace x^{-s-\lambda}dx. $$ For details on the notations and the precise arguments see "OSCILLATION THEOREMS OF ARITHMETICAL FUNCTIONS" by Emil Grosswald from $1967$. I have the feeling that every (sufficently) non-trivial statement on $\mu(n)$ will always involve $\zeta(s)$, directly or indirectly. Update: Of course one should mention here the reference of Odlyzko and te Riele, "Disproof of the Mertens Conjecture", which contains many more informations on the behavior of $M(x)$, which is in fact determined by the zeros of the zeta function. They refer to the following reference: J. Pintz, Oscillatory properties of $M(x)$, Acta Arith. 43 (1984), 105-113. 

The Killing-Hopf theorem (yes, Hopf is already dead). The ugly duckling theorem. The no free lunch theorem. The Cox-Zucker machine. 

The subclass of nilpotent Lie algebras formed by arbitrary ideals of parabolic subalgebras consisting of nilpotent elements in reductive Lie algebras has been classifed in the article Yu.B. Khakimdzhanov, "Standard subalgebras of reductive Lie algebras" Vestn. Moskov. Univ. Mat. Mekh. : 6 (1974) pp. 49–55 (In Russian) (English abstract). I have not seen the paper, but it seems to me that the nilpotent Lie algebras arising this way are somewhat special. For example, they are graded by positive integers. This excludes already all characteristically nilpotent Lie algebras, i.e., those nilpotent Lie algebras having only nilpotent derivations. Edit: For the question on free nilpotent Lie algebras: Tamaru has proved in 2007 that the nilradical of any parabolic subalgebra of a (real) semisimple Lie algebra is a so-called Einstein nilradical (A nilpotent Lie algebra which can be a nilradical of a standard Einstein metric solvable Lie algebra is called an Einstein nilradical. ). However, a free $p$-step nilpotent Lie algebra on $m$ generators can only be an Einstein nilradical if (a) $p=1,2$, or (b) $p=3$, $m=2,3,4,5$, (c) $p=4$ and $m=2$ or (d) $p=5$ and $m=2$. This is due to Y.Nikolayevsky, see $URL$ So this already excludes most free nilpotent Lie algebras, and I suspect that one can exclude further cases by investigating Khakimdzhanov's classification. 

I'm trying to learn about the Lefschetz decomposition but am having a very basic problem: For the fundamental form $K$ of a Kahler metric on a complex manifold $M$, the corresponding Lefschetz operator $L$ is defined by $$ L:\Omega^k(M) \to \Omega^{k+2}(M), ~~~~~~~ \omega \mapsto K \wedge \omega. $$ From basic exterior algebra we must have $K \wedge K = 0$. Thus, to my eyes, we should have $$ L^2(\omega) = L(K \wedge \omega) = K \wedge (K \wedge \omega) = (K \wedge K) \wedge \omega = 0 \wedge \omega = 0. $$ However, the repeated Lefschetz operator is a central feature in Kahler theory. What am I missing? 

Given a noncommutative ring $R$, and two (left) $R$-modules $M$ and $N$, how does one define a left action on the the vector space tensor product $M \otimes N$? Multiplying on just the first factor of the tensor product seems a little unnatrual, but I can't see what else to do. 

For $H$ a Hopf algebra, let $V$ be a right $H$-comodule with coaction $\Delta_R$. Moreover, let $W$ be a subspace of $V$ such that $\Delta_R(W) \subseteq W \otimes H$, and note that this implies that $\Delta_R$ restricts to a coaction $V/W \to V/W \otimes H$. If we denote, $$ V^H := \lbrace v \in V ~ | ~ \Delta_R(v) = v \otimes 1 \rbrace, $$ and analagously $$ (V/W)^H := \lbrace [v] \in V/W) ~ | ~ \Delta_R([v]) = [v] \otimes 1 \rbrace, $$ where $[v]$ denotes the coset of $v$, and $\pi:V \to V/W$ be the canonical projection, then when do we have $$ \pi(V^H) = (V/W)^H? $$ 

Let $A$ be a not neccessarily commutative algebra, and let $B \subset A$ be a subalgebra of $A$. Moreover, let $M$ be an $A$-bimodule, and let $N \subset M$ be a $B$-sub-bimodule. The tensor product $N \otimes_{B} N$ has a natural inclusion in $M \otimes_{A} M$, and it seems to me that this inclusion should be injective, but I can't prove it. Am I right here, or does one need to make extra assumptions? Is there a clean/non-messy way to prove all this? The question boils down to showing that $$ (N \otimes_B N) \cap \lbrace m_1a \otimes m_2 - m_1 \otimes am_2 | m_i \in M\, a \in A \rbrace. $$ is equal to $$ \lbrace n_1b \otimes n_2 - m_1 \otimes bm_2 | n_i \in N,b \in B \rbrace. $$ But I can't see how to do this. 

For a Lie group $G$ let $EG \to BG$ denote the universal bundle. A Lie group homomorphism $\rho: G \to H$ determines a map $B \rho: BG \to BH$ as the classifying map for the principal $H$-bundle $EG \times_\rho H \to BG$. While this argument yields existence of $B \rho$ (and uniqueness up to homotopy) it is far from being explicit. Does there exist a true construction of $B \rho$? If $\rho$ is a embedding of a subgroup, then on gets the classifying map by a quotient procedure. I was hoping for a similar result for arbitrary group homomorphism. Assume anything you want on $H$ (compactness ect). 

2) Wurzbacher [2] says that $\Lambda^k M$ is a vector bundle because every continuous linear map $T: E \rightarrow E$ maps bounded to bounded sets. Where is this fact needed?

Does there exists a symplectic formulation of statistical physics? I know that thermodynamics can be written in a symplectic language and of course classical mechanics is intrinsically formulated symplectic, but I do not know anything which tries to relate them 'symplectilly'. Partial results are also welcome! 

If you take the compact-open ($C^\infty$) topology (instead of the Whitney one), then you have continuity/smoothness of the evaluation map and the following exponential laws $$ C(M \times N, P) = C(M, C(N, P)) $$ $$ C^\infty(M \times N, R) = C^\infty(M, C^\infty(N, R)) $$ if $N$ is a (locally compact) manifold without boundary, $M$ and $P$ are manifolds and $R$ is a vector space (possibly infinite-dimensional). In particular, for a compact manifold $N$ the above exponential laws also hold for the Whitney topology (which of course coincides with the compact-open topology in this case). More details can be found for example in some lecture notes by H. Glöckner. Also Michor's "Convienient Calculus" book contains a discussion of these matters but there a different topology on the space of smooth maps is used.
