So, what is $P$? I'll first do it with $\pi_P(n)$ having the correct growth, then I'll add in the more refined $\pi_P(n, r,m)$'s. Divide $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ up into intervals $[a_0, a_1) \sqcup [a_1, a_2) \sqcup \cdots$ where $a_0=1$ and $a_{k+1} = a_k + \sqrt{a_k} + O(1)$ where the $O(1)$ is some absolute cnstant bound for how much error we will permit (I think $2$ would work). Choose a subsequence $b_j$ of the $a_i$ such that $b_1=a_1$ and $b_{i+1} \geq 2 b_i$. We will make sure that none of the $b_i$ are in $P+P$. Don't put any elements of $[a_0, a_1)$ into $P$. That ensures that $b_1=a_1$ is not in $P+P$. We now inductively construct $[a_k, a_{k+1}) \cap P$. Suppose that we have already constructed the part of $P$ in $\bigcup_{i < k} [a_i, a_{i+1})$, and that $P+P$ does not contain any $b_j$. Let $b_j$ be the unique $b$ such that $b_{j-1} \leq a_k < a_{k+1} \leq b_j$. When adding elements of $[a_k, a_{k+1})$ to $P$, we can't make a sum of the form $b_{j'}$ with $j' < j$, because $b_{j'}< a_k$. And we can't make a sum $b_{j''}$ with $j' > j$, because $b_{j''} > 2 b_j \geq a_{k+1} + a_{k+1}$. So our only concern is that we might create the sum $b_j$. Choose $\sqrt{a_k}/\log a_k+O(1)$ elements of $[a_k, a_{k+1})$ to put into $P$, subject to the sole condition that we don't make $b_j$ land in $P+P$. Again, the $O(1)$ is a once and for all global choice. In order to avoid creating this sum, we must avoid putting in $b_j - p$, where $p$ is an element of $P$ lying in an interval of length $[\sqrt{a_k}]$. The size of $P \cap [x, x+L]$ is $\approx L/\log(x+L) \leq L/\log L$. So we have to avoid $\sqrt{a_k}/\log \sqrt{a_k} = 2 \sqrt{a_k}/\log a_k$ things, while choosing $\sqrt{a_k}/\log a_k$ things, all from an interval of length $\sqrt{a_k}$. Since $\log a_k$ is eventually bigger than $3$, this is not a problem. Now, let's do this while, at the same time, making sure that the $\pi_P(n, r,m)$ grow correctly. This time, make sure to take the $b_j$ to be even, since you won't be impressed if they are odd. The $O(1)$ in the defining recursion for the $a$'s gives me enough room to make sure lots of $a$'s are even, so that's fine. This time, we are going to require that, in addition, for every $m$, we have $(\sqrt{a_k}/\log a_k)/\phi(m!)+O(1)$ elements of $P \cap [a_k, a_{k+1})$ in each invertible residue class modulo $m!$. Note that, for $m$ large, the $O(1)$ swamps the first term, so this condition is trivial. So for each $k$, this is in fact finitely many conditions to obey. And, since $\log a_k$ does eventually get larger than $3 \phi(m!)$, this should be doable. There is a lot of unchecked material here; I welcome corrections and citations. 

It seems to me that this statement is an incidence theorem. It is true in $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and false in $\mathbb{CP}^2$, both of which obey Pappus theorem. I learned this example from Kiran Kedlaya. To see this over $\mathbb{R}$, note that a counterexample to this claim is also a counterexample to the Sylvester-Gallai theorem. Over $\mathbb{C}$, the flexes of any cubic curve form a counter-example, as discussed on the above linked Wikipedia page. More precisely, I believe that the claim is true in $K\mathbb{P}^2$ if and only if $K$ does not contain a root of $x^2+x+1$. 

Proof: Write $H$ for the filled in hexagon. So $H^3$ is a $6$-dimensional polytope in $\mathbb{R}^6$. There is a linear map $\pi: H^3 \to \mathbb{R^2}$ sending $(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3) \to (x_1+x_2+x_3, y_1+y_2+y_3)$. The (ordinary) support of $f \ast f \ast f$ is the image of $\pi$, and the values of the convolution are the $4$-dimensional volumes of the fibers of $\pi$. Now, as $z$ varies through $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\pi^{-1}(z)$ is a four dimensional polytope. Generically, changing $z$ will just slide the defining facets of $\pi^{-1}(z)$ parallel to themselves. The volume of a polytope with fixed facet normals is a polynomial (degree $4$ in this case) in the positions of those facets, hence smooth. When do singularities occur? When the combinatorics of $\pi^{-1}(z)$ changes. This happens when $5$ facets of $\pi^{-1}(z)$ pass through a common vertex. (Since these are $5$ hyperplanes in $4$-space, it doesn't happen generically.) Back in the big $6$ dimensional polytope $H^3$, this is the same as saying that $z$ lies below a point of $H^3$ which is on $5$ facets -- in other words, $z$ lies below an edge of $H^3$. That's the condition I have above. Now, if $z$ only lay below one edge of $H^3$, I could write down the singularity introduced by that edge and show that $f \ast f \ast f$ is indeed singular there. Instead, most points which are below some edge of $H^3$ are below many edges, so I can't guarantee the singularities don't cancel. But I don't expect them to. 

No. Take k[t] and invert countably many relatively prime polynomials. This obeys all of your adjectives (localization preserves noetherianness, the others are obvious.) However, a ring of global sections must be a subring of some finitely generated k-algebra. (I pointed this out in the last discussion.) Hence, its unit group must be a subgroup of the group of units of a finitely generated k-algebra. If A is any finitely generated k-algebra, then Units(A)/Units(k) is a finitely generated abelian group, and thus can't contain the countably generated group of the above example. I can't find a reference for the fact about Units(A)/Units(k) at the moment, Tevelev describes this as well known. 

Regarding the question about higher dimensions, Scholl showed that RH in all dimensions follows from the statement: 

Actually, what I really want is the corresponding statement in the category of crystals, so "at $q=0$". What this turns into concretely is that there is a bijection between 

I agree with Tom G in the case of hyperelliptic curves. Interestingly, I think the bound for a general curve of degree $g$ should be $d = (3/4)g+3$. More specifically, the Brill-Noether theorem tells us that, for this $d$, there is a line bundle with $\dim H^0(X, L) =4$. I would guess (but don't know a reference) that, for generic $X$, this line bundle gives an embedding $X \to \mathbb{P}^3$. 

No. Let $k = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-17})$. The class group of $k$ is $\mathbb{Z}/4 \mathbb{Z}$, generated by $\langle 3, 1+\sqrt{-17} \rangle$. (I checked this table for a field of class number $4$ and then checked that $\langle 3, 1+\sqrt{-17} \rangle$ and $\langle 3, 1+\sqrt{-17} \rangle^2$ are not principal. To do this, note that $a^2+17 b^2=3$ is not solvable in integers, and $a^2+17 b^2=9$ only has the solution $(\pm 3, 0)$.) Let $L$ be the class field of $k$. The only fields between $L$ and $k$ are $L$, $k$ and an intermediate quadratic extension $K$, corresponding to the three subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}/4 \mathbb{Z}$. But $k(\sqrt{-1})$ is abelian and unramified, so $K$ must be $k(\sqrt{-1})$. Thus, all nontrivial extensions of $k$ within $L$ contain a root of unity. 

$\def\fg{\mathfrak{g}}\def\cU{\mathcal{U}}\def\cT{\mathcal{T}}\def\tD{\widetilde{\Delta}}$Here is an argument Noah Snyder showed me back in grad school, which proves PBW in characteristic zero on the assumption that $\fg$ has a faithful representation. Ado's theorem says that every Lie algebra has a faithful finite dimensional representation, but here we don't need finite dimensionality -- just any vector space at all on which $\fg$ acts without kernel. For example, if $\fg$ is the Lie algebra of a group $G$, we can take the action on $C^{\infty}(G)$; if $\fg$ is given to us as a space of $n \times n$ matrices we can use the action on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $\cU(\fg)$ be the universal enveloping algebra and let $\cT(\fg)$ be the tensor algebra. Let $\tD : \cT(\fg) \to \cT(\fg) \otimes \cT(\fg)$ be the unique map of rings with $\tD(v) = v \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes v$ for $v \in \fg$. (In the ring structure on $\cT$, the factors $1 \otimes \cT$ and $\cT \otimes 1$ commute.) We can check directly from the defining relations that $\tD$ descends to a map $\Delta: \cU(\fg) \to \cU(\fg) \otimes \cU(\fg)$. (This is the Hopf coproduct.) Let $S(\fg) \subset \cT(\fg)$ be the symmetric tensors. We want to prove the composition $S(\fg) \to \cT(\fg)\to \cU(\fg)$ is injective. We show by induction on $n$ that this map is injective on $S_{\leq n}(\fg)$ -- the space of symmetric tensors of degree $\leq n$. The inductive step is fine. Suppose (for contradiction) that $f$ is a nonzero element of the kernel, and $f \in S_{\leq n}$. Set $g:=\tD(f) - f \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes f$. Then $g \in S_{\leq n-1} \otimes S_{\leq n-1}$. And, if $n \geq 2$, then $g$ is nonzero. Checking the latter uses that we are in characteristic zero in order to make sure that certain binomial coeffcients are nonzero; for example, if the characteristic were $p$ then, for $v \in \fg$, we have $\tD(v^p) -v^p \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes v^p = (v \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes v)^p -v^p \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes v^p=0$. But, if $f$ maps to $0$ in $\cU$, then $g=\tD(f) - f \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes f$ must map to zero in $\cU \otimes \cU$. But $g \in S_{\leq n-1} \otimes S_{\leq n-1}$ and, inductively, $S_{\leq n-1} \otimes S_{\leq n-1}$ injects into $\cU$. The trouble is the base case, $n=1$. To do this, we assume that $\fg$ acts faithfully on some vector space $V$. Then we obtain a map $\cU(\fg) \to \mathrm{End}(V)$, such that $\fg \to \cU(\fg) \to \mathrm{End}(V)$ is injective. In particular, $\fg$ injects into $\cU(\fg)$.
