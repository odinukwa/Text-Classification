There are a few reasons why, at least in a broader theoretical context, substantial government influence in a market economy may have negative consequences. A few are: Crowding Out Effect Increases in government spending can potentially lead to a decrease in investment from the private sector. This can be thought of in the more formal definition of the term (that an increase in government demands for loanable funds can lead to an increase in the interest rates faced by the private sector) or in the more informal one- that government involvement can change the profit motive faced by private entities in the field. If you assume that those private firms are, on balance, more efficient with resources than the governmental agency, it can lead to negative economic outcomes. Market Distortions One potential problem of increased governmental activity in the economy comes from unforeseen distortions that can ripple through other sectors. For all their problems, one nice feature of market equilibria are their ability to reflect private information and demands, and aggregate the individual actions of hundreds of millions of people effectively. That is no small feat; it is hard for a centralized agency to mimic that effectiveness. One of the major problems with centralized economies in practice is their practical inability to allocate resources "efficiently." Modeling government interaction in a repeated game-like context. Another (albeit more philosophical) problem some see is that, even if a larger government would be optimal for right now, it is often difficult to cut bureaucracy once it becomes entrenched. Therefore, we should consider that "future value" of inefficiently large government spending in the future (even if it is optimal to increase government's size today) into today's perceived "payoffs" of different actions. Problems with the Multiplier Effect: The multiplier, as learned in econ101, is a bit oversimplified in its presentation. While there almost certainly is some multiplier in every case, it isn't really just a single number that turns on an economy wide "marginal propensity to consume." Instead, it's far more subtle, and often depends on who is receiving the benefit, what the context of the payment is, etc. Furthermore, some conservative economists argue it is often too small to justify the expense. Now, note that I personally don't really believe much of what was said above. I'm not trying to suggest that Mr. Corbyn should or shouldn't increase the size of government expenditures (I haven't studied the issue enough to make an informed opinion). Furthermore, I think it should be noted (in the interest of fairness) that many times these theoretical concerns can be misapplied in practice: for example, The Laffer Curve may be the most poorly applied theoretical concept in political economy. Let me know if that didn't answer your question, or if you'd like more detail! 

From a quick glance, it looks like the difference is that the new finance minister is including promised payments that the government had previously made, but hasn't had to pay yet. For example, say I borrow \$10 from you. At the same time, say I had previously promised (in an unrelated interaction) to give you \$5 at the start of June. What's my current debt to you? Officially, it's \$10 (from the loan you had given me). But come the first of June, if I haven't paid you back yet, I'll find myself in debt to you for \$15: \$10 from the loan, and the additional \$5 from the promise. Effectively, the new finance minister is counting the debt to be the entire \$15 (that is, current debt obligations, as well as promised future payments to different projects in Malaysia), while the official figure only considers my debt to be \$10 (since I don't yet technically owe you the additional \$5). Technically, the government official figures are correct, since the government can "get out" of the future payments by (I'd assume) changing the law to remove themselves from that responsibility. At the same time, since (it looks like) those payments are to Malaysian government/private company partnership projects, simply refusing to pay would ultimately undermine Malaysian projects, which would hurt citizens. Which is more important depends on the context, and the interests of the individual. 

A profit maximizing firm will expand output until marginal return (MR) equals marginal costs (MC). Intuitively, if the revenue of an additional sale exceeds the costs of the sale, you should go for it. On the other hand, if the additional costs are higher, you should obviously refrain from making the transaction. Therefore, a firm will optimally expand or reduce output until MR = MC. So when costs are shifting down (but the price for the products stays the same for the short term), the last unit is being sold with a profit. Therefore you should expand output until marginal costs equal marginal return again. What you should do: Get a standard textbook and look up the behavior of firms in two cases: Perfect competition and monopoly. You will see that the tradeoff you were referring to is only relevant for the monopolist. With a lower price he may sell additional units but he will also receive a lower price for all the units he sold beforehand. Why is this only relevant for the monopolist? Hint: The difference between the two cases (monopoly and perfect competition) is that a perfect competitor faces a horizontal demand curve while a monopolist faces a demand curve that is downward sloping (because it is market demand!). You will see that marginal return will differ in the two cases. This is what Harman Deep is referring to: The "downward slopiness" of the demand, i.e. the elasticity of demand, is crucial for the problem at hand. 

In his seminal paper Arrow (1962) states that information should be distributed without limit if an optimal allocation is to be achieved. Quote (p. 614-615): 

Starting position is a principal-agent-model with incomplete information (moral hazard) and the following properties: 

where $r_A$ and $r_P$ is the Arrowâ€“Pratt measure of absolute risk-aversion for the agent and the principal respectively. I am looking for the optimal contract for the principal to offer to the agent when the agent's effort is not visible. The principal's utility can be written as follows: $$U^P(e,a,b)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty-e^{(-r_P((1-b)x-a))}f(x\mid e) \, dx$$ I want to show that the following equivalence holds, meaning that the maximization of the principal's utility can be written as the RHS of the following equivalence: $$\max_{\rm e,a,b}\int_{-\infty}^\infty-e^{(-r_P((1-b)x-a))}f(x\mid e) \, dx \Leftrightarrow \max_{\rm e,a,b}(1-b)\mu(e)-a-\frac{r_P}2(1-b)^2\sigma^2$$ where $f(x|e)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{(-\frac{1}2(\frac{x-\mu(e)}\sigma)^2)}$ is the density function of a normal random variable $x\sim N(\mu(e),\sigma)$, with expected value $\mu(e)$ and variance $\sigma>0$. I tried to use the explicit form of $f(x|e)$ in the LHS, manipulate it a bit and then itegrate but could not get the equivalence. 

Arrow makes the point that creating a market for information is difficult given the peculiar nature of the commodity information. But if information did not have those special attributes: Couldn't information be "produced" by an organization and sold without welfare loss? Why do property rights lead to suboptimal allocation in the case of information? Reference: Kenneth Arrow, 1962.

Interesting observation, but I think the answer is partly explained by several factors: First, any calculation of real GDP would eliminate the year-over-year variance that could be due to taste shocks leading to significant price changes. Second, I think your observation is partially true, however. What makes an iPhone more valuable than an old Motorola smartphone? Sure, some inputs might be slightly different, but the "production technology" of the iPhone makes it such that we (in general) do value it higher. While some measures like CPI try to account for some of those issues by considering benchmarks for certain performance criteria (like processing power, memory, etc.), in the end, there absolutely is some taste-based component. I think it's partly accounted for by aggregation, as you mentioned, but I think the third point is that there's a bit of a disconnect between what value is trying to measure, and what GDP is interested in. Theories of value attempt to explain why we attach certain "utility amounts" to different goods. But that doesn't mean the output of any particular "theory of value" is subjective: the observed prices and quantities are quite objective. GDP (like other macroeconomic indicators) is more interested in tabulating those objective outputs of the theory of value and observing their change over time. For example, I know I value the green mechanical pencil in front of me at \$2, despite the fact I only paid \$1 for it. Assuming the production costs are negligible, GDP would observe that as \$1 of economic activity. It doesn't consider how much I would have paid for it, which is what different theories of value attempt to explain. Furthermore, why I value it at \$2 might be for any host of reasons- perhaps its a subjective value, or perhaps that valuation reflects what I think the pencil will be worth in a year's time. Regardless of what that reasoning is, the objective measurements that GDP considers are the price paid and quantity. 

There is a broad literature that attempts to address the very question you pose- what is the impact of immigration (legal and illegal) on native wages? However, if you're interested in the 'real world' evidence, I'd suggest focusing on empirical labor economics as opposed to more theoretical labor models. The reason for my suggestion is that theoretical economics makes no clear prediction without a lot more information. There are a variety of factors, such as the production function being considered, the labor market conditions observed, the relative substitutability of immigrant and native workers, etc. which tends to make answering the question more of an empirical exercise. As far as the findings of the empirical papers, they actually tend to find relatively little impact of immigrant labor on native wages, with a few notable exceptions. For some examples: This survey paper, though a bit out of date as it's from 2005 outlines the results of 18 papers and finds wide discrepancies depending on modeling techniques and underlying assumptions used. Borjas, 2003 is one of the better known works, and finds what one might expect based on Econ101 models- that an increase in immigrant labor supply leads to a decrease in wages for native workers. A couple very well known articles have tried to tease out the impact of immigration on wages by focusing on particular events (called supply shocks) where the number of immigrants increased "suddenly" for reasons having nothing to do with the economic climate at the time. A pair of papers examined the impact of the Mariel Boatlift, which led to a spike in Cuban immigrants in Miami: The first, a paper by Card 1990 found no evidence of a negative impact of immigration on wages, while Borjas 2015 finds a substantial decrease in the wages for the least educated Miami residents. Several other papers have found either no negative effect, or even positive effects, of immigrants on various worker wages. For example, this paper by Peri in 2011 finds no negative impact of immigrants on wages, but a strongly positive impact of immigrants on productivity. This paper from 2013 finds significant positive impacts of undocumented immigrants on the wages of native workers in Georgia. Ultimately, the exercise of determining the impact of immigrants on wages really depends on the method of analysis and a number of underlying parameters, and applying "standard" (i.e. Principles of Micro) models can lead to erroneous results and a false sense of certainty. If there's anything else in particular you're interested in, let me know and I'll try to improve the answer! EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to include a link to this additional survey paper in the original answer! 

This question is a quantitative analogy to this question on philosophy.SE. Within the framework of economic decision-theory using utility functions, how do you characterise the moral principles of utilitarianism and altruism, and how do they relate? (Please ignore uncertainty in the outcome of actions, since I don't want to complicate the question unnecessarily.) 

Both of these rankings involve an inequality on sums of marginal utilities, but they differ in terms of the signs applied to the parts of the aggregation. Both can be written in the general form: $$a \succeq_{\mathbf{w}} a' \quad \quad \iff \quad \quad \sum_{i} w_i \Delta U_i (a) \geqslant \sum_{i} w_i \Delta U_i (a'),$$ for some specified vector of weights $\mathbf{w} = (w_1, ..., w_n)$. In the case of utilitarianism we have weights $w_i = 1$, so that each individual contributes their utility equally to the aggregation. In the case of altruism we have $w_i = \mathbb{I}(i \neq k) - \mathbb{I}(i=k)$ so that the decision-maker contributes his marginal utility negatively to the aggregation (i.e., self-sacrifice is considered good). 

Descriptive Framework: Consider a society composed of $n$ individuals, and consider a person in this society who is faced with a decision problem where he has to choose an action $a \in \mathscr{A}$. For simplicity, we will presume that the marginal utility from this action for each individual is known to the decision-maker, and is given by the function $\Delta U_i : \mathscr{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ for person $i$. A positive value of a marginal utility function means that there is a gain from the chosen action to that individual, and a negative value means there is a loss. Note that utility is interpreted here in the cardinal sense, so it is not merely an ordinal measure (i.e., it can be aggregated by summation). The vector function of all the marginal utility functions is $\boldsymbol{\Delta U} = (\Delta U_1, ..., \Delta U_n): \mathscr{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$, and this gives the total change in utility from the action, for all individuals in society. We can represent an ethical system dependent on these utilities as an ordinal ranking $\succeq$ over $\mathscr{A}$ that depends on $\boldsymbol{\Delta U}$. This ranking describes which actions are more or less good under the ethical systems, based on the vector of marginal utilities in the society. 

How to describe utilitarianism and altruism: Both of these ethical systems involve judging the goodness of an action by the benefit to oneself and others, which we will take to be a judgement in relation to some aggregation of the marginal utilities of the action. We characterise these two ethical systems with the following rankings. 

In terms of modelling, this could reasonably be represented as a signalling effect (signalling his wealth to others by buying goods with higher prices), or as a situation where there is an unobserved, or imperfectly observed, "quality" element, and he is using price as a basis for inferring higher quality. Neither of these is necessarily "irrational" since they may come with either social gains or quality gains, at the expense of greater cost. To differentiate these effects it would be necessary to observe how he acts in cases where the quality of two items is known to be equal, and whether he has a greater tendency to do this with goods that are observed by others. (Of course, here there is a sampling problem, since you only observe him when he is able to be observed by others!)
