I am trying to learn the meaning of Terms of Trade, but I'm confused. From the wikipedia article, it says that TOT is the ratio of the value of exports over imports, and since for the other country these are reversed the TOT of the other country is the inverse, but I don't understand how that works. Suppose country X with currency symbol \$ trades with country Y with currency symbol ¥. (I am using an exchange rate of \$1 = ¥5, but it is not relevant.) We consider two commodities, A and B. Companies buy inputs and sell output either buying wholesale and selling retail, or buying inputs to industry and selling the product of that industry. Input A can be bought in Y at ¥10. Since in X it costs \$2.20 to buy it, company XA buys 3 million units from the market in Y. Conversely B can be bought in X at $2, but it costs ¥12 in Y, so company YB buys 3 million units from the market in X. Since country X exports 3M units of A, which in X are valued at \$2.20, the value of its exports is \$6.6M. Since it imports 3M units of B valued at \$2, the value of its imports is $6M and 1.1 is its TOT. Country Y exports 3M units of B valued at ¥12, imports 3M units of A valued at ¥10 for 1.2 as its TOT. I don't understand why TOT should be reciprocal when they are 1.1 and 1.2. EDIT: Maybe I am doing it wrong. What is the meaning of "value" as in the value of exports and value of imports. I assumed it is the cost if someone bought it locally. 

This is a classic supply and demand chart. The horizontal axis (x axis) is quantity, and the vertical axis (y axis) is price. In a labor market, the vertical unit price would be wages, and the quantity would be quantity of labor. Quantity is function of Price, but economists like representing price vertically. (Veblen described curves where the same quantity could trade at more than one price.) The D curve is demand. As price goes up, there is less demand (disregarding Veblen). That is, as the price rises, there are still buys who will buy at that price, but some will not, so there is a lower quantity that can be traded. The S1 and S2 curves are supply. As the price goes down, some suppliers will not what to supply the commodity. This is a little bit of a question in the labor market. Do fewer people want a job if wages are low? The price and quantity that is actually traded tends to be the equilibrium at the intersection of supply and demand. If the price is higher or lower, it will tend toward the equilibrium. I won't explain here, but we will see an example with the shift from the S1 to S2 curves. The arrow showing a shift from the S1 to the S2 curve represents a change in supply. There is now a greater quantity of supply at the same price, or the same quantity at a much lower price. Suppose when the supply curve was S1 trading happened at the equilibrium. Now at that price, there are more suppliers willing to supply the commodity. They are also willing to supply at a lower price. There are some buyers who would not buy at the old price, but will buy if the price were lower. The extra suppliers are willing to take the lower price. So the price decreases as a greater amount is supplied. This continues until the price lowers so much that there are no additional suppliers, which happens at the intersection of D and S2.

As an answer let me offer a paradox that goes in your direction and is related to automation and the future of jobs: 

Consider an exact same product, say an umbrella, which is both imported from China in India and locally produced. The reason why the Chinese product is cheaper compared to the local one could be related to differences in productivity or total factor productivity. The Chinese product could be relatively cheaper because Chinese firms use better production techniques, higher-quality general labor and capital input, better managerial practice/talent, or better information technology. See the JEL survey about What Determines Productivity? The recent paper by Rodrik and co-authors documents that labor productivity is higher in China than in India (see Table 1). This could be a first reason why prices of the same product differ.

The Wikipedia page on risk aversion states that a "Constant Relative Risk Aversion implies a Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion, but the reverse is not always true". Let me decompose this statement in two parts: 1/ "Constant Relative Risk Aversion implies a Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion." A simple example is the log utility function, $u(c) = \ln(c)$, with $c>0$ satisfies the DARA because the utility function is positively skewed $\left(u'''=\frac{2}{c^3} >0\right)$ and implies a Relative Risk Aversion equals to $1 \left(=-c\frac {u''(c)}{u'(c)}\right)$. 2/ "but the reverse is not always true". I am wondering if this is the most frequent case? Or if most of the time DARA utility functions also exhibit CRRA? I would be grateful if you can illustrate your answer with some utility functions. 

How to describe utilitarianism and altruism: Both of these ethical systems involve judging the goodness of an action by the benefit to oneself and others, which we will take to be a judgement in relation to some aggregation of the marginal utilities of the action. We characterise these two ethical systems with the following rankings. 

Descriptive Framework: Consider a society composed of $n$ individuals, and consider a person in this society who is faced with a decision problem where he has to choose an action $a \in \mathscr{A}$. For simplicity, we will presume that the marginal utility from this action for each individual is known to the decision-maker, and is given by the function $\Delta U_i : \mathscr{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ for person $i$. A positive value of a marginal utility function means that there is a gain from the chosen action to that individual, and a negative value means there is a loss. Note that utility is interpreted here in the cardinal sense, so it is not merely an ordinal measure (i.e., it can be aggregated by summation). The vector function of all the marginal utility functions is $\boldsymbol{\Delta U} = (\Delta U_1, ..., \Delta U_n): \mathscr{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$, and this gives the total change in utility from the action, for all individuals in society. We can represent an ethical system dependent on these utilities as an ordinal ranking $\succeq$ over $\mathscr{A}$ that depends on $\boldsymbol{\Delta U}$. This ranking describes which actions are more or less good under the ethical systems, based on the vector of marginal utilities in the society. 

This question is a quantitative analogy to this question on philosophy.SE. Within the framework of economic decision-theory using utility functions, how do you characterise the moral principles of utilitarianism and altruism, and how do they relate? (Please ignore uncertainty in the outcome of actions, since I don't want to complicate the question unnecessarily.) 

In terms of modelling, this could reasonably be represented as a signalling effect (signalling his wealth to others by buying goods with higher prices), or as a situation where there is an unobserved, or imperfectly observed, "quality" element, and he is using price as a basis for inferring higher quality. Neither of these is necessarily "irrational" since they may come with either social gains or quality gains, at the expense of greater cost. To differentiate these effects it would be necessary to observe how he acts in cases where the quality of two items is known to be equal, and whether he has a greater tendency to do this with goods that are observed by others. (Of course, here there is a sampling problem, since you only observe him when he is able to be observed by others!)
