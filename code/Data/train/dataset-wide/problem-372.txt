There are fewer particles to hit in intergalactic space This would require the energy released from the formation of an entire galaxy to somehow be concentrated in a single particle 

For one thing, action has units, so you can't add $1$ to it as you do in the denominator. But that's easily worked around by replacing the $1$ with a constant $h_M$. From there, let me simplify your expression by writing the modified action as $$S = S^{(L)} + \frac{S^{(M)}}{h_M + \lvert S^{(L)}\rvert}$$ According to the stationary action principle, you need the variation $\delta S = 0$ for physical paths. Variation basically follows the same rules as derivatives, so $$\delta S = \delta S^{(L)} + \frac{\delta S^{(M)}}{h_M + \lvert S^{(L)}\rvert} \pm \frac{S^{(M)}}{(h_M + \lvert S^{(L)}\rvert)^2}\delta S^{(L)}$$ The $\pm$ sign, resulting from your use of the absolute value, is already a clue that this is going to get fairly complicated. I won't bother to explain the sign choice in detail, but it does bring up the related issue of a sort of "gauge dependence" of your action: the fact that adding a constant to the action changes the equations of motion. In standard Lagrangian mechanics, you can add any value representable as $f(t_2) - f(t_1)$, for some differentiable function $f$, to the action with no effect on the underlying physics. This property is essential in deriving the Euler-Lagrange equations. In your case, however, significant changes could result from adding that kind of term. That sign choice, for instance, depends on whether $S^{(L)}$ is positive or negative. So let's do the following: 

The problem is not so much the strong magnetic field (either a huge permanent magnet or a super conducting magnet), because a high temperature super conducting magnet might be feasible in the (near?) future. It's not the hf coils for reading the returning signals. It's homogeneity! An mri device works by reading the energy at a specific frequency level which reaches the hf reading coils. The frequency describes the location of origin because gradient coils are used to superimpose a slight offset onto the basic field which varies by location. So that each point in the target volume has a different magnetic field strength. That way the lamor (or lamour?) Frequency changes and the signal received by the reading coils has a different frequency for each location of origin. That's the frequency-space coding that allows you to reconstruct an image. The less precise the magnetic field, the lesser the image quality. There are open bore mris and small mri for small probes, but shooting a magnetic field around and getting any kind of signal that is more than nonsense is not feasible in near future. So let's go further in time. If you can measure very low energy and effectively calculate all the noise you would get, the presence of a human in the magnetic field of the earth could be picked up as slightly different noise by a reading coil. Combine that with a high temperature super conducting magnet which generates a magnetic field at a target (handwave, or maybe someday by adding cancellation) or a visual measurement of the distance and the expected magnetic field there and a lot of calculation power and you could actually get a signal from another human. As to blur, the quality of the image depends on measuring time and homogeneity. If however you could calculate exactly how the field would look like at your target and what deviations you'd get and compensate motion with the camera data etc. You could get some good data. However the calculation necessary is way out of our reach today and if you had an ai capable of that, there would probably be easier ways to calculate the needed dosage. For example, a simple rgb camera can already measure the heart rate of someone by filming their skin (the green channel is best for just reading out the waves from the bloodflow). Combine that with an infrared camera, some statistical data and a weight and fitness estimate and you can already get a lot of information about the physical condition. TL;DR: no, a lot would have to happen first, essentially leaving you in a future with very high tech and a lot of different possibilities we can only imagine today. 

Take some path $\mathcal{P}$ such that $S^{(L)}[\mathcal{P}] < 0$. Define $s = \lvert S^{(L)}[\mathcal{P}]\rvert$. Define $$f(t) = \frac{2st}{t_2^{[\mathcal{P}]} - t_1^{[\mathcal{P}]}}$$ and add $f(t_2) - f(t_1) = 2s$ to the action, which changes its value from negative to positive. 

Now you've flipped the sign of the action, and also flipped the sign in the variation formula, which means the quantity that needs to be set to zero is different. What this means is that the invariance to total derivatives which is present in standard Lagrangian mechanics does not exist in your framework. By itself, that isn't a dealbreaker; the magic action still presumably has stationary paths. But good luck finding them without being able to use variational calculus on the general action. You won't have the Euler-Lagrange equations to work with, and unless you get really lucky, there won't be any general way to find the paths that set the variation to zero. This makes it a very frustrating (at best) and possibly practically useless framework. And of course, this doesn't rule out the possibility of contradictions. It just makes them harder to identify, along with everything else. 

So I somehow turned into an immortal (I don't age). (Looking ~25-30) Naturally, this brings around some problems. After ~10 years of fun, people started making comments on how young I look. I fear that in the next 10 years this will seriously affect me. People will start asking real questions. I'm planning to disappear. But life today is too connected. I need passports everywhere, money, jobs where people don't ask who I am and going to jail for a longer time could be very problematic. Any fixes? What do I do? (Starting point: Central Europe/US/similar, Caucasian male, ~50kâ‚¬ funds available). 

Imagine a world of magic. This magic can do anything you want it to, as long as physics agrees (totally useless addendum: physics is actually a very pendantic guy, but rumour has it his mistresses have been seen flying). Meaning, energy is to be conserved. A spell can lay dormant for centuries, but once activated it can only consume the amount of energy put into it when casted. Which is why magicians are very good cooks, they have to get fat fast before casting a powerful spell and then consume their fat all at once to put the energy into the spell (others just kill animals, but that's frowned upon). Now skeletons are easy to use as tomb guards (scary, bones are easy to get), but how much energy would be needed (approx.) to have a skeleton actually be able to fight? They don't have muscles etc. so keeping all those bones aligned would be consuming some energy already. Is it feasible to cast the skeleton spell and the remains of an army within a few days/weeks/months without having big energy sources available (aka food, maybe a companion), or would those skeletons rather need more energy? "Careful, there are skeletons there, they'll chop you into parts!" "I know, just watch." The hero charges into the dungeon activating all trap spells, turns around, sprints out of the dungeon, releases the stick holding the boulder next to the door, waits two days, removes the boulder and walks into the dungeon because the skeletons had only enough energy to hit the boulder once or twice and are now just bones lying on the ground. I'd like to evade that scenario. 

What you're talking about here is basically the same thing as a cosmic ray air shower, except that it would have to take place in intergalactic space instead of in the atmosphere, and the amount of energy involved would have to be unimaginably higher. There are two factors that make this event rather different from an air shower: 

Traveling at $0.7c$, it will take the Problem $\frac{48.6\ \mathrm{ly}}{0.7c} = 69.4\ \text{years}$ after the encounter to reach ship B, of which 50 years have already passed, so they have $19.4\ \text{years}$ left to prepare when ship A returns. And at that time, the Problem will be $0.7c\times 19.4\ \text{years} = 13.6\ \mathrm{ly}$ away. 

1There do exist chemical reactions that release energy but don't occur spontaneously, usually because they require a small input of energy or a catalyst to get started. But you're not going to get these from building materials. They occur in combustible or explosive substances. 

So I robbed fort kn... I mean had a misunderstanding with some pretty powerful people by no fault of my own. I can teleport to places I can see or have seen (like in the movie jumper, btw I love google maps). I need a secret place to where nobody will ever find me while I'm sleeping (just then, when I'm awake I'll jump around on earth) and thought about looking at some photos of the moon to build a secret hideout. I can totally teleport there with anything in hands and a space suit on, but I can't take anything I can't lift, so no heavy machinery. Where do I build a sleeping place and how and how do I hide it?
