In their example, both traders have the same utility function, which has the following characteristics: 

Divide the family income $I$ among the family members, such that each member $i\in F$ receives an income $I/|F|$. Then, let each member select a bundle $(x_i',y_i')$ that maximizes his utility function $u_i$ in given his fraction of the income. Then, calculate the family bundle as a sum of the members' bundles: 

Consider an economy with $n$ consumers with an identical utility function, which is quasilinear in $x$: $$ u_i(x,y) = x+u(y) $$ If we want to represent all consumers by a single representative consumer, what would his utility function look like? Here is my current solution. For every consumer, the demand for $y$ depends only on the price. It is determined by the equality: $$ u'(y_i) = p_y $$ so: $$ y_i(p, m_i) = (u')^{-1}(p) $$ (where $m_i$ is the income of consumer $i$). Hence, the aggregate demand is: $$ Y(p, M) = n \cdot (u')^{-1}(p) $$ (where $M$ is the aggregate income of all consumers). Let's assume that a representative consumer has utility function $U$, which is also quasilinear in $x$: $$ U(x,y) = x+U(y) $$ Then, his demand will be: $$ Y(p, M) = (U')^{-1}(p) $$ Equating the above expressions for the aggregate demand gives: $$ (U')^{-1}(p) = n \cdot (u')^{-1}(p) $$ $$ U'(y) = u'({y \over n}) $$ $$ U(y) = n\cdot u({y \over n}) $$ So, the utility function of the rep. agent is: $$ U(x,y) = x + n\cdot u({y \over n}) $$ Is this calculation correct? 

This question is about Pareto optimality (PO) in cake-cutting. The basic definition is: an allocation is PO if there does not exist another allocation in which all players are weakly better off and at least one player is strictly better off. For example, consider the following cake (where "C" means Chocolate and "V" means Vanilla): 

While reading economics papers, especially those related to economy with land, I often encounter the terms $L^\infty$ and the "weak* topology". They seem like very basic terms, but I couldn't find a basic explanation of them. Here is a typical paragraph which I am trying to decipher (it is from page 4 at the introduction of A foundation of location theory): 

The book claims that the only payoff vector in equilibrium is 1,1,0! Why? Let $E$ be some equilibrium in the repeated game. The payoffs of the row and column players in $E$ must be 1, because: 

In a standard problem of fair cake-cutting, there is a real interval which is called "cake", and it has to be divided among $n$ partners. Each partner $i$ has a subjective value function $v_i$, which is an additive function on subsets of the cake. This means that, for every two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$: $$v_i(A\cup B)=v_i(A)+v_i(B)$$ Suppose that, instead of a value function, each partner has a preference relation $\succeq_i$. A preference relation $\succeq_i$ is represented by a value function $v_i$ iff: $$A\succeq_i B \iff v_i(A)\geq v_i(B) $$ What properties on the preference relation guarantee that it can be represented by an additive value function? NOTE: The Wikipedia page Ordinal utility describes some conditions under which a preference relation can be represented by an additive value function. But, it deals with preferences on bundles of homogeneous goods. Here, the preferences are on subsets of a heterogeneous good. EXAMPLES: $$u_1(A) = \text{len}(A)^2$$ $u_1$ is not additive, but the preference relation it represents can be represented by the additive function $v_1(A) = \text{len}(A)$. $$u_2(A) = \min[\text{len}(A\cap[0,4]),\text{len}(A\cap[4,8])]$$ The preference relation represented by $u_2$ cannot be represented by an additive function. Proof: suppose by contradiction that the preference relation is represented by an additive function $v_2$. Then, because: $$u_2([0,1])=u_2([4,5])=u_2(\emptyset)$$ this must also be true for $v_2$: $$v_2([0,1])=v_2([4,5])=v_2(\emptyset)$$ By additivity: $$v_2([0,1]\cup[4,5])=v_2(\emptyset\cup\emptyset)=v_2(\emptyset)$$ This must also be true for $u_2$: $$u_2([0,1]\cup[4,5])=u_2(\emptyset)$$ a contradiction. 

The question basically boils down to whether the inequality below is true or not. $$\bigg|\Delta G\bigg(\frac{1}{1-MPC}\bigg)\bigg|>\bigg|\Delta T\bigg(-\frac{MPC}{1-MPC}\bigg)\bigg|$$ If $\Delta G=\Delta T$, we can divide by either and get $$\bigg|\bigg(\frac{1}{1-MPC}\bigg)\bigg|>\bigg|\bigg(-\frac{MPC}{1-MPC}\bigg)\bigg|$$ If we multiply each side by $1-MPC$ and we evaluate the absolute value, we get $$1>MPC$$ This statement is true, so that implies that the first inequality is true. By this inequality, we know that $\Delta GDP_G>\Delta GDP_T$. Since $\Delta GDP_G<0$ and $\Delta GDP_T>0\implies \Delta GDP<0$ 

Government spending is the spending by the government on goods and services (non-capital goods). This means that the government buying physical capital would not be included in government spending, and would be included in investment spending. 

Well, rent control is the classic example used in many economics textbooks when talking about price ceilings. A price ceiling is a maximum price one can pay for a good, and is set by a governing body. There are many cons to price ceilings and not many pros. $\textbf{Pros:}$ 1) Because tenants of the property know that apartments are in short supply, they will have an incentive to take good care of the place in order to stay on the renter's good side because they may not be able to get another apartment if they get kicked out of this one. 2) Tenants who get apartments will have lower rent costs and will therefore be able to spend/save more of their money. If they choose to spend it, that can boost the local economy because more money will be spent in local businesses. $\textbf{Cons:}$ The graph above depicts a binding rent control. By this, I mean that the rent controlled price is below the equilibrium price. In this example, the rent controlled price is $1,000$ and the equilibrium price is $1,500$. What this causes is a shortage of apartments. Looking at this graph, we can see that at the price of $1,000$, $Q_D=2,100,000$ and $Q_S=1,900,000$. Using this, we can see that the shortage will be: $$Q_D-Q_S=2,100,000-1,900,000=200,000\;apartments$$ What this means in words is that there are more people who want apartments than there are people who are willing to supply apartments. What might be the side effects of this? 1) Rationing: There are a couple of ways rationing may occur, but in the market for apartments the only way which makes sense is rationing through discrimination by sellers biases. What this means is that the renter may give the apartment to someone who doesn't value it as much as another person based on their biases. 2) Illegal activities: One thing which may occur due to rent control is under-the-table deals. Basically, people may pay the seller some money under the table to ensure that they get an apartment. 3) Homelessness or relocation: We need to look at what we mean by the quantity of apartments demanded is greater than the quantity of apartments supplied. What this means is that people who want/need to buy apartments will not be able to (in our example 200,000 people at least). What are the two outcomes of this? The first outcome would be homelessness because people cannot get apartments, and they may have nowhere else to go. The reason why this is not desirable is pretty obvious (we don't want people to have to live on the streets). The second outcome would be relocation of current residents. What this means is that people will need to move out of the area. This will hurt the local economy because less people will be spending their money in local businesses. One last thing to keep in mind is that over time this shortage will get worse. In the short run, the sellers may not be able to take the apartment off the market. However, in the long run, sellers may decide to sell the apartment complex, which will cause the supply of apartments to decrease even more. This will exacerbate the problems I listed above. $\textbf{Edit:}$ Another problem caused by rent controls was mentioned (quite astutely) by $\textbf{AdamBailey}$. He pointed out that landlords may not make enough money to maintain his or her rental properties, and over time the quality of such rental properties may depreciate drastically. This shows that, not only will the quantity of apartments decrease, but the quality may decrease as well. This is another perfect example of how rent controls can hurt those that it is trying to help. 

Note: I asked this question on MathOverflow some time ago. Taneli Huuskonen came up with the negative example for weakly-quasiconcave function, but the question for strictly-quasiconcave function is still open. Due to the economic importance of quasiconcave functions, I thought someone here might have an answer. 

I am looking for economics papers which use concepts, techniques and theorems from geometry. I am mainly interested in Euclidean geometry, the kind of material that is taught on high-schools (e.g. proving theorems about triangles, squares, circles, etc.). But, other kinds of geometry are also interesting. I looked at some papers about land economics, thinking that it geometry can be useful there (after all, the word "geometry" means "measurement of land"). But, the papers I found used mostly advanced measure theory and topology. I am looking for more basic geometric methods. 

Suppose the Net Domestic Product in a certain sector (e.g. agriculture) is 10 billion. Who enjoys this 10 billion? Initially, I thought that this 10 billion is the gross income of the farmers. So some of it is paid as taxes while the rest remains with the farmers as net income. But, I did the math with some real-life data, and found out that the net income of the farmers is much smaller. So, where does the difference go to? My conjecture is that the NDP include the income of other workers related to agriculture, e.g. truck drivers, traders and sellers in farmer markets. Is this correct? Or are they counted in a different sector? 

When I took a course in consumer theory, the economy always had a single consumer, represented by a monotone positive utility function $u(x,y)$ and an income $I$. Given prices $p_x$ and $p_y$, it is possible to calculate the demands of the consumer for products $x$ and $y$. Now, I deal with a different type of economy: there are many consumers, each of them wants only a single unit of each product. Each consumer is represented by three positive values: $u_x$ (utility for having $x$), $u_y$ (utility for having $y$) and $u_{xy} \geq \max(u_x,u_y)$ (utility for having both $x$ and $y$). Given prices $p_x$ and $p_y$, each consumer buys either $x$ or $y$ or both, whichever gives the highest net utility (utility of product/s minus price). So it is possible to calculate the aggregate demands for $x$ and $y$. MY QUESTION IS: Is there a natural/standard way to convert between these two types of economies? I.e, given a utility function $u(x,y)$ and income $I$ for a single consumer, is it possible to construct a set of consumers with different $u_x$, $u_y$ and $u_{xy}$, such that the demand curves in both economies are the same? 

In the TR and ML cells, the sum of utilities of the row and column players is less than 2; hence, these cells are not played in equilibrium at all. So in equilibrium, the only cells that may be played with positive frequency are: TL, MR, BL, BR. Now, the authors claim that TL and MR are also not played at all in equilibrium. From this they conclude that the payoff of the dummy player is 0. I didn't understand this part. Is it true that TL and MR are never played in equilibrium? Why? 

Well, one advantage to a sales tax is that it affects everyone (even those who don't pay income taxes). However, some people may see that same fact as a problem. This problem lies in analysis of the equity of the tax. When we consider every single person being taxed 30% on everything they buy, we need to think about how that affects different income groups. Lower income groups spend a much larger portion of their income on consumption, which means that they will be taxed relatively much more heavily than high income groups. This fact alone is enough to discourage this sort of action because the government tries to encourage saving in the lower income groups (so they can move up to higher income levels). This is one large reason why a tax like this may not be as fair as the name makes it seem. Another piece of information that must be considered is the incidence of the tax. As we know, the incidence of a sales tax depends upon the relative own-price elasticities of supply and demand. This means that in a market with very inelastic demand (such as cigarettes or oil), the buyer is paying most of the tax whereas in a market with elastic demand the sellers would pay most of the tax. This fact would make it so that different industries would end up paying a different amount of the sales tax compared to one-another. For example, an oil company would end up paying much less of the percentage of the tax than a company making a selfie stick. This, again, seems to be unfair. 

If this were to occur, there are three things we need to look at. 1) Will production occur? 2) Without wages, how will households make money? 3) What will be the welfare effects? $\textbf{1)}$ To answer the first question, if we assume that capital replaced all labor, we are assuming that capital and labor are substitutes which means that the production function will have the following form: $$F(k,l)=\alpha k+\beta l$$ What this means is that if $l=0$, $F(k,l)$ will still be greater than zero, so production will still occur. $\textbf{2)}$ To answer the second question, we can look at how households make money. Households make money from wages, and they make money from owning a fraction of firms (so they get that fraction of the profits the firm makes). All firms are owned by households (either through stocks or private ownership). The typical income of a household looks like the following: $$Y(\frac{}{})=wl+\theta\Pi$$ Where $w$ is wages, $l$ is labor hours, $\theta$ is the fraction of firms which the household owns, and $Pi$ is those firms' profits. If $l=0$, our income reduces to $Y(\frac{}{})=\theta\Pi$ One thing that immediately comes to mind is "without wages, won't all households' income decrease?" Well, we don't know for sure. According to economic theory, the reason the automation will have occurred is because it will cost less. What this means is that profit will increase, so $\theta\Pi$ will also increase. It really depends on whether $\Delta\theta\Pi$ is larger than, smaller than, or equal to $wl$. $\textbf{3)}$ The welfare effects are where we run into problems. When we look at the equation for income of a household, we can conduct a thought experiment: How does the fraction of income attributed to each term change when in different income groups? In the highest income groups, most of their income will come from $\theta\Pi$. An example of this would be the show SharkTank. In this show, companies come to the very wealthy "sharks" looking for capital, and in turn, they often offer a share of their company. Now, when we think about lower income groups, where does most of their income come from? Well, most of their income comes from wages because they cannot afford to save money (and therefore invest in stocks or entrepreneurship). What would happen as a result from full automation, we would theoretically see the income inequality grow to be even larger than it currently is. This is a very undesirable result.
