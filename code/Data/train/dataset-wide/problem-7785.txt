I stand corrected on a couple of points. First, on the math, there is a paper by George Andrews, "q-Analogs of the binomial coefficient congruences of Babbage, Wolstenholme, and Glaisher", that does give some version of a q-analogue of Wolstenholme's theorem. The proof given there is algebraic, so it does not shed light on possible combinatorial "explanations". Second, according to Andrews, the full binomial interpretation of Wolstenholme's result is due to Glaisher. 

Per JSE's remark above, I misunderstood the original question to mean that the coefficients are in $\{-1,0,1\}$. If $0$ is not allowed, then congruence conditions develop that make it much more likely for a random polynomial to be irreducible. I replaced the code to reflect the actual question, although if anyone is interested the old code is still there in the edit history. (I personally think that the ternary question is at least as interesting.) In particular, if the degree is one less than a prime, then as Mark Meckes suggests below, the polynomial $p$ can only be divisible by a cyclotomic polynomial by being a cyclotomic polynomial. Here is some typical output from the code: 

In spirit, the solution is in any calculus book, using the length formula $$L(f) = \int_a^b \sqrt{f'(x)^2+1} dx.$$ You also need the theorem that a continuous function on a closed interval is bounded. 

If $M$ is Kähler, then it is symplectic and thus $H^2(M,\mathbb{R}) \ne 0$. (Also, as explained in a blog posting by David Speyer, you still have $H^2(M,\mathbb{R}) \ne 0$ even if $M$ is non-projective but algebraic.) An interesting first example of a non-Kähler manifold is a Hopf manifold, by definition $(\mathbb{C}^n\setminus 0)/\Gamma_r$, where $\Gamma_r$ is a rescaling by $r$ with $|r| \ne 0,1$. This example has $H^1(M,\mathbb{R}) \ne 0$. On the other hand, even-dimensional, compact Lie groups have left-invariant complex structures. If $M$ is such a manifold and is simply connected, then it is also 2-connected. $H^1(M,\mathbb{Z}) = H^2(M,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and $M$ is manifestly not Kähler. On the other hand, no such example is 3-connected and you always have $H^3(M,\mathbb{R}) \ne 0$. There is (or was) a long-standing conjecture that no even-dimensional sphere other than $S^2$ has a complex structure. 

Henry Cohn cited a very nice definition of the Barnes-Wall lattices, but in my opinion, this definition that I just found in a paper by Micciancio and Nicoli is even better. (Although the two definitions are similar.) The Barnes-Wall lattice in $\mathbb{C}^{2^{n-1}}$ is a lattice over the Gaussian integers generated by the rows of the matrix $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1+i \end{pmatrix}^{\otimes {n-1}}.$$ Then of course to get the generator matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{2^n}$, you use the replacement $$a+ib \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ -b & a \end{pmatrix}.$$ This isn't a basis of minimal vectors. However, if you change the Gaussian generator matrix to $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & i \end{pmatrix}^{\otimes {n-1}},$$ then it is a basis of minimal vectors, and the associated real basis is also minimal. 

A confession: I have never really understood the basic model of fiat money and central banking, by which a central bank controls the money supply. By the standards of someone trained in mathematics, all of the explanations that I have ever seen are either too short or too long. My impression is that the way that a central bank controls the money supply in a modern economy can be taken on faith (if you want a short explanation), or is hard to understand (if you want a long one), but I have am suspicious of both of these extremes. I have also seen explanations that describe what happens "in effect" without clearly explaining the underlying rules. I would be interested in a concise mathematical summary of how a currency such as the US dollar is controlled. (I hope that it can be taken as an MO-appropriate question in mathematical economics.) Here is a model that I understand, but that isn't true: A game such as Monopoly has a central bank that simply grants fiat money from time to time to private parties. I'm sure that this is the wrong way to run a real economy, but at the serious level I don't know why. In any case this is not how the Fed works, because it mostly lends money rather than simply granting it. Here is a failed improvement of the model: Suppose that the bank in Monopoly only lent money to the players instead of granting it. Then the players would have no way to pay back the loans with interest! Maybe it could work if the players were allowed to accumulate debt --- but what would prevent unlimited borrowing? I can believe in multiplier effects (although actually I don't know a rigorous definition). If transactions occur more and more quickly, or if assets get more and more leveraged, that could be equivalent to an increase in money. I have trouble believing that the central bank does not need to create money and that we see inflation (except in depression circumstances) solely because money keeps travelling faster and faster and because the economy gets more and more leveraged. An abstracted economy has the following actors, each operating according to certain financial rules: A central bank, a government budget, regulated private banks, and the rest of the private sector. (And foreign actors, who I suppose are an extension of the private sector.) I think that I know the basic financial rules for the last one, but not for the others. To rephrase the question, I am hoping that there is a concise mathematical model that makes clear when money is created, and that looks dynamically stable with some controllable rate of inflation. A reference could be okay, but only if it has a good, specific explanation. 

I got email about this from Kevin Buzzard that made me look again at the paper referenced by Wikipedia, A weak countable choice principle by Bridges, Richman, and Schuster. According to this paper, life is pretty strange without countable choice. You want to make the real numbers as the metric completion of the rationals. However, there is a difference between general Cauchy sequences and what they called "modulated" sequences, which are sequences of rationals with a promised rate of convergence. They cite a result of Ruitenberg that the modulated complex numbers are algebraically closed in ZF. Hence $\mathbb{Q}$ has an algebraic closure in ZF. But it still seems possible that without countable choice, algebraic closures of $\mathbb{Q}$ need not be unique up to isomorphism, and that the complex analysis model of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ might not have automorphisms other than complex conjugation. 

Also, concerning your question about Cartesian products: Obviously the famous results imply that there is a fibration of standard $\mathbb{R}^5$ by exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$. The Whitehead manifold cross $\mathbb{R}$ is also homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^4$. (I don't know if it's diffeomorphic.) These fibrations are also fractal or have fractal features. 

According to a talk that I found on the web, it is a theorem of Voronoi that every indecomposable root lattice is extreme. Also the $E_8$ lattice is the union of two copies of the $D_8$ lattice with the same sphere radius. And, of course, the rotational symmetry group of the $E_8$ is transitive on roots. So I think that that gives it to you: If you put two small, flat dents in a round ball in $\mathbb{R}^8$, then you cannot deform the $E_8$ lattice packing, because there is a $D_8$ lattice inside that is far away from the dents. The same argument works for the Leech lattice, which contains a $D_{24}$ sublattice of index 8192. It also works for $E_7$, because it contains $A_7$. (Also $E_8$ contains $A_8$, but not in the same way, since $[E_8:A_8] = 3$ while $[E_7:A_7] = 2$.) However, I do not think that it is known, nor even a conjecture with strong evidence, that the kissing number of the best lattice sphere packing in dimension $n \to \infty$ is more than the bare minimum $n(n+1)$. 

You can only really ask for a proof that avoids a particular fact or construction, if that fact or construction is difficult enough or distinct enough from the thing that you're proving. By that principle, the comments imply that it would be enough to show that Derek Holt's subgroup $\langle a,b,c,e \rangle$ has index 2 in the candidate group $\langle a,b,c,d,e \rangle$. In fact Derek's proof is good: It is easy to show that $\langle a,b,c,e \rangle$ is isomorphic to $L_2(9) = \text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{F}_9)$, which plainly has order 360. ($L_2(9)$ is also isomorphic to $A_6$, but this fact is not needed.) Once you know that, you can also quickly construct $M_{10}$ as well, since you can show that the extra generator $d$ normalizes $L_2(9)$, and that $d^2 \in L_2(9)$. In that Usenet posting, Derek gave these expressions: $$\begin{matrix} a &=& (2\; 3\; 4)(4\; 6\; 7)(8\; 9\; 10) \\ b &=& (2\;5\;8)(3\;6\;9)(4\;7\;10) \\ c &=& (3\;5\;4\;8)(6\;7\;10\;9) \\ e &=& (1\;2)(5\;8)(6\;7)(9\;10) \end{matrix}.$$ Recall that $\mathbb{F}_9 = (\mathbb{Z}/3)[i]$. You can define a bijection $$\alpha:\mathbb{F}_9 \cup \{\infty\} \to \{1,2,\ldots,10\}$$ by the formula $$\alpha(x+iy) = 2+x+3y \qquad \alpha(\infty) = 1,$$ using the gauche embedding $\mathbb{Z}/3 = \{0,1,2\} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$. Then it is easy to check these expressions (using more normal arithmetic in $\mathbb{F}_9$): $$a(z) = z+1 \qquad b(z) = z+i \qquad c(z) = iz \qquad e(z) = 1/z.$$ So, that's $L_2(9)$. 

If I understand the question correctly, no because $V \subset \mathbb{C}^2$ could be the union of $xy = 1$ with $x=0$. You can see from looking at the real solutions that it does not have a tubular neighborhood of fixed width. And it can be modified to make a connected example. The case that interests you, $V$ is actually only quasiaffine in $M_r^k(\mathbb{C})$, not affine, so it's a strange question. Now I suspect that if you are allowed to change the embedding, then every affine (or quasiaffine) variety is isomorphic to an affine variety with such a tubular neighborhood. If that is your real question, then I suspect yes, but I would have to think about it some more. One thing that is definitely true, for any smooth manifold in any Euclidean space which is a closed subset, is that it has a tubular neighborhood which is allowed to get narrower and narrower as you go to infinity. 

The Wikipedia page for the Tutte polynmomial doesn't use the word crossing, it also uses the word bridge. In graph theory, a bridge of a connected graph is an edge that separates the graph into two components. However, there is a relation between the Tutte polynomial and the Jones and HOMFLY polynomials. More precisely, the HOMFLY polynomial generalizes the Tutte polynomial for planar graph. A knot diagram has crossings, which means points where two arcs of the knot cross. A knot diagram also has bridges; a bridge is a maximal sequence of over-crossings along an arc of the diagram. So there is a little bit of collision of terminology, because crossings aren't bridges and because bridges for knots aren't the same as bridges for graphs. 

If $X$ can just be a topological space, there are examples in which $H^i(X;L)$ and $H^i(X;M)$ vanish entirely, but $H^i(X,;L \otimes M)$ does not. For example, in cohomology with real coefficients, maybe $X = \mathbb{R}P^3$ and $L = M$ is the local system corresponding to the tautological line bundle, or if you like the non-trivial representation of $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}P^3) = \mathbb{Z}/2$. Then $H^i(X,L)$ vanishes, but $H^i(X;L \otimes L)$ is the usual cohomology of $\mathbb{R}P^3$ and does not vanish in degrees $0$ and $3$. One thing that exists (again for cohomology in the setting of topological spaces) is a well-defined cup product map: $$\cup:H^i(X;L) \otimes H^j(X;M) \to H^{i+j}(X;L \otimes M).$$ This map is not a direct statement about dimensions of anything, but it is an important map in the theory of cohomology with local coefficients. For instance, if $L$ and $M$ are inverse line bundles and $X$ is a closed manifold, then this cup product is the right way to set up Poincare duality. (To review, they have to be line bundles with flat connections to give you local coefficients.) 

Here is a variation of the question which is true and generalizes readily to the Brauer group. If $G$ and $H$ are two groups with two complex irreducible representations $V$ and $W$, then $V \otimes_{\mathbb{C}} W$ is an irrep of $G \times H$, and the Schur-Frobenius indicators multiply. For the proof, I'll switch to the generalization that works for any Brauer group. Let $F$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $V$ and $W$ be two irreps of $G$ and $H$ over the field $F$. Then $V$ and $W$ might each represent an element of the Brauer group of $F$, because by Schur's lemma each of $\mathrm{End}_G(V)$ and $\mathrm{End}_H(W)$ is a division ring. I say "might" because it is not necessarily true that the centers of these division rings are $F$. If so, then $V \otimes_F W$ does not quite have to be $(G \times H)$-irreducible, but its summands land in the expected place in the Brauer group, using the equation $$\mathrm{End}_{G \times H}(V \otimes_F W) \cong \mathrm{End}_G(V) \otimes_F \mathrm{End}_H(V).$$ Taking the case $F = \mathbb{R}$, you get a relation that is equivalent to the previous paragraph. 

In the comments to my other post on possible counterexamples, Anton also asks for references. I found the paper Nonexpansive retracts in Banach spaces, by Kopecká and Reich. They say, 

I think that the answer is yes. It looks like you can prove it by relying on a convenient proof of Ado's theorem. Procesi's book, "Lie groups: an approach through invariants and representations", has the following theorem preceding the proof of Ado's theorem: Theorem 2. Given a Lie algebra $L$ with semismiple part $A$, we can embed it into a new Lie algebra $L'$ with the following properties: 

There is a way to explain it that's similar to what you said about multiplication by $n$. Let $G$ be a Lie group, and let $f_1$ and $f_2$ be any two clutching functions that describe $G$-bundles $E_1$ and $E_2$ on $S^n$. Suppose that $f_1$ and $f_2$ agree at a base point of $S^{n-1}$. Let $c$ be some characteristic class of $G$-bundles of degree $n$; it could even be a cup product of standard classes such as Chern or Pontryagin or whatever. Let $f_3$ be the combination of $f_1$ and $f_2$ on the one-point union $S^{n-1} \vee S^{n-1}$. It is the clutching function of a bundle $E_3$ on the suspension $\Sigma(S^{n-1} \vee S^{n-1})$, which is the union of two $n$-spheres along an interval and thus homotopy equivalent to $S^n \vee S^n$. Whether you define $c$ the old-fashioned way by obstructions, or the more modern way by pullbacks from classifying spaces, it is easy to argue that $c(E_3) = c(E_1) \oplus c(E_2)$. I.e., it's just the ordered pair of the characteristic classes of its parts. Now addition in $\pi_n$ is modeled by a map $S^n \to S^n \vee S^n$, and the induced map on $H^n$ takes $a \oplus b$ to $a+b$. (Your generalized question about $H^k(S^n)$ is of course non-trivial only when $k=n$.) 

If the above sketch works, it also motivates this question: Suppose that a number $0 \le x \le 1$ is chosen at random with independent but biased digits in base $b$. For concreteness suppose that the digits are all $0$ or $1$ and that the density goes to 0 sufficiently slowly. Then is $1/x$ at $b$-normal number almost surely? 

There is a survey of open problems related to factoring algorithms, Open problems in number theoretic complexity, II, by Adleman and McCurley. It lists so many questions related to distinguishing almost primes from other composite numbers that it seems safe to infer that it is an open problem to do it quickly, and that you would either use a factoring algorithm or a related method. For instance, computing the Mobius function as you say is a known open problem, and detecting an almost prime can be viewed as a special case of computing the Mobius function. Because, of course, it is easy to distinguish a prime from an almost prime. As for relevant properties, the most important relevant property of a prime $p$ is that its multiplicative group $(\mathbb{Z}/p)^\times$ is cyclic of order $p-1$. The Miller-Rabin primality test is based on that fact. Now, if $n = pq$ is an odd almost prime, then the multiplicative group $(\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times$ is a product of two cyclic groups. Conversely, if $(\mathbb{Z}/n)^\times$ is a product of two cyclic groups and $n$ is odd, then $n$ is a product of two prime powers. But, there is too little control over the cardinality of this group. In the almost prime case, it has $(p-1)(q-1)$ elements. Even if you found the 2-torsion elements, in other words all solutions to $x^2 \equiv 1 \bmod n$, you would be able to factor $n$. The set of almost prime numbers is an important statistical ersatz for the set of prime numbers in analytic number theory. However, in computational number theory, no particular reason leaps out that identifying almost primes is easier than other factoring-related questions that are accepted as hard.
