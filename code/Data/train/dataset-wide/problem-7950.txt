If you're asking about the combinatorics of the polytope, then there is an easy answer. If you sample with a continuous distribution, then you will get a combinatorial permutohedron with probability 1. The only way to get something else is to take a point on one or more of the hyperplanes x_i=x_j. Then your orbit (i.e. set of vertices of the polytope) gets smaller. The simplest way to understand the number of vertices is to think about the stabilizer of your point: It is the subgroup generated by all transpositions (i j) such that your initial vector has x_i=x_j. So it's a product of symmetric groups. Also, I agree with Benjamin Steinberg (comment above) that you want to look at the Postnikov reference. 

The short answer, for arbitrary dimensions is this: You are asking for what polytopes can serve as the fundamental domain of an affine Coxeter group (represented as a group of Euclidean isometries of R^n). These are classified, and in particular, you are right about Question 1. I'll try to elaborate. A good reference for this is Humphreys "Reflection groups and Coxeter groups" which has a whole chapter on affine Coxeter groups. Much of what you need is there or is implicit, with maybe some connecting of dots needed. First, extend the facets (maximal proper faces) of P to form a hyperplane (so a point in R, a line in R^2, a plane in R^3, etc.). The following facts are easy and/or standard (for people who think about reflection groups). None of these hyperplanes cuts the interior of any other copy of P in the tessellation. Also, reflection in each of these hyperplanes is a symmetry of the uncolored tiling. All of these reflections together generate a discrete group of Euclidean motions. It is known that an infinite discrete group of Euclidean motions generated by reflections is an affine Coxeter group. (Going the other direction, if you start with an affine Coxeter group represented as a group of Euclidean motions, you will get a polytope P fitting your description.) In Humphreys, or for example at $URL$ you'll find a list of diagrams (edge-labeled graphs) that classify affine Coxeter groups. Here's how to read your P from these diagrams. Your graph will have c components, each of which is one of the connected graphs shown in the list. If there are k total vertices in all of the components, you will be constructing a polytope in R^n for n=k-c. For a moment, take c=1. Then each vertex will be a facet of your polytope and the edges tell the angles between facets by the following rule: no edge: angle is pi/2 unlabled edge: angle is pi/3 edge labeled m: angle is pi/m The edge labeled infinity only happens for n=1, and that is saying that the two "facets" (points) of a line segment meet at an angle pi/infinity=0, which is right if you think about it. If c>1, then you construct P_i for each component, and your P is the Cartesian product of all of the P_i. So for example, If P_1 is a line segment and P_2 is a triangle, you get a triangular prism, etc. But more interesting things can happen in R^3 than prisms. For example the diagram called "A_3 tilde" gives a tetrahedron. One pair of facets meets at right angles, the other two also meet at right angles, and all four other pairwise angles are pi/3. If you put a tag of "Coxeter groups" on this question, I'm sure there will be plenty of people who can add details. 

As so often happens, the answer is Steinberg. R. Steinberg, Finite reflection groups. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 91 (1959) 493–504. He explicitly constructs two lines that span the plane. A while back, for my paper Noncrossing partitions, clusters and the Coxeter plane, Sém. Lothar. Combin. 63 (2010), Article B63b. I worked through this and wrote maple code to construct an orthonormal basis for the plane. I looked and there are not many clues in my paper, but I still have the code. (It's ugly...so I won't post it here, but send me an email and I can share it. I don't know if mathoverflow has a messaging feature, but google my name and email me.) Or, have more fun and work through it yourself. 

Check out the paper by Thomas Lam and Anne Thomas: "Infinite reduced words and the Tits boundary of a Coxeter group" arxiv: 1301.0873. There is also, I think, an earlier paper by Lam and Pylyavskyy. 

Say I have a cluster algebra with principal coefficients and initial cluster $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. I don't want to invert the coefficient variables $y_1,\ldots,y_n$. The Laurent Phenomenon says that every cluster variable (and thus every element of the cluster algebra) is a Laurent polynomial in the $x_i$ with coefficients integer polynomials in the $y_i$. The question is simple: If I hand you an expression for a Laurent polynomial in the $x_i$ with coefficients integer polynomials in the $y_i$, can you tell me if it is an element of the cluster algebra? Answers might take the form of a criterion that could be checked by hand or an algorithm. I would also be interested in algorithms or partial criteria that can provide answers in some cases but not all cases. 

So, the question (as already asked in the title): Is this known? On the one hand, the proof is fairly simple, using the Serre relations, so maybe it's known. On the other hand, it may not be very Lie-theoretically natural (for example, I don't think there is a corresponding subalgebra relationship), so maybe it's not known. It is very combinatorially natural and is connected to some interesting facts about the weak order on finite Coxeter groups and to some interesting phenomena surrounding dominance relations on exchange matrices (in the sense of cluster algebras). 

The point of your question is: What is the relation between the two representations you describe of a Coxeter group? To each Coxeter group, one can associate a Cartan matrix in an even more general sense, where you allow real entries but require that $a_{ij}a_{ji}=4\cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{m(i,j)}\right)$, where the $m(i,j)$ are the data for the Coxeter system. (I'm taking $S=\{1,\ldots,n\}$.) Then the reflections $R_i$ that you describe are reflections generating a group isomorphic to the Coxeter group. The reflections $\sigma$ you describe are these reflections, in the case where the (generalized generalized) Cartan matrix is chosen to be symmetric. In some cases (called "crystallographic"), the Coxeter system admits an integer (and symmetrizable) Cartan matrix. In this case, we get a representation of the Coxeter group as a group of isometries of a symmetric bilinear form derived from the Cartan matrix. Anyway, once this is understood, the question about the Coxeter element is also answered (unless I misunderstood the question). 

(I'm starting by rephrasing the question, because it makes sense in terms of Coxeter groups. Skip down further for the simple answer for permutations.) The two moves you describe are called braid moves in Section 3.3 of Björner and Brenti's Combinatorics of Coxeter groups (and this is standard terminology). (However, braid moves are usually defined in terms of the reduced expressions, not the inversion sequence. Furthermore, that section deals, more generally, with Coxeter groups.) Their Theorem 3.3.1(ii) says that any two reduced expressions for $w$ can be related by a sequence of braid moves. Your question is a bit more subtle, and is equivalent to the following question: Given a reduced expression for $w$ whose reflection sequence is $(\ldots,(i,j),\ldots,(i,k),\ldots,(j,k),\ldots)$ is there also a reduced expression for $w$ whose reflection sequence is $(\ldots,(j,k),\ldots,(i,k),\ldots,(i,j),\ldots)$? (If the answer to the original question is yes, the one more braid move will provide a positive answer to my rephrasing. If the answer to my rephrasing is yes, then there must have been a step at which a braid move changed $(\ldots,(i,j),(i,k),(j,k),\ldots)$ to $(\ldots,(j,k),(i,k),(i,j),\ldots)$. Just before that step, we have found a positive answer to the original question. The answer to both questions is undoubtedly "yes" for Coxeter groups in general, although I'm having trouble thinking of a quick proof or reference in the short time I have before I have to get back to work. (I would love it if someone else supplies one.) [UPDATE: There are good reasons I couldn't find a quick proof! See David Speyer's comment and answer below.] But here is a quick proof for the symmetric group: The fact that the inversion sequence is $(\ldots,(i,j),\ldots,(i,k),\ldots,(j,k),\ldots)$ implies in particular that the one-line notation for the permutation has $\cdots k \cdots j \cdots i \cdots$. A reduced expression amounts to a sequence of swaps of adjacent entries in the permutation, always putting entries into numerical order, ending at the identity permutation. (This corresponds to removing the rightmost letter in the reduced expression at each step.) The given expression exchanges the $j$ and $k$ first, but we need to be able to exchange the $i$ and $j$ first. We can do this as long as we first move away all entries that are between them. This is possible because entries less than $j$ can be moved left of $j$ and entries greater than $i$ can be moved right of $i$.
