One magenta square at the top-left(bottom-right), and 3 cyan squares below(above) the x-axis. Two magenta squares at the top(bottom), and 2 cyan squares below(above) the x-axis. Or, one magenta square at the top-left(right), one magenta square at the bottom-right(left), one cyan square at the left(right) below the x axis, and one cyan square at the right(left) above the x axis. Two magenta squares at the top(bottom), one magenta square at the bottom-left(top-right), and one cyan square at the right(left) below(above) the x axis. Two magenta squares at the top and two at the bottom. 

MY QUESTION IS: Is anything known about such "directed cages"? Specifically: how many nodes are needed for a directed cage when $r=2$, as a function of $g$? 

After reading many papers about problems of minimum polygon covering, I found out that there are four different types of units that are considered for covering polygons, in increasing order of generality: squares, rectangles, convex shapes and star shapes. In theory, there can be many other covering units, for example: it is possible to cover a polygon with triangles (this is different than the problem of triangulation because the units in a covering may overlap), pentagons, hexagons... but, I haven't found any paper discussing such covering problems. My question is: are you aware of any papers discussing the problem of finding a minimum covering of a polygon with shapes other than the four classes above? I am particularly interested in covering a polygon with right-angled isosceles triangles, isolateral triangles or other regular polygons.

Three agents, failed directions Again the goal is to use at most 4 cuts (the lower bound). Let agent #3 make $Q$ marks on the circle, such that the piece between each two consecutive marks is worth for him exactly $1$. We would like to give one of the three agents a fair piece, while making sure that the remaining cake is sufficiently valuable for the remaining two agents. This can be done in three ways: Way 1. Give agent #1 an arc of length at most $p_1$, whose value for agent #1 is at least $p_1$ and for agent #2 at most $p_1$. Way 2. Give agent #2 an arc of length at most $p_2$, whose value for agent #2 is at least $p_2$ and for agent #1 at most $p_2$. Way 3. Give agent #3 an arc of length $p_3$, whose value for agents #1 and #2 is at most $p_3$. Unfortunately, there are cases in which none of this ways is possible. For example, suppose the weights are $p_1=3,p_2=2,p_3=1$. Agent 3 cuts six pieces equal in his eyes, and the valuations of 1 and 2 for these pieces are: 

The Baumslag-Solitar groups $B(1,n)$ for $n\ge 2$ can be ordered, even with a total order. Indeed, all orderings have been classified in this case, see C. Rivas: On spaces of Conradian group orderings. Here is one way to obtain an ordering for $B(1,n)$. Start with an exact sequence $$ 0 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}\rightarrow BS(1,n) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}[1/n]\rightarrow 0, $$ and define bi-orderings from this: $(k,r/n^j)\succ id$ iff either $k>0$ or $k=0$ and $r/n^j>0$. Another way to see the result is to note that $B(1,n)$ embedds into the affine group, and hence obtains such an ordering (see Alain Valette's remark). 

Yes, we can conjugate $B_1$ and $B_2$ simultaneously by a matrix $S$, whose columns are a basis of generalized eigenvectors of $B_1$, such that $S^{-1}B_1S$ is in Jordan normal form, and both $S^{-1}B_1S$, $S^{-1}B_2S$ are upper-triangular. This is possible, because commuting operators leave invariant generalized eigenspaces. On the other hand, not both of $B_1$ and $B_2$ can be simultaneously "Jordanized" in general. For non-commuting strictly upper-triangular matrices $B_1$ and $B_2$, we may still apply $S^{-1}B_1S$ with those invertible $S$ which keep $B_2$ upper-triangular. Then we may not arrive at a Jordan form for $B_1$, but to an "almost-Jordan-form", see section $2$ of the article Modules for certain Lie algebras of maximal class. 

Profinite groups were first called "Groups of Galois type", see J.P. Serre's book "Cohomologie Galoisienne" of $1964$. The term "profinite" comes from Serre (if I am not mistaken). Of course, some profinite groups have a much older history, e.g., already Hensel defined in $1910$ the $p$-adic integers during his studies of algebraic numbers. As to the definition, a profinite group is a Hausdorff, compact, and totally disconnected topological group. The other (equivalent) definition, better adapted to the name "profinite", is, that a profinite group is a group which is isomorphic to the inverse limit of an inverse system of discrete finite groups. 

Concerning the related question, which has not been addressed so far: the space of $p$-chains for a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over a field $K$ is given by $C_p(\mathfrak{g},N)=\Lambda^p\mathfrak{g}\otimes_K N$ for any $\mathfrak{g}$-module $N$ and any integer $p\ge 0$. The homology is given by the homology of the complex of $p$-chains together with the usual boundary maps $\partial_p\colon C_p(\mathfrak{g},N)\rightarrow C_{p-1}(\mathfrak{g},N)$, i.e., $H_p(\mathfrak{g},N)=\ker \partial_p/{\rm im} \,\partial_{p+1}$. Now if $\mathfrak{g}$ is abelian of dimension $n$ then the boundary map simplifies quite a lot, and one can use this to compute the homology. For example, for the trivial module $K$ we obtain $H_p(\mathfrak{g},K)=\Lambda^p\mathfrak{g}$ for $p\le n$. Alternatively, $H_n(\mathfrak{g},N)=Tor_n^{U(\mathfrak{g})}(N,K)=Tor_n^{S(\mathfrak{g})}(N,K)$, because $U(\mathfrak{g})=S(\mathfrak{g})$ for abelian $\mathfrak{g}$. 

The ring of integers $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]$ is an UFD if and only if the class number of $\mathbb{Q}[\zeta_p]$ is $1$. This is the case if and only if $p\le 19$. For bigger primes $p$ the class numbers $h(p)$ grow rapidly: $$ h(23)=3, \; h(29)=8, \; h(31)=9, \ldots ,h(89)=13379363737, $$ $$ h(137)=646901570175200968153, etc. $$ 

Let $S$ be a family of finite sets. Say that $S$ is 1-dimensional if there exists a sequence of sets $W_j$, for $j=1,2,\dots$, such that for every $j$: 

Each vertex in a graph is randomly and independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. A coloring is called $r$-good, for some fraction $r\in[0,1]$, if at least a fraction $r$ of the edges touch at least one red vertex. Define $p(G,r)$ as the probability that a graph $G$ is $r$-good. Obviously $p(G,r)$ is decreasing with $r$. What is the largest $r$ such that $p(G,r)>1/2$ for all finite graphs $G$? There is an upper bound of $2/3$ (as noted by Kevin P. Costello) and a lower bound of $1/2$. 

So the question now becomes: is this always possible to find such $g_1,g_2$ when $f_1,f_2$ are strictly quasiconcave*? Reminder: $f$ is quasiconcave iff $\forall x,y: \forall r\in(0,1): f(r x + (1-r) y)\geq \min(f(x),f(y))$. It is strictly quasiconcave iff $\forall x,y: \forall r\in(0,1): f(r x + (1-r) y)> \min(f(x),f(y))$. 

If $H$ is a chain (each set of $H$ either contains or is contained in any other set of $H$) then $H$ is simple. Proof: Suppose $H\cap g$ contains the set $\{x\}$. Then some set $h\in H$ contains $x$ and not $y$. Every other set in $H$ either contains $h$ (so it also contains $x$), or is contained in $h$ (so it does not contain $y$). So, $H\cap g$ does not contain $\{y\}$. More generally, if $H$ is a collection of disjoint chains, then $H$ is simple. The proof is similar: if some set $h\in H$ contains $x$ and not $y$, then every other set in $H$ either contains $h$ (so it also contains $x$), or is contained in $h$ (so it does not contain $y$) or is disjoint from $h$ (so it contains neither $x$ nor $y$). In all cases $H\cap g$ does not contain $\{y\}$. More generally, suppose $H$ has the following tree structure: it contains the empty set as the "root"; this root has several children which are singletons; each singleton $\{z\}$ has as children several pairs that contain $z$; and so on. A set is a child of another set if it contains it; there are no intersections between sets except through the edges of the tree. Then, $H$ is simple. Proof: Suppose $H\cap g$ contains the set $\{x\}$. Then some set $h\in H$ contains $x$ and not $y$. If some other set $h'\in H$ contains $\{x,y\}$, then $h'$ must be a descendant of $h$ in the tree, so there is no other set which contains only $y$, so $H\cap g$ does not contain $\{y\}$. 

$\newcommand{\abs}[1]{\left|#1\right|}$ There is a population $O$ with a countable (finite or infinite) number of subjects. The population is colored randomly: for each subject, an unbiased coin-toss is used to decide whether the subject is colored red or green. Then, a sub-population containing $t$ subjects are selected; denote this sub-population by $T$ (so $T\subseteq O$ and $|T|=t$). Denote by $T^R$ the set of red subjects in $T$ and by $T^G$ the set of green subjects. The difference $\abs{|T^R|-|T^G|}$ denotes the imbalance caused by the randomization process. What is high-probability upper bound on this imbalance, as a function of $t$? There are two extreme cases: 

Let $s(n)$ denote the number of distinct crystallographic groups in $Isom(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Apparently the best known upper bound so far is $$ s(n)\le e^{e^{4n^2}}, $$ given by Peter Buser in $1985$. On the other hand, it is not difficult to see (using a fixed-point lemma by Burnside-Cachy) that the number of $n$-dimensional crystallographic groups in the arithmetic class of the group of diagonal matrices has the asymptotic value $$ \frac{2^{n(n-1)}}{n!}. $$ This should give a lower bound for $s(n)$. Moreover, this class seems to be quite large in general, so that I have the feeling that the upper bound of Buser is not yet optimal. What is known about lower and upper bounds for $s(n)$ ? Is it possible to use some other results on bounds of conjugacy classes of finite groups (since $s(n)$ is related to that by the number of conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of $GL(n,\mathbb{Z})$) ? Update: Are there upper bounds known for the number of $n$-dimensional Bieberbach groups (torsionfree crystallographic groups), better than Buser's bound ? 

Why is it true that with $x\in \mathfrak{m}$ also $p(x)\in \mathfrak{m}$ for all polynomials $p(x)$ without constant term ? The proof I know just uses the Jordan decomposition $x=x_s+x_n$, and shows for the eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of $x_i$, that $P(ad x_s)=ad (y)$ for a certain interpolation polynomial $P$ without constant term, and $y$ a certain matrix depending on $\lambda_i$. Then basically $0=tr (xy)=f(\lambda_1)^2+\cdots +f(\lambda_r)^2$, with linear form $f$ defined on the span of the $\lambda_i$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ gives $f=0$, hence all $\lambda_i=0$, so that $x=x_s+x_n=x_n$ is nilpotent. 

Heaton showed that if the field $K$ has characteristic zero, then all polynomial cocycles are coboundaries. In characteristic $p$ this is not always the case, but the following result holds (which you may know already). THEOREM: For $n> 2$ and $K$ a field of characteristic $p$, every polynomial $n$-cocycle over $K$ of degree less than $p$ in the first indeterminate and less than $p-1$ in the second is a coboundary. It is not possible to relax the requirements given in the above theorem on the degrees; there are counterexamples, see R. Heaton: A Note on Polynomial Cocycles, Math. Zeitschr. 76, 2357-239 (1961). For a modern application, see for example chapter $1$ on formal groups (and symmetric polynomial cocycles) in the lecture notes on Shimura Varieties (class of Robert Kottwitz), see $URL$ under "Other Writings". 

I have the impression that even nowadays the term "metabelian" can be confusing if you talk about. Although I would also say, that it means $2$-step solvable now most of the time, it still can mean $2$-step nilpotent sometimes. In particular, "metabelian Lie algebras" can still mean $2$-step nilpotent Lie algebras, see the following (and other) articles: M. A. Gauger: On the Classification of Metabelian Lie Algebras (1973). E. M. Luks: What is the typical nilpotent Lie algebra ? (1977). L. Y. Galitski and D. A. Timashev: On the Classification of Metabelian Lie Algebras (1999). This is not an answer in the historical sense, but only a comment with too long references (which should perhaps belong to meta, if abelian belongs here).
