I've wondered about this for many, many, years..... maybe there's an answer (or several answers?) after all. As the global economy is set up, one reason a person in the US and EU can afford a nice new \$400 smartphone is because the cost is much lower than \$400. The cost is much lower in part due to mechanisation of the process (assembly line robotics, efficient bulk transport, etc) but largely because the people assembling it (summing down the supply chain) are paid at a rate that equates to considerably less than $400 per device pro-rata. Put another way, some people's ability to buy expensive items is because (largely for historical reasons) many people in other places live in economies where the average earnings, cost of living, and expectations of things needed to be bought, are a lot less. And put another way again, it's essentially akin to the laws of thermodynamics - a bit like a consequence of some kind of "work being done as a result of non-entropy"; the living standard and expectation of being able to buy such things, in some countries, is a result of differentials between those countries and other countries. (This also would apply to all items that can be transported - food, for example, as well). But suppose these differentials didn't exist. Suppose the person who mined the copper and gold and rare earths, the person who shipped it, the assembly factory and sellers and other persons involved in its production, were to have wages with the same buying power (on average) as those who buy the devices? Equivalently, suppose everyone on the planet were to have parity of buying power with their wages. Ignore disruptions such as trade barriers, differences in health and age, etc, and any transient effects that will level out over time, for simplicity. Or put it another way, suppose one created a city with a closed economy, and in which all people can afford to buy the same things (same wages). Now, your factory worker making iPhones wants to buy an iPhone, and can - because all persons in the supply chain are paid in the same dollars and with the same amount as the end consumers of iPhones for their various works), do we get a situation where everything is inevitably pushed out of price reach (due to resulting inherent inflation)? Does the sum of people's time equating to the sum of people's income (in some sense) mean that the community as a whole can only afford to buy things at cost? Does the ability actually to buy things depend inherently on differences between different people (and groups of people) having higher and lower purchasing power or value of money? What would happen? So a factory can mechanise, but the persons designing and creating the mechanisation (computers, software, factory robotics) also have wages of identical value, so that might be no solution. Would the removal of value-of-money differentials, wage differentials, and buying power (and freedom to buy) differentials, kill the ability of an economy to work? If not, what happens? (Sorry if the question is poorly phrased, I don't know how to rigorously define the point I'm asking about) 

The inflation tax is a one-dimensional instrument. Your income tax may depend for example on household size, since the government believes that if your income is shared by a large family, you should pay less taxes. Or the amount of VAT you pay will in many countries depend whether you spend it on luxury cars or food. An inflation tax cannot make such distinctions. This is probably the prime answer to almost all questions of the kind "why don't we simplify taxation by doing X". It would be not very hard to remove a lot of bureaucratic costs by simplifying taxation systems. But the result will often conflict with what the population/government perceives as "fair". Inflation taxes are (more or less) equivalent to taxes on cash holdings. However, cash holdings for example in the U.S. are less than 1/20 of annual GDP. Thus, you would need massive inflation taxes of about 200% to get anywhere near the current federal government revenue (>10% of GDP). At this point it is no longer clear (read: very unlikely) whether the reduction in bureaucracy outweighs the costs of inflation. It is hard to create reliable institutions which would guarantee a fixed stream of income to the current government and resist pressure from the government to increase this income. Even in countries with independent central banks, it is not uncommon for political parties to argue for reducing central bank independence. The costs of tax reforms: this is maybe the most interesting answer to the question why switching from inefficient system A to efficient system B may be...inefficient! Suppose you just sold your house and gave a credit to the person who bought the house. You plan to live from mortgage payments of the new house owner. The next day the government announces that it will switch to an inflation based system of government revenue. Suddenly, the mortgage payments are almost worthless. The loss is of course equivalent to the gain of the new house owner. However, this redistribution may conflict with the government's redistribution goal. The government then must expend costly effort to reverse the distributional effects of the tax reform. If these costs are too high, it is inefficient to switch from A to B, even though in the long run B may be more efficient. 

This means items of daily use did not experience price increases as much as items that are not of daily use. Let's say half expenditures are on items of daily use. Then an increase of 2.2 percentage points will make these contribute 1.1 percentage points in total inflation. To make numbers match, the remaining 3.4 percentage points of total inflation must then have been contributed by a 6.8 percentage point price increase in items not of daily use. 

Actually there is a large literature on the estimation of production functions. Usually, one starts out with assuming a particular functional form (CES, Cobb-Douglas, etc.) and then estimating the parameters of the model. As indicated, the mathematics of this estimation are often nontrivial. However, here are some early references which can provide you with an entry point to the literature: Aigner, D., Lovell, C. K., & Schmidt, P. (1977). Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models. Journal of Econometrics, 6(1), 21-37. FÃ¸rsund, F. R., Lovell, C. K., & Schmidt, P. (1980). A survey of frontier production functions and of their relationship to efficiency measurement. Journal of Econometrics, 13(1), 5-25. 

I'm looking at data for an online shop with clothing items listed at different prices. I'd like to use this information to do some kind of profit maximization (i.e. I'd like to have some understanding of the impact on sales if I raise/lower price of an individual item). Unfortunately, I don't have information of the variety "Q sales for clothing item X at price P" for a variety of prices; this would be hard to estimate due to the small number of items in each category. However, I do have a distribution of sales vs. price and the distribution of price of items in the shop. I'm thinking if I compute $$ \frac{\text{% of all sales at this price}}{\text{% of available items at this price}} $$, that gives me something analogous to a "quantity demanded". For simplicity, I bucketed the prices and sales into $5 increments. Having done this and doing your traditional log-linear fit $ \ln(P) = a\ln(Q)+b $ I get a pretty good fit and a reasonable number (around $-.9$). Question 1: Does my methodology make sense? If so, what did I just calculate? I feel like it's an "aggregate" price elasticity of all items in the shop. The clothing items for sale are mostly substitutable with each other, the price elasticity of an individual item must be a lot higher (since there are substitutes available). Question 2: Is there a way to figure the "average" price elasticity of each item from this (approximating that they all have about the same price elasticity)? EDIT: Based on the suggestion from @optimal-control and @NickJ, it appears the issue is that I don't really have a good model of what's going on. Here's what I'm imagining: Suppose you have $n$ unique items, each with a fixed price $p$. Each item has a limited supply available $s$. I observe $q(p, t)$ sales for each unique item, limited by $s$. Let's say $q(p, t)$ is something like a homogeneous poisson process, for simplicity. The above is starting to look like a markdown optimization problem; I could imagine finding an optimal price for each item based on these factors and my cost structure (storage cost, time value of money, etc.), if I could, say, change prices and estimate the change in $q(p, t)$. Unfortunately, this function is so small, and $s$ is so small (maybe 1 to 5 items) that this may be impossible to estimate. What I'm trying to figure out is some way to estimate the response of $q(p, t)$ with respect to $p$ without modifying prices, off of the assumption that the $n$ items are partial substitutes for one another. If they were perfect substitutes, I would expect ALL of my lowest price items to sell out, and then my next lowest, etc. going on upward and I could use these results to estimate $q(p, t)$. But clearly this isn't the case, because some more expensive items sell first. The problem is, $q(p, t)$ is dependent on the mix of items and prices available. Any thoughts on how to approach this? 

Let me just add some observations which are too long for a comment. It seems that the description of demand with linear utility as a step function seems not quite correct. In fact, what we get instead is a demand correspondence. The step function "jumps" at the step $w_x=w_y$, while the correct demand correspondence includes all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ at the step. Moreover, the selection of demand (possibly better termed Marshallian demand) as an additional feature is good, but I think the table would be more useful if there are (possibly hidden until manually opened) the indirect utility function, the Hicksian demand and the expenditure function in the graph. Aside from the mentioned CES, quasilinear and translog utility, I would add the isoelastic utility $u(x,y)=x^a+y^b$. Note that if we start including utility functions over lotteries, we may also expand the tables by preferences over time, i.e. rational/hyperbolic discounting, etc. Finally, I think the generalization of the current functions to $n$ goods rather than two should not complicate the table but adds generality. (Also possible as additional entries). Edit: I also just realized that the current demand for the Leontief utility is wrong. It should be $I w_x/(p_yw_y+p_xw_x)$ for good $x$. What is currently given as the demand is instead the indirect utility $I/(p_yw_y+p_xw_x)$. The demand functions for the linear (and similarly the max function) can be written as $\begin{cases} I/p_x, & p_x w_x \leq p_yw_y \\ 0, & p_x w_x>p_yw_y \end{cases}$ The assumptions of the consumption problem should also be clearly stated (budget constraint, maximization problem) 

In classical economic models prices have no effect on economic variables. Thus, high inflation would be fully compensated by changes in the exchange rate. However, in models with frictions, this is no longer the case. For example, in a model with sticky prices the inflation rate does affect exports. Suppose that each seller can reset prices with some fixed probability in each time period (Calvo-type price setting). Then in a country with high inflation, the seller will choose a price that is much higher than the current efficient price. The reason is that the seller anticipates price level increases in future time periods in which he cannot reset prices. However, if the seller has not reset his prices for a long time, his prices will be too low since inflation has decreased the real price over time. Note that these inefficient prices are not compensated by the exchange rate, since the exchange rate can at most compensate for the inefficient price of a single seller. We have now seen that high inflation rates can lead to inefficient prices, but sometimes these prices may also be too low and thus should encourage sellers abroad. However, two empirical facts may explain why trading partners abroad may avoid buying from high-inflation countries. First, many sales contracts are made for longer terms. Second, countries with higher inflation usually also have a higher inflation volatility. Both these points add significant risks to buyers and sellers in addition to the aforementioned inefficient pricing. Therefore, the reason why buyers may prefer sellers from countries with less inflation (if true), may simply be risk aversion.
