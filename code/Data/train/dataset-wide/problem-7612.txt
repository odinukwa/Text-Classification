If you are willing to allow uncountable generalizations of Fraisse's/Hrushovski construction then the conditions you need essentially are those that make up an Abstract Elementary Class. Abstract elementary classes are a framework for studying abstract logics introduced by Shelah and generalize many important known examples of logics. As for the relationship to set theory, Will Boney has recently proved from large cardinals the Shelah's categoricity conjecture (see Tameness). If you are willing to generalize just a little further then you get the notion of an accessible category. Accessible categories have strong connections to Vopenka's principle. 

I would like to second Andrej's answer as that was my first instinct as well. However I thought I would also give some links to related concepts. In particular if you are willing to change the natural numbers to some other set and use a different "notion of computability" then this idea appears in several places. For example: Represented spaces and Type Two Effectivity (TTE) Underlying set: Baire space ($\omega^\omega$) Notion of Computable Function: Extensions of computable functions from $\omega^{<\omega}$ to $\omega^{<\omega}$.

I'll flesh out the consequences of Gerald's comment in a (CW-ed) answer. Lindenstrauss, Olsen, and Sternfeld showed in 1978 that if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are compact metrisable simplices such that the extremal points of $S_i$ are dense in $S_i$ for $i=1,2$, then there is an affine homeomorphism from $S_1$ to $S_2$; the unique (up to affine homeomorphism) compact metrisable simplex with the property that its extremal points are dense is called the Poulsen simplex. In that same paper, it was shown that the Poulsen simplex has the property that its set of extremal points is arc-connected. Since $\mathcal{M}$ is a compact metrisable simplex whenever $X$ is a compact metric space and $f\colon X\to X$ is continuous, and the extremal points of $\mathcal{M}$ are precisely the ergodic measures $\mathcal{M}^e$, it follows that $\mathcal{M}^e$ is arc-connected whenever it is dense in $\mathcal{M}^e$. In particular, the strong specification property introduced by Bowen implies that periodic orbit measures are dense in $\mathcal{M}^e$ (Sigmund 1974), and since such measures are ergodic, this implies that $\mathcal{M}$ is the Poulsen simplex, and hence $\mathcal{M}^e$ is arc-connected, whenever $(X,f)$ has strong specification. So that's not quite as constructive a proof as the approach following (Sigmund 1977) as suggested in Andrey's answer and the comment following, but it's certainly simpler to write down based on existing results. 

I have emailed technical support at MathSciNet. Unfortunately they do not know how to search for a string containing a *, as * is interpreted as a wild card. However, if you know the word before and after the * then you can use the proximity search tool adjN which is a stand in for at most N-1 words. For example, searching for "C adj2 algebra" will find "$C^*$-algebra", as well as "l.m.c. algebras". 

Suppose $B, \{A_i: i \in \omega\}$ are i.i.d. random variables with uniform distributions on $[0,1]$. If $f$ is a map such that $\{f(A_i, B): i \in \omega\}$ are independent, must $\{f(A_i, B): i \in \omega\}$ also be independent of $B$? 

Note one reason "continuous" can be thought of as "notion of computation" is a function from reals to reals is continuous if and only if it is computable relative to some oracle. For more on effective analogs of continuous functions (and more complicated functions) 

the endpoints of $I$ are fixed by every map in $\mathcal{C}$; the maps in $\mathcal{C}$ are strictly increasing; $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under composition; every positive real number appears exactly once as the ratio of the derivatives of $\mathcal{C}$ at the right and left endpoints of $I$. 

Poking through the DGS book mentioned in Ian's answer I came along a reference to a paper that turns out to be exactly what I wanted when I asked this question originally, so I'll post it here for the sake of closure and because it's a nice example. The paper is by Wolfgang Krieger: On the uniqueness of the equilibrium state, Mathematical Systems Theory 8 (2), 1974, p. 97-104. The example is the Dyck shift, which is easiest to understand in terms of brackets. The alphabet of the shift is a collection of $2n$ symbols that come in $n$ pairs; each pair has a left element and a right element. So with $n=2$ we can write the four symbols as ( ) [ ]. The shift space $X$ comprises all sequences on these symbols in which the brackets are "opened and closed in the right order". So for example, ( ) [ ] is a legal word, as is ( ( ( ) [ ] [, but ( [ [ ) is illegal because the ( bracket cannot be closed before the [ brackets are. Sticking with $n=2$, let $B_-\subset X$ be the set of all sequences in which every left bracket has a corresponding right bracket, and $B_+$ be the set of all sequences in which every right bracket has a corresponding left bracket. One can show that every shift-invariant measure has $\mu(B_- \cup B_+) = 1$ by partitioning the complement into a countable collection of disjoint sets indexed by the location of the first/last left/right bracket with no partner. Define a map $\pi_+\colon B_+ \to \{0,1,2\}^\mathbb{Z}$ by sending ( to 0, [ to 1, and both ) and ] to 2. Then $\pi_+$ is an isomorphism between the two shift spaces because every right bracket has a corresponding left bracket, and hence its identity as ) or ] is uniquely determined by the rules of the shift. Similarly, the analogous map $\pi_- \colon B_- \to \{0,1,2\}^\mathbb{Z}$ is an isomorphism. Because every ergodic invariant measure on $X$ is supported on either $B_-$ or $B_+$, we conclude that $h(X) = \log 3$ and that there are exactly two ergodic measures of maximal entropy $\mu_{\pm} = \nu \circ \pi_{\pm}$, where $\nu$ is the $(\frac 13, \frac 13, \frac 13)$-Bernoulli measure on the full 3-shift. Each of these measures gives positive measure to every open set in $X$, and each is of positive entropy -- indeed, each is Bernoulli, which is part of what makes this answer so satisfying to me. Note that for larger values of $n$ the same argument shows that $h(X) = \log(n+1)$. 

One of the nice features of the first admissible ordinal after $\omega$, i.e. $\omega_1^{CK}$, is that it is the collection of ordinals whose order type is that of a computable well-ordering on $\omega$. Is a similar thing true for all other admissible sets? Specifically suppose $\alpha$ is an admissible ordinal, $\alpha^+$ is the next admissible after $\alpha$ and $\alpha \leq \gamma < \alpha^+$. Is there always an $\alpha$-computable well-ordering on $\alpha$ of order type $\gamma$? If so can someone also provide a reference for the result? 

How much of the theory of C*-algebras holds when the complex numbers are replaced by different (algebraically closed) field (possibly with a distinguished ordered subfield that satisfies the same properties as the reals)? Examples of some fields for which I would be interested in knowing if there are known analogs include (but aren't limited to): 

The comments by Andreas and Anton give you the answer already to your specific question. Let me give a more general answer, since your question is very representative of a whole class of examples. The condition that $x_n = 1 \Rightarrow x_{n+1} = 0$ is a Markov condition: the value of $x_{n+1}$ is restricted by the value of $x_n$. In your case you are considering all sequences in $\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ such that the symbol $1$ cannot follow itself; one could also consider more symbols and more complicated restrictions, such as "every occurrence of $2$ can only be followed by $0$ or $2$, but not $1$". See $URL$ for more details. Subshifts of finite type (abbreviated SFTs) are also called topological Markov chains, and can be presented in terms of a transition matrix, as described in that Wikipedia article. The logarithm of the largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix is an important quantity called the topological entropy of the SFT. When you construct a subset of the Cantor set as in your question, the topological entropy turns out to be directly related to the Hausdorff dimension: namely Hausdorff dimension is topological entropy divided by $\log \lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the contraction ratio at each step of the construction of the Cantor set. We wrote a more detailed description of this in Pesin & Climenhaga, "Lectures on fractal geometry and dynamical systems", or you can find many parts of it in most standard textbooks on dynamical systems. 

Suppose $T$ is a complete first order theory with a finite axiomatization. Must $T$ be $\aleph_0$-categorical? If not are there any simple examples of finitely axiomatized complete first order theories which are not $\aleph_0$-categorical? 

It is worth noting that if $T$ is a first order theory or a sentence of $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$ (2) can't happen. This is connected with Barr's Covering Theorem. Next I want to talk about your question on the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem and your observation about in local presentability giving a notion of cardinality in a Grothendieck topos. While the notion of presentability does give a nice notion of size in a Grothendieck topos, once we are in this framework there are several other notions of size which are useful. For a discussion of several of them as well as several model theoretic results that lift to Grothendieck toposes (including the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem) you might look at: On transferring model theoretic theorems of $L_{\infty, \omega}$ in the category of sets to a fixed Grothendieck topos. This paper also discusses Morley's theorem on the number of models in a Grothendieck topos: The Number Of Countable Models In Categories of Sheaves. Also if you are interested in model theory in realizability toposes you can also check out: The Number Of Countable Models In A Realizability Topos. While the specific case of presentability rank isn't discussed in these papers it should be relatively straightforward to prove a Lowenheim-Skolem theorem with respect to presentability rank. Specifically, given a theory $T$ which has a model in a Grothendieck topos $G$ it should be relatively straight forward to find a model with presentability rank at most $|T| + |(C, J)|$ where $G \cong Sh(C, J).$ Roughly the argument should go something like the following: 

Note that not all vertices may be accessible from the original vertex $(0,0)$, and so you actually are only concerned with a subset of $\mathbb{N}^2$. Note also that there are two "distinguished rays" in the graph. One of these corresponds to incrementing $i$ at every step, and is labeled with the sequence $a$. The other corresponds to incrementing $j$ at every step, and is labeled with the sequence $b$. This corresponds to the characteristic sequence $z$ that determines the $\beta$-shift and appears in the graph as a ray to $\infty$. 

$\mu_k(K_\epsilon)>1-\epsilon$ for all $\epsilon$ and all large $k$, and hence the sequence $\mu_k$ is tight, so by Prohorov's theorem it has a convergent subsequence $\mu_{k_i}\to \mu$. If $D$ is a metric on the space of probability measures on $\Omega$ that induces the weak* topology, then $D(\mu, f_*\mu) \leq D(\mu,\mu_k) + D(\mu_k,f_*\mu_k) + D(f_*\mu_k,f_*\mu)$. The first term goes to zero along $k_i$ by the assumption on the subsequence. The second term goes to zero along $k$ because the empirical measures are averages over long orbit segments. The third term goes to zero because $f$ is continuous on $K_\epsilon$ and both $\mu$ and $\mu_k$ put nearly all their weight on $K_\epsilon$. Thus $D(\mu,f_*\mu)=0$ and so $\mu$ is $f$-invariant. 

Suppose there is a bag with $M$ white marbles and $N - M$ black marbles. Let $H(n, N, M)$ be a random variable which is number of white marbles in a draw, without replacement, of $n$ marbles from a bag. It is known (see [1]) that $$ Pr\left[ \frac{H(n, N, M)}{n} \geq \frac{M}{N} + t\right] \leq e^{-2t^2 n} $$ and $$ Pr\left[ \frac{H(n, N, M)}{n} \leq \frac{M}{N} - t\right] \leq e^{-2t^2 n} $$ I am looking for a similar lower bound to the left hand side. Specifically a function $f(n, N, M, t)$ such that 

You need to be a little careful here with what we mean by the relativization of a Grothendieck topos, but it is worked out in this paper: Relativized Grothendieck topoi. Finally by the Shelah conjecture, I assume you mean the "Shelah categoricity conjecture"? In general models of theories (even first order theories) inside a Grothendieck topos are like``models of a sentence of $L_{\infty, \omega}$ with a very little second order logic thrown in''. However to the best of my knowledge I don't think his eventual categoricity conjecture is even known for sentences of $L_{\omega_1, \omega}$ (although I could be wrong). If so this seems like a very hard problem in general. 

An easy calculus exercise gives the blue area as $\frac{a^p}p$ and the green area as $\frac{b^q}q$, hence their sum dominates the area $ab$ of the rectangle outlined in red. I learned this proof from Cohn's measure theory book, where it appears as an exercise (in Section 3.3). 

If I remember my infinite ergodic theory correctly, any measure-preserving transformation $T$ of a $\sigma$-finite measure space $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ leads to a decomposition of $\Omega$ into a dissipative part $\Omega_d$ and a conservative part $\Omega_c$. (This notation is probably non-standard.) The dissipative part is the union of the wandering sets for $T$, where a set $E$ is wandering if it is disjoint from all its preimages $T^{-n}(E)$, $n\geq 0$. The conservative part is thee complement of the dissipative part. On the dissipative part, everything "goes to infinity" in some sense (eventually leaves $\Omega_k$, for instance), while on the conservative part, the Poincare recurrence theorem holds. (Conservative measures are exactly those $\sigma$-finite measures for which the Poincare recurrence theorem still works.) I believe this establishes the dichotomy you want. This may even work for transformations that don't preserve $\mu$, but only preserve the collection of null sets. I'd check a reference on that, though -- details of all of this are in Aaronson's book An Introduction to Infinite Ergodic Theory.
