This answer is built on the answer by jmbejara. I really like the books he recommended in the last paragraph. They give you an general overview of the landscape on the mathematics involved in macroeconomics. And immediately you get the following feeling. Economists do not have the background enough to really understand most of the methods they use. They take a more pragmatical, albeit superficial, view of mathematics. Just see the disparity of mathematical areas are crammed into any of those books. From measure theory, to PDE, ODE, Stochastic Calculus/Optimization - these for the solving of the models; Bayesian Statistics, Multivariate Time Series, etc. (for the more empirical part of the work, like model simulation, calibration, etc.). Intersect them all, and right there in the middle, you'll find the mathematics of macroeconomics. It's almost impossible for economists to have a barely decent understanding of a so many diverse fiels, with their background which more than probably just consists of 2 calculus courses, 2 statistics courses and 2 to 3 econometric courses. Just watch any webcast from AEA with renown researchers, and you'll be amazed at the lack of precision, and exactly wonder how they are able to use some mathematical methods when they understanding of it is so superficial... I know I'm venting a bit out my accumulated frustration, but since it seems that you're relatively inexperienced in the area, I thought my personal point of view might help you, even though I usually study by myself. Maybe with a formal education, things would be different, but I seriously doubt it. I'll give two book recommendations for Time Series: For univariate and small intro to multivariate, you have a great introductory book by Brockwell and Davis. For multivariate time series, choose Lütkepohl, it's the best of the whole group. 

Here's the Sims(2002) paper How does one deduce equation (39) from that paper? Any help would be appreciated. 

In this VOXEU article, the authors talk about a model in which behaviour economics is applied to macroeconomics. I'm trying to understand fig.1, and the following sentence: «This means that if the central bank keeps its inflation control unchanged, increasing flexibility creates a new trade-off, which is negatively sloped – that is, more flexibility then reduces output volatility at the expense of more inflation variability.» Why is there a trade-off when b2 increases? doesn't the std dev of inflation gap decreases as the std dev of output gap decreases? where's the trade-off? I just don't see how there's a trade-off when the flexibility parameter b2 increases... Also, the authors sometimes say that b2 is the «sensitivity of inflation to the output gap», and others «[wage/price] flexibility». Any help would be appreciated. 

Model with dependent variable $y_t$ implies that $\log(y_t)$ is not linear in the parameters. Model with dependent variable $\log(y_t)$ implies that $y_t$ is not linear in the parameters. 

I've taken the data from the FRED. One can notice that the observations were taken monthly for some variables, and for others were taken quarterly. Some begin in the 40's, while others begin in the 50's. However, the formulas in the book assume the same time period $t$. Hence, what I did was to discover the intersection of the dates of all observations, i.e. quarterly data beginning from the 50's, and cleaned the data accordingly. Now, I'm using the formulas in the book to create those new variables, namely per capita real output, annualized inflation, and federal funds rate. My doubt resides on whether my procedure was correct. 

What are the effects of quantitative easing on the foreign exchange rates? If the central bank starts buying debt denominated in domestic currency, I would think that the market would be flooded with domestic currency, making it less valuable with respect to other currencies. Are there any other effects which I'm not taking into account? Any help would be appreciated 

Solvency: Long-term liabilities are covered by assets(with value measured at maturity, not at market-to-market) Liquidity: short-term liabilities are covered by assets which can be sold in the short-term. Is this it? Should CB lend to insolvent banks? or only to solvent but illiquid banks? This related to the problem of moral hazard, where if banks are being bailed out, more can think that their liability side is being covered by the CB/Government... 

where $D$ is the spending independent of $Q$. From this, how we can conclude $\Delta y < \Delta y_{BT}$? Any help help would be appreciated. 

Let's define elasticity, in a regression setting, as $\frac{\partial \log E(y|u)}{\partial \log x_j }$. How do we relate this definition to the percentage change interpretation, i.e., seeing this elasticity as the approximate change in $E(y|x)$, when $x_j$ increases by 1 percent? I'm reading Wooldridge. Any help would be appreciated. 

I'm trying to understand how the solutions of a DSGE model can be seen as VAR or VARMA. Can you give examples of DSGE model solutions which can be seen as such? Also, does this only happen when we use linear methods, or also with non-linear methods? Any help would be appreciated. 

123, the CF method is a specific case of when we have generated regressors. Check the appendix to chapter 6, pages 157-160, for the asymptotic covariance matrix of $N^{1/2}(\hat\beta_{CF}-\beta)$. The expression is truly enormous. ;) Instead I will just cite wooldridge on page 160, 2nd paragraph: «If $\mathbf{G}\neq \mathbf{0}$, then (...). Neither the usual 2SLS variance matrix estimator nor the heteroskedasticity-robust form is valid in this case.»The $\mathbf{G}\neq \mathbf{0}$ is the case when we have generated regressors. Good luck ;) 

What is there that links computational Bayesian statistics and Economics(preferably macro)? I'm looking for a primer or gentle introduction on the matter. It doesn't need to go into much detail. Any help would be appreciated. 

I was watching a show on economics, and the guests stated that the way structural deficits measured by the IMF and European Comission usually give antagonic values, and worse, the corrections made to previous estimations may in fact indicate that previous advised policy was in fact wrong and in the opposite sense. Well, I'm looking for some references that show how both institutions measure structural deficits, and why are they problematic. Any help would be appreciated. 

Let's suppose we have linear regression with dependent variable $ln(y)$. How would one find a prediction interval for $E(y|X_0)$ ? If we have $PI(E(ln(y)|X_0))$, is there a way to reach $PI(E(y|X_0))$? Any help would be appreciated. 

Let's consider a Mundell-Fleming model for the short-run, with flexible exchange rates. Now, if we have a monetary contraction (or expansion), the exchange rate path will differ whether we're in the presence of rational expectations or not, and if the goods market adjust slowly. Realistically, there are empirical evidence that the goods markets adjust slowly. In this case, if the agents are not forward-looking, then there's a slow adjustment of the exchange rate until there's an equilibrium. But when the agents are rational, the expected exchange rate is immediately the equilibrium exchange rate, and with a slow adjustment from goods market, there will be an overshoot(difference between the actual exchange rate and equilibrium one) for some periods, before reaching the equilibrium. With a rapid adjustment in the goods market, the output would go immediately to equilibrium. My question is what implications have a bigger or smaller period of overshooting/adjustment for the equilibrium exchange rate? Are there also some empirical studies on this? Any help would be appreciated. 

There's one way, albeit not from interest rates futures. From fisher's approximation $i=r+\pi^E$, and thus if I know the nominal interest rate from a regular government bond, and subtract the (real)interest rate of an inflation protected bond - like TIPS - we get the market's expected inflation forecast. 

I'm having some difficulty in understanding the following statement: «For example, if a bank has a capital cushion(or capital ratio) of 3%, then a loss of 1% in the value of assets wipes out 1/3 of the equity of the bank. However, if the bank equity amounts to 25% of assets, then a 1% fall in the value of assets wipes out only 4% of equity.» I'm not seeing the math behind this. I bet it's pretty simple, but I'm not seeing it... Any help would be appreciated. 

Where do transfer payments (unemployment subsidies, etc.) enter in the multiplier formula for the IS curve? The usual multiplier is of the form $\frac{1}{1-c(1-t)-m}$, where $c$ is the marginal propensity(m.p.) to consume, $m$ is m.p. to import, and $t$ is the tax rate. I've tried to see $t$ instead as net transfers rate, i.e. transfer payments minus taxes. But I'm not sure if it's the right way to think about this... Any help would be appreciated. 

From the above definitions for exports and imports, we're able to define the trade balance equilibrium output $y_{BT}=\frac{\sigma(Q)}{Qm(Q)}y^*$. So, assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition, we know that a depreciation in $Q$ will make the $y_{BT}$ to increase. I'm reading a textbook that states: assuming the world real interest rate $r^*$(=domestic real interest rate $r$) is constant, when the $Q$ increases, $y_{BT}$ will increase by more than the domestic output $y$. Well,I'm trying to check this assertion. For that I define IS (with keynesian consumption function) as $y=\frac{1}{1-c_1(1-t)+Qm(Q)}(c_0+I(r)+G+\sigma(Q)y^*)$. In this definition I'm trying to keep everything simple, i.e. no lags for the interest and exchange rate. So, when there's a depreciation in $Q$ from $Q_1 \rightarrow Q_2$, we have 

Has anyone ever read the book «Time Series and Panel Data Econometrics» by M. Hashem Pesaran? I'm trying to find a hardcopy near me, but I can't find it anywhere, even in libraries near where I live. Hence this question. How would you compare the treatment of the subject by him, and Hayashi or Wooldridge? For me the main good points in Hayashi was the mathematical clearness, and rigour. Every demonstration was very rigorous. However, the intuition for the use of certain objects like Instrument Variables, Panel Data, etc. was a bit lacking, also his treatment of time series was almost inexistent. With respect to Wooldridge, I really like the intuition he gives, but contrary to Hayashi, the proofs are not very rigorous, sometimes lacking in important(at least for me...) details. Also, he defines certain concepts in a very specific context, instead of giving a general definition and working with it right from the start. It's almost too ad-hoc. Also, there's almost no clear separation in the cycle: Motivation->Theorem->Proof->Examples/Properties->More Examples.( Repeat as needed) Well this was the opinion I made after reading most of Hayashi, and a few hundred pages from Wooldridge. Can someone help me to by telling me how the book by Pesaran would fit in the scale for someone who has this opinion on Hayashi and Wooldridge? 

What is the relationship between structural budget balance and the cyclically adjusted budget(CAB) balance? I know that $PB=\textit{CAB}+AS$, where $PB$ is primary budget, and $AS$ are the automatic stabilizers(tax revenues, unemployment benefits, etc. $AS$ term is counter-cyclical, i.e negative in recessions, positive in booms). My question is, how do I relate, mathematically, the structural budget and the CAB? Any help would be appreciated. 

(This is 3rd Part of a series questions under "Negative Interest Rates") Motivation: I've happen to stumble on two articles, with some weeks, that the central bank(CB) of switzerland, due to Russia ruble crisis, and , has decided to use a negative interest rate for reserve deposits of banks at the CB, to facilitate the exchange rate peg. Bank of Japan(BoJ) also seems have implemented a negative interest rate, even if for different reasons(not sure...). In all textbooks, the topic of negative interest rates is easily dismissed, or simply tought of as impossible, and so the authors work with non-negative lower bound(ex:deflation trap). Now, how is this negative rate going to affect the theory? Almost every part of the economic theory is going to be influenced by this. Hence I'm dividing my question into several. This part is for supply-side policy. With negative interest rates, what changes for supply-side policy(scope, effects, etc.) can we expect? Any help would be appreciated. 

I'm reading a book on macroeconomics, and on a chapter on the money market, when explaining how the central banks(CB) determine the interest rate, there is a balance sheet for the CB. In it, under the assets we have bonds, and under liabilities we have currency and bank reserves. My question is which bonds are these? Do these bonds belong to the same country that the CB belongs to? Isn't in this case the bond of the CB a liability/debt that will have to be repaid in the future? Because if so, it seems that we're just exchanging one liability (bond) for another (money). Or are these bonds from any entities other than the CB itself? Any help would be appreciated. 

In wage bargaining theory, in the context of matching theory, firms and workers can negotiate a Nash equilibrium by maximizing a function of firms' and workers' surplus - with the purpose of allowing voluntary unemployment?. Let's say we have an objective function $N_t$ and we're trying to maximize it with respect to wage rate and hours worked. Why do we insert the steady-state values of the surpluses in $N_t$? Any help would be appreciated. 

In these class notes, page 3, the author defines the stochastic discount factor as $M_t=\beta^t\frac{E_0(u'(C_{t+1}))}{u'(C_{0}))}$. I'm trying to find the rationale behind it. A cash flow at period t, is usually discounted by $\prod^t_{i=0} \frac{1}{1+r_i}$ (if I'm not mistaken). I was thinking of using equation (5) - in the notes - where we have that $\frac{1}{1+r_t}=\beta\frac{E_t(u'(C_{t+1}))}{u'(C_{t}))}$. However, since $\frac{E_{t-1}(u'(C_{t}))}{u'(C_{t})}\neq 1$, I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. Also, just below equation (10), the author states that $E_t(M_{t+1})=\beta\frac{E_t(u'(C_{t+1}))}{u'(C_{t}))}$. How is this possible? Isn't the tower property exactly the inverse: $I_0\subseteq I_t\implies E(E(M_{t+1}|I_t)|I_0)=E(M_{t+1}|I_0)$ ? Any help would be appreciated. 

What's a singular model in economics? I've tried google, but I didn't find a definition... In an article by Ingram et al (1994), they state: 

In reading a textbook on seigniorage, the authors define seigniorage as $\frac{\Delta H}{P}$, where $\Delta H$ is the change of high-powered money, and $P$ is the price level. In the IS-LM model, and assuming that H is proportional to money demanded, and assuming that factor/multiplier constant, we have that in the medium-run, the growth-rate of high-powered money is equal to the growth-rate of money supplied, which in turn is equal to inflation: $\gamma_H=\gamma_M=\pi$. What would happen if instead of the IS-LM model, the Central Bank(CB) was active/forward looking, and guided the economy by setting the interest rates, i.e. use an interest-rate rule, instead of passively adjusting the money supply? In this setting, except for abnormal times like today's, the medium-run equilibrium would be $\pi=\pi_T$, where $\pi_T$ is the inflation target of the CB. Can the CB use an interest-rate rule while monetary financing the government's fiscal stance? 

With high probability this question is duplicate, and I tried to find one already in the community, but I was unsuccessful. According to the Lucas Critique, in its more general terms, the problem with empirical macroeconomic models is that they are not invariant to policy changes, and hence we cannot take any policy conclusions out of them. My question then is why do we still use them? Any help would be appreciated. 

Our model: $y_t=X_t\beta+u_t$ Our error terms: $u_t=\rho u_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$ with $\epsilon_t\sim IID(0,\sigma^2)$, and $|\rho|<1$. This results in $y_t=\rho y_{t-1}+X_t\beta-\rho X_{t-1}\beta+\epsilon_t$. Why is this last model not linear in $\beta$ and $\rho$? Is it because the parameters are multiplied with each other in the 3rd term? or is there something else? Any help would be appreciated.
