You are doing intervals to put an intense load on your system. It's important to keep that load relatively constant to get the best benefit from them. You can also use this to tell if you need to stop early; when an interval gets lots slower than the previous one, you are done for the set (and perhaps for the day if you're doing multiple sets). I don't do running intervals, but when I do intervals on my bike, I see a 5% variance in power often. I wouldn't worry too much about small variances. 

Check out this website from Duke University. Please remember that eccentric strengthening exercises will put greater stress on your muscle fibers (extreme muscle soreness), thus you will need to start out easier (3 sets of 8-10 reps, 1-2 exercises for a few weeks) prior to moving towards the goal by doing 3 sets of 10-15 reps of 2-3 exercises 3 times per week as a regular routine. In addition, you may also want to check your nutrition by drinking more fluid, particularly your sodium (electrolytes) and eating your potassium (sweet potatoes has the most). This should do it! 

I know there already is an accepted answer to your question but I thought you might find the following link quite useful: Lower Body stretching Some of the ones from the link above that I prefer: 

For arm wrestling your going to want to work out the shoulder and arm muscles. Chair dips(Triceps) Narrow grip push ups(Triceps) Chin ups and Inverted Chin ups (Biceps) Push ups (Shoulders) Superman (Shoulders) General overall upper body strength will help. These exercises work more than one muscle which should only help and not harm your case. If it was me I would start a strength program that works the whole body. Buts thats just my opinion. Unfortunately the exercises I mentioned do not incorporate your 1.5 litre water bottle. (Perhaps fill it with water and drink from it during your rest periods) ;) 

To get lean (lose fat) and to gain muscle mass while also gaining strength seems hard at first; however, a carefully designed exercise program with proper nutrition can get you results as fast as in 10-12 weeks. It seems like you are doing what I would call a “typical” weight training program that I'm afraid you will not see the results that you are looking for. To save time and to make sure to utilize all major and minor muscle group during each workout, try supersetting. This way, you will be able to target more muscles while saving a lot of time. Each workout should last about 45-60 minutes, depending on how much you really need to rest between sets. Also, it’s okay to isolate the minor muscle group like curls and extension, but they can take up a lot of time, and that’s why it’s great to also supersetting them. By the way, you can do some cardio on the off days if you wanted, but I would recommend with shorter time (less than 30 minutes) and with higher intensity. Try this program instead: Male - Gain Muscle Mass - Gym - Intermediate Level Weeks 1-2 (3 days per week with one day of rest in between) - Total Body Toning Superset one - Dumbbell Squat Shoulder Press and Dumbbell Push-up Row Superset two –Barbell Squat and Dumbbell Decline Bench Press Superset three – Dumbbell Alternate Lunges and Lat Pull-down Superset four - Planks (front and sides) and Mountain Climber Pick the weight that will allow you to perform at least 12 reps but no more than 15 reps for weeks 1-2. Repeat 3 more sets before moving on to the next superset. Try to hold the planks (front and sides) and perform the mountain climber 30 secs each . Rest 60 seconds between sets and between superset. Weeks 3-7 (4 days per week with 2 on, 1 off, then 2 on) Day 1 and 4 - Chest, Back, Abs and Calves Superset one – Bench Press and Bent-over Barbell Row Superset two – Decline Dumbbell Bench Press and Lat Pull-down Superset three – Cable Cross-over and Seated Cable Row Superset four – Kneeling Stability Ball Rollout and Planks (front and sides) Superset five - Dumbbell Push-up Row and Seated Machine Leg Press Calf Raise Day 2 and 5 - Lower Body, Arms, Shoulder and Fat Burning Super set one – Dumbbell Lunge Tricep Extension and Mountain Climber Super set two – Dumbbell Squat Shoulder Press and Bent-over Dumbbell Fly Super set three – EZ Bar Curl and EZ Bar Skull Crush Super set four – Dumbbell Bicep Curl and Cable Tricep Push-down Super set five – Inchworm and High Knee Sprint Pick the weight that will allow you to perform at least 8 reps but no more than 12 reps for weeks 4-7. Repeat 2-3 more sets before moving on to the next superset. For kneeling stability ball, planks (front and sides), inchworm and high knee sprint, try to perform 30 secs each . Rest 60 seconds between sets and between superset. Weeks 8-12 (5 days per week including one day of high intensity cardio training with 2 on, one off, then 3 on) Days 1 and 4 - Major Muscle Group Superset one – Barbell Squat and Dumbbell Bench Press Superset two – Dumbbell Squat Shoulder Press and Lat Pull-down Superset three – Bench Press and Bent-over Barbell Row Super set four – Dumbbell Push-up Row and High Knee Sprint Superset five – Kneeling Stability Ball Rollout and Planks (front and sides) Days 2 and 5 - Minor Muscle Group Superset one – EZ Bar Bicep Curl and EZ Bar Skull Crush Super set two - Dumbbell Bicep Curl and Cable Tricep Push-down Superset three - Seated Leg Press Machine Calf Raise and Mountain Climber Superset four - Inchworm and High Knee Sprint Day 6 - High Intensity Cardio Training Sprint Intervals - either on treadmill or outside Try sprinting for 30 secs and jog for 30 secs on the treadmill for about 10 minutes Or try to do 100 meter dash and walk 100 meter dash (perform 10-20 times). Pick the weight that will allow you to perform at least 6 reps but no more than 10 reps for weeks 8-12. Repeat 2-3 more sets before moving on to the next superset. For kneeling stability ball, planks (front and sides), inchworm and high knee sprint, try to perform 30 secs each . Rest 60 seconds between sets and between superset. Eating is very important regarding how you want your body to feel and look, especially for the washboard abs and to have energy throughout the day. If I were you, I will just focusing on eating a lot more of these foods instead of buying all of the supplements due to cost and not-effective: whole eggs, mixed nuts, peanut butter, avocados, chicken breast, fish, sweet potatoes and to make sure to load up with lots of fruits and vegetables for the natural vitamins and minerals. Let me know how you feel after about 4 weeks into this program. Don't forget to warm-up! And for intermediate fitness levels, a good way to warm-up is to perform 2 sets of 10 of burpee push-ups each time prior to starting your workout. By the way, make sure you know how to perform each exercise properly to prevent injuries and for best results. You can find all of these exercises on youtube these days. Good luck and have fun! 

Coming from a kickboxing background, leg flexibility was quite important. I personally found the hurdle stretch, fantastic. I found it great for the hamstring muscle and also the lower back. However as pointed out in the comments there are some arguments against this exercise. Although I personally never had any issues with it. I did it twice a day 5 days a week for about 3 years and it never gave me any bother. 

If you are getting exhausted and fatigued after only 30 minutes, the problem isn't that you need an energy drink. The problem is that you are working out too hard. The fact that you are feeling tired later in the days would support that. The point of working out is to put training stress on your system. After you have done that, when you rest, you improve. High intensity workouts do have a place, but only after you have an existing base of workout. My suggestion is to back off your workout intensity so that you can do 60 minutes without being super-tired at the end. I'd also consider either backing off to 3 days a week or varying your workout from day to day. 

Learn the basics by doing body weight exercises (squat, push-ups, chin-ups, dips, lunges, etc.) until you can master the form and technique for a few sessions, then you can try resistance training with similar movement patterns (barbell squats, weighted push-ups, pull-ups, dumbbell lunges, etc.). It might be forth it if you have some friends with great experience regarding weight training to help you in the beginning to make sure you understand the basics (proper form and technique, breathing patterns, dosage, frequency, duration and simple eating plan). If your friend(s) cannot help you with this, I recommend you to find a local CSCS (Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialist) to work with you for a few weeks, perhaps months. But you do not have to meet every single day. You might want to start out training and learning with a CSCS once per week for 4 weeks, then once per month for another few months until you are comfortable to be on your own. This will ensure your goals are met! 

Personally I would say no, this is not enough to stay in good health. I would say that you are not consuming anywhere near enough calories. I am surprised you are only starting to feel the effects of this now. Assuming you are a male, I would recommend that with doing that amount of training you should consume (cleanly) closer to 2500-3000 calories. This is taken from the UK Department of Health Estimated Average Requirements (EAR). Its an average, so there are other factors to take into account(age, height etc), so you should use it as a guide. With this you will notice that you will have more energy. Also make sure you are getting enough rest. 8hrs sleep on average. And dont be afraid to take the odd day off to allow your body to recover. Exercising everyday for a month will have a big toll on the body, so rest plenty. 

The ratios do not change based on duration, the ratios change based on the intensity of the exercise. At low intensities, you can get nearly all of your energy from fat, but the amount of power that can be generated by fat is limited, so as you increase your intensity, you will need to start burning more carbohydrate, and therefore the ratio of carbohydrate to fat will increase. It might help to think of fat metabolism as a furnace that is very efficient but can't put out much heat; if you need to get the house warmer you might need to turn on the electric heater (carb metabolism) to produce extra heat. This is somewhat related to duration because long-duration events are generally at a lower intensity than short-duration events, and therefore will depend more on fat as an energy source. 

This problem is called "valgus" knee. Its is more common for females due to the anatomy - wider hip and slight larger Q angle. However, here are some very common problems for most people with valgus knee, especially during squatting and landing: 

It sounds like you may have sprained your TFCC. It is one of the most common wrist injuries when it comes to weight training, especially after doing lots and lots of pull-ups or push-ups. As a sports physical therapist, I would first recommend you to take away all painful activities, yes this includes the punching and doing pull-ups. Next, you should try to protect your wrist by wrapping it or wearing a wrist brace during weight training over the next 4 weeks or so. You can also substitute bent-over rows and overhand lat pull-down for the pull-ups. If things don't get better, you should go get it check out either by your orthopedist or by a physical therapist. For future references, you always want to train proximal stability (rotator cuff and scap stabilizers) for distal mobility. Secondly, you should not try to progress too fast, and in your case, it seems like that may be it. This progression may not be just by doing pull-ups, but also by doing lots and lots of repetitive motion that may cause stress and strain to the wrist (punching, push-ups, gripping and pulling things). Hope this helps! 

Hamstring Stretch Lie on floor with knees bent. Straighten one leg and slowly pull it towards you, clasping the thigh, calf or ankle. Keep knee slightly bent. Switch legs. Quad Stretch Lie down on your side using elbow for balance. Using other arm, slowly pull your foot towards your glutes, keeping both knees together and bent knee pointing down. Switch legs. Inner Thigh Stretch Sit on floor with feet pressed together. Keeping abs in, lean forward until you feel a gentle stretch in your inner thighs.
