Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected complex semisimple Lie group, and let $P\subseteq G$ be a parabolic subgroup. Suppose that $V$ is a $1$-dimensional complex $P$-representation and consider the associated complex line bundle $G\times_P V\rightarrow G/P$. Let $X\subseteq G\times_P V$ denote the complement of the zero-section. I would like to compute $H^*(X;\mathbb{C})$ in terms of the given data. My first attempt has involved identifying $X$ up to homotopy with a circle bundle over $G/P$. The Gysin sequence is then applicable. However, it becomes necessary to understand the maps $$H^i(G/P)\xrightarrow{\cup e} H^{i+2}(G/P),$$ where $e\in H^2(G/P)$ is the Euler class of the circle bundle. If one fixes a maximal torus and Borel $T\subseteq B\subseteq P$, then I think the Euler class equals the weight of the $T$-rep $V$ (where we are identifying $H^2(G/P)$ with $H^2(G/B)^{W_P}=Hom(T,\mathbb{C}^*)^{W_P}$). I would appreciate any advice concerning my approach. If you like, you may take $G$ to be simple, and you may take the $T$-weight to be the highest root. I would also appreciate any alternatives to my approach. Fundamentally, though, my question is: How should one use the Hard Lefschetz Theorem to understand the maps $H^i(G/P)\xrightarrow{\cup e} H^{i+2}(G/P)$? I would really appreciate a reference on this. 

Let $G_i$ be a compact Lie group, $i=1,2$, and let $E_{G_i}^*$ be a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded complex-oriented $G_i$-equivariant generalized cohomology theory with commutative products. Let $X_i$ be a compact $G_i$-manifold. Note that $X_1\times X_2$ is then a $(G_1\times G_2)$-manifold, and we may consider $E_{G_1\times G_2}^*(X_1\times X_2)$. $\textbf{Question}:$ In what sort of generality can we say that $E_{G_1\times G_2}^*(X_1\times X_2)$ and $E_{G_1}^*(X_1)\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} E_{G_2}^*(X_2)$ are naturally isomorphic as rings? (This question is vague, so please feel free to answer in any way you desire.) In particular, is this true if $G_1$ and $G_2$ are tori and the theory in question is equivariant complex cobordism? I would also be grateful for a reference. This is not difficult to verify in the case of equivariant cohomology with rational coefficients. It also holds in equivariant K-theory. 

Let $T$ be a compact real torus, and $X$ a Hamiltonian $T$-manifold (which you may take to be a smooth complex projective variety) with moment map $\mu:X\rightarrow\frak{t}^*$. If $\dim(T)=\frac{1}{2}\dim(X)$, then $X$ is classified up to $T$-equivariant symplectomorphism by its moment polytope $\mu(X)$. If we relax this dimension condition, then what information about $X$ might we hope to obtain from an explicit description of its moment polytope? For instance, is the $T$-equivariant cohomology of $X$ nicely related to $\mu(X)$? My question is somewhat vague, so please feel free to answer in any fashion you deem to be acceptable. 

I have an idea, but it needs to be made rigorous. It might be helpful to consider the smooth map $f:[a,b]\times\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3$, $$f(t,\alpha)=\alpha\gamma(t).$$ This is a map from a $2$-manifold with boundary to a $3$-manifold. So, its differential has rank at most $2$ at a given point, while the tangent space to a point in an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ has dimension $3$. So, it would seem that the answer is no, but I am far from certain. 

No, the bundle is not trivial in general. If we consider the case $n=1$, then the associated Lagrangian Grassmannian is actually the ordinary Grassmannian, namely $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1$. Also, the tautological bundle over $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^1$ is non-trivial. 

Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected, complex semisimple Lie group with Lie algebra $\frak{g}$. Let $\mu:T^*\mathcal{B}\rightarrow\mathcal{N}$ be the Springer resolution of $\mathcal{N}$. If $G=\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb{C})$, then the Springer fibers $\mu^{-1}(e)$, $e\in\mathcal{N}$, are known to be connected projective varieties. Are the Springer fibers known to be connected varieties for arbitrary $G$? 

I believe there is a reasonable notion of $\text{Ext}^1(G,H)$ in the category of groups (where $G$ and $H$ are groups). Is there a decent reference describing this? My particular situation involves a nilpotent Lie group $G$ with finitely many components. One may form the short-exact sequence $$1\rightarrow G_0\rightarrow G\rightarrow\pi_0(G)\rightarrow 1,$$ an element of $\text{Ext}^1(\pi_0(G),G_0)$. I am curious about conditions under which this sequence splits. I would appreciate any and all references and suggestions. Thanks! 

I believe the answer is yes. For a $G$-manifold $X$, let $X_G$ denote its Borel mixing space. Recall that $$H_G^*(X)=H^*(X_G).$$ Now, note that $E_G$, $F_G$, and $(E\oplus F)_G$ are the total spaces of vector bundles over $B_G$. Also, $$(E\oplus F)_G\cong E_G\oplus F_G$$ as vector bundles over $B_G$. (I am confident this is true, but it is worth checking.) Computing equivariant Euler classes, we obtain $$e_G(E\oplus F)=e((E\oplus F)_G)$$ $$=e(E_G\oplus F_G)$$ $$=e(E_G)e(F_G)$$ $$=e_G(E)e_G(F).$$ I hope this helps. 

One possibility would be to follow the treatment of this subject given in Yang-Mills Equations over Riemann Surfaces by Atiyah and Bott. Call a subset $I\subseteq S$ open if whenever $\beta\in I$ and $\gamma\in S$ satisfy $\beta\leq\gamma$, we have $\gamma\in I$. For open $I$, we have the desirable property that $$X_I:=\bigcup_{\beta\in I}X_{\beta}$$ is open in $X$. Also, if $\beta$ is maximal in the complement of $I$, then $I\cup\{\beta\}$ is also open. So, we have the equivariant Thom-Gysin sequence, $$\cdots\rightarrow H_T^{i-2d(\beta)}(X_{\beta})\rightarrow H_T^*(X_{I\cup\{\beta\}})\rightarrow H_T^*(X_I)\rightarrow\cdots.$$ Assume that these sequences split into short-exact sequences. We begin by selecting a maximal element $\beta_1\in S$. Set $I_1:=\{\beta_1\}$. Take a maximal element $\beta_2\in S\setminus I_1$ and set $I_2:=I_1\cup\{\beta_2\}$. Write the associated Thom-Gysin sequence to conclude that $$H^*_T(X_{I_2})\cong H_T^{*-2d(\beta_2)}(X_{\beta_2})\oplus H_T^*(X_{I_1})$$ as graded vector spaces. Next, choose a maximal element $\beta_3\in S\setminus I_2$ and set $I_3:=I_2\cup\{\beta_3\}$. Form the associated Thom-Gysin sequence to obtain $H_T^*(X_{I_3})$ as a graded vector space. Continue with this inductive procedure to obtain $H_T^*(X)$. 

Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected complex semisimple group. We have the famous Springer resolution $$T^*(G/B)\rightarrow\mathcal{N}$$ of the closure of the regular nilpotent orbit. My understanding is that the closures of nilpotent $G$-orbits $\mathcal{O}$ admit symplectic resolutions $$T^*(G/P)\rightarrow\overline{\mathcal{O}}$$ when $G=SL_n(\mathbb{C})$, but that this need not be the case for other $G$. Accordingly, I am looking for a reference giving some information as to which nilpotent orbits have their closures resolved in this way. 

I believe the answer is yes. Since $X$ is an affine $G$-variety, $G$ acts on $\mathbb{C}[X]$ by $\mathbb{C}$-algebra automorphisms. This yields an action of $G$ on the fraction field of $\mathbb{C}[X]$ by algebra automorphisms. This restricts to an action on the integral closure of $\mathbb{C}[X]$, so that inclusion into the integral closure is $G$-equivariant. We can now apply Spec to this inclusion to obtain the desired equivariant map. 

Denote this Riemann surface by $X$. It is equivalent to find a complex line bundle of positive degree on $X$. We can identify the isomorphism classes of line bundles on $X$ with $H^1(X;\mathcal{C}^{\infty}_X(\mathbb{C}^*))$ via Cech data, where $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}_X(\mathbb{C}^*)$ is the sheaf of smooth $\mathbb{C}^*$-valued functions on $X$. Furthermore, the exponential sequence $$0\rightarrow \underline{\mathbb{Z}}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}^{\infty}_X(\mathbb{C})\rightarrow\mathcal{C}^{\infty}_X(\mathbb{C}^*)\rightarrow 0$$ yields a long-exact sequence in sheaf cohomology that identifies $H^1(X;\mathcal{C}^{\infty}_X(\mathbb{C}^*))$ with $H^2(X;\underline{\mathbb{Z}})\cong\mathbb{Z}$. This identification associates to a line bundle in $H^1(X;\mathcal{C}^{\infty}_X(\mathbb{C}^*))$ its degree in $\mathbb{Z}$, 

The most generic answer that occurs to me is to use the Littlewood-Richardson Rule for writing a product of Schur polynomials as a weighted sum of Schur polynomials. The idea is to realize each irreducible representation of the general linear group as the result of applying the Schur functor $\mathcal{F}$ to a Specht module. More explicitly, $M=V({\lambda})$ and $N=V({\mu})$, where $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the highest weights, namely partitions of length $\leq n$. We then have $$\mathcal{F}(S^{\lambda})\cong V(\lambda)$$ and $$\mathcal{F}(S^{\mu})\cong V(\mu).$$ Then, decompose the "product" $[S^{\lambda}][S^{\mu}]$ (really, an induced representation) of these Specht modules in the full representation ring for all symmetric groups into Specht modules. This is best accomplished by using the Littlewood-Richardson Rule, since we have an isomorphism between the full representation ring and the ring of symmetric functions. The isomorphism sends $[S^{\nu}]$ to the Schur polynomial $s_{\nu}$. So, the exercise is really to decompose the product $s_{\lambda}s_{\mu}$ into a weighted sum of Schur polynomials by using the Littlewood-Richardson Rule. The partitions of the Schur polynomials occurring in the sum are then the highest weights. 

I do not believe this is the case. If you have any smooth complex submanifold $X$ of $\mathbb{CP}^n$, then the Kahler form on $\mathbb{CP}^n$ pulls-back to a Kahler form $\omega$ on $X$ (so $\phi^*\omega_{FS}=\omega$). You can take $X$ to be any smooth projective variety. These are not all simply-connected. For instance, let $X$ be an elliptic curve. 

Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected complex semisimple Lie group with Lie algebra $\frak{g}$. Fix a maximal torus $T\subseteq G$, and let $$\frak{g}=\frak{t}\oplus\bigoplus_{\alpha\in\Delta}\frak{g}_{\alpha}$$ be the corresponding decomposition into weight spaces. Given a non-zero root vector $e_{\alpha}\in\frak{g}_{\alpha}$, is there a nice way to describe those root vectors lying in the nilpotent $G$-orbit of $e_{\alpha}$? This is possible in the context of several examples, but is there a more example-independent description? 

I think the idea is to write $P$ as a semidirect product of its unipotent radical $N$ and its (maximal reductive) Levi subgroup $M$. (If $P$ is a Borel, then $M$ is a maximal torus.) You can then restrict a complex representation of $P$ to $M$ and decompose it into irreducibles. 

Any inner product on $\mathfrak{g}$ will give rise to a metric on $G$. More specifically, you can use a left trivialization of $TG$ to get a vector bundle isomorphism $TG\cong G\times\mathfrak{g}$. The latter bundle has a metric by virtue of the inner product on $\mathfrak{g}$. The same construction will work if one instead uses the right trivialization. 

Let $X$ be a smooth manifold and $\pi:V\rightarrow X$ a real vector bundle. Let $\mathcal{O}_X$, $\Gamma$, and $\Omega_X^1$ denote the sheaves of functions on $X$, smooth sections of $V$, and $1$-forms on $X$, respectively. A connection on $V$ is a morphism $$\nabla:\Gamma\rightarrow\Gamma\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X}\Omega_X^1$$ of sheaves of $\mathbb{R}$-vector spaces on $X$ that satisfies the Leibniz rule. Essentially, a connection is just a mechanism for differentiating (local and global) sections of $V$. (It generalizes the exterior derivative of smooth functions on $X$, since the exterior derivative is an example of a connection on the trivial rank-one bundle on $X$.) The covariant derivative comes from a connection on the tangent bundle and allows you to differentiate its sections (vector fields). 

Suppose that $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a surjective submersion of manifolds. Let $n=\dim(X)$ and $m=\dim(Y)$. Suppose that $y\in Y$. In suitable local coordinates $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ on $X$ and $(y_1,\ldots,y_m)$ on $Y$ at $y$, $f$ has the form $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\mapsto (a_1,\ldots,a_m)$. Hence, you should obtain a nice $(n-m)$-dimensional fibre. This should be made rigorous, but I think it gives a decent place to start. 

Is there a decent way to describe the canonical module of the ring $\frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]}{x^2-yz}$? I am not necessarily looking for an explicit description of the canonical module, but I would appreciate any and all suggestions for describing its structure. 

Let $G$ be a Lie group (possibly disconnected). Consider the natural short-exact sequence $$1\rightarrow G_0\rightarrow G\rightarrow\pi_0(G)\rightarrow 1,$$ where $G_0$ is the identity component of $G$, and $\pi_0(G)\cong G/G_0$ is the component group. Under what conditions does this sequence admit a splitting, so that $G$ is a semidirect product of $G_0$ and $\pi_0(G)$?. Useful answers might include (but need not be limited to) some types of Lie group $G$ for which a splitting exists. I would appreciate any and all references and suggestions. Thanks!
