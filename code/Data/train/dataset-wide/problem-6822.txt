The quantity produced does not depend on the fixed costs. Fixed costs only influence the decision of whether or not to produce, not how much to produce. The individual firm's level of production is determined by MR=MC, independent of fixed costs. Firms will produce less when fixed cost decrease, because, as you point out, more firms will produce (entry in the market). On the aggregate market supply shifts out, so that price declines. For each individual pricetaking firm, the exogenously determined price has declined. Put differently, MR has shift down, resulting in an optimum (MR=MC) at a lower level of production. 

Complementary to the answer of Ubiquitous with respect to the effect of a devaluation on foreign trade (and only of marginal importance), is the possibility that the positive effect of a devaluation on the current account occurs only after an initial worsening of the current account. This sequence of a worsening and subsequently improving current account in response to a devaluation is called the J-curve effect, introduced by, if I rembember well, Abba and Lerner. Its presence can be explained by disentangling two opposite effects that result from a devaluation: a volume-effect that positively affects the current account and a price-effect that negatively affects the current account. The volume effect with a positive impact on the current account is exactly what is described by Ubiquitous. The negative impact of the price-effect on the current account follows from the fact that any given imported quantity becomes more expensive after the devaluation. This price-effect will dominate in the case that the price-elasticity of domestic demand for imports and the price-elasticity of foreign demand for domestic exports are low, because in that case the exported quantities will increase only modestly and imports will decrease only modestly. Or, put differently, in this case of low price-elasticities, de volume effect is small. This is typically the case in the short run. In the long run the volume-effect can be expected to dominate. 

The straight-line supply and demand curves can be thought of as a magnification of this graph, where the two intersect. Thus, the units on the axes would give you a clue as to how high up the graph is being drawn, or how far to the right (if the units start at a number other than 0 or skip an interval). This shows you why they are indeed called 'curves', even when they are sometimes straight lines. Supply and demand curves are drawn using straight lines for simplicity. For example, two straight-line equations may be given, from which it is relatively simple to calculate the point of intersection. In the real world Supply and demand curves are an approximation of what happens in real life. The curves are a simplified model which show the general trend in the two functions. In reality, supply and demand curves are approximated using data that is collected over many years, with many short-term variables affecting the results, if the curves are even drawn up at all (the curves are more a theoretical model than a calculative method). Economic factors which affect supply and demand 

I recommend Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, for this topic. I don't know what you mean by "the society." Diamond makes it clear that there are many different societies around the world, progressing at different rates. To answer your question about why we have what we have today and why individual societies developed in the direction they did: some technologies are inevitable, such as farming, writing and mettalurgy. What differs is that a few societies developed these technologies much earlier than others. Diamond lays out the reasons why; differences in intelligence across races is not a reason but the geology and biogeography of people's habitats are ultimate causual factors. These ultimate factors lead to more proximate factors such as animal and plant domestication, leading to denser and more sedentary populations with more complex political organization. Technological development led to further economic development, with most technology arising from it being spread from other societiesâ€”and that transmission depends again on geography. Eurasia had the advantage of an east-west axis that made transfer of domestic food and animal species easier (along the same lines of latitude and hence similar climes), and thus the technology which accompanies more sedentary societies. More isolated societies such as Australia did not benefit from the spread of technology, and hence remained a hunting-gathering society until European conquest. His book is entertaining and interesting to read. I've learnt facts and a perspective of the differences amongst races that I couldn't do without. 

Different elements can contribute to such an evolution, without trying to be exhaustive, these are a few general comments: 

A flat AD-curve is not the result of the desire of a central bank to stabilize the price level, it is determined by the behaviour of the aggreggate economy (such as elasticities and taxes). Stabilizing the price level by using monetary or fiscal policy can be done by shifting the AD-curve (or influencing the slope of the curve, but that is a less standard option). In this context the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy depends on how easily policymakers can shift the AD-curve. If you have an equation for AD, this can be easily calculated as $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial X }$, $X$ being the variable in the AD-equation used to implement the policy. The effectiveness of monetary or fiscal policy also depends on the slope of the AS-curve, possible shifts in the (short run) AS-curve in response to the policy (such as inflation expectations), and the objective of the policy: price stabilization or outputstabilization. 

Given a hamiltonian of the form: \begin{equation} H_{t} = ln(c_{t}) \dot{} e ^{-\rho t} + \lambda_{t}(w+ra_{t}-c_{t}), \end{equation} with $c_{t}$ consumption at time t (the control variable), $\rho > 0$ time preference, $w$ a constant (for example wage), $a$ assets held in period t (this is the state variable for which the dynamics are described by: $\frac{da_{t}}{dt}=\dot{a_{t}}= w+ra_{t}-c_{t})$ and $r$ the return on assets. The first order conditions are: $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial c_{t}}=0$ $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial a_{t}}=-\dot{\lambda_{t}}$, or equivalently, $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial a_{t}}+\dot{\lambda_{t}}=0$. We were taught that $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial a_{t}}$ can be interpreted as the marginal return on assets in t, and $\dot{\lambda}$ as a capital gain. Together they are the overal return. An accompanying sketch with $a_{t}$ on the horizontal and $H_{t}$ on the vertical axis shows $H_{t}$ is a concave function with a maximum. The growthpath for consumption is given by $\frac{\dot{c_{t}}}{c_{t}}=-\frac{\dot{\lambda_{t}}}{\lambda_{t}}-\rho$, so that consumption grows over time if $\rho+\frac{\dot{\lambda_{t}}}{\lambda_{t}}<0$, that is: consumption grows if the relative capital losses exceed time preference. As such, the optimizing agent should let his consumption grow when there are sufficiently big capital losses. My questions are the following: 

My guess is that the ''elasticity of substitution'' means something like$$\frac{\%\Delta K}{\% \Delta L}=\mathrm{mrs} \times\frac lk, $$ but that is dependant on what point you are at (i.e. a coordinate $(l, k)$). To get $\mathrm{mrs} $, find $\frac {\mathrm d k} {\mathrm d l} $, and even that is dependent on the value of $f$. 

I would say it exhibits no returns to scale. What follows is a counter argument to the idea that it can exhibit returns to scale. A 'return to scale' means that production will change in response to a change in the input. A 'constant return to scale' is a straight-line function (or a portion thereof) including the origin (0, 0), with the input on the horizontal axis and the output on the vertical axis. That is, a directly proportional relationship. A 'decreasing return to scale' means that, as more and more of the input is used, production changes with a decreasing effect. This means that the graph will have a gradient that gets more and more flat as the input increases. An 'increasing return to scale' means that production changes with increasing effect as the input increases - a function who's gradient increases. In conclusion, if the input has no effect on production, there is no 'return' from the input. 

Re-order the equation. $U=x-\frac 1 y\\ x-U=\frac 1 y\\ y=\frac 1{x-U}$ I'm sure you know how to draw that graph: 

I'm dealing with panel data and I chose to do a regression with cross-sectional fixed effects. Some of my explanatory variables (such as $debt_{it}$) do not show very much variation over the time dimension. In fact, the most interesting variation in $debt_{it}$ (but also in some other variables), is probably the cross-sectional variation (i.e. one country having a higher debt over the entire period under investigation) rather than the variation of debt over time within each country. Therefore, I believe that demeaning the data by using cross-section fixed effects may elimate a lot of interesting information. The $H_{0}$ of redundant fixed effects is strongly rejected, and the Hausman test strongly rejects the consistency of the random effects estimator. Doing a pooled estimation, rather than F.E. estimation, more than doubles the estimated coefficient to debt. In an attempt to 'retrieve' the valuable cross-sectional information, I plotted each country's fixed effect against each country's average level of debt over the time period. There was a significant correlation $(p<0,01)$ between the averaged debt and the fixed effect. Intuitively, it seems to me that I can conclude that (even though the coefficient to $debt_{it}$ is possibly insignificant, depending on the specification, I'm still working on this) a higher debt does result in higher interest rate spreads (which is the dependent variable). These are my questions:
