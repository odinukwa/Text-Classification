The steps to optimally go from the Production function to the Cost function is to solve the cost-minimization problem for the firm, which determines the input mix given prices and some level of output, and in turn allows us to express one input with respect to the other (in this simplest two-inputs case). When the production function is of the Leontief variety, optimal input mix is indeed determined by the equality stated by the OP, since by simple reasoning, any amount of one input above the amount satisfying the equality will incur the cost to buy it but not any extra output. Inserting the equality $$\frac{L^*}{2a}=\frac{K^*}{4b} \implies L^* = \frac {a}{2b}K^*$$ into the cost function we get Cost expressed as a function of one of the inputs only, $C^* = g(K^*)$ In order to eliminate it too, we turn again to the production function which can also be expressed as a function of one input at the optimal solution, $$Q = h(K^*) \implies K^* = h^{-1}(Q)$$ Inserting $h^{-1}(Q)$ into the Cost function we obtain $$C = g\left[h^{-1}(Q)\right]$$ where also the various exogenous constants and prices will be present. In fact, this is easier done when the production function is Leontief, than when it is Cobb-Douglas for example, and so it should be easy for the OP to arrive at the correct solution. 

We have that $$D(p^*,\mathbf{a}) = -\frac {d}{dp^*}\int_{p^*}^\infty\!D(p;\mathbf{a})\,dp,$$ $$\Rightarrow \text{PS}(p^*) = -\text{CS}'(p^*)p^* \tag{1}$$ So $$\text{PS}(p^*)= \text{CS}(p^*) \Rightarrow -\text{CS}'(p^*)p^* = \text{CS}(p^*)$$ or $$\text{CS}'(p^*) + \frac 1{p^*}\text{CS}(p^*)=0 \tag{2}$$ which is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation in $p^*$ with variable coefficent. Its solution is $$\text{CS}(p^*) = B\exp\left\{-\int \frac 1{p^*}dp^*\right\} = B\exp\left\{-\ln p^*\right\}=B\frac 1{p^*},\;\; B>0 \tag{3}$$ So we have that the demand function the OP seeks must satisfy $$\int_{p^*}^\infty\!D(p;\mathbf{a})\,dp = B\frac 1{p^*} \tag{4}$$ Since it should hold $\forall p^*$ we can consider the derivative w.r.t to $p^*$ on both sides, to obtain $$D(p^*;\mathbf{a}) = B\frac 1{[p^*]^2} \tag{5}$$ But since, again, it should hold $\forall p^*$, it holds $\forall p$. So $$\text{PS} = \text{CS} \Rightarrow D(p;\mathbf{a}) = B\frac 1{p^2} \tag{6}$$ Verification of $(6)$ is straightforward. 

You iterate towards a fixed point, so you want to reach a situation where plugging in your current iterated value produces itself. Now using your notation, we are told that we should calculate $$V_{n+1}(a) = V_n(a) + \Delta$$ where $$\Delta = \ u(c(a^*)) + \dfrac{\partial V_n(a)}{\partial a}da_t(a^*) - \rho V_n(a)$$ Insert the second into the first to see what the iteration rule is: $$V_{n+1}(a) = V_n(a) + \ u(c(a^*)) + \dfrac{\partial V_n(a)}{\partial a}da_t(a^*) - \rho V_n(a)$$ When you reach a point where $$V_{n+1}(a) = V_n(a) $$ (or $\epsilon$-so) It will mean $$\rho V_n(a)= \ u(c(a^*)) + \dfrac{\partial V_n(a)}{\partial a}da_t(a^*) $$ which is what you have to satisfy. Some stars etc may have to be adjusted in the above, for a fully consistent notation. 

I will set up a naive static/short run model to examine the case (so this post may be a bit long - I will try to dispense with some algebraic steps). I will use convenient functional forms, which are nevertheless consistent with usual assumptions. FIRMS There are $i=1,...,n$ identical, price taking firms. In the short run they maximize the objective function $$A\ln\ell_i - (1+s_f+\xi)w\ell_i\tag{1} $$ where $A$ includes any component of the production function that is fixed in the short run, $\ell_i$ is the amount of labor firm $i$ employs, $s_f$ is the Employer's Social Security Fees (SSF) as a percentage over the "mixed" wage $w$. $\xi$ is a possible change in this percentage, which I include from the start. The concept of "mixed wage" is central in actual labor markets: in most cases bilateral or union negotiations over the wage are carried in terms of the "mixed wage", not in terms of the "take home" wage. Profit maximizing behavior will lead to market labor demand $$L^d= n\cdot\frac {A}{(1+s_f+\xi)w} \tag{2}$$ WORKERS There are $j=1,...,m$ workers, who posses one unit of labor and perform static maximization of the quasilinear utility function $$U = c + \gamma \ln(1-\ell_j)\;\; s.t\;\; c= (1-s_w+\psi)w\ell_j \tag{3}$$ i.e. there is no consumption-saving decision here. $s_w$ is the "Employee's SSF" and $\psi$ is a possible change of this percentage (a positive $\psi$ implies lowering of the percentage) Utility maximization leads to $$L^s = m\cdot \frac{(1-s_w+\psi)w - \gamma}{(1-s_w+\psi)w} \tag{4}$$ Assuming that the labor markets clears, we have $$L^d = L^s \implies n\cdot\frac {A}{(1+s_f+\xi)w} = m\cdot \frac{(1-s_w+\psi)w - \gamma}{(1-s_w+\psi)w}$$ $$\implies (nA/m)\frac {(1-s_w+\psi)}{(1+s_f+\xi)} = (1-s_w+\psi)w - \gamma$$ $$\implies w^* = \frac {(nA/m)}{(1+s_f+\xi)} + \frac {\gamma}{(1-s_w+\psi)} \tag{5}$$ Equation $(5)$ provides the first major conclusion : 

Continuing on the comments exchange, the conclusion that the overall effect is to change the discount factor, is similar to the one reached in the original Overlapping Generations Model of Blanchard, where individuals are faced with a "probability of death" (surely a "catastrophic event" I believe). See the Blanchard & Fischer book "Lectures in Macroeconomics", p. 117. The authors note that the result has been originally obtained by Cass and Yaari (1967) "Individual Saving, Aggregate Capital Accumulation, and Efficient Growth", a paper that is part of the book Essays on The Theory of of Optimal Economic Growth 

This journal article (Oct 29-2011,) has parts from a telephone conversation of the journalist with Sargent: $URL$ Although none of it mentions "New-Keynsian", there are some interesting points, like 

"Durable goods" are a form of utility-generating capital. But they are capital, and what is actually generating utility is the flow of services from them, not them directly. So when we buy a durable good, this is not consumption, it is investment. The phenomenon of uneven intertemporal allocation of purchasing expenses in durable goods is not related to "saturation", in the sense the word is used in microeconomic theory: saturation and non-saturation is a static concept. Intertemporally, the capital stock may very well decline, as an optimal choice : we pile up capital early on, and then, the rate of usage is greater than the rate of further accumulation: we use what we have bought in the past, wearing down the stock. The right way to model durable goods (and it has been done of course), is to specify a utility function like $$U = U(C, h(D))$$ where $C$ are non-durable goods and $h(D)$ is the service-flow function related to durables $D$. Sometimes we simply write $C_D$ (consumption of the service flow). The difference is that the stock of durable goods is a state variable, alongside any other state variables the model has. As a recent example of a theoretical model (not a canonical one), see the paper Mansoorian, A., & Michelis, L. (2010). Monetary policy in a small open economy with durable goods and differing cash-in-advance constraints. Economics Letters, 107(2), 246-248. Public Capital also enters sometimes the utility function, to represent the services flow that come from public infrastructure (contrasted to current public expenses). See for example Chatterjee, S., & Ghosh, S. (2009). Public goods, congestion, and fiscal policy: Do consumption-based instruments matter? 

Applying a regression model $$\ln Y = \ln A + a\ln K + b\ln L$$ on a standard macroeconomic time-series data set from a country would immediately provide an estimate for $A$, essentially an average over the sample. The problem is that experience has shown us that we don't have $A$ but $A_t$, i.e. it is time-varying. As such, estimates of $A$ as though it was a constant seem rather meaningless or even misleading. More-over, in a time-varying coefficient framework, what is important is the change, rather than the absolute value, since it is essentially a mark-up index on the production function, and not something that can be meaningfully measured in absolute units. In this case, we take $A_0=1$ (the first period in the sample) and we track the percentage change over the sample. 

Important details are missing, but just think: whose expectations about inflation are included in the monetary policy rule? Model consistency should help you answer your question. If you provide more details on your model, I will be happy to expand. 

The answer to this "puzzle" has been clarified in the comments to the original OP's post. The issue is that agents treat the $v$ function as exogenous when optimizing with respect to $l$ and $e$, while the social planner naturally takes it into account. But this is a behavioral assumption with mathematical consequences. The Envelope Theorem does not allow for such asymmetries. Let's apply the Envelope Theorem, which says that if we have a function $f(x;a)$ and we optimize it over, say, $x$, then the total derivative of the optimized function $f(x^*,a)$ with respect to what previously was treated as a parameter equals the partial derivative of the non-optimized function with respect to that parameter, keeping the $x$s fixed: $$\frac {df(x^*,a)}{da} = \frac {f(x,a)}{\partial a}$$ Now, note that $z$ depends on $t$ only through $l$ and $e$. So, for the purpose of applying the theorem, we have that the partial derivative $\partial z/\partial t =0$. Keeping that in mind let's write $$W = H + v$$ where $H$ contains all the other terms. As the OP showed in his answer we have $$\frac{dW}{dt}= l_t[w(1-t)-\psi'] + e'[t-c_e] - z + \frac{dv}{dt}$$ and taking into account the f.o.c for $l$ and $e$ given the behavioral assumptions related to $v$, we are left with $$\frac{dW}{dt}= \frac{dH}{dt} + \frac{dv}{dt} = -z + \frac{dv}{dt}$$ $$\implies \frac{dH}{dt} = -z$$ Does this conform with the Envelope Theorem? It does, with respect to $H$ only, because this is the part of $W$ over which we maximize with respect to $l$ and $e$. And we have $$\frac{\partial H}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial (-tz)}{\partial t} = -z$$ since as we have said, $\partial z/\partial t =0$. So we should not see the partial of $z$ in the first position in any case, while the appearance of $dz/dt$ in relation to $v$ appears only because we have ignored it in the maximization with respect to $l$ and $e$. If the agents optimized taking into account $v$ also we would have obtained $$\frac{dW}{dt} = -z + v'\cdot z$$ and the Envelope Theorem would hold for the full $W$ function.
