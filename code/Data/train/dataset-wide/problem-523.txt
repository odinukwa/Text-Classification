GoVisually is a possibility. You can mark annotations and place comments on any part of your project, and there is this pretty cool feature where you can click on each user and it will hide or display relevant content, so if you think some user is just trolling around you can ban him. Revisions can also be easily upload and it's simple to switch between different versions of the same document or project. And I'm not entirely sure, but I think it's still free. Here's a promotional video I found on google: Video 

For structure 2, you say that you want a $900 km$ shell. I have absolutely no idea what you want inside it or how much it should weigh, so I am going to assume that it is an empty metal shell made of aluminum foil :). I'll make it approximately $1m$ thick which...if you want to know, would explode due to differences in air pressure in space. Note that this is all smaller than the actual measurements because I'm proving that it's going to take A LOT of energy. This would be a total of $$W = \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h \cdot \rho \\= 450000m^2\cdot \pi\cdot 4\cdot 1m\cdot 2700kg/m^3 \\= 6870663133400878 kg \approx 10^{15} kg$$. 

Now for the best part. Plugging this into the equation for energy, we get $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-(0.32c)^2/c^2}\approx 1.0555008$. Thus, $$E \approx 10^{15}kg*c^2*(1-\gamma)\approx 5\cdot 10^{30} J$$ which is basically the amount of energy the sun burns every second (very very close actually)!! But hey, if you can build a spaceship $900 km$ in diameter, I don't doubt you. =========================================================================== 2) Traveling at such a high speed makes encountering space debris highly painful (and probably lethal). You would need something that could detect space debris very far off, load your laser cannon or whatever you have and destroy the particle very, very quickly, considering that you are moving very fast. 

On one hand, you can't burn them all, on the other hand, collaboration is a risky path - eventually, someone will betray you. You need a third way: Become God. Find a relatively large and strong tribe, preferably one that you did not burn recently. Strat helping them from time to time, convince them that you are the one and only god, creator of the world and humankind. It shouldn't be particularly complicated - you are obviously different, stronger and smarter then they are. With your help, this tribe will conquer many others, and their religion (i.e. you as a god) will spread even further. They will even give you food and other gifts. Eventually, they won't need your assistance, but your godly nature will likely remain unchallenged for centuries - you are a living proof that God exists. Moreover, the believers are quite unlikely to betray you, and will even defend you at any cost. Hopefully, if a time comes and unbelievers form a majority, the ethics will change and you will become a national symbol\heritage, or at least an equal member of society. 

Yes, the notion that democracies are inferior is completely wrong Autocracies might be better at a short-term scientific blitz (i.e. you know exactly what you need, and you can concentrate all resources on this task). But that's about it. In the long-ish run (decade+) a democracy will prevail. There are a bunch of reasons: 

The United States of America has 50 states and 14 territories (according to Google). In my story, each state is drawn far apart from each other due to conflicting interests. If all 50 states + 14 territories went to war against each other, which state would win? Conditions: I am talking about militaristic winning. The exact details, I'm not sure. I would prefer it to be conquering all other states, but I'm not sure if that is entirely possible. Time Period: Current Methods of fighting: Everything each state has, EXCEPT for nuclear war. So states with nuclear missiles would NOT have an advantage. Could you guys include specific details and facts? Thanks :D 

I'll put a few points here as to why this kind of spaceship (minus some of your requirements) will be able to exist with our current laws of physics but not be able to exist with our current technology (or any technology in the near future, anyways). 1) The energy required to accelerate a mass $m$ to $0.32c$. (Also as a minor point, dealing with a constant speed is pretty easy as the spaceship at constant speed is basically an inertial reference frame. I'll deal with the logistics of this later $$E=mc^2(γ-1)$$ where $$γ=1/\sqrt{1−v^2/c^2}.$$ Assuming that each room for a passenger weights approximately $400 kg$ (a.k.a a small car minus the engine and mainframe) and that there are $9000$ passengers, the total weight of structure one is a MINIMUM of $3,600,000$ or $3.5 \cdot 10^6kg$. And this is just structure 1. 

Consider a mountain pass. In short, you need a small village located on a major road. Possibly, your village is located near (on the only road leading to) a mountain pass. You mentioned the mountainous location, so it fits geographically, and such location will result in quite a bit of traffic (merchants, travellers) passing through. At the same time, the rough terrain will restrict the settlement from becoming a busy town. You might want this pass to be internal (i.e. in a heartland of the country), and away from any borders, and thus without much political/military value, and otherwise unremarkable. 

Your Empire is a federation/confederation of free democratic ethnic states**. Through the history, there were very few nation states. The majority of the people were ruled by some other ethnicity. For instance, consider the large Europian countries in 1900: one can argue that France is the only fully established nation-state. Germany & Italy are very new nation-states, United just a generation ago. While the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Russia, Ottman Empire, the UK & Spain are multinational (albeit the last two are long-standing and fairly assimilated at this point). Also, notice that there are few democracies on this list. So, your country needs to position itself as a liberator - "we do not conquer lands, we free people!". After the conquest, it should establish democratic, ethnically homogeneous, states with a high degree of autonomy (and influence on the federal government). The notion of a fully independent nation-state is unknown, and thus it will not be seen as a half-measure, but as an extremely positive development. And, if you conquer a nation-state (or a region that is stelled by the dominant ethnicity of the former country) you can always sell "democracy and the rule of the people". 

I've seen multiple posts on destroying the Earth, but is it possible for humans to reverse the spin of Earth? In order words, considering modern technology at our disposal, is it possible for human beings to band together to reverse the spin of Earth? In addition, considering how much energy is required to do so, what if reversing the spin of Earth became the most important thing in our daily lives? A.k.a. all the money, all the governments working together. I would greatly appreciate any feedback on how to improve this question, or how to answer. Thanks in advance! 

Bullets A machine gun that fires rubber bullets at high speeds would be enough to stop organisms from physically boarding the ship, unless their armor is as strong as the ship's hull. If it isn't, just increase the mass or speed of the bullets. Nets and Rope: Or, if there are few organisms approaching your ship, like maybe one or two, Nets and Rope would work. Keep it like the old times :P Light Blinding light (which wouldn't damage the ship) could also be useful. Considering that the outer hull of the ship should be resistant to the sun's rays, you could mount a high intensity light ray gun on the outside, aimed to blast anything coming near. Worse case, it hits your own ship, but then again, your ship is resistant to the sun's rays. Magnets You have magnets? Okay then. Create an entry way into your ship that combatants must travel through. Possibly a tunnel or something of the sort. Cap the ends of the tunnel with very magnetic magnets. They come barging in? Release the magnets and squish 'em. How to prevent a Mutiny: You said that all personnel wear magnetic boots? Well, make the floor an electromagnet, and if your crew mutiny's, just turn on the electromagnet and poof, they're all stuck to the ground. Does this help? Any questions? 

All in all, democracies work better because the people's self-interest is aligned with the states one. Your win is typically the state's win, while in an autocracy it's quite common to work against the state. This makes everything work much better. In our world, in the end, democracies were always more technologically, industrially and economically advanced. The best example is, of course, the Cold War, but you can also look at South Korea vs North Korea, or East Germany vs West Germany etc. The difference is that [unlike in a computer game] a state is, essentially, a bunch of people. Given the same resources and starting position, any country will only be as successful as it's people. 

Humans did have "weapons" (and in a way still do) - the gorillas (for instance) can defend themselves quite well. With time those "weapons" became less relevant (even counter-effective at times) and gradually declined. Of course, those "weapons" are limited when compared to a carnivore (such as a lion), but that's just nature, carnivores will always be better equipped. In fact, it is believed that the fact we are not carnivores (but omnivores) was highly important to our evolution. While herbivores spend much of their day eating food, and carnivores hunt fast and then are inactive for the rest of the day (one meat meal is enough), omnivores combine the best of two worlds. They do look for food (a challenge) but also have "free" time, and are otherwise far more versatile and flexible. Some evolutionists believe (see the link above) that those factors were crucial for humanity to develop intelligence.
