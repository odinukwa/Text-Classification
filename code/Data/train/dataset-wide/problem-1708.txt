…at least in our Universe The redshifting is not due to the source moving away from us. If the expansion hadn't been gradual, but we instead lived in a crazy universe that were static when the distant galaxy emitted the light, and static when we observe, but somehow expanded suddenly by some factor in the meantime, then we would still observe a redshift, even though the galaxy were static both when it emitted the light and when we observed it. 

Guiseppe Rossi's answer is excellent; I just want to add why the mentioned UV radiation modifies the spectrum of the background radiation. (one word took the other, and it became a rather long comment.) The hyperfine level Neutral hydrogen in its ground state can be in two different configurations; either the proton and the electron may have parallel spins ($\uparrow\uparrow$), or they may have antiparallel spins ($\uparrow\downarrow$). When the spins are parallel, the atom has a slightly higher energy than when they're antiparallel. The atoms "wants" to make a spin flip to the lower energy configuration$^\dagger$, and will eventually do so, but since the line is forbidden, the lifetime of the parallel state is of the order $10^7\,\mathrm{yr}$. The relative population of the states is given by the Boltzmann distribution $$ \begin{array}{rcl} \frac{n_1}{n_0} & = & \frac{g_1}{g_0} \, e^{-\Delta E \, / \, k_\mathrm{B} T_S} \\ & = & 3 \, e^{-0.068\,\mathrm{K} \, / \, T_S}\label{a}\tag{1}, \end{array} $$ where subscripts 1 and 0 denote the $\uparrow\uparrow$ and $\uparrow\downarrow$ states, respectively, $n$ is the density, $g$ is the statistical weights (with $g_0,g_1 = 1,3$), $\Delta E = 5.9\times10^{-6}\,\mathrm{eV}$ is the energy difference of the states, $k_\mathrm{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T_S$ is the spin temperature, which I think is better thought of as "a number that describes the relative populations" than an actual temperature. Departure from equilibrium In thermal equilibrium, the spin temperature is equal to the "real", kinetic temperature. Just after decoupling of the radiation from matter at a redshift of $z\simeq1100$, the gas and the photons share the same energy, and since $T\gg 1$, we have that $n_1/n_0 \simeq 3$. But when the first stars begin to shine, they produce massive amounts of hard UV radiation which ionizes their surrounding medium. The ionized gas quickly recombines (in the beginning, at least), with $\sim2/3$ of the recombinations resulting in the emission of a Lyman $\alpha$ photon, i.e. a photon with an energy corresponding to the energy difference between the first excited state (one of the three $2P$ states) and the ground state (the $1S$ state) of the hydrogen atom (10.2 eV). The Ly$\alpha$ photons scatter multiple times on the neutral hydrogen. Each scattering excites an atom from $1S\rightarrow 2P$, which subsequently de-excites and emits an Ly$\alpha$ photon in another direction. But since the energy difference between the $2P$ and the $1S$ state is a million times larger than between the hyperfine states, there is equal chance of ending in the $\uparrow\uparrow$ and the $\uparrow\downarrow$ state. That is, $n_1/n_0$ is no longer $\simeq 3$, but is driven toward $\sim 1$. This is the Wouthuysen–Field effect that Guiseppe Rossi mentions; from eq. \ref{a}, you see that this corresponds to a much smaller spin temperature, and thus the factor that Guiseppe Rossi mentions becomes negative. The full equation describing the brightness (or, equivalently, the flux received) as a function of redshift can be written (e.g. Zaldarriaga et al. 2004) $$ T(z) = 23\,\mathrm{mK} \, \frac{T_S - T_\mathrm{CMB}}{T_S} \, (1+\delta) x_\mathrm{HI}(z) \frac{\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2}{0.02} \left( \frac{0.15}{\Omega_\mathrm{m}h^2} \, \frac{1+z}{10} \right)^{1/2}\label{b}\tag{2} $$ and when the $(T_S - T_\mathrm{CMB})\,/\,T_S$ factor is negative, you will get an absorption line. (In eq. \ref{b}, $\delta$, $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$, $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, and $h$, are the local overdensity, the neutral fraction of hydrogen, the baryon and matter density parameter, and the dimensionless (reduced) Hubble constant, respectively, but this is of less importance.) Since the observed absorption line (Bowman et al. 2018) starts to drop around an observed frequency of $\nu_\mathrm{obs} = 65\text{–}70\,\mathrm{MHz}$, and since the rest frequency of the hyperfine line is $\nu_\mathrm{rest} = 1420\,\mathrm{MHz}$, this means that the first stars appeared around a redshift of $z = \nu_\mathrm{rest}/\nu_\mathrm{obs} - 1 \simeq 20$, corresponding to an age of the Universe of $\sim 180\,\mathrm{Myr}$ (i.e. million years — the largest absorption is reached at $z\simeq 17$, or $t\simeq 200\,\mathrm{Myr}$). Now the big question is, according to eq. \ref{b} the dip should be of the order a few tens of mK, but is in fact roughly 0.5 K, i.e. an order of magnitude larger. One possible mechanism that could produce this effect is coupling of the gas with dark matter, something which is not usually considered possible but could happen if the dark matter particle has a very small charge (Barkana et al. 2018). Time evolution of the 21 cm signal The figure below (from a great review by Pritchard & Loeb 2012) shows how the 21 cm signal evolves with time. The dip discussed in this answer is the orange and red part. 

In general the total velocity of a faraway object is not obtainable, only the component along the line of sight. However, if a star is not too far away, and its position on the sky is measured very accurately with an interval of some years, the velocity component perpendicular to the line of sight can be determined, yielding together with the redshift the total velocity. The recently launched Gaia spacecraft is expected to be measure the proper motion of millions of stars in this way. In distant galaxies, this is not possible. If one is interested in, say, the 3D velocity dispersion of the gas, the 1D dispersion is measured, and assuming (fairly) an isotropic dispersion, this number is then multiplied by $\sqrt{3}$ to get the total velocity. The distance to which parallax is measurable depends on the angular resolution of your instrument. For milliarcsec resolution, parallax measurements are good out to roughly 1 kpc. If you wait long enough, the motion around the galactic center increases your baseline such that larger distance can be probed.

What Tegmark points at is that although we're told that "Big Bang happened everywhere", this doesn't make sense, because how can one part of this "everywhere" know about the other parts of "everywhere"? One solution, obviously, is pure luck. After all, the regions on the sky are a little bit different. But this is a very unsatisfying solution, known as fine-tuning, which we loathe. Enter inflation. If you assume the our Universe was much, much denser in the beginning, but then went through a period of extreme (!) expansion, then in the very first tiny fraction of a fraction of a second, before this epoch which started when the Universe was $\sim10^{-36}$ seconds old, everything was so close to each other that a region much, much larger than the part of the Universe that we can see (the "observable Universe") could exchange information and reach thermodynamical equilibrium. The reason that many people believe in this scenario, I think, is that it simultaneously solved two other puzzles, known as the flatness problem and the magnetic monopole problem (and that, so far, no better scenario has been proposed). So, to recap, Tegmark is not saying that Big Bang didn't happen everywhere, but rather that, before Alan Guth proposed the inflation scenario in 1979, but after we first observed the CMB, this didn't make sense. 

Often for molecules to form in interstellar space, dust is used as a catalyst. The reason is that in typical interstellar environments, densities are so immensely low that even for just two atoms to meet, the probability is so small that formation time scales are very long. For 3+ atoms, the chance decreases rapidly. Instead, an atom can stick to a dust grain and wait for ages until other atoms stick. The atoms slowly "crawl" around on the surface of the dust grain, eventually meet and make bonds. If the formation of a bond releases energy (is exothermic), the molecule can be ejected from the grain surface. This process is call adsorption. The dust also helps shielding the molecules from stellar radiation which would otherwise easily destroy them. This is why molecular clouds are also very dusty. But actually UV irradiation helps with the formation of very complex molecules by ionizing less complex molecules that subsequently can make bonds with other atoms and molecules. If the environments are extremely dense, as when a star dies and ejects its gas either as a supernova or a planetary nebula, molecules can also form. This is probably also how the dust itself is formed, although it might also be formed later on (this is currently debated; the problem is that supernovae are so powerful that their shock waves tend to destroy dust shortly after it forms, and planetary nebulae are created from stars that live so long that they can't explain the abundance of dust in the very early Universe where they wouldn't have had the time to live their lives). As Stan Liou and LocalFluff says, methane is actually an "easy" molecule to form, both because it's rather simple, and because its constituents, hydrogen and carbon, are the most and the fourth most abundant elements in the interstellar medium, respectively. In fact, far more complex molecules are regularly found in interstellar space, as can be seen on this list. 

If the mean velocity is 600 km/s, the component along your line of sight is, on average, a factor $\sqrt{3}$ smaller, i.e. ~350 km/s. To get 10% accuracy, the Hubble velocity should then be ~3500 km/s. For $H_0=$ 100 (50) km/s/Mpc, that corresponds to 35 (70) Mpc. The reason the exact calculation of the mean (or rms) velocity come into play is that, for very large spreads in velocity, you will have more uncertainty. 

The Sun's spectrum measured outside our atmosphere (yellow) and at sea level (red) (modified image from Wikipedia, with data from Global Warming Art). Sometimes we want to observe the Sun in a wavelength region that is invisible to humans, for instance in UV or X-rays. This can be done with a telescope and a detector that is sensitive to light in that particular region, but in order for us to see it, we represent the image with a color that we can see. The image in the top of the link you provide is taken with the European spacecraft SOHO's instrument EIT at 19.5 nm, which we call "extreme UV", bordering on soft X-rays. Since this is invisible to humans, they arbitrarily chose to represent it using green. They might as well have chosen pink or brown. 

Time dilation The time dilation of various "standard clock" processes in distant galaxies (e.g. the time it takes for a supernova to fade away) has been proposed as a way to distinguish the GR model from the SR model. However, it turns out that the time dilation factor in the same in the two models, namely $1+z$, where $z$ is the redshift of the galaxy. So this doesn't work either. It does, however, rule out models that don't predict any time dilation at all, such as the "tired light" hypothesis. Supernova magnitudes The best "proof" (in quotes because nothing is ever really proven in physics, only verified or falsified) of GR is given in Davis & Lineweaver (2004), I think. Because of the mechanism that makes supernovae type Ia explode, these objects are thought to reach a known brightness at their peak luminosity, and can thus be used as "standard candles". Plotting their magnitudes (in the $B$ band, taken from Perlmutter et al. 1999) $m_B$ vs. their redshift, the result can be compared to the predictions of various cosmological models. In the standard GR model, the result depends on the history of the expansion, which in turn depends on the densities of the various constituents of the Universe (baryons, dark matter, dark energy, radiation). This is the reason that SN1a can be used to constrain the densities of the components. In the special relativistic (SR) explosion model, however, the result only depends on the velocity of the emitter at the time of emission, and the velocity of the observer at the time of observation. Whatever happened in between doesn't matter (in this models nothing special happened in between$^\dagger$). The result is shown in the figure below for various GR models (thin black lines) and for the SR model (thick black line). The SR model is ruled out at $23\sigma$. 

Not at all a dumb question. As you have heard, it is true that time is affected by gravity. The stronger the gravitational field, the slower time passes. If you're far from any gravitating matter, time passes "normally". But to answer your question, we must specify what is meant by "the black holes's time" (let's call the black hole $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$; see note below on the nomenclature), since it depends on how far from Sgr A* we are talking. The time pace at a distance $r$ from the center of a BH is given by $$t = t_\infty \sqrt{1 - \frac{r_\mathrm{S}}{r}},$$ where $t_\infty$ is the time "at infinity", i.e. far from the BH, and $$r_\mathrm{S} \equiv \frac{2GM}{c^2} \simeq 3\,\mathrm{km}\,\times \left( \frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)$$ is the so-called Schwarzschild radius (the "surface" of the BH), which is where not even light can escape. Here, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the BH, $c$ is the speed of light, and $M_\odot$ is the mass of the Sun. The last equality shows that a BH with the mass of the Sun would have a radius of 3 km. The mass of $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$ is some 4.1 million Solar masses, so its radius is $r_\mathrm{S} = 12.4$ million km. Plugging in the other numbers, we can see that at a distance from $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$ of 

$\dagger$Actually, $r_0$ refers to a distance corresponding to the line of sight towars zenith; observing at an angle $\zeta$ from zenith introduces a factor $\cos^{3/5}\!\zeta$. 

Stars are responsible. HII regions$^\dagger$ can refer to several things, but usually I guess one thinks of the volumes around star-forming regions. The more massive a star is, the faster it burns its fuel, and at a higher temperature, meaning that the peak of their spectra are more toward the high frequencies. The most massive stars of a stellar population — the so-called O and B stars — produce enough photons with wavelengths below the hydrogen ionization threshold of $\lambda = 912$ Å that they carve out bubbles in their surrounding HI clouds, giving rise to HII regions. 

$^\dagger$Since the roughly constant rotation speed of disk galaxies with galaxy mass (a few 100s of km/s) implies that $R$ grows approximately linearly with $R$ (and not with $R^3$ as one might expect), smaller galaxies — which exist in much larger numbers than large galaxies — have even shorter dynamical timescales. 

Wrt. your second question, you're right that the text is not correct. The three small constellations lie north of hydra. "North" means "toward higher values of declination". Perhaps it's more easily seen in this image (from Wikipedia):
