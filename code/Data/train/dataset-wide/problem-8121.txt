Under what circumstances is a quasi-isomorphism between two complexes necessarily a homotopy equivalence? For instance, this is true for chain complexes over a field (which are all homotopy equivalent to their homology). It's also true in an $\mathcal{A}_\infty$ setting. Is it true for chain complexes of free Abelian groups? The case I'm particularly interested in is chain complexes of free $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})[U]$ modules or free $\mathbb{Z}[U]$ modules, but I'm also interested in general statements. 

A Soergel bimodule (for $S_n$) is a bimodule over $R = \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ which appears as a summand/grading shift of tensor products of the basic bimodules $$B_{i,i+1} = R \otimes_{i,i+1} R$$ where $\otimes_{i,i+1}$ means the tensor product over the subring of polynomials invariant under permuting $i$ and $i+1$. It follows immediately that every Soergel bimodule $M$ has the following properties: (1) $M$ is free as a left module or as a right module, although not necessarily as a bimodule. (2) $M$ commutes with invariant polynomials, in the sense that for every invariant polynomial $p \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ and $m \in M$, we have $$ pm = mp. $$ I think they also have the following property: (3) There is an invariant vector, an element $m_0 \in M$ so that $$ x_i m_0 = m_0 x_i $$ for every $i=1,\dots,n$. Do these properties characterize Soergel bimodules? Without the third condition, you could have, for instance, a bimodule that just permuted the $x_i$: a one-dimensional module with a single generator $a$ as a right module, so that $ x_i a = a x_{\sigma(i)} $ for some permutation $\sigma$. Edit: The natural generalization for a general Weyl group $W$ would be to replace the invariant polynomials in (2) by the polynomials that are invariant under $W$. Clearly all Soergel bimodules would still satisfy this generalization of (2). Any references are welcome. If it's not known, I'll try to prove it. Edit: Ben Webster gave a counterexample below. More generally, I'm still interested in some sort of intrinsic, elementary characterization. 

The portions of $l$ and $\sigma$ that are in the thick part are a uniform distance from each other, and in particular if they don't enter the thin part then they are a bounded distance apart. Inside the thin part, $l$ goes closer to the singularity (i.e., the length of the short geodesic gets shorter). (To the extent that $l$ is well-defined, anyway, I haven't thought that through.) 

It's the same proof. Take a topological pants decomposition as before, and look for a minimal-length representative on your given Riemannian metric. Then you invoke the theorem that if you have a simple multi-curve without trivial or parallel components on a Riemannian surface, then it has a minimal length representative without intersections. This is one of a number of theorems in surface topology that seem obvious but have a surprising number of subtleties. I think this one appears in a thesis by Shepard at UC Berkeley. The main thing that fails with respect to the hyperbolic case is that the minimal length representative need not be unique. 

Any continuous map from M to N is homotopic to a smooth map, and if two smooth maps are homotopic, then they are also smoothly homotopic. (More generally, two homotopic functions are homotopic through a homotopy that is smooth except at the endpoints.) The proof involves convolving with Gaussians, and is standard; I think you can find it in Milnor's Topology from a Differentiable Viewpoint, for instance. (It's also appeard on mathoverflow before, but I couldn't find it just now.) The hard issues for smooth vs. continuous functions arise only once you start demanding the maps be injective. I can't say more about McDuff and Salomon without more context for the quote. 

I have a family of possibly related questions. Let me start with an elementary one: Question 1. Fix an integer $n$. For which collections of real numbers $a_{ij}$, $i, j = 1, \dots, n$, is it true that, for all trees $T$ and points $x_1, \dots, x_n$ in $T$, $$ \sum_{i<j} a_{ij} d(x_i, x_j)^2 > 0? \tag{1} $$ That is, I want to characterize the quadratic length inequalities that hold in trees. A related fact (if you drop "quadratic") is that a set of distances $d_{ij}$ can be realized inside a tree iff the $d_{ij}$ satisfy $$ d_{ik} + d_{jl} \le \max(d_{ij} + d_{kl}, d_{il} + d_{jk}) $$ for all $i,j,k,l$. (If you take $j=l$ you recover the triangle inequality.) But any quadratic relation as above will also hold for a product of trees (using the Euclidean-like product metric). In particular, it will also hold for Euclidean spaces. For Euclidean spaces, the inequality $(1)$ holds iff the matrix with off-diagonal entries $-a_{ij}$ and rows summing to $0$ is positive semi-definite. But not all such inequalities hold for trees. Examples. For any points $x_1,\dots,x_4$ in a metric space, $ 2 d_{12}{}^2 + 2d_{13}{}^2 \ge d_{23}{}^2. $ This follows from the triangle inequality, and the corresponding matrix $$ \pmatrix{4&-2&-2\\-2&1&1\\-2&1&1} $$ is positive semi-definite. Likewise the four-point inequality $$ d_{13}{}^2 + d_{24}{}^2 \le d_{12}{}^2 + d_{23}{}^2 + d_{34}{}^2 + d_{14}{}^2 \tag{2} $$ is true in any tree. But the inequality $$ 3(d_{14}{}^2 + d_{24}{}^2 + d_{34}{}^2) \ge d_{12}{}^2 + d_{23}{}^2 + d_{13}{}^2 \tag{3} $$ is true for Euclidean spaces, but not for trees. (Take a tripod, where $x_4$ is the central point of the tripod and the other three points are on different branches.) The best such inequality that is true for trees is $$ 4(d_{14}{}^2 + d_{24}{}^2 + d_{34}{}^2) \ge d_{12}{}^2 + d_{23}{}^2 + d_{13}{}^2. \tag{4} $$ Given that any inequality satisfying $(1)$ will also hold for products of trees, it is natural to ask about CAT(0) spaces as well. Question 2. Which inequalities of the form $(1)$ hold for CAT(0) spaces? More generally, what length inequalities characterize when a finite set of points can be embedded in a CAT(0) space? You could also ask the questions in a dual form. Question 3. Which squared pairwise distances occur between a finite subset of a CAT(0) space? (This is a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n(n-1)/2}$.) For all the questions, I'm looking for a "nice" description, along the lines of the positive semi-definite description for Euclidean spaces. It's worth mentioning that Berg and Nikolaev [Geom. Dedicata (2008) 133:1995-218)] proved that inequality $(2)$ characterizes CAT(0) spaces among geodesic metric spaces. But that inequality is not enough to guarantee that even a set of 4 points is embeddable in a CAT(0) space. Update: It appears that Question 2 is a known hard question. But it also appears that Question 1 and Question 2 are different, although the stated reference gives only the barest sketch of a proof; I'd like to see some explicit example. I'm also most interested in Question 1. 

Robert Lipshitz has the nicest formula, described in Corollary 4.3 of this paper: Robert Lipshitz, "A cylindrical reformulation of Heegaard Floer homology", Geometry & Topology 10 (2006) 955–1096, DOI: 10.2140/gt.2006.10.955, arXiv: math.SG/0502404 At this stage, I would not worry so much about the proof of the formula, although it's also not so bad. 

Let $q = q(z)\,dz^2$ be a quadratic differential on the unit disk $D(1)$, normalized so that $\int_{D(1)}|q| = 1$. I have a fairly convoluted argument that for any smaller disk $D(r)$ with $r < 1$, there is an upper bound on the area: $$ \int_{D_r} |q| \le r^2. $$ (The optimal quadratic differential is just $dz^2$.) This result feels quite elementary, and there ought to be a better proof; does anyone have one? (This fits into a larger context of more general surfaces and subsurfaces. I can prove similar statements there with non-explicit bounds, but this would be a nice warm-up example if there's a short proof.) 

I got a request for some more details on the reasoning. $F(S^1,k)$ breaks into connected components according to the cyclic ordering of the $k$ points $x_1,\dots,x_k$. There are $(k-1)!$ different cyclic orderings of $k$ points, giving the $(k-1)!$ connected components. On each component, we can take the position of $x_1$ as one of the coordinates, and then keep track of the successive differences between adjacent points (in the cyclic order) as the remaining coordinates. The successive differences are a choice of $k-1$ positive reals whose sum is less than one, which is a $(k-1)$-dimensional simplex. Thus this component of $F(S^1,k)$ is homeomorphic to a circle cross a simplex, which is homotopy equivalent to a circle, as claimed. To find $C(S^1,k)$, we take the quotient of $F(S^1,k)$ by the symmetric group $S_k$. Some of the permutations will identify the different components of $F(S^1,k)$, but there is also a $k$-cycle in the given cyclic order, which takes that component to itself. As a result, $C(S^1,k)$ is connected, and is homeomorphic to a non-trivial simplex bundle over $S^1$. (For instance, $C(S^1,2)$ is a Möbius strip.) $C(S^1,k)$ is still homotopy-equivalent to a circle. The generator of $\pi_1$ of a component of $F(S^1,k)$ is a loop that takes $x_1$ all the way around the circle to itself, while the generator of $\pi_1$ of a component of $C(S^1,k)$ cyclically permutes the $x_i$. 

Work with the logs of probability directly, rather than trying to compute the probability and then compute the log. You can do arithmetic with the logs, as well; multiplication becomes addition, of course. Addition is somewhat more complicated, but it's not too hard to work out how to do it without taking the exponential back. In response to JM's question, it's easy to come up with practical problems where the probability of something happening is indeed so low that it underflows a float or double. 

Every automorphism of $F_n$ can be realized by an automorphism of the 3-dimensional handlebody of genus $n$, obtained by attaching $n$ 1-handles to a 3-ball. 

They are honestly used all over the place, it's easy for this to get out of control. Maybe one non-obvious place is the construction of the canonical triangulation of a hyperbolic 3-manifold: Epstein, D. B. A., Penner, R. C., Euclidean decompositions of noncompact hyperbolic manifolds. J. Differential Geom. 27 (1988), no. 1, 67–80. 

I just came across this old question, which I happened to think about earlier. Let me give a more explicit description. As you noted, the binary tetrahedral group forms the vertices of a 24-cell. The 24-cell is self-dual, made up of 24 octahedra, with three meeting around a vertex. The 48 points of the binary octahedral group are the union of the 24 vertices of the 24-cell and the 24 vertices of the dual 24-cell (corresponding to faces of the 24-cell). You can see the faces of the convex hull of these 48 points as corresponding to the faces of the spherical Delaunay triangulation of these points. The obvious thing to do is divide each octahedron of the 24-cell into 8 tetrahedra (by coning to the center), but that turns out to be wrong (i.e., it is not the Delaunay triangulation). Instead, you subdivide the octahedra into 8 tetrahedra, and then for each pair of tetrahedra glued to each other from neighboring octahedra, you redivide them into 3 tetrahedra (by adding the edge of the dual 24-cell connecting the two centers). You can get the count of vertices, edges, faces, and cells that Will Sawin gave from this. I like to think about the dual to this simplicial complex, which is a simple polyhedron. ("Simple" here just means "dual to simplicial". More concretely, it is a polyhedral decomposition where the polyhedra meet in three around an edge and in four around a vertex, locally like a soap bubble.) This dual polyhedron is a decomposition of $S^3$ into 48 truncated cubes. This whole construction is entirely analogous to the way you can get the truncated-octahedron tiling of $\mathbb{R}^3$ by taking a cubical decomposition of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and its dual.
