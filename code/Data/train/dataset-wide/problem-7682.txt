Let $G$ be a locally compact subgroup, $\mu$ a Haar-measure. For $f \in L^1(G)$, and for $\pi$ a unitary, topology irreducible, representation of $G$ on an Hilbert space $H_\pi$, it is customary to define a continuous operator $\pi(f)$ on $H_\pi$ by $$\pi(f) v = \int_G f(g) \pi(g)(v) d\mu(g).$$ Let us say here that $f \in L^1(G)$ is of trace class if for every unitary, absolutely irreducible representation $\pi$ of $G$, the operator $\pi(f)$ is of trace class. (side question: is there a name outside for this notion?). I have many question about this notions, but let me give one: 

The answer is yes if $\rho_6$ is absolutely irreducible. Here is a proof when $p>n$ using pseudo-characters. The trace of $\rho_j$, for $j=2,3,6$, is a pseudo-character $T_j$ of $G$ to $\mathbb F_{p^j}$ of dimension $n$. For $g$ in $G$, we have $T_6(g)=T_2(g)=T_3(g) \in \mathbb F_{p^2} \cap \mathbb F_{p^3} = \mathbb F_p$. Hence $T_6$ is a pseudo-character absolutely irreducible of $G$ to $\mathbb F_p$ and such a pseudo-character over a finite field always comse from a representation $\rho_1$, which clearly satisfies your condition since two absolutely irreducible representations with the same trace are isomorphic over any field. Of course the same argument work when 2,3 are replaced by any relatively prime integers. Also I have supposed $p>n$ just for the convenience of using the classical theory of pseudo-characters, which works well under this condition, but in the general case Chenevier has a general theory (that he calls "determinant" -- see on his webpage at polytechnique) which works without this condition, and with which the proof above can be adapted without difficulties. On the other hand, the hypothesis absolutely irreducible is necessary for the method. I don't know if it is necessary for your question... 

The Jacobi sum of $n$ multiplicative character $\chi_1,\dots,\chi_n$ on a finite field $\mathbb F_q$ is defined as $$J(\chi_1,\dots,\chi_n) = \sum_{x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathbb F_q, x_1+\dots+x_n=1} \chi_1(x_1) \chi_2(x_2) \dots \chi_n(x_n).$$ One also considers the variant: $$J_0 (\chi_1,\dots,\chi_n) = \sum_{x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathbb F_q, x_1+\dots+x_n=0} \chi_1(x_1) \chi_2(x_2) \dots \chi_n(x_n)$$ It is well-known (see e.g. Ireland and Rosen) that one can compute the complex modulus of $J(\chi_1,\dots,\chi_n)$ and $J_0(\chi_1,\dots,\chi_n)$ (when the $\chi_i$ are "general" in some precise sense, $|J(\chi_1,\dots,\chi_n)|=q^{n-3/2}$, and the other cases are not hard to determine as well). The definition of the Jacobi sum can be rewritten in a more compact way using the maximal diagonal torus $T$ of $Gl_n$: for $\chi=(\chi_1,\dots,\chi_n)$ a character of the maximal torus, $$J(\chi) = \sum_{x \in T(\mathbb F_q), \ tr\ x = 1} \chi(x)$$ $$J_0(\chi)= \sum_{x \in T(\mathbb F_q), \ tr\ x = 0} \chi(x)$$ Now it is clear that the definition above of $J(\chi)$ makes sense when $T$ is replaced by any subtorus of $Gl_n$ defined over $\mathbb F_q$, not necessarily maximal or split. My question is 

Let $n$ be an integer. For $S$ a subset of $\{0,\dots,n\}$, define $$m(S) = \sum_{k \in S} {n \choose k}.$$ Let $M_n$ be the set of integers of the form $m(S)$ for all sets $S \subset \{0,\dots,n\}$. Obviously $M_n \subset \{0,\dots,2^n\}$ and for $n=1,2,3$ this inclusion is an equality. For $n \geq 4$ however, this inclusion is not an equality, as for instance $n-1$ is not in $M_n$. 

In particular, by how much (if anything) is it possible to improve on the trivial bound $|J(\chi)| \leq \sum_{x \in T(\mathbb F_q), \ tr\ x = 1} 1$? If the general question is too hard, here is one case I am especially interested: $T$ is the torus of $Gl_4$ of diagonal matrices $(x,y,y^{-1},x^{-1})$. So in this case, $T$ is still a split torus, but is not maximal (actually it it is the maximal torus of the symplectic group $Sp_4$ seen as a torus of $Gl_4$ through the natural inclusion). So in this case, in down-to-earth terms, $J_0(\chi)=\sum_{x,y \in \mathbb F_q, x + y + x^{-1} + y^{-1} =0} \chi_1(x) \chi_2(y)$. 

I disagree with Michael Grünewald's interpretation, which by the way doesn't answer the initial question: who Godement is he referring too? I think this is a joke made without acrimony. "Thought police", "innovation preventing", are much too strong phrases to translate Godement's light ironical quotation. To a french-spaking ear, "Haut Commissariat" in this context evokes the "Commissariat Général au Plan", created by the administration led by de Gaulle in 1946 (and including a large political spectrum, from right wing to communists). It was an institution without real power but which was supposed to prepare non-compulsory "plans" to develop the economy for the next five years, the idea being to take advantage of whatever was thought efficient in soviet-like planning while staying essentially a free-market economy. (Of course there are other institutions with that name, like UN's "haut-commissariat aux réfugiés", but really that the plan one that comes to mind). So back to quadratic reciprocity, I may be completely wrong but I imagine that the Haut-Commissaire in question might be R.P. Langlands and his huge program that has provided a non-compulsory, but hugely influential, planning for the research in "higher class field theory" since more than 40 years. 

No. That is perhaps a little too categorical, but a mathscinet search with Grothendieck as author and "modular form" or "forme modulaire" as "anywhere" gives no result. I don't remember him mentionning modular forms in "Recoltes et Semailles" either. More to the point, it is a commonplace in the field of modular and automorphic forms to wish that Grothendieck had given some time to the subject -- and made it a little more "Grothendieck-style". Pierre Cartier gave a talk at the IHES in January 2009 where he deplored that "Grothendieck and Langlands never met". Also, the correspondence between Serre and Grothendieck contains several letters where Serre tries to attract Grothendieck to the subject of modular forms, and where Grothendieck doesn't conceal his disinterest (to say the least). 

Now consider the composed map: $i: \mathbb R^\ast_+ \hookrightarrow I_k^\infty \hookrightarrow I_k \rightarrow I_k/k^\ast$, where the first map is the diagonal embedding of $\mathbb R^\ast$ in each of the component at infinity of $I_k$ (the product of which I call $I_k^\infty$). This map is clearly injective. Now call a Hecke character $\chi: I_k/k^\ast \rightarrow \mathbb C^\ast$ good if it is trivial on the image of $i$. Prop: for any Hecke character $\chi$, there are exactly one good character in its equivalence class. Proof: Note that $|i(x)|=x^n$ if $n=[k:\mathbb Q]$ (recall that the $|\ |$ on the component $\mathbb C$ is the square of the complex modulus). If $\chi$ and $\chi'$ are good characters in the same class, then $\psi = \chi (\chi')^{-1}$ is trivial on $I_k^1$ and on $i(\mathbb R^\ast)$, hence on $I_k$ since any element $x$ on $I_k$ can be written as $(x/ i(y)) i(y)$, with $y = |x|^{1/n} \in \mathbb R^\ast_+$, hence is in $I_k^1 i(\mathbb R_+^\ast)$. Hence the uniqueness. For the existence, by the lemma there exists $\beta: \mathbb R_\ast^+ \rightarrow \mathbb C^\ast$ such that $\beta^n = \chi \circ i$, and consider $\chi' = \chi\ \ \beta^{-1}(|\bullet|)$. 

If $E$ is a non-CM elliptic curve over $Q$, then it is a famous theorem of Serre that there is some integer $M(E)$ such that for any prime $\ell > M(E)$, the image of the Galois representations $\rho_{E,l}: G_{\mathbb Q} \rightarrow Gl_2(\mathbb F_\ell)$ on the $\ell$-torsion points of $E$ is surjectibe. If we define $M(E)$ as the smallest integer having this property, then Serre's bounded uniformity conjecture is that $M(E)$ is bounded above by an absolute constant (41 perhaps) when $E$ varies over all non-CM-elliptic curve over $\mathbb Q$. Let $N(E)$ be the product of all primes where $E$ has bad reduction. My question is: 

I am surprised that no one has answered so far this interesting question. I am not an expert at all, and don't know the answer, but I'll give my thoughts here. Perhaps me saying something stupid will encourage an expert to weigh in, if only to contradict me. So first, one thing I am pretty sure of is that when one consider the problem of classification of complex representations of $U_n(\mathbb F_q)$, we consider it for $n$ fixed, but $q$ variable among the prime powers. In other words, you consider $U_n$ as a group scheme over spec $\mathbb Z$, and you consider the complex representations of its group of points over all finite field. This is how, at least, the problem of classifying representation of G(\mathbb F_q) for $G$ a reductive (as opposed as unipotent) is presented and studied. No in what sense is the problem wild for G=U_n but not wild for G=GL_n ? I don't know. At first, I expected the results to be of a completely different nature in the two cases. But, after doing some bibliographical research, I am not so sure, and I am wondering if what people mean is not just that the results for U_n are just more complicated to prove, rather than more complicated to state. For $GL_2(\mathbb F_q)$, for instance, it has long been known that the degree of irreducible complex representations are $1, q, q-1, q+1$. The number of representations of each of those degrees is $q-1, q-1, 1/2q(q-1), 1/2(q-1)(q-2)$ respectively. Note that all those functions of $q$ are polynomials, which at first may be surprising. All this can be found in many textbooks, such as Fulton-Harris. We have similar results for all reductive group G, although they are more complicated to prove (one needs for instance the Deligne-Luztig theory of generalized induction, which uses étale cohomology). But this is now well-known. A general reference is Carter's book "representation of finite groups of Lie type", actually, of "reductive Lie type". What is the situation for $U_n$? Well, it turns out that conjecturally (and superficially at least) it doesn't look so different. I have found the following survey reference: Le and Magaard, Representations of Unitriangular Groups, in Buildings, Finite Geometries, and groups, Spirnger 2012. First about the degrees of irreducible complex representations of $U_n(\mathbb F_q)$ are exactly the $q^i$ for $i=0,1,\dots,m$, with $m = \lfloor n/2 \rfloor^2$. This was proved in 1995 by Issacs and Huppert. Note that a prori it is only obvious that the degrees are power of $p$, not of $q$ (where $p$ is the prime of which $q$ is a power), and it was not at all obvious that the power of $q$ appearing were bounded independently on $q$. But the result is here and is similar to the case of reductive group. What is striking however, is the recent date (1995) where he was proved, and just for the simplest class of unipotent group. Apparently, the similar question for general unipotent group is still open. Let us now consider the number of representations of each degree $q^i$. It seems that it is conjectured, but not known yet, that this number is a polynomial $P_{i,n}(q)$ with rational coefficients. So here again, the situation seems similar to the case of reductive groups, but much harder to prove. So to restate my point (which is a guess and may be false), it seems that what makes the theory of representation of $U_n(\mathbb F_q)$ wild is not the nature of the results, but the difficulty of their proofs. In this sense, it is different from other classification problems, as this one : the classification of semi-simple group over $\mathbb C$ of a given dimension is tame, because there are only finitely many such groups up to isomorphism, but the same question is wild for unipotnet group, because there are continuous family of such groups (except in low dimension). I was expecting something of this nature for representation of $U_n$ vs $Gl_n$, but apparently not.
