Land is included inside capital. You should not think of land only as the fields for agricultural production but as any physical space needed for productive processes. Therefore, land could be the terrain where a factory is placed, a block of offices etc. Similarly, do not think that land is a fixed factor. Although the dimensions of a country are given, abandoned terrains are available for the construction of new factories and buildings, forests can be cut, residential spaces can be turned to commercial etc. It is true that all this could be added as additional factors, but that will not lead to any improvement. With respect to energy and raw materials, notice that they are very special factors different than capital and labor. For instance, in a given year the maximum quantity of capital and labor that you can use is difficult to modify, you are constrained. However, this will change over time through capital accumulation, employment transitions etc. Changes in these two factors will determine the variation of GDP over time. However, one may think that at any point in time all energy and raw materials needed for the productive process are immediately available, they do not accumulate but are consumed and disappear, and therefore they do not play a role in determining the evolution of production over time (it is true that natural resources are a stock that deteriorate and decrease with their use, but in this framework, it is like if they were infinitely available). Productivity can make land more productive, increasing for example the tons of grain produced by ha. This would be captured in A. Nonetheless, if technologies allow a more efficient used of resources, this would have no impact on the production function because as we saw, they do not enter as factors. To conclude, the production function $Y=F(K,L)$ is a simplification of reality, but it is useful to the extent that it captures part of the most crucial factors that determine production and its evolution over time. It is not meant to be perfect, simply to help us understanding growth, in fact, differences in capital and labor alone can explain more than 80% of the cross-country differences of GDPpc and its growth rate. Given that the pressure on resources it is becoming more and more important and it is likely to constrained future production possibilities (if not today), it would be sensible to take this into account, and many economists do it with more sophisticated production functions. 

In the Solow model, we have the Solow residual often referred to as the level of technology A. More particularly : \begin{equation} Y(t) = [K(t)]^{\alpha} [A(t)L(t)]^{1-\alpha} \end{equation} Here it is defined as "is the portion of output not explained by the amount of inputs used in production" though there's an explanation of its fluctuations, I still do not understand how it is calculated. This paper from the National Bank of Belgium does leave me a bit confused because several measurements are said to be used but it sometimes sounds as if one took the total output for a year and substracted what wasn't explained directly by labour and capital, to obtain the residual? I'm not really sure how it is measured and where said measurements even come from, Can someone point me to an answer? Thanks for your time, Nate 

Is there any case where, when choosing bundles of goods, revealed preferences indicate to a different optimum/choice that maximum utility? Thanks. 

As you said, GDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the market value of all good and services produced in a certain period in a country, either by national or non-resident bodies (firms, non-profit organizations, government companies, households etc.) As an example, two firms producing in US, one owned by Americans and another one by Spanish businessmen, would both contribute to US GDP. The GNP (Gross National Product) measures the market value of all goods and services produced in a certain period by national bodies, independently of where this production takes place. For instance, the production of the Spanish firm in the US would not form part of the US GNP, but all the value of the production of American-owned firms abroad would be part of US GNP (Note: if the Spanish firm stays for more than a year in the US it would be considered resident). Why is GNP useful? Because it is a better indicator of the amount of income actually obtained by the citizens of a country in the reference period. Think of American firms producing abroad, their benefits will probably come back to the US in the form of dividends. To clarify, if the shares of a firm producing abroad are held by Americans, then these dividends would form part of US GNI but not GDP. Another important example are migrants remittances, they adds up to the GNI of their country but not to GDP. Although these two sources imply more income for the citizens of a country, they are ignored in the GDP. Notice, that in most of the countries GNP and GDP figures are very similar. However, in some countries with a high presence of foreign firms, for instance Ireland, GDP is considerably higher than GNP (more than 30%) because most of firms' profits leave the country. Using GDP to measure standards of living could be thus misleading, we would think that Irish are much richer than what they actually are, but more than 30% of the income generated in the country does not stay there. 

By estimating these models you also get an answer to your second question (you just have to look at the coefficients). Another way to go would be to estimate a VAR model where you include all of your indices and explanatory variables, and then see whether the lags of a given explanatory variable for a given index are jointly significant. This will have a slightly different interpretation: you would test whether your explanatory variables Granger-cause your indices even if you condition on all the indices. In your case I would be careful with it due to the relatively low number of observations. Practical concerns 

This problem is similar to first-price (sealed-bid) auctions with independent private values for the buyers. You can read about those for exaxmple here. Your first question was already ansewered in the comments: given others' efforts the probability of getting the reward is or 1. Let us assume that $e_1 \geq e_2 \geq \dots$ are the other players' efforts and $e$ is own effort. Then $$ \Pr[\text{getting }R | e, e_e, e_2, \dots] = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } e > e_3 \\ 0 & \text{if } e < e_3 \\ \dots & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$ What happens in case of ties is not exactly specified in the question, but as $\theta$ has a continuous distribution, if $e(\theta)$ is strictly monotone edge cases happen with 0 probability. Based on this, you can also calculate what happens if you do not condition on other players' strategies (you should probably look into order statistics). Now the player want to maximize the following: $$ EU(e) = \Pr[\text{getting }R | e]\times R - c(\theta, e) $$ 

Say I have a starting situation with Pareto efficient allocations between 2 individuals, now a third one comes in and changes the allocations. Now a fourth one, etc. Up untill a nth individual comes in. Do we now have to resolve (n-1) equations or n^(n-1) equilibria? How does the "difficulty" scale for n individuals? I don't know if that makes sense? Thanks. 

I'm looking for resources and explanations about a game that would explain what two candidates should expect from an election process? Example : Should they reveal their program first or second? Should they withold a part of their program (hidden information) a reveal it later in the election process ? Is there a way to describe a game with those two candidates where the strategies are measured in terms of electorate capture? I was wondering if there was a game theoretical framework that applies to social choices and particularly an election process. Note that this game takes place between the two candidates and their respective strategies, not between a candidate and his or her electorate. Thanks for your answers. 

You can start by assuming that players follow pure strategies, so $e_i = e(\theta_i)$. Also assume that effort is strictly monotone decreasing in $\theta$. And last, assume that players have symmetric strategies. 

One of the reasons why there are so many different models is that "having impact" is not that easy to define. It is not to test whether a variable has "any" effect on another variable, so researchers first have to come up with a model (based on theoretical considerations) that they can estimate and test. And of course the tests are different depending on the model they assume. Basic model One of the most basic (but powerful and widely used) concepts for these type of hypotheses is Granger-causality. Simply put, variable $A_t$ is said to Granger-cause variable $B_t$, if $A_t$ is useful in forecasting $B_t$. So you might try to find out which macro variables Granger-cause your indices. However to do formal tests you need to restrict the previous definition a bit. Let us say, that variable $A_t$ Granger-causes variable $B_t$ if $$E[B_t|B_{t-1}, B_{t-2}, ...] \neq [B_t|A_{t-1}, B_{t-1}, A_{t-2}, B_{t-2}, ...]$$ or in words, knowing the past values of $A_t$ helps us get a better prediction of the current value of $B_t$. The nice thing is, that the above hypothesis is easy to test: you just have to fit a linear model. So if your index variable is $Y_i$, and your explanatory variables are $\{X_{1t}, \dots X_{mt}\}$, then you just have to estimate the simple linear model $$ Y_t = \alpha + \sum_{s=1}^S \gamma_s Y_{t-s} \sum_{k=1}^m \beta_{ks} X_{k, t-s} + \epsilon_t $$ by OLS. Then $X_k$ Granger-causes $Y$ (in the expectation sense), if $\beta_{k1}, \dots \beta_{kS}$ are jointly significant. Practically to test which explanatory variables Granger-cause $Y_t$ you have to do the following: 

Let's say I'm given a matrix ixj with n games, is there a finite amount of Nash equilibria for those games? 

I'm looking for a software which may help me to both take notes and draw graphs during university lectures. It must have the ability to switch between texts and graphs, add other formats such as Office related format and pdf. Also, the the graphs should be easily tunable (preferably on the fly) and of course, shareable. Being able to draw matrices and operate with them would be great too. I can't seem to find an application/software for laptop which makes all of those easy in an economics related setting. Any idea? Thanks a lot 

We often talk about information as pricing being the best information or reflection of different aggregate pieces of information existing on markets. Why do we then also often hear that some prices do not reflect reality or do not compare with the real economy? Thanks. 

Now you have to write down the expected utility defined above in terms of integrals. As of assumption 2. (and the convexity of $c$) you can differentiate it with respect to $e$ to get a (sufficient) first order condition. Then using assumption 3. and luck will get you a solvable differential equation, and hopefully you can find a closed form for $e(\theta)$. That is going to be your equilibrium strategy. Or to be precise, one of the equilibrium strategies, as we have only looked at a subset (pure symmetric strategies). But finding others (or proving that none exist) is much more challenging. I hope this is enough to start. If you get stuck, I will gladly expand this answer with some concrete formulas. Disclaimer: I have not solved this problem, but as it is remarkably similar to the previously mentioned auction problems, this method should work. There might be another way using the revelation principle. You could come up with a (second price auction-like) game where reporting the truthful $e$ is the dominant strategy, and has the same expected payoffs. Then you could relatively simply calculate the expected payoffs, and based on that, getting the strategies might be quite easy. I am not sure this method works either, but if you are interested I can look into it.
