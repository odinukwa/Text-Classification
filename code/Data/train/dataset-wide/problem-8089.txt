Can we interchange the order of integration of following double integral ? $$I = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} F(x,y) \overline{R(x,y)} - R(x,y) \overline{F(x,y)} \; dx \; dy$$ Where $F(x,y)= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y}$ and $R(x,y)= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x^2 n^2 f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y}$ With $f(x)$ a function from $\mathbb{R^+}$ to $\mathbb{C}$, exponentially decreasing at infinity, such that near zero the asymptotic is $f(x)= a.x +O(x^2)$ ($a$ is a complex constant) and $\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x) dx=\int_{0}^{\infty} x^2 f(x) dx=0$ If we could interchange integration order we would have immediatly $I=0$: $$ I= \int_{0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(nx) \overline{x^2 n^2 f(nx)} - \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x^2 k^2 f(kx) \overline{ f(kx)} \; dx =0 $$ The integral $I$ can also be written (for $n$ and $k$ strictly positive integers) : $$I= \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sum_{n \ne k} f(nx)\overline{k^2 x^2 f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} - n^2 x^2 f(nx)\overline{ f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} dx\; dy$$ $$I= \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sum_{n \ne k} (n^2-k^2) x^2 f(nx)\overline{f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} dx\; dy$$ So showing we can interchange integration is equivalent to show that following integral is well defined: $$ \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} | \sum_{n \ne k} (n^2-k^2) x^2 f(nx)\overline{f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} | dx\; dy$$ But how can this be proved? I post a similar question here: Is this double integral of Fourier series always real? Note: $I$ is well-defined as $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y} $ and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^2 x^2 f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y}$ do not have any singularity for $x$ near zero (this can be shown using Poisson summation formula, even for $y=0$ there is no singularity as we have $\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x) dx=\int_{0}^{\infty} x^2 f(x) dx=0$). 

I've gone through many texts in algebraic geometry, specifically, Schubert calculus. They all claim that the Schubert classes $[\Omega_{\lambda}]$ form a basis for the cohomology ring of the complex Grassmannian of $k$-dimensional subspaces of $n$-dimensional complex space, i.e. $H^{*}(Gr(k, n))$, but without any proof. I would think that there could be a way to somehow show this result using an argument involving linear independence and span, but I'm not sure where to begin. In the back of Fulton's $\textit{Young tableaux}$, it is suggested to construct a filtration $$Gr(k, n)=Y_0 \supset Y_1 \supset \cdots,$$ where $Y_p$ is the union of all Schubert varieties $\Omega_{\lambda}$ with $|\lambda| \geq p$. Then I would have to take the cohomology of each member of the filtration, but how does one conclude that the Schubert classes form a basis of the cohomology ring in question? 

Suppose we have a Young diagram $\lambda$ inside an $r \times n$ rectangular grid, i.e. $\lambda \subset [r] \times [n]$. If I were to add just one more box to $\lambda$, obtaining a new partition (Young diagram) $\lambda'$, would $\lambda'$ still lie inside the $r \times n$ rectangular grid? I'm asking this question because I'm trying to show that the complement of Schubert cells $\Omega_\lambda ^o$ inside a Schubert variety $\Omega_\lambda$ is the union (not necessarily disjoint) of all Schubert varieties $\Omega_{\lambda'}$, where $\lambda'$ is obtained from $\lambda$ by adding one box. I think symbolically, what I'm trying to show is that $\Omega_{\lambda}- \Omega_{\lambda}^o= \bigcup_{\lambda' \supset \lambda} \Omega_{\lambda'}$. Anyhow, I will try to prove it myself, but would like some clarification as to whether my intuition is correct. 

So first, let's get a few problems out of the way, using that the intersection number is the smallest number of cliques needed to cover all edges of the graph. For all $n$, $i(K_n) = 1$. Next, we have $(*)$: $\exists n$ such that $G \times H = K_n$ is equivalent to $\exists n_g n_h$ such that $G = K_{n_g}$ and $H = K_{n_h}$ (by definition of the tensor product). Now we can say $(**)$: if $G = \cup_i K_{n_i}$ and $H = \cup_j K_{n_j}$ then $i(G \times H) = i(G) \cdot i(H)$. Claim: for any pair of graphs $G$, $H$, $i(G \times H) = i(G) \cdot i(H)$. To get a clique-covering of size $i(G) \cdot i(H)$, we just use the coverings of $G$ and $H$, as in $(**)$. We can prove that there is no smaller covering by contradiction. Suppose that there is a clique covering of $G \times H$ with $i(G \times H) < i(G) \cdot i(H)$. Then by $(*)$, we get a clique covering of (wlog) $G$ of size less than $i(G)$, contradicting the minimality of the covering of $G$. 

I'm not an expert on that specific question, and it's certainly the most difficult regime of $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$ to understand, so I'll just show the path. First, the question can be generalized as $p = n^{-\alpha} + w(n)$, with the question taking the specific instance of $\alpha = 1/2$ and $w(n) = (\ln n )^{1/2}$. The first thing to understand is the Shelah-Spencer result about $\mathcal{G}(n,n^{-\alpha})$. Fundamentally, it depends on the rationality of the exponent because the result depends on the threshold function for the appearance of certain subgraphs, in other words on the number of copies (asymptotically none, a finite number or infinitely many) of certain logical types in the graph. Precisely, for a subgraph $H$ the number of copies of $H$ is $O(n^v \cdot p^{e}) = O(n^{v-e\alpha})$, which should give an intuition of why some things break when $\alpha$ is rational. Now close to the rational power of $n$, the situation is quite tricky and full of subtleties, but there's a treatment in Spencer's wonderful book [1], in section 8.4. [0] Shelah, Saharon, and Joel Spencer. "Zero-one laws for sparse random graphs." Journal of the American Mathematical Society 1.1 (1988): 97-115. [1] Spencer, Joel.

Is it true that the number of Plücker relations for a Grassmannian $Gr(k,n)$ is equal to the dimension $k(n-k)$ of said Grassmannian? So far, for $Gr(2,5)$, I get exactly five Plücker relations: $$p_{12}p_{34}+ p_{23}p_{14}- p_{13}p_{24}=0,$$ $$p_{12}p_{35}+p_{23}p_{15}- p_{13}p_{25}=0,$$ $$p_{12}p_{45}+p_{24}p_{15}- p_{14}p_{25}=0,$$ $$p_{13}p_{45}+p_{34}p_{15}- p_{14}p_{35}=0,$$ $$p_{23}p_{45}+p_{34}p_{25}- p_{24}p_{35}=0.$$ I'm not sure, but I think that three of the above relations are algebraically independent, no? Are there supposed to be six Plücker relations for $Gr(2,5)$? 

In Manivel's Symmetric Functions, Schubert Polynomials, and Degeneracy Loci, I am confused with some parts of his proof of Pieri's Formula. It is given as Pieri's Formula $3.2.8$ (p. $109$): If $\lambda \subset m \times n$ is a partition and we have $k$ such that $1 \leq k \leq n$, then $$\sigma_{\lambda} \cup \sigma_{k} = \sum_{\nu \subset m \times n, \nu \in \lambda \otimes k} \sigma_{\nu}.$$ According to Manivel, to prove Pieri's Formula, we must show that if $|\lambda|+|\mu|= nm-k$, then $\sigma_{\lambda} \cup \sigma_{\mu} \cup \sigma_{k}=1$ with the following inequality condition: $$n-\lambda_{m} \geq \mu_{1} \geq n-\lambda_{m-1} \geq \mu_{2} \geq \cdots \geq n-\lambda_{1} \geq \mu_{m} \text{ }(1),$$ and that $\sigma_{\lambda} \cup \sigma_{\mu} \cup \sigma_{k}=0$ otherwise. Now Manivel defines the following spaces assuming $\lambda_{i}+ \mu_{n+1-i} \leq n \text{ } \forall i$: $$A_{i}= \langle v_{1},…,v_{n+i-\lambda_{i}} \rangle =V_{n+i-\lambda_{i}},$$ $$B_{i}= \langle v_{\mu_{m+1-i}+i},…,v_{m+n} \rangle = V^{'}_{n+m+1-i-\mu_{m+1-i}},$$ $$C_{i}= \langle v_{\mu_{m+1-i}-i},…,v_{n+i-\lambda_{i}} \rangle = A_{i} \cap B_{i}.$$ But then it is claimed that the inequality condition $(1)$ is satisfied if and only if $C_{1},…, C_{m}$ are direct summands, and also if and only if the sum of their dimensions is $m+k$. I don't see how that is the case as Manivel claims it to be without proof; this is where I'm confused. What is the justification for his claim?
