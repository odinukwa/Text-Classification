I'm a student and I want to determine the demand for a product (and consequently determine what will happen if the price of the product increases). I don't have access to any businesses that can provide the data for me (price and demand at that price? How do I estimate the demand curve or function by surveying people? What I currently have in mind is to ask people what amount of the product they'll demand at a given price and extrapolate this data for a city or a region. Additionally, what'd be a good sample size for such a survey? 

I'm currently learning the Mundell Fleming model, and so from my textbook and other sources I've figured out the effect of increase in money supply and government expenditure increase for the following conditions: 

Move the IS curve to the right. At this point (B), there will be a BOP deficit because the point is below the BP curve. Thus, the domestic currency will depreciate. Exports will rise, imports will decrease and thus net exports will rise. This will have two effects: (a) this will shift the IS curve further to the right (because net exports have risen, and so Y has risen) and (b) this will shift the BP curve to the right (because net exports have risen, improving the current account balance). The new equilibrium is at C. 

Hi I am reading Hayashi's econometrics and have got stuck in the review question 1.5.1. The question asks us to prove that the multicollinearity assumption of the CLRM is satisfied by the transformed data matrix CX where C is (n by n) invertible matrix and X is an (n by k) matrix with rank = k. We have to show that the rank of CX = k. I know this is a theorem in matrix algebra and we can prove that rank CX = Rank X = k. But Hayashi suggests in the hint to the question another way to prove it and says that we must show that for all non-zero vectors c it must be that Xc is not equal to zero. Now, I could easily show this from the the fact that X has a full rank. But I get stuck in showing the final result that rank (CX) = rank (X) = k. Any suggestions on how to go about this, will be very helpful. It might something very straightforward that I am missing. Thanks a lot in advance. P.S. In case you are interested in looking at the question it is on page 59 of chapter 1.$URL$ 

Fixed & floating exchange rates (perfect capital mobility / BP horizontal) Fixed & floating exchange rates (imperfect capital mobility, BP flatter than LM curve) Fixed exchange rate (imperfect capital mobility, BP steeper than LM curve) 

Does existing research show, for example, that if A & B relax labour mobility norms, poverty in both these countries reduces? Do note that I'm not talking about domestic labour mobility. 

Yes, the diagram represented in the question is correct. Assuming imperfect capital mobility (with the BP curve steeper than the LM curve), an increase in G will: 

I wanted to verify the relationship between inflation and unemployment empirically, so I took data from the World Bank and used excel to correlate them. I got a very, very bad correlation between unemployment and inflation (from 1991 to 2016). Am I doing something wrong here? I took these two sets of indicators: (1) Unemployment, total (modeled ILO estimate) and (2) Inflation, consumer prices. Here are the links: $URL$ and $URL$ I downloaded the data from here and I studied the data for the United States of America. Is the low correlation because of the fact that the market needs time to react to unemployment rates? If so how did Phillips study it in the first place? 

I am reading the 2014 annual reviews article by Hopenhayn and am struggling to reach the aggregation results he states in the general case of vector of inputs (let's for simplicity assume two inputs, labor and capital) in the section 2.2 of page 740. There is a more specific case also of a similar aggregation problem that he discusses in his basic model on page 738-739 using one input-labor. I was able to derive his aggregation result (basically using the first order condition that all the firms would equalize marginal product of labor), in the simpler case as given in eq: $1$ pg 738. However, in the general case of two inputs, I am stuck. The first order condition of course give us that all the firms would equalize MRTS $\left(\dfrac{MPn_{i}(k_i,n_i)}{MPk_{i}(k_i,l_i)}\right)$ but I can not move further and reach the aggregate result in this case. Let me quickly restate the problem here: For the firms indexed by 'i' maximize aggregate output subject to resource constraints. $\underset{k_i, l_i} Max \sum_i z_i (f(n_i, k_i))^{\eta} $ s.t. (i) $\sum_i n_i = N$ (ii) $\sum_i k_i = K$ where $f(n_i, k_i)$ is homogeneous of degree $1$. As stated above using the FOC for the above problem we need to arrive at the following: $y = \sum_i z_i (f(n_i, k_i))^{\eta} = \left[\sum z_i^{\frac{1}{1-\eta}}\right]^{1-\eta} f(N,K)^{\eta}$ Thanks for your help in advance. 

IS moves to the right (1 to 2) At B, there is a deficit in BOP, which causes the domestic currency to depreciate. This increases exports and decreases imports, which causes net exports to increase, which then causes Y to increase, which shifts IS further up (IS 3). At B, because of increase in net exports, BOP improve and so BP also shifts to the right. The economy settles at the new equilibrium C. 

I found a better diagram illustrating this (the diagram includes two cases: one with the BP flatter than the LM and one steeper; the points and movements marked with an asterik (*) are the ones concerned with the case of BP being steeper than the LM). (Image Courtesy of Polinomics: $URL$ 

If not, what type of trade financing do Chilean exporters or importers get? Is it all from private banks and insurers? 

Let's say we have a soft-drinks store. Say the store sells Pepsi and Coke. If the retailer drinks a bottle of coke from his own store, does that get counted into the GDP of a nation? Or is it only counted if someone else apart from the store owner consumes it by paying for it? How does this work? 

The advantages of 2-4 are that more people end up contributing to both the design and the code of the project, and it goes into a kind of ecosystem where strong ideas survive (by procreation if you will) and weak ones don't. Bugfixing and feature addition become community efforts. In scenarios #2 and 3, the developers adopting the project benefit from sound engineering principles and mature code. 3 and 4 are correlative. In scenario #4, the developers benefit when other people adopt and improve the code and give back (#3). It's advantageous to contribute back to the project so that your improvements get cemented in as other fixes and improvements go in on top of them, which you continue to benefit from. In my experience, all of these scenarios are commonplace. On my current software project, I'm one of about 12 developers and have worked on a system for about two years. We have incorporated about 5,000 open-source projects! We have spawned only a few new FOSS projects, and contributed back to maybe half a dozen. We aren't particularly good citizens in this case (other companies are much better), but this shows you the sheer scale of how this all works. Even on small projects, contributions from open-source can easily number in the dozens or hundreds. If we did not use any open-source software, development costs would balloon by a factor of 100-10,000. Scalability happens because of modularity of design and also through this kind of survival-of-the-fittest process where code can get refactored, forked, and so on. Survivability is usually better than proprietary alternatives because even if the code is no longer maintained, it's out there and other people who find value in it can maintain their own fork of it. Companies come and go and employees are hired and quit even faster. If you add a software dependency that you don't have the source code for or have only a small in-house team to maintain, you have incurred substantial risk. Big projects like the Linux kernel, gcc, Android and others often have a large number of companies actively contributing. It's not true that it's easier to write good and correct code than it is to read it (in most cases). Nor do you have to read all of the software you're using even if you are making modifications. You have to dive deeply into sections of it and read a lot, but not the whole. I could say more here about unit tests, but will omit that for brevity. The majority of open-source software is not developed by people in their free time. The practice is so phenomenally beneficial that it works without an optimizing marketplace. I personally suspect some kind of market-driven approach would greatly help, but I don't know what that approach might look like. People argue that there is a marketplace where reputation is the currency, but I don't think that's an accurate model. One currency at work is the time it takes to adopt a new piece of software. You want to find and use something that is active, simple, has good documentation, etc. So like a shopper you're looking for the best quality product for the least amount of time invested. 

I have a following type of problem: $Maximize\,\, F(s,x,y,z)$ $s,x,y,z$ s.t. (i) $g(x,y,z) \le I$ (ii) $x \ge 0$ (iii) $y \ge 0$ (iv) $s > 0$ That is there is no non negativity constraint on variable $z$. I have read about the Kuhn-Tucker method in the books but in all those cases the problem is fourmulated such that the non-negativity constraints apply to all the choice variables. How would my K-T optimality conditions change if I have no non-negativity constraint on $z$? My sense is that other than the regular K-T conditions for $x$ and $y$ and Lagrange multiplier, $\lambda$, we would have (a) $\frac{\partial \Large{L}}{\partial z} = 0$ (i.e. no inequality here) and NO such condition as (b) $z\,.\frac{\partial \Large{L}}{\partial z} = 0$ (which is obviously true given (a)). My entire confusion is because I have not seen such a formulation in books where K-T conditions are discussed and just want to be sure about my steps. What would the conditions be in case of $s$, where the inequality is strict? Here I would think that with strict inequality the problem is not well defined. The constraint set is not compact (not closed). Thanks a lot in advance.
