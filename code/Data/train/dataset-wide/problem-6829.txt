It seems to me that they do. Suppose $x$ is a Giffen good (that is, it violates the law of demand). Then when $p_x$ increases, the quantity of $x$ demanded increases. Suppose also that this increase of $p_x$ decreases the demand for $y$. Now, the standard definition for complements suggests that $x$ and $y$ are complements because the demand for $y$ decreased when $p_x$ increased. I would argue, however, that they are, in fact, better thought of as substitutes as the change in $p_x$ leads to the quantity demanded of $x$ increasing as the demand for $y$ decreases, i.e., the consumer is substituting from $y$ to $x$. By "standard definitions" of substitutes and complements, I'm referring to: 

A spiel on why this question is worth asking: In some environments, seemingly reasonable goal functions (or correspondences) yield impossibility results (i.e. no mechanism can implement it) or otherwise deeply unsatisfying results (e.g. the only mechanisms that can implement it are dictatorial). The classical example is, of course, Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. But if a client tells us her goal function, it's not all that helpful to simply respond to her: "Sorry, it can't be implemented." Rather, you might want to suggest what goal functions could be implemented. In the particular question above, I'm essentially taking a simple mechanism as given (the mechanism is simply that agents make their reports and the client/planner maximizes her objective taking those reports as true), and then asking for what objective functions, $U(\theta,\mathbf{c})$, that truthful reporting assumption can be valid. Note also that the $U(\theta,\mathbf{c})$ implicitly defines a goal function: $$ x \in f(\theta) \iff x \in \arg \max_\mathbf{c} \:U(\theta,\mathbf{c}).$$ 

As you can see, at 88c currently, the NZD is still well above its 10-year average against the AUD. Again, there's been a sharp dropoff of late -- NZD almost reached parity with the AUD quite recently. In terms of why there has been a dropoff of late, I think you've hit the nail on the head regarding dairy prices. Dairy (including baby formula) accounts for a large share of NZ's exports, and dairy prices are at a 6-year low currently. Fonterra, the dairy exporter, is scrambling to restructure. That alone probably explains the majority of the NZD's recent decline against the AUD. I think the NZD decline more broadly against the USD is probably partially attributable to the weakness of the AUD -- New Zealand's economy has close ties with the Australian economy, and the Aussies have suffered from decreasing commodity prices. Also, it takes two countries to calculate an exchange rate, so when looking at the NZD's decline against the USD, you might note that the US economy has been doing quite well over the last few years (at least if you're naively tracking the DJIA or something). Anyway, there's no need to panic about the NZ economy. Exporters benefit from a weak NZD. The tourism industry, another key sector in the NZ economy, benefits significantly from a weaker NZD also. If you're a Kiwi that likes to travel, and most seem to, the weak dollar isn't much fun, but such is life. 

Let $\theta_i$ be $i$'s private information about the state of the world, $\theta \in \Theta$, where $\theta = \times_i \theta_i$. Each agent reports $\hat{\theta_i}$ to a social planner, so that $\hat{\theta}$ is the reported state. Typically, in mechanism design, we take a goal function, $f(\theta): \theta \rightarrow X$, where $X$ is the set of all possible outcomes, as given and look for mechanisms that implement it. By the revelation principle, we know to look for mechanisms under which incentives are such that, $\forall i$, $\hat{\theta_i}=\theta_i$. This usually manifests itself in incentive compatibility constraints. However, there's a different (but related) question that could be asked. Suppose the social planner will directly make the choices, a vector $\mathbf{c}$, to maximize the social planner's utility function, $U(\theta,\mathbf{c})$, which is common knowledge. Individual agents have utility functions $u_i(\theta,\mathbf{c})$. Suppose also the social planner assumes the agents are truthful, so that $\theta = \hat{\theta}$. Then the social planner will choose $\mathbf{c}$ to solve: $$ \max_{\mathbf{c}}\:\: U(\hat{\theta},\mathbf{c}) $$ Under what conditions on $U$ and $u_i$ ($\forall i$) will the social planner's assumption that $\theta = \hat{\theta}$ be valid? Is anybody aware of papers that consider mechanism design from this angle? 

Do you agree that my reformulation of the problem is formally equivalent to yous? Can you think of any assumption weaker than assuming preference homogeneity within the family that I can try to invalidate with a counter-example? 

Define a Bayesian game as follows: $$G = \left\langle I, \left(A_i,T_i,(p_{t_i})_{t_i \in T_i}, u_i \right)_{i \in I} \right\rangle$$ 

Have you seen this done anywhere, either explicitly or implicitly? Supposing you haven't, what would you call this? 

Suppose I have alternatives $A$, $B$, and $C$. If I have strict preferences, that means that for any $x,y \in \{A,B,C\}$ such that $x \ne y$, either $x \succ y$ or $y \succ x$. Assume transitivity, non-reflexivity, completeness. Things get a lot less clear to me when I'm trying to talk about it as an order. How would I say that an agent has an order over the alternatives that would allow some ties? And how would I say an agent has an order over the alternatives that would not allow ties? Is it just the intuitive weak total order and strict total order, over alternatives where the weak and strict carry the same meaning as for preference relations and total is a synonym for complete? 

By the Wikipedia definition, a sales tax would technically be a proportional tax as the rate is fixed regardless of how the base (consumption) changes. However, by the textbook definition, and assuming that households with lower income consume a greater percentage of that income than households with higher income (i.e. have lower savings rates), a sales tax with a fixed rate would be regressive. You might be inclined to suggest that the textbook was defining it specifically for income taxes where the Wikipedia article is defining it generally. Actually, though, the authors of the text make it clear they mean their definition to be general. They say that they define it in terms of income because "all taxes are ultimately paid out of income." I think that statement is a bit imprecise, but whatever. They go on to show an example that demonstrates that sales taxes are regressive (conditional on lower-income households saving less). I agree with them on an intuitive level that sales taxes are regressive. But then why has Wikipedia decided on a definition that is independent of income, with one consequence being that sales taxes are proportional? 

And now my question: Am I correct that this implies that, in a BNE, every player (or rather, every type of every player) best responds given their beliefs about the types of other players, but that there is nothing in a BNE that pins down the beliefs a player (or type of player) has on the types of other players? That is to say, in a BNE, a player (or type of player) could have a degenerate belief (putting full probability on some $t_j^*$ for player $j$) in an equilibrium in which $t_j \ne t_j^*$? Put more simply, can a type of player's beliefs about the type of another player be wrong in a BNE? 

Note that Omission bias is inapplicable here as there are no harmful actions, and there are really no morality issues at play. On the other hand, Action bias might imply that agents are more likely to pick the first or second options here than they are to choose the third option, even though homo economicus would be indifferent across the three. To conclude, the key difference, as I see it, is that Action bias is really only relevant in situations with risk or ambiguity. I think technically speaking there is no ambiguity here, since the rules of the game and the balls in the urn are known to the player, but you could easily transform it into a game with ambiguity by saying the player doesn't know the contents of the urn and instead has some belief. Omission bias, on the other hand, is more related to morality. If a bad thing is going to happen, we'd rather it happen because of something that we didn't do than something that we did. 

Omission bias might lead the general to prefer option 2. The fuzzy human reasoning might be that in choosing the first option, the general somehow causes 200 deaths, while in choosing the second option, it is the enemy that causes the deaths, so the general may prefer the second option even though he should be indifferent between them. This example can not be applied for Action Bias because there is no ambiguity, uncertainty or risk in the example. 

Addendum: Remember that in a competitive equilibrium, each agent's marginal rate of substitution (MRS) equals the price ratio. Here, my agents have constant and different MRS's, so there can exist no competitive equilibrium with a price ratio that equals both of their MRS's. If each agent has an MRS that varies, then perhaps they could happen to be equal at the equilibrium price ratio. So maybe you could get away with some notion of local homogeneity of familial preferences. But you need to have them be locally homogenous at the competitive equilibrium, which is exactly what you're trying to prove exists, so it would be a bit circular. Important note: As mentioned previously, I'm assuming that the only way to prove existence is how Varian did it, via CEEI. There may be other proof techniques that skirt these issues, but I suspect not. Beyond CEEI: As the OP points out in the comments, proving existence of PEEFs through CEEI as Varian does is somewhat restrictive. I do not have a lot to say about proving existence of PEEFs directly, but the following is readily apparent: For any allocation satisfying your Pareto efficiency condition (ignore envy-freeness for the moment), for any $i,j$ such that $x_i, x_j, y_i, y_j > 0$, $$MRS_i = MRS_j$$ If this weren't true, there would be a Pareto improvement. Competitive equilibrium essentially equates the MRS's through the price ratio, but you still need to equate these MRS's just to find a Pareto efficient allocation. I think the familial constraints will make this very difficult -- it's not hard to come up with an environment and familial constraints such that there exists no Pareto efficient equilibrium satisfying those constraints. In any case, this could be another partial step towards an answer: Forget about envy-freeness. First try to come up with an assumption on preferences (and maybe on familial constraints) that guarantees the existence of a Pareto efficient allocation that satisfies familial constraints. Then worry about envy. 

Relative utilitarianism takes utilities as reported by agents, rescales them so that, for each agent, the alternatives have utility values between 0 and 1, and then chooses an alternative to maximize the (weighted) sum of the rescaled utilities. This forces an equality of sorts upon the agents as their utilities are all bounded on the same range. However, they can still express the degree to which they prefer A to B (relative to their preference of B over C) by making the gap between A and B larger (or smaller) than that between B and C. Has anybody come across a mechanism like this except that, instead of rescaling reported utilities to a given range, we simply take the ordinal preferences expressed by the reported utilities and assign predetermined utility values (respecting the order). That is, with relative utilitarianism: $$ (10,4,2,0) \rightarrow (1,0.4,0.2,0) \text{ and } (100,9,1,0) \rightarrow (1,0.09,0.01,0)$$ What I want to do is the following: $$ (10,4,2,0) \rightarrow (10,7,5,2) \text{ and } (100,9,1,0) \rightarrow (10,7,5,2)$$ The numbers in $(10,7,5,2)$ are irrelevant (they could be between 0 and 1) -- the point is just that they're the same across the two cases. Basically, I'm just extracting a preference order from the reported cardinal utilities and then slapping predetermined utility values on to them, respecting the order but not magnitudes in differences. Then, subsequently, I would choose an alternative to maximize the sum of utilities. Two related questions: 

In a penny auction, each bid raises the going price of an object by just one penny. However, placing such a bid is costly whether or not you win. Usually it costs one dollar to place a bid -- sometimes this is obfuscated by making you purchase bids (or bidding credits) before you participate. In any case, if the opening bid of an auction for something is 0.01, and the auction ends with the price at just 10, then one thousand bids have been placed and therefore the site has made 1,000 on top of what the item actually sells for (10). So if the item has a value of 500, then they would represent that as 98% discount even though they actually made a profit of 510, simply because they ignore the bidding costs (their primary source of profit). Now, if you happen to be the person who makes the winning bid, and you have not bid previously, then obviously you would be getting a very good deal -- in the example above, you would be paying 11 for an item that might be worth 100 or more. However, it is difficult (and out of your control) to be the winning bidder. After every bid, time is allowed for other bidders to outbid you, in which case you lose the money you spent on the bid. With all of this in mind, participating in penny auctions is essentially gambling. Sites that market these discounts and obfuscate the cost of bidding are highly misleading. I personally believe they should be banned. Note that these penny auction sites should not be confused with standard auction sites like Ebay. In standard auction sites, you pay only if you win -- you do not pay simply to make a bid. 

Obviously there has been a pretty sharp decline lately, but it's still not that far below the 10-year average of 74.27. It's also interesting to look at how it's been doing against the Australian dollar: 

Has anybody come across a nice, intuitive (i.e. neither formal nor technical) way to demonstrate how markets yield both productive and allocative efficiency? I suppose the allocative argument requires just a very superficial treatment of the first fundamental theorem, which is doable. But what about productive efficiency? I'm teaching Econ 101 and I don't like the textbook's treatment of the topic -- it basically asserts efficiency without even trying to argue it.
