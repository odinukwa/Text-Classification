Counterexample. First, let ${\cal B}$ be the Borel $\sigma$-algebra on ${\bf R}$ and let ${\cal B}'$ be the $\sigma$-algebra generated by ${\cal B}$ together with one non-Borel set $E$. Note that $E$ is a union of atoms of ${\cal B}$. Now for each $n$ let $\Sigma_n$ be the $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of ${\bf R} \times {\bf N}$ generated by sets of the form $A \times [n,\infty)$ for $A \in {\cal B}$ and sets of the form $B\times \{k\}$ for $B \in {\cal B}'$ and $k < n$. Since ${\cal B}$ is countably generated, so is each $\Sigma_n$. The atoms of $\Sigma_n$ are the singletons $\{(x,k)\}$ for $x \in {\bf R}$ and $k < n$ and the sets $\{x\}\times[n,\infty)$ for $x \in {\bf R}$. You don't get anything new in $\Sigma_{n+1}$ that's a union of atoms of $\Sigma_n$. However, $E\times{\bf N}$ appears in the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\bigcup_n \Sigma_n$, and this is a union of atoms of $\Sigma_0$. 

You could look at the set of operators in $B(H)$ which are diagonalized by a given basis. For each choice of orthonormal basis, this gives you an atomic maximal abelian von Neumann algebra (atomic masa). Now there is a natural topology on the space of all von Neumann algebras sitting inside $B(H)$ called the Effros-MarÃ©chal topology, so you could just restrict this topology to the set of atomic masas. Here is a link that may be helpful. 

I'm teaching a course over the summer (it's a sort of make-your-own course for non-majors) and I'm planning on organizing it as a math history course, hitting on major threads through about 1900, and focusing on the evolution of ideas and on people, rather than on the details of proofs. I've also been having a lot of trouble finding a good book covering this material (none finding books on ancient mathematics, but I want to focus on Renaissance to 19th Century, if possible), and so, here's my question: 

So, let's say we have a symplectic variety over $\mathbb{C}$, $M$, of dimension $2n$, and $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ Poisson commuting functions with $df_1\wedge\ldots\wedge df_n$ generically nonzero. Further assume that the fibers of the map $f:M\to\mathbb{C}^n$ determined by the $f_i$ is an open subset of an abelian variety and the vector fields $X_{f_i}$ are linear. We call such a thing an algebraically completely integrable Hamiltonian system. Now, I'm told that there's a definition of integrable system in PDEs that acts as some sort of stability condition, though I don't understand it. I've also been told that there's a way to, from an integrable system of PDEs, construct an integrable Hamiltonian system (just drop the condition that fibers be in abelian varieties), and that these two types of objects should be equivalent. My questions: 1) What's the correct formulation for PDEs to make something like this work out? (I know virtually nothing about PDEs, and would be quite grateful just to be pointed at a good reference, if there's too much I need to read to get a quick, understandable answer) 2) Is there a general method of going from an algebraically completely integrable Hamiltonian system, which is algebro-geometric in nature to working out the PDEs explicitly? Does it help if the symplectic variety is known to be the cotangent bundle of something? How about if the base is unirational? rational? 

This fails for $n = 2$. For simplicity consider the unit square $C = [0,1]^2$ instead of $B$. Then define $f$ by first setting $f(x,y) = (x + 1/2, y)$ for $(x,y) \in C$ with $x \leq 1/2$ --- this shifts the left half of the square onto the right half, no fixed points there. Define $f(x,y) = (2x - 3/2, y)$ for $(x,y) \in C$ with $x \geq 3/4$ --- this takes the right one-fourth of $C$ onto the left half, again no fixed points. Then the middle strip $[1/2, 3/4] \times [0,1]$ can be stretched around over the top of the square to complete the definition of a continuous map. I have a hard time describing that last step without drawing a picture, is it clear? 

I have a brief survey on predicativism here. But it may be more of the kind of "verbal" explanation that you've been unsatisfied with. Maybe proof theoretic ordinals could provide the kind of rigorous account that you want. Are you familiar with this subject? The Wikipedia article might be a good place to start. The rough idea is that, given a formal system $S$ that interprets some minimal amount of number theory, we look at the recursive well-orderings of the natural numbers that can be proven to be well-orderings in $S$. The supremum of the corresponding ordinals is a countable ordinal which provides a basic measure of the deductive strength of $S$. The relevance to your question is that, broadly speaking, systems with sufficiently small proof theoretic ordinal will be considered predicatively acceptable, while those whose proof theoretic ordinal is too large will not. As Todd alluded to in his comment, exactly where to draw the line, or whether there is an exact line to be drawn, has been controversial. However, there is no disputing that predicativism (in the historically primary sense that accepts countable constructions) sanctions Peano arithmetic, whose proof theoretic ordinal is $\epsilon_0$, and other systems in that neighborhood. Getting much beyond that point takes some work. I have argued here that predicatively acceptable constructions can get up to the small Veblen ordinal.

Ok. Concrete. A morphism of projective (quasi-projective) varieties f:V->W can be described by taking V and W, embedding them into projective spaces, and then f will be a collection of homogeneous rational functions, all of the same degree, such that the image of V is contained in W. The intuition here is that we're looking at algebraic maps of algebraic objects. Naturally, this is a bad way to do things from a modern perspective, but you said you wanted concrete. So as for motivating examples, take any rationally parameterized anything in projective space, and it's a morphism from some open subset of another projective space (where the rational functions are all defined). 

Isn't that the only one of length two? And for length three, shouldn't $\mathbb{F}_q[x,y]/(x^2,xy,y^2)$ work? I believe (possibly incorrectly) that here length and dimension over the base field agree. 

So, I've been running in both stacky circles and logarithmic circles and I've been wondering: is there a definition of log stack that is "useful"? I can imagine two such definitions: 1) A log stack is a stack along with an effective divisor (could be useful for studying moduli of smooth curves, then) 2) A log stack is a stack over the category of log schemes Is either one in standard use? Are they equivalent? 

I think you mean $|B(x,x)| \leq c(|x|^2 + |x|'^2)$, etc. As the problem is stated, you can take $A(x,y) = \langle x,y\rangle$ and $C(x,y) = B(x,y) - \langle x,y\rangle$. Then the answer is no, there's a counterexample where $H$ is two-dimensional. First, let us not demand that $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ and $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle'$ be equivalent. Set $\langle \vec{x},\vec{y}\rangle = x_1\bar{y}_1$ and $\langle \vec{x},\vec{y}\rangle' = x_2\bar{y}_2$. Then $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle''$ is the standard inner product on ${\bf C}^2$ and the form $B(\vec{x},\vec{y}) = \frac{1}{2}(x_1 + x_2)(y_1 + y_2)$ has norm 1. But $|A(\vec{x},\vec{x})| \leq |\vec{x}|^2 = |x_1|^2$ for all $\vec{x}$ implies that $A(e_1,e_2) = A(e_2,e_1) = 0$, and similarly for $C$, so their sum cannot have nonzero off-diagonal terms. Thus, we cannot write $B = A + C$ for such $A$ and $C$. Now modify that example by letting $\langle \vec{x},\vec{y}\rangle = (1-\epsilon)x_1\bar{y}_1 + \epsilon x_2 \bar{y}_2$ and $\langle \vec{x},\vec{y}\rangle' = \epsilon x_1\bar{y}_1 + (1 - \epsilon)x_2 \bar{y}_2$. For any $\epsilon > 0$, these are equivalent inner products. Let $B$ be as above; since $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle + \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle'$ is the standard inner product for any $\epsilon$, $B$ has norm 1 independent of $\epsilon$. If you could find $A$ and $C$ as desired for any $\epsilon > 0$, then by compactness (take a cluster point) you could find $A$ and $C$ as desired for $\epsilon = 0$, which we just saw is impossible. So for some $\epsilon > 0$ the given $B$ cannot be decomposed in the desired way. It's not hard to give explicit estimates on the off-diagonal entries of $A$ and $C$ in terms of $\epsilon$ (I guess $\sqrt{2\epsilon}$ is a bound), and this would allow you to give an explicit counterexample. But I prefer the preceding proof. 

It's not so much that it's two points of the stack, it's that the point of $\mathcal{A}_g$ has inertia, that is, the map restricted to a point (corresponding to a general curve) looks like $*\mapsto */\mathbb{Z}/2\cong B\mathbb{Z}/2$. The key is that a point of a moduli stack "looks like" $*/Aut$ where $Aut$ is the automorphism group of the object corresponding to the moduli point. So, for any point, we have $*/Aut(C)\mapsto */<Aut(C),-1>$ which is degree 2, with general point being like I described above. You can think of it as just being that if you have a set and quotient by $\mathbb{Z}/2$ it should be a double cover if the action is free, and here it's just not free, so we also have a double cover, because the target stops being just a set, but is rather a groupoid. 

My guess is that, traditionally, the Geometric Langlands program seems to be looking for a functor from D_{coh}(Loc,O)\to D_{coh}(^L Bun,D), that is, from the derived category on the space of local systems to the derived category of D-modules on the space of bundles for the Langlands dual. So, by reverse Langlands transformation, he might be asking for a functor in the other direction, to try to establish the equivalence. 

Not possible, in a completely regular space every open set is a union of cozero sets. Just collect the clopen sets that you use for these subordinate cozero sets. 

I'm surprised no one mentioned C${}^*$-algebras and their Automorphism Groups by Pedersen. The later chapters get a little specialized, but no one does basic C*-algebra more elegantly than this book. 

Yes, if $K$ is a closed convex subset of a Hilbert space $H$ there is a standard "projection" map $P: H \to K$ defined by letting $Pv$ be the closest element of $K$ to $v$. I guess the basic properties of this map are that $Pv = v$ for any $v \in K$ and $\|Pv - Pw\| \leq \|v - w\|$, i.e., $P$ is a contraction. 

It sounds like you want a representation independent construction, but did you know that every von Neumann algebra has an essentially unique canonical representation (the "standard form")? This is done in Takesaki vol II. I guess it's pretty straightforward to take the direct limit of a system of standard forms and I suspect that should do what you want. 

We call such modules projective. If you take $N\mapsto Hom(N,M)$ then you get injective modules. This is fairly basic, and covered in any homological algebra book, and mentioned on wikipedia. 

In both cases, I'm particularly interested in finite covers of $\mathcal{M}_g,\mathcal{A}_g$ and other moduli spaces, if that helps to know how the variety is given. 

(Reference for all of this: anything on Poisson manifolds, in particular, wikipedia.) Now, I've seen people seriously (for instance, in Vanhaecke's book) extend this notion to affine varieties over $\mathbb{C}$, where being Poisson means that the structure sheaf is a sheaf of Poisson Algebras, specifically, a Poisson algebra is an associative algebra along with a Lie bracket that is a derivation in each variable. Now, what I'm interested in is how far this can be generalized and still have something where there are interesting (new!) examples. For instance, is "Poisson Scheme $X$ over $S$" a real object of interest? Specifically, I'm wondering if there are any examples where $S$ is not the spectrum of a field of characteristic zero, say $S$ is a finite field, or something positive dimensional, or nonreduced, etc, and if there are examples of this form, what makes them interesting? For instance, one reason that Poisson manifolds are interesting is that they are applicable to physics and, in fact in many cases to problems related to the geometry of the moduli space of vector bundles on a Riemann surface.
