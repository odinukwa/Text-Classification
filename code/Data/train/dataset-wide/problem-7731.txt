We can think of the "tangent category" of a category $\mathcal{C}$ at an object $A$ as being the abelian group objects in the overcategory $\mathcal{C}/A$ (with whatever conditions I need on $\mathcal{C}$ for this to make sense). In the case that $\mathcal{C}$ is commutative rings, I can think of this as being the category of square zero extensions of $A$, or equivalently, $A$-modules. Suppose I were to iterate this process. Can I think of iterations as being like higher level "approximations" (i.e. quadratic category, cubic category)? If I iterate it a countable number of times, do I obtain some sort of formal object? One obvious initial issue with my question is to determine what one means by iterate. I imagine it might make sense to take the tangent category AGAIN at the point $A$, which corresponds to the square zero extension $A[x]/x^2$. At the first level, this obtains all $A$-modules. Also, everything in the category of $A$-modules is already an abelian group, so what do I want to mean by taking abelian group objects over $A$ (as the square-zero extension of itself)? Is it the case that not all $A$-modules are in fact abelian group objects in the overcategory over some particular module? thanks! 

Let $A$ be a connected $E_{n+1}$-ring spectrum and let $\alpha\in\pi_k(A)$. I am having trouble showing that attaching an $E_n$-cell along $\alpha$ will necessarily not kill an element $\beta\in\pi_k(A)$ unless $\beta$ is a multiple of $\alpha$. Perhaps this is not true, but it seems plausible to me since attaching an $E_n$-cell seems like everything above the cell that kills $\alpha$ itself should be in higher dimensions. To be precise: we can "attach an $E_n$-$A$-cell" to $A$ along $\alpha$ by taking the pushout of the following span in $E_n$-$A$-algebras: $$A\overset{\overline{0}}\leftarrow F_{E_n}(\Sigma^kA)\overset{\overline{\alpha}}\to A $$ where $F_{E_n}$ is the free $E_n$-$A$-algebra functor, $\overline{0}$ is the adjoint of the zero map $\Sigma^kA\to A$ and $\overline{\alpha}$ is the adjoint of the $A$-module map $\Sigma^kA\to A$ induced by $\alpha$. It seems to me that there should be a "bottom layer" of $F_{E_n}(\Sigma^kA)$ that kills of $\alpha$, but that everything else (used to kill off the powers of $\alpha$ in a homotopy coherent way) should happen in higher dimensions, so cannot kill $\beta$. Is this true? It may be useful to notice that, according to Lemma 4.4 of this paper of Antolin-Camarena and Barthel, that the above pushout is equivalent to $Ind_0^n(cof(\Sigma^k A\to A))$ where $Ind_0^n$ is the left adjoint to the forgetful functor from $E_n$-$A$-algebras to $E_0$-$A$-algebras (where $E_0$-$A$-algebras here just means unital $A$-modules). I should also mention that this is the pretty clearly the best we can do in general, since as Tyler pointed out in the comments it's relatively easy to attach a structured cell along something in degree $k$ and kill something in degree $k+1$. And his example is not rare either. I can construct an infinite family of ring spectra in which this occurs for arbitrarily large degrees, when only attaching $E_1$-$A$-cells. 

If one has a normal Lie group inclusion $H\to G$, with quotient $G/H$, and a $G$-manifold $X$, one can take the quotient $X/H$. Then the $G$-action on $X/H$ factors thru a $G/H$-action, so one can take the quotient again to obtain $(X/H)/(G/H)$. It is known classically that $(X/H)/(G/H)\cong X/G$ (see, e.g. Bourbaki's book on Lie Groups and Lie Algebras, Section 1.6 of Chapter III). In a less structured setting, say, May's "Classifying Spaces and Fibrations" where the $H$ and $G$ are not Lie groups, but only topological monoids, and $X$ is just an object of the category of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces, we can still produce the quotient monoid $G/H$ and quotient space $X/H$ by a bar construction. One could take this one step further and work just with a spectrum $X$ with an action of a topological monoid $G$. One can still take the quotient by $H$, and can still try to then take the quotient again by $G/H$. This all seems like it should be some purely formal bar construction thing. My question is: where (if anywhere) can I find a proof that for a general model or quasi- category $C$, and a $G$-action on an object $X\in C$, the iterated quotient $(X/H)/(G/H)$ is equivalent to $X/G$? It'd also be nice to see a general proof for spaces or spectra. 

Given a fiber square of simplicial sets $$\begin{array}{cc} & \hspace{-7mm} E \\ &\hspace{-7mm}\downarrow \\ \ast\longrightarrow &\hspace{-7mm} B \end{array}$$ and a homology theory $h(-)$, there is an associated Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence converging to the homology of the homotopy fiber $F$. This is just the spectral sequence for a cosimplicial space, specifically a cobar construction $C^\bullet(E,B,\ast)$. It is claimed in this paper of Hopkins and Ravenel, in the middle of page 7, that if this Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence converges strongly then $\Sigma_+^\infty Tot(C^\bullet(E,B,\ast))\simeq Tot(C^\bullet(\Sigma^\infty_+E,\Sigma^\infty_+ B,\mathbb{S}))$. Why is this true? I know from an old paper of Bousfield that the EMSS for stable homotopy converges strongly in certain nice cases (e.g. if $B$ is simply connected), but does that give me an actual equivalence of objects? That only seems to tell me nice things about the algebra. For instance that there exists a finite filtration of $\pi_n^S(F)$ whose filtration quotients are the $E_{i,j}^\infty$ for $i+j=n$. That seems several steps away from making a general statement about the suspension spectrum functor commuting with totalization. More generally, are there other functors $Top\to Spectra$ which commute in this fashion? For instance, it seems like the Thom spectrum functor (a sort of twisted suspension spectrum functor) for suitable fibrations should also commute with totalization is suspension spectrum does. EDIT---------------------------- I've also discovered this mysterious correspondence between Tom Goodwillie and Mike Hopkins (this is how people talked about this stuff before MO I guess!) that shows that suspension commutes with Tot in certain cases. $URL$ 

Given a distributive lattice $A$ we can look at $Spec(A)$, whose points are prime ideals and its open sets are given similarly to the Zariski topology on Spec of a ring. That is, the basis of open sets is composed of sets of the form $D(I)=\{p~\mathrm{prime~in~A}:I\nsubseteq p\}$. 

I'm trying to find a reference which defines and discusses some properties of connections and flat connections on the cotangent complex in a homotopical setting. That is to say, a connection or flat connection on a morphism of highly structured ring spectra. This is the sort of thing I feel like might be written down somewhere by Jacob Lurie or John Francis, and I'm actively looking for it, but of course that's a lot of ground to cover. Also, it might be written down somewhere else (perhaps Illusie or someone defined a notion of a connection on the cotangent complex at some point that I can generalize to the setting of ring spectra). Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

So, given a prime ideal, it is not hard to show that its complement is a prime filter. Hence there is a set bijection between the set of prime ideals and the set of prime filters. Does anyone know, if we force this bijection to be a homeomorphism based on the topology on $Spec(A)$, is there a nice description of the open basis elements on the set of prime filters of $A$? 

There is a pretty well known, and widely written about, adjunction between augmented algebras and coaugmented coalgebras given by taking the bar construction on algebras and the cobar construction on coalgebras. Sometimes, under certain circumstances (for instance, if your algebras are group-like loop spaces), this adjunction is an equivalence (e.g. the equivalence between group-like loop spaces and connected spaces) My question is: when does this lift to categories of modules and comodules? In other words, given an augmented monoid $A$ (augmented, let's say, over $k$) and an $A$-module $X$, we can produce a $BA$-comodule $BX$ by taking a bar construction $Bar(X,A,k)$, which is effectively a kind of ``quotient" by the $A$-action. There should, I feel, be a right adjoint going from $BA$-comodules to $A$-modules, given by $Cobar(C,BA,k)$ ($C$ being a comodule). A good example is the case of $G$-spaces for a discrete group $G$. If we have a group action of $G$ on a space $X$, then we have an "action groupoid" which is basically a simplicial diagram whose bottom part looks like $G\times X\rightrightarrows X$ and whose colimit is $X//G$. In particular, we now also have a map $X//G\to BG=\ast//G$ endowing $X//G$ with a $BG$-comodule structure (using the diagonal map of $X//G$). On the other hand, given a map $Y\to BG$, we can perform a cobar construction whose effect is to take the fiber of $Y$ over the base point, which is, by elementary topological considerations, once again a $G$-space. I'm skipping a lot of the technicalities of describing this kind of structure, but I'm really interested in knowing how general this structure is. In particular, I'd really like to be able to go between modules and comodules, and I'd really like to do this in some homotopical-enough setting (e.g. quasicategories or simplicial model categories). Are there well known references for this? Note: There are TONS of references for this kind of thing for going between algebras and coalgebras. I'm very specifically interested in doing this for modules and comodules. 

Okay, I'll take a crack at it, although this is basically just a translation of Tyler's comments from the chat room. Recall that given a topological group (or group like $A_\infty$-space) $A$, we can form the bar complex associated to $A$, $BA$ such that $\Omega BA\simeq A$. $BA$ is what is commonly known as the delooping of $A$. It is a defining characteristic of algebra objects that we can form this delooping. Moreover, the simplicial object of which this delooping is the geometric realization satisfies a special property often called a Segal condition. Intuitively, this condition says that at level $n$, this simplicial object looks like the $n$-fold tensor product (in whatever way tensor product makes sense to us) of the first level of the simplicial object. Note also that we're taking the tensor product relative to the zeroth level of the simplicial object. As a result, if we were interested considering group-objects in some category it would suffice to look at simplicial objects satisfying the Segal condition whose zeroth level is a terminal object (if we don't have this last condition, we would be looking at group-oid objects). Now, dualizing, we should say that an object is a coalgebra if it admits a looping which we model with the cobar complex (which we can always construct given a comonoidal structure). And the cobar complex satisfies a suitable coSegal condition. At first glance this seems kind of silly, since we can ALWAYS loop a space. But I claim that this is precisely because spaces are ALWAYS coalgebras! This of course is just by using the diagonal map. So, a coassociative comalgebra in $A_\infty$-ring spectra should be precisely the data of a cosimplicial object in $A_\infty$-rings satisfying a coSegal condition. I think that just composing the suspension spectrum functor with the cosimplicial space defining the comonoidal structure on a given space $X$, we can obtain that, using this definition, every space yields a coalgebra in spectra. What's more, if this space is an $n$-fold loop space, then this functor can be lifted to $E_n$-ring spectra. Now, we haven't touched the issue of cocommutativity at all. For the extent of this answer, we'll just have to take on faith that the right place for cocommutative coalgebras of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $C$ to live is $Alg_{E_\infty}(C^{op})$. The motivation for one to believe this is essentially section 5.2 of Lurie's "Higher Algebra" where it is shown that this is the place that the iterated cobar construction lands (producing a Koszul dual monoid to a commutative algebra) and that the iterated bar construction gets us back here. So, the point is that, all things considered, I believe that the right definition of a "cocommutative Hopf-algebra in associative ring spectra" is precisely an $E_\infty$-algebra in $(Alg(Spectra)^{op})$. Now, how do we know that the suspension spectrum of a loop space satisfies this? Well, first we need to notice that the suspension spectrum functor lands in $Alg(Spectra)$, as expected. Next, we need to notice that it is a monoidal functor with respect to the smash product in both categories, so there is a suitable monoidal op-ification of it (living inside the category of infinity categories) which takes commutative monoids in the opposite category of loop spaces (which, by the way, is ALL OF THEM), to commutative monoids in the opposite category of associative ring spectra. 

Can anyone tell me if there is a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for an arbitrary homotopy pushout (hence homotopy pullback) of spectra and an arbitrary (co)homology theory. If this comes from some easy way of writing down a pushout/pullback as a fiber sequence, it'd be really cool to see that spelled out (as if I were a baby). Also, it would also be really neat to know if there are general conditions on a model category or on the (co)homology theory to make this true. Thanks in advance. :-) 

In a series of three papers from the fifties, Eilenberg and MacLane did a pretty exhaustive study of what we now call "Eilenberg-MacLane spaces" and used a lot of machinery to do it, e.g. Whitehead's $\Gamma$ functor on groups, a $\ast$-product on the bar complex (which might be essentially the same thing as Loday's filtration of Hochschild homology by shuffle products, in a different context), iterated normalized bar constructions, and a whole slew of different products. There is a notion of Eilenberg-MacLane stacks for the additive group $\mathbb{G}_a$ (and presumably for other group schemes?), described in Toen's Champs Affines. Has the same sort of analysis been carried out for such "derived" Eilenberg MacLane spaces? That is, is it known that such stacks can be constructed by some sensible iterated bar construction? Do they have the same sorts of products on them? What exactly does homology of such simplicial schemes compute, stack (co)homology? There is for instance an interesting result of Eilenberg and MacLane (26.3 in paper II of On the Groups $H(\Pi,n)$) indicating that $H^3(K(\Pi,1),K(\Pi,1)^\ast;G)=0$, where $K(\Pi,1)^\ast$ is the subcomplex generated by the shuffle product of chains (they actually use the complexes $A(\Pi,1)$, which have identical homology but are "more perspicuous"). The proof seems to be completed by suspending chains in $K(\Pi,1)$ and looking at the cohomology of $K(\Pi,2)$. This seems that it would be even more interesting in the context of group schemes, since the double delooping of $\mathbb{G}_a$ is necessarily a stack. The cohomology of such stacks also seems to be the natural place to work with the so-called "polynomial cocycles" of Robert Heaton and others, which behave like group cohomology but don't actually make sense as cocycles in group cohomology.
