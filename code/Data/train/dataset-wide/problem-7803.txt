I'm not sure this should be an answer, but here is a proof that might be more conceptual resting on one non-trivial fact: if $E\rightarrow M$ is a real analytic fiber bundle over a real analytic manifold $M$ which admits a continuous section, then $E\rightarrow M$ admits a real analytic section. If you take this one black box, the proof is identical to the standard "reduction of structure" interpretation of a metric on a vector bundle. Specifically, let $V\rightarrow M$ be a real analytic vector bundle. If $E\rightarrow M$ is the principal $GL(n,\mathbb{R})$-frame bundle of $V$, it has an induced real analytic structure. A $C^{r}$-metric on $V$ is equivalent to a $C^{r}$-reduction of structure of $E$ to the orthogonal group, which is equivalent to a $C^{r}$-section of the associated bundle of homogeneous spaces $E\times_{GL(n,\mathbb{R})}GL(n, \mathbb{R})/O(n).$ This bundle of homogeneous spaces has a $C^{0}$-section since the fibers are contractible, and therefore by our black box it has a real analytic section. This proves $V\rightarrow M$ admits a real analytic metric. See $URL$ section 5.8 for a discussion of these matters. There they verify that one can even approximate as well as one likes a $C^{k}$ metric by an analytic one in the $C^{k}$-topology. Of course, as you see there, the proofs of the black box rely on embedding $M$ real analytically into some Euclidean space, and therefore this proof is really not "different" than the one explained by Mike Miller in the comments. 

Given a closed, oriented surface $\Sigma$ of genus greater than 1, let $Mod(\Sigma)$ denote the mapping class group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of $\Sigma$ up to isotopy. Given any finite subgroup $F\subset Mod(\Sigma),$ the affirmative solution to the Nielsen Realization problem states that there exists a hyperbolic metric $h$ on $\Sigma$ such that $F$ is isomorphic to the isometry group of $h.$ Now, by Hurwitz's Theorem, the order of $F$ is bounded above by $84(g-1).$ I've always wondered if there was a topological/algebraic method to deduce a uniform bound on the order of finite subgroups of the mapping class group without going through the above mentioned argument. If $Mod(\Sigma)$ were a linear group over a field of characteristic zero, I suppose this would follow immediately from Selberg's Lemma, but I vaguely recall hearing that $Mod(\Sigma)$ has no faithful, finite dimensional linear representations. So, my question is: is there a way to see that finite subgroups of the mapping class group have a uniform bound on their order without using the above argument, and if so how sharp can one make the bounds in this manner. I've long been curious about this question and finally remembered to post it on mathoverflow. As always, thanks for your input. 

Let $(M,g)$ be a negatively curved, closed Riemannian manifold. I'll ask the question first, then explain the involved players. This data defines the Patterson-Sullivan length function, \begin{align} L_{g}:\mathcal{M}_{-}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \end{align} where $\mathcal{M}_{-}$ is the space of Riemannian metrics on $M$ which have negative sectional curvature. The question is the following, suppose $g_{t}$ is a $C^k$-one parameter family of negatively curved Riemannian metrics defined on some open interval $(a,b).$ What is the regularity of $L_g:(a,b)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $t\mapsto L_{g}(g_t)?$ In an ideal world, if the variation in metrics is real analytic, this function would also vary real analytically. There are some known instances of this phenomenon. For instance, the paper of Bridgeman-Taylor shows the veracity of this result for the slightly different case of convex-cocompact hyperbolic metrics (which are infinite volume, but it's a very similar setup). $URL$ Unfortunately, their proof relies crucially on some properties of the deformation theory of convex-cocompact hyperbolic metrics, and so cannot be carried over to this context. Some explanation now. For a pair of negatively curved metrics $g,g',$ there is a conjugacy (for the $\pi_1(M)$-action) of the space of geodesics in the universal cover $\widetilde{M},$ \begin{align} f:\mathcal{G}(g)\rightarrow \mathcal{G}(g'). \end{align} The Patterson-Sullivan geodesic current $\sigma_g$ (for g) is a measure on the space of geodesics $\mathcal{G}(g)$ which is invariant under the action of $\pi_1(M).$ Using $f,$ one obtains the push-forward measure $f_{*}(\sigma_g).$ Combining this measure with arc-length measure for $g'$ along geodesics gives a measure on the total space of an $\mathbb{R}$-bundle over the space of geodesics, \begin{align} T^{1}(\widetilde{M})\rightarrow \mathcal{G}(g'). \end{align} The map here sends a unit vector to the unique geodesic to which it is tangent. This picture is invariant under the $\pi_1(M)$-action, and taking the quotient by the action yields a measure on the unit tangent bundle $T^{1}(M).$ The function $L_g(g')$ records the total mass of this measure. I didn't define the Patterson-Sullivan geodesic current here, but I'm banking on the fact that anyone who answers will already know the construction of this measure. If anyone would like more detail, I'll be happy to write it up. Let me know. 

Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a simple complex Lie algebra and let $\Delta$ be a system of positive roots relative a choice of Cartan subalgebra and $\mathfrak{b}$ the corresponding Borel subalgebra. Let $B<G$ the corresponding Borel subgroup in the connected Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}.$ Then, there is a theorem of Kostant which states the following: Let $V=\{u + \sum_{\alpha \in \Delta} v_{\alpha} \ | u \in \mathfrak{b}, 0\neq v_{\alpha}\in \mathfrak{g}_{-\alpha}\}$ where $\mathfrak{g}_{-\alpha}$ is the root space corresponding to the negative simple root $-\alpha.$ Then, there exists an affine subspace $L\subset V$ such that the mapping $\phi: B\times L\rightarrow V$ defined by $\phi(b, v)=Ad(b)(v)$ is an isomorphism of algebraic varieties. Is there a generalization of this theorem to parabolic subgroups/subalgebras other than the Borel? If there is not a generalization, is it because no such result can be true? I feel like there's probably a discussion of this somewhere in the vast literature on Lie algebras, but I haven't been able to turn anything up with google searches. Thank you very much for any help you can offer. 

Firstly, without the hypothesis that the manifold is compact, this is not true, with hyperbolic space and Euclidean space being the only other complete examples. Moving on, in three dimensions an Einstein metric has constant sectional curvature (this is just linear algebra). Hence, any complete Einstein metric on a simply connected 3-manifold is isometric to the sphere, hyperbolic space or Euclidean space by the classification of space forms which you can find in any text on Riemannian geometry. If the manifold is assumed compact and $1$-connected, then the only option is that the manifold is isometric, hence diffeomorphic, to the $3$-sphere since the others are non-compact. 

This post concerns the following question: Can we black-box the analysis of PDE's which arises in the construction of Kuranishi families for complex analytic structures? The deformation theory of compact complex manifolds hit a benchmark with the work of Kodaira-Spencer, Nirenberg and Kuranishi which culminated in the following results. Given a compact complex manifold $X$ and a deformation $p: \mathcal{X}\rightarrow B$ of $X$ over a pointed base $(B, b_{0})$, there exists a natural map \begin{align} KS: T_{b_{0}}B\rightarrow H^{1}(X, \Theta) \end{align} where $\Theta$ is the sheaf of germs of holomorphic vector fields on $X.$ Moreover, there is a natural obstruction map \begin{align} Ob: H^{1}(X, \Theta)\rightarrow H^{2}(X, \Theta) \end{align} such that $\alpha\in H^{1}(X, \Theta)$ is tangent to an honest deformation of $X$ if and only if $Ob(\alpha)=0.$ Pushing a bit further, $Ob^{-1}(0)$ is a complex analytic space which is (locally around 0) the base of a versal deformation of $X.$ In complex analytic geometry, there are a plethora of natural refinements of such deformation problems, a few examples include deformations of a pair $(X, E)$ where $X$ is a complex manifold and $E$ is a holomorphic vector bundle, or deformations of a pair $(Y, X)$ where $X$ is a complex manifold and $Y\hookrightarrow X$ is an embedded complex sub-manifold. In each of these aforementioned deformation problems, there is an analogous story of some sheaf (or complex of sheaves) whose (hyper)-cohomology governs the deformation problem, and an attendant Kodaira-Spencer and obstruction map connecting the infinitesimal theory to the local theory. The infinitesimal theory has a very beautiful general framework (given by DGLA's and functors from local analytic Artin $\mathbb{C}$-algebras to sets), but I've found it a bit discouraging that there seems to be a lack of such a general framework for passing from the infinitesimal to the local picture. Let me explain, the pioneering work of Kodaira-Spencer and Nirenberg used now standard, but non-trivial analysis (Hodge theory and the attendent analysis of elliptic PDE) to establish the existence of a versal family $\mathcal{X}\rightarrow Ob^{-1}(0)$ where we really intend an open subset around $0\in H^{1}(X, \Theta)$ when we say $Ob^{-1}(0).$ For the problem $(X, E)$ of a complex manifold and a holomorphic vector bundle, the paper of Chan-Suen $URL$ proves the same theorem, but feel the need to reiterate the same analytic strategy to establish the existence of a Kuranishi family. There are many other examples of this phenomenon, where the infinitesimal theory is standard, but due to lack of general theorems, the passage to the existence of a local versal deformation requires a standard application of the strategy outlined above. The result of this situation is that many papers in the literature end up spending many pages to establish the existence of Kuranishi families. My question follows: Question: Do there exist general theorems in the literature giving infinitesimal conditions on general deformation problems which guarantee the existence of a local Kuranishi family? If not, why not? My impression is that it's just too annoying to prove these general statements, but perhaps there's something much less trivial going on. To be a bit more precise, I am asking if there is a (finite) list of conditions, let's call then Condition A, such that the following theorem is true: "Theorem:" Let $X$ be a compact complex manifold equipped with auxiliary holomorphic data (this is imprecise, but I'm thinking of things like holomorphic vector bundles, holomorphic connections on them, sections of them, etc.) Suppose that $\mathcal{A}^{\bullet}$ is a complex of sheaves governing the deformation problem, by which I mean that (up to degree considerations) 

Let G be a complex simple Lie group of adjoint type. Then, it is well known that every such $G$ contains, unique up to conjugacy, an irreducibly embedded copy of $PSL(2,\mathbb{C}).$ This fact seems to play a critical role in why the theory of compact Riemann surfaces, in my sphere through the theory Higgs bundles and Hitchin representations, is so intricately tied to the geometry of these groups. In particular, every Fuchsian group uniformizing some Riemann surface can be seen to live in the split real form of $G,$ wherein it admits large families of deformations, and through this story the complex analysis of Riemann surfaces gets all tied up with the Lie theory of $G$ and the associated geometry of the symmetric space for $G.$ Of course, though I rarely think about this, there are plenty of algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero other than $\mathbb{C}$ out there, and from my scant knowledge, when you ask the question of how much the Lie theory of the associated algebraic groups is like that of their complex counterparts, or how much of the geometry of the associated homogeneous spaces reflects the complex case, the answer really depends on what question you might have asked. My question is this: given some other algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$ (I'm not positive I should be asking it to be algebraically closed), and some reasonable class of algebraic groups defined over $\mathbb{K},$ are there objects associated to that situation that play the kind of role that Riemann surfaces (and their fundamental groups) play in the realm of complex simple Lie groups. I can imagine that many people would point directly to the Langlands conjecture, and geometric Langlands, given this question, and although my knowledge is extremely limited regarding that story, I'd be more interested in hearing of other examples. Perhaps another way to phrase my question is, given a suitable class of algebraic groups over some (algebraically closed) field of characteristic zero other than $\mathbb{C},$ is there some other group/object that plays an equally fundamental role as $PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$ and it's split real form $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ plays in the case of groups defined over $\mathbb{C}.$ If this question isn't appropriate for mathoverflow, I understand and apologize for causing any trouble.
