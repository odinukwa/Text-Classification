For $x>0$ let $\pi(x)$ denote the number of primes not exceeding $x$. A well-known conjecture of Legendre states that $\pi(n^2)<\pi((n+1)^2)$ for any positive integer $n$. Here I ask the following natural question. QUESTION: Are all the numbers $\pi(n^2)/n^2\ (n=1,2,3,\ldots)$ pairwise distinct? Based on my computation, in 2015 I conjectured that the answer is yes. Moreover, my computation suggests that the sequence $$\frac{\pi(n^2)}{n^2}\ \ (n=15647,15648,\ldots)$$ is strictly decreasing. For each $k=3,4,5,\ldots$, I also conjectured that the sequence $$\frac{\pi(n^k)}{n^k}\ \ (n=2,3,\ldots)$$ is strictly decreasing. Any comments on the question are welcome! 

Here I ask the following question in additive combinatorics. QUESTION: Let $A$ be any finite subset of an additive abelian group $G$ with $|A|=n>3$. Can we write $A$ as $\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ so that all the $n$ sums \begin{gather*}a_1+a_2+a_3,\ a_2+a_3+a_4,\ \ldots, \\ a_{n-2}+a_{n-1}+a_n,\ a_{n-1}+a_n+a_1,\ a_n+a_1+a_2\end{gather*} are pairwise distinct? Note that if $G=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ is an addtive abelian group with $|G|=n>3$ then $2(a_1+\ldots+a_n)=0$ and hence \begin{align*}&(a_1+a_2+a_3)+\ldots+(a_{n-2}+a_{n-1}+a_n) \\&+(a_{n-1}+a_n+a_1)+(a_n+a_1+a_2) \\=&3(a_1+\ldots+a_n)=a_1+\ldots+a_n.\end{align*} This is the main motivation of my question. In 2013 I conjectured that the question always has a positive answer, and showed this when $G$ is torsion-free (cf. $URL$ However, I'm even unable to answer the question for $G=\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ with $p$ prime. Any comments are welcome! 

Lebesgue measure is both the unique SRB measure and the unique measure of maximal entropy for the cat map. Any Markov partition into $p$ rectangles gives a topological (semi-)conjugacy between the cat map and a subshift of finite type on $p$ symbols with some 0-1 transition matrix $A$. This conjugacy carries the measure of maximal entropy for the cat map (Lebesgue measure) into the measure of maximal entropy for the subshift, which is a Markov measure (namely, the Parry measure). In particular, the measures of the rectangles in the partition are the entries in the probability vector that defines the Parry measure. But these are given very explicitly in terms of the transition matrix $A$: if $u$ and $v$ are the left and right eigenvectors for $A$ corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue (which is $e^{h_\mathrm{top}(f)} = \phi$), then the entries in the probability vector are proportional to $u_i v_i$ (one needs to normalise so that they sum to 1). At this point it becomes linear algebra; given a 0-1 matrix whose maximal eigenvalue is $\phi$, show that the corresponding eigenvectors $u$ and $v$ have the property that $u_i v_i / (\sum_j u_j v_j)$ is of the form $\phi^n$. I'm not sure how difficult this is, but that's the direction I'd attack the problem from. 

Here I ask a somewhat curious question on Euler's totient function $\varphi$. QUESTION: Can we write each integer $n>8$ as $k+m$ with $k$ and $m$ distinct positive integers such that $\varphi(k)\varphi(m)$ is a square? Based on my computation, in 2014 I conjectured that the answer is yes. For example, \begin{align*}17&=5+12\ \ \text{with}\ \varphi(5)\varphi(12)=4\times4=4^2, \\24&=4+20\ \ \text{with}\ \ \varphi(4)\varphi(20)=2\times8=4^2, \\56&=8+48\ \ \text{with}\ \ \varphi(8)\varphi(48)=4\times16=8^2. \end{align*} Though the graph available from $URL$ reflecting the growth of $$\text{A236998}(n)=\left|\left\{0<k<\frac n2:\ \varphi(k)\varphi(n-k)\ \text{is a square}\right\}\right|$$ supports my conjecture, I feel rather puzzled since I do not see why the conjecture is reasonable. By the way, in 2013 I conjectured that any integer $n>5$ can be written as the sum of two positive integers $k$ and $m$ such that $(\varphi(k)+\varphi(m))/2$ is prime (cf. $URL$ This is still open. Any comments are welcome! 

In Section 2 of my talk "Simple ideas for famous problems" (available from $URL$ given in 1996, you will find a detailed proof of Erdos' result in his 1950 paper published in Summa Brasil. Math. In the proof, an extra congruence $x\equiv 3\pmod{31}$ is used. In my paper "On integers not of the form $\pm p^a\pm q^b$" [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 128(2000), no.4, 997--1002] (available from $URL$ I introduced a method to avoid a bunch of extra congruences, and used the technique to improve the Cohen-Selfridge work (with a detailed proof). After reading my 1996 talk material and my 2000 paper in Proc. AMS, you will remove your puzzle definitely! 

Now we can compute the cumulative density function for the overtake-time. Indeed, we have $P(t<T) = P(\theta/v<T) = P(\theta < Tv)$, which we can get by the following integral: $$ P(t<T) = \int_0^1 2(1-v) P(\theta < Tv | v) \,dv. $$ The probability $P(\theta < Tv | v)$ is given by the function $f(\theta,v) = \max(Tv,1)$. Thus for $T\leq 1$, we have $f(\theta,v)=Tv$ for all $v\in[0,1]$, so integrating gives $P(t<T) = T/3$, while for $T\geq 1$, we integrate and find $$ P(t<T) = \int_0^{1/T} 2(1-v)Tv\,dv + \int_{1/T}^1 2(1-v)\,dv = 1-\frac 1T + \frac 1{3T^2}. $$ So in the end the cumulative density function for the overtake-time is $$ P(t<T) = \begin{cases} \frac T3 & T\leq 1, \\ 1 - \frac 1T + \frac 1{3T^2} & T \geq 1. \end{cases} $$ The term $1/T$ in the last expression will give you the infinite mean, since upon differentiating the CDF you'll get a term $1/T^2$, which upon multiplying by $T$ and integrating to get the mean you end up integrating $1/T$ from $1$ to $\infty$. As for the median, it looks as though any proximity to $\pi/2$ is just a red herring, because solving for $P(t<T) = 1/2$ yields $T=1 + \frac 1{\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.57735\dots$. 

Let $\mathbb Z^+$ denote the set of positive integers. Here I ask the following question. QUESTION: Does each integer have the form $x^4-y^3+z^2$ with $x,y,z\in\mathbb Z^+$? I guess that the answer is affirmative. I have verified that any integer $m$ with $|m|\leqslant 10^5$ can be written as $x^4-y^3+z^2$ with $x,y,z\in\mathbb Z^+$ (cf. $URL$ For example, \begin{gather*}0=4^4-8^3+16^2,\ \ -1=1^4-3^3+5^2,\\-20=32^4-238^3+3526^2,\ \ 11019=4325^4-71383^3+3719409^2.\end{gather*} Moreover, based on some heuristic arguments, I conjecture that if $\{a,b,c\}$ is among the multisets $$\{2,3,3\},\ \{2,3,4\},\ \{2,3,5\},$$ then any integer $m$ can be written as $x^a+y^b-z^c$ with $x,y,z\in\mathbb Z^+$ in infinitely many ways. See Conjecture 5.1 and Remark 5.1 of my paper New conjectures on representations of integers (I). I don't know how to prove that the question has a positive answer. Any comments on the question are welcome! 

Is any integer $n>1$ the sum of a number of the form $4^k-k$ $(k=0,1,2\ldots$) and a positive squarefree number? Though such representations are very sparse, I conjecture that the answer is yes! For any positive integer $n$, let $a(n)$ be the number of nonnegative integers $k$ with $n-(4^k-k)$ positive and squarefree. The sequence $a(1),a(2),\ldots$ is available from $URL$ Note that $1\leqslant a(n)\leqslant 7$ for all $n=2,3,\ldots,10^5$. I have verified that $a(n)>0$ for every $n=2,3,\ldots,10^{10}$. It is natural to look at those integers $n>1$ with $a(n)=1$. I have found totally 112 such values below $2\times 10^9$ (cf. $URL$ the last of which is $180196927$ with $$180196927=4^{11}-11+2\times139\times227\times2789.$$ I guess that there are no other values of $n$ with $a(n)=1$. I have some other similar questions. For example, I conjecture that any positive integer can be written as the sum of a Fibonacci number and a positive odd squarefree number (cf. $URL$ Any comments are welcome! 

In the time since I asked this question, Dan Thompson and I have posted a preprint showing, among other things, that every Hölder continuous potential function on a β-shift has a unique equilibrium state. Since β-shifts do not have specification for most β>1, this gives an example of the sort I was after. 

In case the book referred to in Doug Lind's comment didn't have what you're looking for, a proof of this statement can be found in Section 2 of this paper: Doris Fiebig and Ulf-Rainer Fiebig, Invariants for subshifts via nested sequences of shifts of finite type, Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems 21 (2001), pp 1731-1758. There are also some other references there, including an article by Krieger with the proof, and another paper by Fiebig and Fiebig with lots more information on coded systems. 

If $a_i = b_j$, then there is a single outgoing edge from $(i,j)$, labeled with the common value, going to $(i+1,j+1)$. If $a_i < b_j$, then there is an edge $(i,j)\to (i+1,0)$ labeled with $a_i$, an edge $(i,j)\to (0,j+1)$ labeled with $b_j$, and for each $a_i < c < b_j$ there is an edge $(i,j)\to (0,0)$ labeled with $c$. 

For $x>0$ let $\pi(x)$ denote the number of primes not exceeding $x$. The prime-counting function $π(x)$ is quite mysterious. I'm curious when it maps a perfect power to a perfect power. So I consider the new diophantine equation $$\pi(x^m)=y^n\ \ \text{with}\ m,n\in\{2,3,\ldots\}\ \text{and}\ x,y\in\{1,2,3,\ldots\}.$$ QUESTION: (i) Does the equation $\pi(x^2)=y^2$ have infinitely many positive integer solutions? (ii) For the diophantine equation $$\pi(x^m)=y^n\ \ \text{with}\ m,n\geqslant 2,\ m+n>4,\ \text{and}\ x,y\in\{1,2,3,\ldots\},$$ apart from the five solutions $$\pi(89^2)=10^3,\ \pi(2^3)=2^2,\ \pi(3^3)=3^2,\ \pi(14^3)=20^2,\ \pi(1122^3)=8401^2,$$ are there any other solutions? Based on some heuristic arguments, I conjecture that part (i) has a positive answer and part (ii) has a negative answer. Any comments are welcome! 

The central binomial coefficients are those integers $$\binom{2n}n=\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}\ \ \ (n=0,1,2,\ldots).$$ QUESTION: Does each odd prime $p$ have a primitive root $g<p$ which is the sum of two central binomial coefficients? I conjecture that the answer is yes. For example, $$\binom{2\times3}3+\binom{2\times3}3=40\ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \binom{2\times1}1+\binom{2\times4}4=72$$ are primitive roots modulo the prime $109$. For the number of pairs $\{k,m\}$ ($0\leqslant k\leqslant m$) with $\binom{2k}k+\binom{2m}m$ not only smaller than the $n$th prime $p_n$ but also a primitive root modulo $p_n$, one may visit $URL$ I have verified that each odd prime $p<10^9$ has a primitive root $g<p$ which is the sum of two central binomial coefficients. Recall that the Catalan numbers are given by $$C_n=\frac1{n+1}\binom{2n}n=\binom{2n}n-\binom{2n}{n+1}\ \ (n=0,1,2,\ldots).$$ I also guess that every odd prime $p$ has a primitive root $g<p$ which is the sum of two Catalan numbers. Any comments are welcome! 

Consider the Smale horseshoe, call it $\Lambda$, with the corresponding map $f\colon \Lambda\to\Lambda$. Then $\Lambda$ is a locally maximal hyperbolic set. Moreover, $(\Lambda,f)$ is topologically conjugate to $(\Sigma,\sigma)$, where $\Sigma = \{0,1\}^\mathbb{Z}$ is the full shift on two symbols. Call the topological conjugacy between the two $\pi\colon \Sigma\to \Lambda$. Let $X\subset \Sigma$ be any closed $\sigma$-invariant subset. Then $\pi(X)\subset \Lambda$ is a hyperbolic set but is not necessarily locally maximal. Indeed, $\pi(X)$ is locally maximal if and only if $X$ is a subshift of finite type. As an extreme example of what may happen, you may take $X$ to be some minimal subshift that is not periodic, then $\pi(X)$ is a hyperbolic set that does not contain any periodic orbits. Similarly you can construct hyperbolic sets on which the map is uniquely ergodic, or has more or less any kind of behaviour you wish -- at least, anything you can realise with a shift space, which is quite a lot (see for example the book by Denker, Grillenberger, and Sigmund). The point of local maximality is that you ensure the types of behaviour that are typically associated with hyperbolic dynamics. 

Using this "bump function", one can do all sorts of "gluing" tricks: for example, if $f\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is any smooth map and $\epsilon>0$ is such that $|f(x)|<\epsilon$ for all $|x|\leq\delta$, then we can build a smooth map $F\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that 

Recall that the Mersenne numbers are those integers $M_p=2^p-1$ with $p$ prime. QUESTION: Is it true that for each prime $p>3$ there is a Mersenne number which is a quadratic nonresidue modulo $p$? In 2014 I conjectured further that for any prime $p>3$ there is a prime $q<p/2$ such that $M_q=2^q-1$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ (cf. $URL$ or $URL$ For example, $M_{17}=131071$ is a primitive root modulo the prime $37$. Of course, the question is easier than this difficult conjecture. I'm even unable to prove that each prime $p>3$ has a quadratic nonresidue of the form $2^n-1$ with $n$ a positive integer. Any ideas towards the proof? By the way, in 2014 I also conjectured that for each prime $p>3$ there is a Fibonacci number smaller than $p/2$ which is a quadratic nonresidue modulo $p$ (cf. $URL$ This should be quite challenging. Any comments are welcome! 

Those integers $\binom{2n}n\ (n=0,1,2,\ldots)$ are called central binomial coefficients. By Stirling's formula, $$\binom{2n}n\sim \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{n\pi}}\ \ \ \ (n\to+\infty).$$ Of course, the central binomial coefficients are much sparser than the squares of integers. Motivated by Lagrange's four-square theorem, here I ask the following question. QUESTION: Is every integer $n>1$ the sum of two squares and two central binomial coefficients? I conjecture that the answer is affirmative. I have verified this for $n$ up to $6\times10^9$; for example, $$2435=32^2+33^2+\binom{2\times4}4+\binom{2\times5}5.$$ For the number of ways to write a positive integer $n$ as $a^2+b^2+\binom{2c}c+\binom{2d}d$ with $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb N=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$, $a\leqslant b$ and $c\leqslant d$, one may consult $URL$ A set $A\subseteq \mathbb N$ is called an additive basis of order two if $\{a+b:\ a,b\in A\}=\mathbb N$. My above conjecture essentially says that $$\left\{k^2+\binom{2m}m-1:\ k,m=0,1,2,\ldots\right\}$$ is an additive basis of order two. I have some similar questions. I conjecture that each integer $n>1$ can be written as the sum of two squares and two Catalan numbers, and that $$\left\{a^2+b^2+\binom{2k+1}k+\binom{2m+1}m:\ a,b,k,m\in\mathbb N\right\}=\{2,3,\ldots\}.$$ See $URL$ and $URL$ for related data. My above question looks quite challenging. Any helpful ideas?
