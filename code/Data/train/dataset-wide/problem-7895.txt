Consider a field extension $F$ of $\mathbb{R}$ of finite degree $d>1$. We'll see that $d=2$, which forces $F\simeq \mathbb{C}$. Note that the map $\alpha(x)=x^2$ is an endomorphism of the multiplicative group $F^\times$. The differential of $\alpha$ at $x$ is the multiplication by $2x$ operator, which is invertible, so the image of $\alpha$ is open in $F^\times$. Since $F^\times$ is connected (it is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^d-\{0\}$ and $d>1$), and a connected topological group has no proper open subgroup (open subgroups are closed), we conclude that $\alpha$ is onto. Since $\mathbb{R}^\times=\alpha^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^\times_+)$ we get that $\alpha$ induces a continuous isomorphism $F^\times/\mathbb{R}^\times\simeq F^\times/\mathbb{R}^\times_+$. This yields a homeomorphism $\mathbb{P}^{d-1}(\mathbb{R}) \simeq S^{d-1}$. There are several ways to see that there is no such a homeomorphism unless $d=2$ (the most standard one is by using the simply-connectedness of the sphere, but using an ad-hoc argument would make the above proof available for younger students), thus I leave the end game to the reader. 

The answer below (is a detailed edit of a previous answer which) provides a (more-or-less) self contained proof of the fact that $\mathbf{G}(K)$ contains a cocompact solvable closed subgroup. Let $K$ be a local field and $\mathbf{G}$ a linear algebraic group defined over $K$. I denote $G=\mathbf{G}(K)$ and assume as I may that $G$ is Zariski dense in $\mathbf{G}$. Note that by [Borel's "Linear Algebraic Group, AG14.4] the Zariski closure of $G$ in $\mathbf{G}$ is itself a $K$-algebraic group whose $K$-points set is again $G$, thus replacing $\mathbf{G}$ with the Zariski closure of $G$ justifies this assumption. Below topological notions, unless otherwise said, are taken with respect to the Hausdorff (ie $K$-analytic) topology. Lemma 1: If $G$ is not solvable then $\mathbf{G}$ has an irreducible $K$-representation of dimension $>1$. Proof: Assuming every $K$-representation is 1-dimensional, fixing an injective $K$-representation $\mathbf{G}\to \text{GL}_n$ the image of $G$ is easily seen to be in a $K$-Borel subgroup of $\text{GL}_n$ (here we use the fact that $G$ is Zariski-dense in $\mathbf{G}$). Lemma 2: If $G$ is not solvable then there exists a $K$-algebraic variety $\mathbf{X}$ endowed with a $K$-action of $\mathbf{G}$ and a point $x\in X=\mathbf{X}(K)$ which is not $G$-fixed such that $Gx$ is compact. Proof: Using lemma 1, we fix an irreducible $K$-representation $\mathbf{G}\to \text{GL}_n$ with $n>1$ and consider the associated $K$-action of $\mathbf{G}$ on $\mathbf{X}=\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. Observe that $X=\mathbf{X}(K)$ is compact. By Zorn Lemma, using compactness, we can find a minimal closed, non-empty, $G$-invariant subset $Y\subset X$. We fix such $Y$ and a point $x\in Y$. By the fact that $n>1$ and the representation is $K$-irreducible we get that $x$ is not $G$-fixed. Note that $\overline{Gx}$ is a non-empty $G$-invariant closed subspace of $Y$, thus by minimality, $Y=\overline{Gx}$. We recall that the action of $G$ on $X$ has locally closed orbits (this is proved in the appendix of $URL$ It follows that $\partial(Gx)$ is a proper closed invariant subset of $Y$, hence by minimality $\partial(Gx)=\emptyset$. We conclude that $Y=Gx$ and indeed $Gx$ is compact. Corollary: If $G$ is not solvable then there exists a proper $K$-algebraic group $\mathbf{H}<\mathbf{G}$ such that $H=\mathbf{H}(K)$ is cocompact in $G$. Proof: Fix $\mathbf{X}$ and $x\in X$ as in Lemma 2 and let $H$ be the stabilizer of $x$ in $G$ and $\mathbf{H}$ be the Zariski-closure of $H$ in $\mathbf{G}$. By [Borel's "Linear Algebraic Group, AG14.4], $\mathbf{H}$ is a $K$-group and clearly $H=\mathbf{H}(K)$ (note however that $\mathbf{H}$ might not be the stabilizer of $x$ in $\mathbf{G}$). We get a continuous bijective $G$-map $G/H\to Gx$. By a standard argument in the theory of locally compact groups (using Baire category) this map is open, thus $H<G$ is cocompact. By the fact that $x$ is not $G$ fixed, $H<G$ is proper. Thus also $\mathbf{H}<\mathbf{G}$ is proper. Theorem: There exists a $K$-subgroup $\mathbf{S}<\mathbf{G}$ such that $S=\mathbf{S}(K)$ is solvable and cocompact in $G$. Proof: The collection $$ \{\mathbf{H}\mid \mathbf{H}<\mathbf{G} \text{ is a $K$-algebraic subgrop such that $\mathbf{G}(K)/\mathbf{H}(K)$ is compact} \} $$ is not empty, as it contains $\mathbf{G}$, hence it contains a minimal element by Noetherianity. Let $\mathbf{S}$ be such a minimal element. Denote $S=\mathbf{S}(K)$ and note that by minimality $S$ is Zariski dense in $\mathbf{S}$. If $S$ is not solvable, then by the corollary there exists $\mathbf{H}<\mathbf{S}$ such that $H=\mathbf{H}(K)$ is cocompact in $S$, hence also in $G$, contradicting the minimality of $\mathbf{S}$. Thus $S$ is indeed solvable. 

Remark: I was tacitly assuming above that everything is over an algebraically closed field, or split. One can easily adjust the definitions to handle the general case. 

Yes, this is true. The answer by Ben Webster gives the idea, but for completion let me give you a list of easy facts that combined together answer the question. 

Yes, many. Here is an example. Take two different locally compact groups with minimal Hausdorff topologies, say $G_1=\text{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ and $G_2=\text{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ for some prime $p$ (endowed with their usual topologies, which are minimal by Theorem 5.3 of $URL$ and take a group $\Gamma$ that injects densely into both, say $\Gamma=\text{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Q})$ (you could also take $\Gamma$ to be a free group here). Take $T_i$ on $\Gamma$ to be the pull back of the topology of $G_i$. Note that for each $i=1,2$, the group $G_i$ is the completion (wtr the two sided uniform structure) of $(\Gamma,T_i)$, by the fact that $\Gamma$ is dense and $G_i$ is complete (as it is locally compact). In particular, $T_1\neq T_2$. We are left to show that the topologies $T_1$ and $T_2$ are minimal. Assume that for some $i\in\{1,2\}$, $S\lneq T_i$ is a weaker topology. Let $H$ be the completion of $(\Gamma,S)$. The map $\Gamma\to H$ extends canonically to $G_i\to H$ and we get by minimality of $G_i$ that $H$ is trivial. Thus $S$ is trivial. As a reply to a comment below, note that the groups $G_i$ are necessarily simple: otherwise they would have a weaker (non-Hausdorff) topologies. 

I don't have a reference, but here is a short argument. Assume $G<H$ are compact groups (in our example take $H=\text{O}(n)$) and recall that unitary representations of compact groups are completely reducible. Recall also that by Peter-Weyl every irreducible unitary representation is finite dimensional. Assume first that $\rho$ is an irreducible finite dimensional continuous representation of $G$ and endow it with a $G$-invariant inner product. Fix $\pi$ to be any finite dimensional subrepresentation of the unitary induction $\text{Ind}_G^H(\rho)$, eg an irreducible subrepresentation. Then, by Frobenius reciprocity, $\text{Hom}_G(\rho,\text{Res}_G^H \pi)\simeq \text{Hom}_H(\text{Ind}_G^H(\rho),\pi)$ and the latter is non-empty by our choice of $\pi$. It follows that $\rho$ is a direct summand of $\text{Res}_G^H \pi$ by its irreducibility. The case of a general $\rho$, continuous finite dimensional representation, follows easily. 

The answer is yes in full generality. You don't need the separability assumption on $E_2$ and the integrability assumption on $XY$ (though clearly you do have to assume that $X\in L^1(\Omega,L(E_1,E_2))$). In comments to the question I was concerned about $E_2$ being a dual space, but that was based on my own confusion and it is irrlevant. Let me first note that if $\mathcal{F}$ is trivial then $Y$ is simply a vector in $E_1$ and your equation reads $$ (*)\quad E[X]Y=E[XY]$$ and is straight forward to prove. For the genral case, I prefer to think of $\mathcal{F}$ as a factor. That is, I consider a measurable map $\pi:\Omega \to \Omega'$ where $(\Omega',\mathcal{A}',P')$ is another probability space in which the points are separated, $\mathcal{F}=\pi^*\mathcal{A}$ and $P'=\pi_*P$. It is known that such a space exists (and it is unique in an apropriate sense) and for every $\mathcal{F}$-measurable map $Z:\Omega\to E$ there exists an $\mathcal{A}'$-measurable map $Z':\Omega'\to E_1$ such that $Z=Z'\circ\pi$. We say that $Z$ is the pull-back of $Z'$. Now we can disintegrate the measure $P$ over $P'$. That is, for a.e $\omega'\in\Omega'$ there exists a probability measure $P_{\omega'}$ on $\Omega_{\omega'}:=\pi^{-1}(\{\omega'\})$ (varying measurably wrt $\mathcal{A}$) such that $P=\int_{\Omega'} P_{\omega'}dP(\omega')$. For every Banach space $E$ and $\mathcal{A}$-measurable map $Z:\Omega\to E$, given $\omega'\in\Omega'$ we may consider the restriction $Z_{\omega'}:=Z|_{\Omega_{\omega'}}$ and its expectation wrt $P_{\omega'}$. This defines a function $Z':\Omega'\to E$. It is a basic fact that the conditional expectation $E(Z\mid \mathcal{F})$ is the pull back $Z'$. The equation $E[XY\mid \mathcal{F}]=E[X\mid\mathcal{F}]Y$ now becomes simply the equation $(*)$, when reduced to the fibers of $\pi$. Indeed, fixing $\omega'\in\Omega'$ and applying $(*)$ for $X_{\omega'}$ and $Y'(\omega')$ (instead of $X$ and $Y$) we get $E[X_{\omega'}]Y(\omega')=E[X_{\omega'}Y(\omega')]$ and pulling back we get the required equation. Let me conclude by the personal remark that I (a.s) prefer to think geometrically, replacing subalgebras by factors and conditional expectation by integration over fibers. In particular, I prefer "integral" over "expextation". Nevertheless, I am well aware of some advantages of the "probabilistic" mind set over the "geometric" one. 

Here is an observation of Yair Glasner that I previously missed. Let $k$ be the field of real algebraic numbers and consider $G=\text{PSL}_2(k)$. Let $P=B(\mathcal{k})$ be the standard Borel subgroup and $K=\text{PSO}_2(k)$. Then $K$ and $P$ are solvable, $K\cap P=\{e\}$ and $G=KP$, but $G$ is not amenable (as it contains free groups). All countable examples I am aware of are variants of this example. In particular, I am not aware of any finitely generated example. 

$\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is indeed cohopfian and evenmore, every non-trivial homomorphism $\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})\to \text{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is onto, and this could be seen in a fairly elementary fashion. My answer here should be seen as an extended comment to YCor's answer. For simplicity I will deal with the case $n=3$. The following theorem, which elementary proof will be sketched below, is a version of "super-rigidity". Theorem: Given a non trivial homomorphism $\phi:\text{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})\to \text{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ there exists a basis $v_1,v_2,v_3\in\mathbb{C}^3$ such that the image of $\phi$ could be identified with the group of orientation preserving automorphisms of $\mathbb{Z}v_1\oplus \mathbb{Z}v_2\oplus \mathbb{Z}v_3\in \mathbb{C}^3$. The proof of the lemma relies only on the following fact concerning elementary matrices in $\text{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$. Denote $$ U_1=\{E_{1,2}(t)\mid t\in\mathbb{Z}\},~ U_2=\{E_{1,3}(t)\mid t\in\mathbb{Z}\},~U_3=\{E_{2,3}(t)\mid t\in\mathbb{Z}\},~ $$ $$ U_4=\{E_{2,1}(t)\mid t\in\mathbb{Z}\},~U_5=\{E_{3,1}(t)\mid t\in\mathbb{Z}\},~U_6=\{E_{3,2}(t)\mid t\in\mathbb{Z}\}. $$ This 6 subgroups $U_i$ (with the standing convention $i\in\mathbb{Z}/(6)$) satisfy: 

I don't know a reference to the question as asked, but below I give a brief argument. Let $G$ be an algebraic group and $H$ a reductive subgroup. By Matsushima's theorem, $G/H$ is affine. Theorem 1.12 in Borel's "Linear algebraic groups" tells that there any $G$ affine action could be $G$-equivariantly closedly embedded in a rational $G$ representation. Applying to $G/H$ we obtain a $G$-representation $W$ and $w\in W$ having stabilizer $H$ and a closed orbit isomorphic to $G/H$. Given any $G$-representation $V$ and $v\in V$ with stabilizer $H$, the stabilizer of $(v,w)\in V\oplus W$ will be $H$. We are left to argue that the orbit will be closed. Since $Gw\subset W$ is closed, it is enough to show that $G(v,w)\subset V\times Gw \simeq V\times G/H$ is closed. For this you need that the $H$-orbit of $v$ is closed, which is clear. 

The dimension is $\phi(n)/|G|$. Denote the $\mathbb{Q}$-span of $\{\hat{G}(a)\mid a\in\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\}$ in $\mathbb{C}$ by $V$. Observe that $V<\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$, which is a Galois extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $\Gamma\simeq (\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^*$. Identifying $G$ with a subgroup of $\Gamma$, I claim that $V$ is the space of $G$-invariants, which leads to the above expression by Galois' theorem. Observe that $v\mapsto \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{x\in G} x(v)$ is a projection of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ on $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)^G$, hence also the image of the operator $P(v)=\sum_{x\in G} x(v)$ is $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)^G$. We therefore need to show that $P(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta))=V$. Since $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ is spanned by $\{\zeta^a\}$, it is enough to show that the span of $\{P(\zeta^a)\}$ is $V$. This indeed holds since, under our identification $x(\zeta)=\zeta^x$, we have $$ P(\zeta^a)=\sum_{x\in G}x(\zeta^{a}) =\sum_{x\in G}\zeta^{ax} =\sum_{x\in\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}}\mathbf{1}_G(x)\zeta^{ax} =\hat{G}(a). $$ 

Take $G=\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})\ltimes (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^2$ and take $B<G$ to be the $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & * \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \simeq \mathbb{Z}$. Then $K_B$ is one of the factors $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. 

If I understand correctly the question is a request for a formula expressing a specific non-constant bounded $\mu$-harmonic function on $\mathbb{F}_2$, where $\mu$ is a fixed generating probability measure. I assume below that $\mathbb{F}_2$ is freely generated by $\{a,b\}$. Let $A$ be the set consisting of all words starting with $a$ in $\mathbb{F}_2$. I claim that $$ h(x)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^n\mu^k(xA), \quad x\in \mathbb{F}_2 $$ is such a $\mu$-harmonic, where $\mu^k$ stands for the $k$-th convolution power of $\mu$ ($\mu^0=\delta_e$). In fact, it is not hard to see that the formula for $h$ above converges pointwise to a $[0,1]$-valued $\mu$-harmonic. With some work you can see that this function is non-constant. A slightly more sophisticated way to see this, which is in line with my comments above, is as follows. Consider the compact space $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_2=\mathbb{F}_2\cup \partial\mathbb{F}_2$. Then $\nu=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{k=0}^n\mu^n*\delta_e$ is a (in fact, the unique) stationary measure on $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_2$. It is supported on $\partial\mathbb{F}_2$, because $\mathbb{F}_2$ supports no stationary measure. It is fully supported there, by minimality. It is not hard to see that $(\partial \mathbb{F}_2,\nu)$ is a $\mu$-boundary in the sense of Furstenberg, thus the Poisson transform of any non constant $L^\infty$ function is non-constant. The expression for $h$ above is the Poisson transform for $\chi_\bar{A}$ wrt $\nu$ on $\bar{\mathbb{F}}_2$, which is the same as the Poisson transform for $\chi_{\partial A}$ wrt $\nu$ on $\partial \mathbb{F}_2$. The latter is non-constant by the fact that $\nu$ is fully supported. Of course, the choice of $A$ in the construction above was quite arbitrary. 

The answer is "yes", as YCor had already answered, but I wish to add another perspective. I think the easiest example to have in mind is the the action of a free group on its Gromov boundary (the set of infinite reduced words) endowed with the standard Markov measure. Moreover, every Gromov hyperbolic group $\Gamma$ has a closed image in $\text{Aut}(\partial\Gamma,\nu)$ where $\nu$ is any $\Gamma$-quasi-invariant measure on the Gromov boundary $\partial \Gamma$, eg a Patterson-Sullivan or a Furstenberg-Poisson measure. The fact that the image of $\Gamma$ is closed follows at once from the "convergence group action property". Let me also add another remark concerning Yves' answer: in fact, the groups $\text{PGL}_d(K)$ have the property that their image under any continuous homomorphism into any other (Hausdorff) topological group is closed, see Proposition 5.4 here (self promotion alert). 

For completeness, let me add the remark that in charactersitic 0 the same proof yields the fact that $\mathbf{G}(k)$ is compact when $\mathbf{G}$ is a $k$-anisotropic reductive group. The only thing to observe is that every $k$-subgroup of $\mathbf{G}$ is again reductive, what enables one to make an inductive argument as above. This follows from Jacobson-Morozov theorem: $\mathbf{G}$ has no unipotent $k$-subgroup. 

We consider infinite countable groups and ask about the this property: admitting uncountably many mutually non-isomorphis free ergodic probability measure preserving (pmp) actions that are all mutually orbit equivalent. You ask which groups satisfy this property. I do not know exactly. I think no one knows. But it is a big class of groups, maybe all groups which do not satisfy property (T). In Corollary 2.6 of A converse to Dye’s theorem Hjorth proves that property (T) groups do not satisfy this property. On the other hand, amenable groups do satisfy this property. Indeed, any amenable group has uncountably many mutually non-isomorphic pmp actions (say, by entropy theory), but these are all orbit equivalent, by the celebrated Ornstein-Weiss theorem. To see that there are many non-amenable groups satisfying this property, fix a pmp action of a non-amenable group $\Gamma_1$ on $X$ and uncountably many pmp actions of an amenable group $\Gamma_2$ on $Y_\alpha$. Then the non-amenable group $\Gamma=\Gamma_1\times \Gamma_2$ will satisfy this property, as witness by its actions on $X\times Y_\alpha$. If you want to study this property further, I suggest you to start with the following two things: try to show that if a group has a quotient that satisfies this property then the group satisfies this property, and try to show that this property is a measure equivalence invariant. 

I don't think you will ever get what you want. I will explain here the way I like to think of this invariant mean. I hope you will find it nice, but I doubt you will find it explicit. There are two natural classes of compactifications which we associate with a group $\Gamma$ that I would like to recall. A group compactification is just a group homomorphism from $\Gamma$ into a compact topological group. A semi-group compactification is a semi-group homomorphism from $\Gamma$ into a compact semi-topological semi-group (a semi-group endowed with a topology for which both left and right multiplication are (separately) continuous). Both types of compactifications could be seen as objects of corresponding categories in which morphisms are continuous homomorphisms between the target (semi-)groups making the obvious diagram commute. It is not hard to see that both categories have initial objects. The universal group compactification is called the Bohr compactification and the universal semi-group compactification is called the WAP compactification. Not surprisingly, when you pull back to $\Gamma$ the continuous functions on these compact objects you get correspondingly the algebras of Almost Periodic and Weakly Almost Periodic functions. Let me remark here that AP / WAP functions are the matrix coefficients of finite dimensional / reflexive Banach representations. I will not elaborate on that here, though it is crucial for a better understanding. Since every group is a semi-group there is a canonical homomorphism $\text{WAP}(\Gamma)\to \text{Bohr}(\Gamma)$. It turns out that there is a section to this map, a homomorphism $\text{Bohr}(\Gamma)\to \text{WAP}(\Gamma)$. Its image is called the Sushkevich kernel of $\text{WAP}(\Gamma)$. It is the unique minimal two sided ideal in $\text{WAP}(\Gamma)$ and it is usually denoted by $K(\Gamma)$. So $K(\Gamma)$ is an isomorphic copy of $\text{Bohr}(\Gamma)$ which happens to live inside $\text{WAP}(\Gamma)$. As I mentioned before, every WAP functions on $\Gamma$ extends canonically to a continuous function on the compact semi-group $\text{WAP}(\Gamma)$. You can now take this extended function and restrict it to the subgroup $K(\Gamma)$. The resulting function on $K(\Gamma)$ you can average wrt the Haar measure of $K(\Gamma)$. This process takes a WAP function on $\Gamma$ and gives back a scalar. This is the invariant mean you wanted to understand. Of course, since $\Gamma$ is dense in $\text{WAP}(\Gamma)$, the finitely supported probability measures on $\Gamma$ are w*-dense in $\text{Prob}(\text{WAP}(\Gamma))$, so in particular you could find a net of finitely supported functions in $\ell^1(\Gamma)$ that will converge to the Haar measure on $K(\Gamma)$. But I seriously doubt that you can find a sequence with this property. In general these objects are not metrizable.
