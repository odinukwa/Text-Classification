I followed YCor's suggestion and googled the relevant paper of Osin: "Small cancellations over relatively hyperbolic groups and embedding theorems" available on the arXiv. You want the following. 

They define "curve" in the first sentence of page 12. Also, note that they write $\alpha \in C_0(S)$, so they mean the isotopy class. It is standard practice to use the same notation for curves and their isotopy classes. Tracking the difference between $\alpha$ and $[\alpha]$ is often not necessary. I grant that this abuse of notation can cause confusion the first time you see it. 

Edit - As pointed out by Igor below, my "proof" of the first bullet point is incomplete. I'll leave the rest of the post here: perhaps some kind soul will fix the gap. Original - Let's restrict attention to the case where all embeddings are smooth and where $S$ has negative Euler characteristic, or is an annulus or MÃ¶bius band. 

Update 4: Does $B_n$ contain a copy of $\mathbb{Z}^2 \ast \mathbb{Z}$? Answer: Definitely. The Abelian factor is generated by a pair of (powers of) disjoint twists while the cyclic factor can be generated by a (power of a) Dehn twist with support curve "sufficiently distant" from the first two curves, in the curve complex. The proof is the bounded geodesic image theorem of Masur and Minsky. There is probably an easier way, as well, using a pA map for the cyclic factor. Edit: I've now spent considerable time thinking about this problem and I think that a very "light" proof is possible. It is enough to use subsurface projection, the fact that the curve complex has infinite diameter (due to Kobayashi and Feng Luo), and Behrstock's lemma on projection to overlapping surfaces. Now, Behrstock's proof used the hierarchy machine, but Mangahas has written up a very pretty (with pictures!) and elementary proof as Lemma 2.13 in her paper "A recipe for short-word pseudo-Anosovs". Now to sketch an answer. Fix $S$, a surface. Let $0 << m << M$ be correctly chosen constants. Suppose that $X, Y$ are disjoint annuli in $S$ and $Z$ is an annulus so that $d_S(X,Z) > M$. Let $x, y, z$ be the $M$-th powers of the Dehn twists about the corresponding core curves. Let $U_r$ be the set of curves $\alpha \in C(S)$ so that $d_Z(\alpha, z^r(X)) \leq m$. Similarly, let $V_{p,q}$ be the set of curves $\alpha \in C(S)$ so that $d_X(\alpha, x^p(Z))$ and $d_Y(\alpha, y^q(Z))$ are both bounded by $m$. Note that if $r \neq s$ then $U_r \cap U_s = \emptyset$ and the same holds for the sets $V_{p,q}$ and pairs of vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^2$. By Behrstock's lemma we find that if $r \neq 0$ then $U_r \subset V_{0,0}$. Similarly, if $(p,q) \neq (0,0)$ then $V_{p,q} \subset U_0$. We also have $z^r(U_0) \subset U_r$ and also $x^py^q(V_{0,0}) \subset V_{p,q}$. (This last because subsurface projection to $\Sigma \subset S$ commutes with $\rm{Mod}(\Sigma) \subset \rm{Mod}(S)$.) Let $w$ be any word in $x, y, z$ and their inverses which is a minimal product of syllables. Here, a word $u$ is a syllable if $u = z^r$ for $r \in \mathbb{Z} - 0$ or $u = x^p y^q$ for $(p, q) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 - (0,0)$. Let $\beta$ be a midpoint of the geodesic $[X, Z] \subset C(S)$. So $\beta \in U_0 \cap V_{0,0}$. We can now follow the orbit of $\beta$ and induct on the syllable length of $w$ to obtain the result. I hope that this is helpful and I apologize if I made this sound "easy" by my earlier comments. Also, I'll say again that this proof is very "light" and does not use anything difficult from Masur and Minsky. 

You can deduce the second bullet from, say, the bounds in Maskit's paper "Comparison of hyperbolic and extremal lengths" and then applying Kerckhoff's characterization (see Equation 2.1 of the paper of Masur and Minsky). 

Just to lend some context to the above question: the mapping class group of the two-torus is naturally isomorphic to GL(2, Z). If we restrict to orientation preserving homeomorphism the mapping class group is SL(2, Z). The periodic mapping classes (isotopy classes of homeomorphisms) are exactly those with trace less than two in absolute value. (Hmm, and +/- Id, I guess!) Now we need to count the number of conjugacy classes of periodic elements. There should be a cool algebraic way to do this. (Perhaps it would help to give a purely algebraic proof that the order of torsion is at most 6?) I think that there is a geometric way to do this: every periodic element occurs as the symmetry of some flat torus (= parallelogram with opposite sides identified). All tori have have the hyperelliptic symmetry, corresponding to rotation by 180 degrees about any point. (These maps lie in the mapping class of the negative identity.) Other symmetries: Rombic tori have a reflection symmetry as do rectangular tori. The square torus has a rotation by 90 degrees. The hexagonal torus has a rotation by 60 degrees. So I count: 1. the identity, Id 2. the hyperelliptic = -Id = rotation by 180 3. rotation by 90 4. rotation by 60 5. rotation by 120 6. the reflection [[-1,0],[0,1]] (reflection in an axis) and 7. the reflection [[0,1],[1,0]] (exchange axes). You can prove that the last two are distinct algebraically. Perhaps the lack of 45 degree rotation is a geometric proof. Now, we could perform similar geometric tricks to obtain symmetries of $N_4$ and get at least all of the rotations... [Edit: For example, it is possible to build a copy of $\rm{Sym}_4$ by placing the cross-caps at the vertices of a tetrahedron.] 

I think you want section 2.11 of reference [6] of the paper you are looking at, namely "A Polynomial Quantum Algorithm for Approximating the Jones Polynomial" at the arxiv. 

$\newcommand{\ZZ}{\mathbb{Z}}\newcommand{\RR}{\mathbb{R}}$Let $S = \Sigma_2$ be the genus two surface. In this case, $\ZZ^4$ is the deck group of the desired covering. Consider $\ZZ^4$ inside of $\RR^4$ and add to these points the usual edges labelled $a, b, c, d$ parallel to the four coordinate axes. This gives a Cayley graph for $\ZZ^4$. Next, starting at every vertex of the graph we attach a two-cell via the attaching map $abcdABCD$ (capital letters denote inverses). This is possible because the boundary word describes a closed loop in the graph. Let $S'$ be the resulting two-complex. Every edge of $S'$ meets a pair of two-cells while every vertex meets eight two-cells. The eight corners give the vertex a disk neighborhood in $S'$. Thus $S'$ is a surface. Taking the quotient by the action of $\ZZ^4$ gives the original surface $S$. By the Galois correspondence, $S'$ is the desired covering space. Note that $S'$ is quasi-isometric to $\ZZ^4$ so it is one-ended. The loops $abAABa$ and $cdCCDc$, based at the origin, meet in exactly one point. Thus $S'$ has genus, and so has infinite genus. This construction works in any genus. When $g = 1$ the construction produces the universal cover.
