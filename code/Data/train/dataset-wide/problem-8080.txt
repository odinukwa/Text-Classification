Axel, I have no idea what you are suggesting I suggested, but in fact the natural map of cochain complexes $$\omega\colon Hom(X,M)\otimes Hom(X',M') \to Hom (X\otimes X', M\otimes M')$$ for chain complexes $X$ and $X'$ and abelian groups $M$ and $M'$ is defined explicitly on page 134 of Concise. It is an isomorphism when $X$ and $X'$ are free and of finite type. When just their homologies are of finite type (and they are bounded below, like the chains of a space), they are chain homotopy equivalent to chain complexes $Y$ and $Y'$ that are free and of finite type, and it follows that $\omega$ then induces an isomorphism on (co)homology. Then we can apply the chain level K\"unneth theorem to deduce the result quoted from Spanier. That is all there is to its proof. While I didn't include this in my book either, I disagree with Allen about it being at all unnatural or unuseful. In applications, we constantly use that, with field coefficients and spaces of finite type, the cohomology of a product is the tensor product of the cohomologies. This is in fact an isomorphism of cohomology algebras over the field of coefficients. For obvious examples, consider the torus $T = (S^1)^n$ or products of real or complex projective spaces. The latter examples are especially important in the study of characteristic classes. 

An evident general construction is to take any multiplicative cohomology theory $E^*$ and a cohomology operation $\psi$ in that theory, say taking $E^q$ to $E^{q+n}$. For an $E$-oriented real $q$-bundle $\xi$ over $X$, $\theta^{-1}(\psi(\mu))$ gives the value of a characteristic class, where $\mu$ is the Thom class of $\xi$ and $\theta$ is the Thom isomorphism. For stable $\psi$, defined for all $q$, this will give a characteristic class on all $E^*$-oriented bundles of the sort wanted, modulo precision about condition (ii). [Senior moment nonsense eliminated]. You are studying the J-map $BO\to BF$ (or $BU \to BSF$), where $BF$ classifies stable spherical fibrations (oriented for $BSF$). A lot more is known than Adams knew. In particular, he didn't yet have the Adams conjecture. Rationally, $BF$ is a point. At an odd prime $p$, $BF$ factors as $BJ\times BCokerJ$, and at $2$ there is a non-split fiber sequence $BCokerJ \to BSF \to BJ$. The $J$-map at $p$ is best thought of as a map $BSpin\to BSF$ ($BO\simeq BSpin$ at $p>2$). By the Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro orientation, the $J$-map $BSpin\to BSF$ factors through the classifying space $B(SF;kO)$ for $kO$-oriented spherical fibrations and, at any $p$, $B(SF;kO)$ splits as $BSpin\times BCokerJ$ (but BSpin is seen in two pieces, one carrying the Wu classes, the other the rest of the Adams splitting). The intuition is that $BCokerJ$ and thus the unknown parts of the stable homotopy groups of spheres can be ignored, leaving the focus on the quite computable composite $BSpin \to BSF \to BJ$. This is too fast, and details are in Chapter V of $E_{\infty}$ ring spaces and $E_{\infty}$ ring spectra''. In ordinary mod $p$ cohomology, calculations are thoroughly understood but don't shed light on your question. They are also understood for $K$-theory, by work of Hodgkin and Snaith, and here the intuition that $Coker J$ can be ignored is made precise by Hodgkin's result that $\tilde K(BCokerJ)=0$. 

Here is a fact that should be much more widely known than it is. The category of posets is isomorphic (not just equivalent) to the category of Alexandrof spaces. A topological space is said to be Alexandrof if arbitrary (not just finite) intersections of open sets are open. For example, every finite topological space is an Alexandrov space. Finite spaces are fascinating and the connection with algebraic topology is very close: finite spaces have associated finite simplicial complexes. Don't just look categorically: that takes the fun out of it! There are notes on my web page and there is a book by Barmak. 

A very interesting example: consider semi-simplicial sets (alias $\Delta$-sets). These are simplicial sets without degeneracies, and there is an ``adjoin degeneracies'' functor from semi-simplicial sets to simplicial sets that is left adjoint to the evident forget degeneracies functor. One can compose this with geometric realization or one can define geometric realization of semi-simplicial sets directly. Define a weak equivalence of semi-simplicial sets to be a map whose geometric realization is a homotopy equivalence (weak equivalence is the same since these are CW complexes). Since it is a presheaf category, the category of semi-simplicial sets is bicomplete, and I've described the obvious weak equivalences, which satisfy the two-out-of-three property. Matthew Thibault convinced me that this truly natural category with weak equivalences does not admit a model structure for any choice of cofibrations or fibrations. EDIT: Dylan, if you believe the comments already posted, you know the proof. According to Tom, the acyclic fibrations have to be the isomorphisms. But then all maps are cofibrations, since they are the maps with the LLP wrt the acyclic fibrations. If you believe Karol that it cannot be the case that all monomorphisms are cofibrations, or just that $\ast$ cannot be cofibrant, you already have a contradiction to such a model structure. 

This is a very special case of a very general result. A quasi-isomorphism of DGAs identifies Massey products (not just triple products but matrix Massey products of all sizes). See for example Theorem 1.5 of ``Matric Massey products'', $URL$ But of course you must interpret your statement modulo indeterminacy. 

Conceptually, the following two theorems (both due to Whitehead) are Eckmann-Hilton duals. Theorem. A weak homotopy equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence. Theorem. A homology isomorphism between simple spaces is a weak homotopy equivalence. They don't look dual, but they are. See J.P. May. The dual Whitehead Theorems. London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Series Vol. 86(1983), 46--54. The point is that the second statement is really about cohomology, and the standard cellular proof of the first statement dualizes word-for-word to a ``cocellular'' proof of the second. Cocellular constructions are what appear in Postnikov towers, and they can be used more systematically than can be found in the literature. Yet another plug: they are central in the upcoming book "More Concise Algebraic Topology'' by Kate Ponto and myself. 

It seems to me that there should be some not too nebulous motivation for such a question. Rather than answer the question as stated, I'll give an open problem along the same lines. It starts with an old and much neglected paper: Daniel M. Kan Semisimplicial spectra Illinois J. Math. Volume 7 (1963), 463-478. That gives an analogue of based simplicial sets that allows for simplices of negative dimension and is designed to give an alternative definition of spectra. There are problems with the smash product and there are several later papers that flesh out the theory (Kan and Whitehead, Burghelea and coauthors). I would be curious to see how this definition fits into the modern world of spectra. There is a notion of Kan semisimplicial spectrum (opus cit) and it seems very natural to wonder if there is an interesting version of stable quasicategories sitting as a subcategory of the category of Kan semisimplicial spectra. 

All these young people talking about being old! I paid a secretary through the nose to type my thesis in 1964, doing much of it myself, and using carbon paper to get a copy. Lots of handwritten graphs of spectral sequences. The memory of that horrid process may be one reason I never published my thesis. It is roughly 150 pages of dense calculations. At Chicago in the 1960's and 1970's we had a technical typist who got to the point that he, knowing no mathematics, could and did catch mathematical mistakes just from the look of things. He also considered himself an artist, and it was a real battle to get things the way you and not he wanted them. My collaborators and I published five long Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics volumes between 1972 and 1986, and all are cluttered with hand written symbols, although the Selectric decreased the number in the last of them. The first of them (in which I introduced operads) is especially painful reading now. Somebody on this thread mentioned translations by non-mathematicians. I could never find it again, but I once read a paper about CW complexes that was translated from a Chinese original. It talked about the $n$th bag of bones. 

It goes back to Wu in the 1950's that if one can compute the mod 2 cohomology of a manifold, with its Steenrod operations, then one can explicitly compute its Stiefel-Whitney classes, via the Wu formula. See for example the Theorem on page 188 of ``A concise course on algebraic topology'' (no originality claimed, just the quickest reference for me to find). 

There is a strongly related result of Gaunce Lewis that I would like to advertise. We have different kinds of $G$-spectra for different ``universes'' $U$, which are countable sums of representations that include $\mathbf{R}$ and countably many copies of each representation they contain. Naive $G$-spectra are indexed on the trivial universe, genuine ones are indexed on the complete universe, which contains all irreducible representations. Gaunce proved that the $U$-suspension $G$-spectrum of an orbit $G/H_+$ (I've added a disjoint basepoint) is dualizable if and only if $G/H$ embeds as a sub $G$-space of a representation in the universe $U$. Neil's example is the simplest illustration of this general result. (Tyler, no problem with cofibrancy here: Neil is working in the Spanier-Whitehead category; Gaunce is working with Lewis-May $G$-spectra.) 

Justin, that is a cute question, and I've never thought about it. One starting thought free guess (acting on connected spaces) is that a non-$\Sigma$ $C_n$-space has $n$ possibly inequivalent but definitely related loop space structures. Do you see examples, or is this just curiosity? As to Ass and Com, I see no interest in building in the permutations to define Ass and then throwing them away. Of course, a non-$\Sigma$ `Com'-algebra is the same thing as an Ass-algebra, but the operadic modules over these kinds of algebras are different (bimodules and left modules). David, I think Justin is asking a concrete question, not the sort that model category structures shed light on. 

The mathematics becomes clearer if you add more structure. The category of graded vector spaces with morphisms of degree $0$ is fine. But it has a tensor product and also an internal hom that makes it into a closed symmetric monoidal category. To define the internal hom between graded vector spaces, $HOM(V,W)$, you must of course use morphisms that vary the grading, since it must be a graded vector space. The category of graded vector spaces is enriched over the ordinary category of ungraded vector spaces, and the underlying category of this enriched category is the category of graded vector spaces and morphisms of degree zero that you started with. 

This is a standard computation, if I understand the question correctly. You are interested in computing $Ext_A(k,k)$ as an algebra, starting with an exterior algebra $A$ on $n$ generators $x_1,\cdots, x_n$ over a field $k$ (no reason to restrict to $\mathbb C$); $A$ is graded with $k$ in degree $0$ and the $x_i$ in degree $1$. It is a Hopf algebra, with the $x_i$ primitive. Let $\Gamma$ denote the divided polynomial Hopf algebra on generators $y_i$, $1\leq i\leq n$; it is bigraded with the $y_i$ in homological degree $1$ and also internal degree $1$. We are mainly interested in the coproduct on $\Gamma$, and that is defined so that its vector space dual is the polynomial algebra on $n$ generators $y_i^*$. The basis elements dual to $(y_i^*)^r$ are denoted $\gamma_r(y_i)$. Write $\otimes = \otimes_k$ and form $K = \Gamma \otimes A$. It is a differential graded $A$-algebra with differential defined on the $\gamma_r(y_i)\otimes 1$ by $$ d(\gamma_r(y_i)\otimes 1) = \gamma_{r-1}(y_i)\otimes x_i. $$ With the natural augmentation to $k$, $K$ is a free $A$-resolution of $k$. Therefore $$ Hom_A(K,k)\cong Hom_k(\Gamma,k) \cong P[y_1^*,\cdots,y_n^*] $$ is a cochain complex suitable for computing $Ext_A(k,k)$, and its differential is zero. We are entitled to conclude that $$ Ext_A(k,k) = P[y_1^*,\cdots,y_n^*] $$ as an algebra (indeed as a Hopf algebra, with the $y_i^*$ primitive). Indeed, via the coproduct on $A$, $K\otimes K$ is a chain complex of $A$-modules, and it is clearly a free $A$-resolution of $k\cong k\otimes k$. The coproduct $K\longrightarrow K\otimes K$ is a map of chain complexes over the identification $k\longrightarrow k\otimes k$. We have $$Ext_A(k,k) \otimes Ext_A(k,k) \cong Ext_{A\otimes A}(k\otimes k,k) $$ The product on $A$ induces a product $$ Ext_{A\otimes A}(k\otimes k,k)\longrightarrow Ext_{A}(k,k).$$ The composite is the product in question, and it is computed using $$ Hom_A(K,k) \otimes Hom_A(K,k) \cong Hom_{A\otimes A}(K\otimes K,k) \longrightarrow Hom_A(K,k). $$ This is nothing but the multiplication on the polynomial algebra $P[y_1^*,\cdots,y_n^*]$. 

I'd like to correct one mistake in the answers to this question. $A_{\infty}$ spaces and algebras are ones that are associative up to all higher homotopies; $E_{\infty}$ spaces and algebras are ones that are associative and commutative up to all higher homotopies. Neither notion has anything to do with groups, a priori. When connected, an $A_{\infty}$ space is equivalent to a loop space (Stasheff) and an $E_{\infty}$ space is equivalent to an infinite loop space (Boardman and Vogt, May). In the non-connected case, both assertions remain true provided that the monoid of components is a group. The $A$ can be thought of as standing for "Associative'', the $\infty$ standing for "up to the infinitude of relevant higher homotopies''. The $E$, due to Boardman, stands for homotopy ``Everything'', the $\infty$ again standing for "up to the infinititude of relevant higher homotopies''. In both cases there are notions of $A_n$ spaces and $E_n$ spaces and many examples of $A_n$-spaces that are not $A_{n+1}$ spaces. This is more striking for $E_n$-spaces, since those are equivalent to n-fold loop spaces (with the same proviso on components in the non-connected case). It is correct that $A_{\infty}$ spaces preceded operads. A key motivation for operads is to encode the infinitude of homotopies in the $E_{\infty}$ case since, unlike the $A_{\infty}$ case, it seems impossible to specify all of the relevant homotopies explicitly. The DG world works in exactly the same way, and passage to chains transports the topological examples to algebraic ones.
