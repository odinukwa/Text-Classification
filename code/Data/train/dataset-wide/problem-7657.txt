Is there a theorem (or theorems) that can be thought of a real analogue of Weil conjectures? One can replace the finite field by real numbers and Frobenius by complex conjugation; counting points can perhaps be replaced by Euler characteristic or a more refined invariant of the set of real points. Of course, Lefschetz fixed point formula can be applied here, but is there something more specific one can say? 

The previous answer may be all you need, but, say, in question one one can also proceed by induction in q, to make the step of induction embed your complex into an acyclic complex of injective objects. 

There are various definitions of boundary of a hyperbolic group. Which of those generalize to semi-hyperbolic groups (in the sense of Alonso and Bridson)? The example I have in mind is a semisimple group over a nonArchemedian local field.The answer I'd like to get is something like a nonHausdorff space which is a union of partial flag manifolds $G/P$ (which can be described as the quotient of the complement to $G$ in the De Concini-Procesi compactification by the right action of $G$). 

It's a toric variety, for which intersection cohomology is computed algorithmically, see e.g. De Catldo's lectures. 

Let $X$ be a smooth closed subvariety in a complex projective space and $Z\subset X$ be a generic hyperplane section. Lefschetz hyperplane section Theorem says that the restriction map $H^i(X)\to H^i(Z)$ is an isomorphism for $i<dim(Z)$ and injective for $i=dim(Z)$. I am interested in examples when it's also an isomorphism $i=dim(Z)$. This is equivalent to saying that Fourier-Deligne transform of the intersection cohomology sheaf of the cone over $X$ has less than full support in the dual space (then this support has to be the cone over the projectively dual variety $X^*$). This is so when $X$ is an even dimensional quadric; are there other examples? 

Is every vector bundle on an algebraic torus $T=({\mathbb A}^1\setminus \{0\})^n$ over an algebraically closed field trivial? I am primarily interested in the case of a characteristic zero base field. 

Let $X$ be a complete smooth curve over $\mathbb C$ and $A=Jac[2]$ be the group of 2-torsion elements in the Jacobian of $X$. Is their a relation between: 1) The $A$-torsor of $\theta$-characteristics and its decomposition into odd and even parts. 2) The projective action of $A$ on sections of ${\mathcal O}_{Jac}(2\Theta)$, where $\Theta$ is the $\Theta$-divisor, lifting to a Heisenberg group action. 

========Update:======== Let me ask a enhanced version of question. Suppose the (1,0)+(0,1) decomposition induced by the almost contact structure satisfies the conditions (for some $Z^{1,0}$ and $Z'^{1,0}$ ) \begin{equation} \left[ {{X^{1,0}},{Y^{1,0}}} \right] = {Z^{1,0}} - d\kappa \left( {{X^{1,0}},{Y^{1,0}}} \right)R, \end{equation} \begin{equation} \left[ {{X^{1,0}},R} \right] = {Z'^{1,0}} - \left( {...} \right)R, \end{equation} 

Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold, with $R$ nowhere-vanishing vector field on $M$(whose orbit may be closed/ not closed). $E$ and $F$ are two vector bundle (Edit: which are sub-bundles of $\Omega^*(M, \mathfrak{g})$, namely forms valuded in Lie-algebra $\mathfrak{g}$) over $M$ with the same rank. Denote $\tilde \Gamma(E)$ and $\tilde \Gamma(F)$ the sections of $E$ and $F$ that are invariant under $R$, namely, for instance $\mathcal{L}_R \tilde \sigma_{E} = 0$. Let $D$ be some differential operator $D: \tilde \Gamma(E) \to \tilde \Gamma(F)$, which obviously commutes with $\mathcal{L}_R$. My target $\dim{\rm ker}D - \dim \ker D^*$. What is the corresponding framework to do this? What is the property of $D$ for this quantity to be well defined? Any reference will be appreciated!(I have basic knowledge about usual index-theorem for elliptic complex) Thanks. 

I have a very stupid and non-specific question, as follows. And let me know if I am asking in a wrong way. We known that, for instance, if one is interested in computing dimension of moduli space of 4d instanton, then one can study the deformation complex, and find it elliptic, and then usual index theorems applies. Now suppose I am interested in some $d$(odd)-dimensional instanton-like equation, and would like to know its moduli dimension. But it turns out that the deformation complex is far from elliptic, which looks like $0 \to {\Omega ^0} \otimes \mathfrak{g}\xrightarrow{{{d_A}}}{\Omega ^1} \otimes \mathfrak{g}\xrightarrow{{\pi ^\circ {d_A}}}H \otimes \mathfrak{g} \to 0$ where $H$ is a sub-bundle of $\Omega^2$ with unfortunate $rank\left( H \right) \ne d - 1$. At some special points on the moduli space, I can "choose a good gauge" and replace the above bad complex with an elliptic once, but in general I am faced with this bad one. So the question is: Does it mean that the dimension of moduli space cannot be described? Is there other ways (other index theorem) to compute the dimension? 

I am considering the following situation. Let $M_5$ be a 5-dimensional manifold which is an $S^1$ principal bundle over 4-manifold $M_4$. For instance, $M_5 = S^5$ and $M_4 = \mathbb{CP}^2$ with standard Hopf fibration.Now there is a principal G-bundle (or associated bundle $adP$) over $M_5$. My question is, how to characterize $P$ over $M_5$, and is there a canonical induced bundle over $M_4$? Let me explain my question a little bit. I know that, for even dimensional manifold $X$, characteristic numbers (integrating over $X$ the characteristic class built up by curvature) can efficiently characterize principal. But in odd dimensional cases, I'm not sure how to do similar thing. One thing I can imagine is to integrate characteristic classes over all even-dimensional cycles. Secondly, suppose there is a way to characterize $P\to M_5$. Then I would like to know if there is a natural principal induced bundle $P'$ over $M_4$, and how to use the data of $P\to M_5$ to describe the induced bundle $P' \to M_4$. If possible, we can take some simple cases. Say, the Hopf fibration. Principal $G$-bundles over $S^5$ are characterized by $\pi_4G$, and they are $0$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$, as I check a list of homotopy group for Lie groups. If I take trivial $G$-bundle over $S^5$, do I get a trivial bundle over $\mathbb{CP}^2$ (do I get new "twist" in the process of inducing bundle)? And what about other situation? Thanks. 

Is there an analogue of Kac-Weisfeiler conjecture (a theorem of Premet) on the power of p dividing dimension of an irreducible representation for Lie algebras of Cartan type? Benkart and Feldvoss mention this as an open problem (Problem 10) in their 2015 survey, but they don't seem to state a precise conjecture. 

The paper by Kazhdan and Lusztig "A topological approach to Springer representation" may provide an answer to the question at the end of the post on an explicit form of Springer representation. Also, I think this question is related to Lusztig's homomorphism from the Hecke algebra $H$ to the asymptotic Hecke algebra $J$. To simplify the statement, assume $G=SL(n)$ (as the author of the question does). Then the matrix of the Springer representation in the canonical basis in the top homology of Springer fiber can be read off that homomorphism (specialized at $q=1$): the algebra $J$ in this case is a sum of matrix algebras, taking the summand corresponding to the given nilpotent we get the answer. The homomorphism is rather explicit, so this answer is as explicit as the canonical basis is. 

Does Hochschild cohomology of a cocommutative Hopf algebra over a field of positive characteristic have a natural divided power structure? If not, perhaps a certain natural extra structure on the Hopf algebra would yield one? 

Let $G$ be a complex simple simply connected algebraic group and $Gr_G$ be the corresponding affine Grassmannian (it is well known that $Gr_G$ is homotopy equivalent to the base loop space $\Omega K$ of the maximal compact subgroup $K\subset G$). Let $H=H^*(Gr,k)=H^*(\Omega K,k)$ be the cohomology ring where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p>0$. The computation of $H$ by Yun and Zhu in their paper "Integral homology of loop groups..." shows that the commutative $k$-algebra $H$ has a divided power structure, at least when $p$ is not too small. Can this be seen from first principles? In particular, is it related to Cartan's divided power structure on homology of a commutative simplicial $k$-algebra? 

The group $SL(2,F)$ where $F$ is a local nonArchemidian field is hyperbolic. Various generalizations of the notion of hyperbolicity have been studied in the literature (I've seen terms like "hierarchically hyperbolic", "relatively hyperbolic" etc.). Which of those classes do groups of the form $G(F)$ where $G$ is semi-simple of higher rank fall into? 

A commutative analogue of the conjecture that the only projective D-affine varieties are homogeneous spaces is a generalization of Harthshorne conjecture. The latter (famously proved by Mori) characterizes projective spaces as the only smooth projective varieties with ample tangent bundles. It is expected that the only smooth projective varieties whose tangent bundle is big and nef are homogeneous spaces of reductive groups, this conjecture is apparently due to Demailly and Campana-Peternell. 

Let $M$ be a compact contact manifold with $R$ the Reeb vector field. Let $E$ be some vector bundle of gauge group $G$, say, $G = SU(2)$ and $E$ is the adjoint vector bundle. So my question is: If $\sigma$ is a global section, can I perform a gauge transformation (select a new trivialization) such that the transformed $\sigma$ satisfies $\mathcal{L}_R \sigma = 0$? To me the answer should be positive, since I can always adjust the basis so that the condition is satisfied, but I'm not sure. Edit: Here $\mathcal{L}_R \sigma = 0$ is understood as $\mathcal{L}_R\sigma_i = 0$ where $\sigma = \sigma_i e_i$ with $e_i$ a local basis in every trivializing patch. $\mathcal{L}_R \sigma = 0$ is not a geometric relation, but more like a gauge-fixing condition. 

My goal to write down an explicit (and simplest) contact metric structure on squashed $S_\omega^{2n + 1}$ defined as \begin{equation} S_\omega ^{2n + 1} = \left\{ {\left( {{z_i}} \right) \in \mathbb{C}^{n + 1}\;\;|\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n + 1} {\omega _i^2{{\left| {{z_i}} \right|}^2} = 1} } \right\} \end{equation} For the contact 1-form I would use the natural one restricted on $S^{2n+1}_\omega$ \begin{equation} \kappa \equiv \frac{i}{2}\sum\limits_{i = 1} {\left( {{z_i}d{{\bar z}_i} - {{\bar z}_i}d{z_i}} \right)} \end{equation} Take $n = 2$ as example, I use parametrization \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{gathered} {z_1} = \omega _1^{ - 1}\sin {\rho _1}\cos {\rho _2}{e^{i{\varphi _1}}} \\ {z_2} = \omega _2^{ - 1}\sin {\rho _1}\sin {\rho _2}{e^{i{\varphi _2}}} \\ {z_3} = \omega _3^{ - 1}\cos {\rho _1}{e^{i{\varphi _3}}} \\ \end{gathered} \right. \end{equation} and if I am calculating correctly, the Reeb vector field will be \begin{equation} R = \sum\limits_i {\omega _i^2{\partial _{{\varphi _i}}}} \end{equation} which generates rotation $\left( {{z_1},{z_2},{z_2}} \right) \to \left( {{e^{i\omega _1^2\theta }}{z_1},{e^{i\omega _2^2\theta }}{z_2},{e^{i\omega _3^2\theta }}{z_2}} \right)$ (Since that $\kappa \sim zd\bar z$ has $\omega_i^{-2}$ coefficients, so $R$ will need $\omega_i^{2}$ to kill these ugly coefficients and leave some $\sin$ and $\cos$ so that $\iota_R \kappa$ to add up to 1). 

In Blair's book and many many literatures, I see definition of a contact metric manifold which involves a relation \begin{equation} d\kappa \left( {X,Y} \right) = g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) \end{equation} as well as other standard relation like ${\Phi ^2} = - 1 + R \otimes \kappa $, $\Phi R = 0$, etc. On the other hand, in Tanno's papers and a few others literatures, the definitions involves \begin{equation} d\kappa \left( {X,Y} \right) = 2 g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) \end{equation} differing from Blair's by a factor of $2$. So I try to figure out which is "more correct", and then comes one important equation that really confuses me, in Blair's book (Lemma 6.2): \begin{equation} {\nabla _X}R = - \Phi X - \Phi hX, \;\;\;\;h \propto \mathcal{L}_R \Phi\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(*) \end{equation} Now, let us consider the contact metric structure to be K-contact, and therefore $h = 0$, ${\mathcal{L}_R}g = 0$, and also equation $(*)$ should still hold, hence (in components) \begin{equation} {\nabla _X}R = - \Phi X \Leftrightarrow {\nabla _m}{R^n} = - {\Phi ^n}_m \Rightarrow {\nabla _m}{R_n} = - {g_{nk}}{\Phi ^k}_m\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(**) \end{equation} On the other hand, since $\nabla$ is Levi-civita, we have \begin{equation} {d\kappa } \left( {X,Y} \right) = \left( {{\nabla _m}{R_n} - {\nabla _n}{R_m}} \right){X^m}{Y^n} = g\left( {X,\Phi Y} \right) = {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n{X^m}{Y^n} \end{equation} and therefore ${\nabla _m}{R_n} - {\nabla _n}{R_m} = {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n$. Now comes the final point: using the Killing vector equation ${\nabla _m}{R_n} = - {\nabla _n}{R_m}$, one obtains \begin{equation} - 2{\nabla _m}{R_n} = 2{\nabla _n}{R_m} = - {g_{mk}}{\Phi ^k}_n \end{equation} which directly contradict the equation $(**)$ So my question is
