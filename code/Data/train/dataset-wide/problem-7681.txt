Given an arbitrary countable group $H$ containing an element of large enough order but no involutions, there exists a two-generator simple group $G$ such that $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$ and $G=\bigcup \limits _{g\in G} gHg^{-1}$. This is Theorem 17 of S.V. Ivanov and A.Y. Ol'shanskii, Some applications of graded diagrams in combinatorial group theory, Groups—St. Andrews 1989, Vol. 2, London Math. Soc. Lecture Note Ser., vol. 160, Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge, 1991, pp. 258–308. 

There is another description of $H_2(G)$ due to Miller: Miller, Clair The second homology group of a group; relations among commutators. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 3, (1952). 588--595. In modern terminology, let $x,y\in G$ and denote ${}^xy=xyx^{-1}$. Let $G\wedge G$ be the group generated by the symbols $x\wedge y$, $x,y\in G$, subject to the following relations: $$ xy\wedge z = ({}^xy\wedge {}^xz)(x\wedge z),\quad x \wedge yz = (x\wedge y)({}^yx\wedge {}^yz),\quad x\wedge x = 1, $$ for all $x,y,z\in G$. The group $G\wedge G$ is also known as the nonabelian exterior square of $G$. There is a commutator homomorphism $\kappa :G\wedge G\to [G,G]$ given by $x\wedge y\mapsto [x,y]$. Miller essentially proved that $\ker \kappa$ is naturally isomorphic to $H_2(G)$. This is closely related to the answers of Henry Wilton and Richard Kent. Namely, $G\wedge G$ is isomorphic to the derived subgroup of a covering group $\hat{G}$ of $G$, and it is not difficult to find an isomorphism between $\ker\kappa$ and $(R\cap [F,F])/[F,R]$. 

S is null homotopic in M via Poincare duality and the exact sequence of the pair. S bounds an embedded 3-ball in M if and only if N can be decomposed into $S^1 \times S^3$, connected sum with a simply connected manifold. 

I think that the conjecture is wrong. The following leads to counterexamples in the topological category and probably also smoothly: Take a closed oriented 4-manifold N with infinite cyclic fundamental group and remove an open neighborhood of a generating circle. Then you get a 4-manifold M with boundary $S^1 \times S^2$ where only the generators can be represented by embedded 2-spheres. If S denotes $pt \times S^2$ then the following hold: 

The 2-type of a 4-manifold is an extremely interesting invariant. In fact, work of Hambleton and Kreck shows that in many cases it determines the homotopy type (if one adds the intersection form as an obvious additional invariant). As a consequence, such 2-types have a very rich structure. It's quite tricky to figure out which 2-types appear in this way, just like it is tricky to figure out which groups arise as fundamental groups of 3-manifolds. This is a very interesting open problem, even if one puts aside the (difficult) 4-manifold questions and just works with 4-dimensional Poincare complexes. 

Lie algebras over rings (Lie rings) are important in group theory. For instance, to every group $G$ one can associate a Lie ring $$L(G)=\bigoplus _{i=1}^\infty \gamma _i(G)/\gamma _{i+1}(G),$$ where $\gamma _i(G)$ is the $i$-th term of the lower central series of $G$. The addition is defined by the additive structure of $\gamma _i{G}/\gamma _{i+1}(G)$, and the Lie product is defined on homogeneous elements by $[x\gamma _{i+1}(G),y\gamma _{j+1}(G)]=[x,y]\gamma _{i+j+1}(G)$, and then extended to L(G) by linearity. There are several other ways of constructing Lie rings associated to groups, and there are numerous applications of these. One of the most notorious ones is the solution of the Restricted Burnside Problem by Zelmanov, see the book M. R. Vaughan-Lee, "The Restricted Burnside Problem". There's other books related to these rings, for example, Kostrikin, "Around Burnside", Huppert, Blackburn, "Finite groups II", Dixon, du Sautoy, Mann, Segal, "Analytic pro-$p$ groups". 

There is a whole theory of functional equations (or functional identities) in algebras. It was used for instance to obtain solutions to some of Herstein's problems on Lie homomorphisms. An overview of the theory is given in the book Bresar, Chebotar, Martindale, Functional identities The area has its own entry in the 2010 MSC (16R60). 

Every group of exponent 3 is nilpotent of class at most 3, and this bound is best possible. The question whether finitely generated groups of exponent $n$ are finite is also known as the Burnside problem. There is an excellent historical overview of this problem, along with a list of relevant references. 

I can provide some pieces of knowledge for Street and Johnson, and, to a lesser extent, for Steiner. Since my reputation on mathoverflow is not important enough, I am not able to include too many links and I can only cite figures in a master thesis I made for an internship on this subject : Parity complexes and pasting schemes We can simplify the analysis of the structures given by Street and Johnson (and Steiner) by decomposing the problem with three questions : 

Globularity Street (and Steiner) uses cells structure to represent the morphisms. It is a stratified structure with $n+1$ levels for a cell of dimension $n$, that represent sources and targets in each dimension with "bags" of generators of dimension $i$ for level $i$. For each level $i$ for $0 \le i \le n$ there is a source bag and a target bag. The top level $n+1$ has only one bag. See figures 12 and 13. Source and target operations then amount to remove some parts of the cells. Concerning Johnson, morphisms are represented using closed set of generators (closed in the sense "source and target" closed) called well-formed pasting schemes (wfps). They lack the organization of cells but they represent much better what one imagines when thinking about pasting diagrams. On the other hand, source and target operations are less trivial : in order to get the source $s(A)$ of a wfps $A$, one removes the "inner-ends" of the top level generators, which is written $A - E(A)$. But this definition of source and target operations does not work for all categories. In particular, one must rule out some categories. For example (figure 20), the pasting scheme $A$ must be forbidden in Johnson because the source and target operations will not work properly on the pasting scheme since the node $1$ is at the same time a "inner-end" ($1 \in E(A)$) and a member of the source of $R(A)$. So $R(A) - E(R(A))$ would not be closed. In order to remove this problem, Johnson uses a strong axiom of acyclicity called the "no-direct-loops" condition, which prevents "inner-begins" to intersect with "inner-ends". Loop-freeness In order to get set-like structure which represents $\omega$-categories, one needs to rule out cycles in the composition of morphisms. One also needs to remove some more specific problems (see figure 15). All these problems can be ruled out using an acyclicity condition on $\triangleleft$, where $\triangleleft$ is the transitive closure of $\prec$, where $\prec$ represents some kind of contact between two generators. In Street, a weak notion of contact is used, where $A \prec B$ when $A^+ \cap B^- \neq \emptyset$, that is to say when there is a contact between the ends of $A$ and the begins of $B$ at dimensions $n$ if $A$ and $B$ are of dimension $n+1$. Johnson uses the same notion of contact for $\prec$ but asks for more than just the acyclicity condition on $\triangleleft$ (as mentionned in the Globularity section) : when $A \triangleleft B$, there must be no contacts between the inner-begins of $A$ and the inner-ends of $B$. It is loop-free axiom (i). In Steiner, the acyclicity of $\triangleleft$ is a consequence of the definition of a loop-freeness basis. It is actually stronger than the acyclicity because this axiom also contains the "segment condition". Freeness / Segment condition In order to get a free-structures, we need to ensure that all cells / wfps can be written as a composition of generators. This can be false with only the acyclicity condition. That is why a "segment condition" is added. This segment condition says the following thing : let $x$ a generator of dimension $m$ and $S$ a $n$-morphism (or cell / pasting scheme) such that the $n$-source of $x$ can be pasted on $S$, then the contact zone must be a segment for $\triangleleft_S$ In Street, there is two occurences of this segment condition : as Proposition 1.3, which is a consequence of axiom 3 (b), and in the corrigenda as the new axiom asking tightness on the sets $\mu(x)$ (see correction of page 330) and its use through the new Proposition 1.4 (which states precisely a segment condition). In Johnson, the segment condition appears as axiom (iv). In Steiner, the segment condition is hidden in the loop-free basis axiom. So, why do we need this segment condition ? Firstly, it is important to note that a formal composition of the generators of an $n$-surface $S$ should respect the order $\triangleleft_S$ to compose the generators : if $x \prec_S y$, then $x$ needs to be "activated" before $y$, because something in the source of $y$ is produced by $x$. Secondly, in an free $\omega$-category without loops, if a generator $x$ of dimension $m$ can be inserted in a context $E[\_]$ of dimension $n<m$ such that $E[x]$ exists, then there exists a formal decomposition of $\partial^-_n E[x]$ in which the $n$-generators of $\partial^-_n x$ appear as a segment in the decomposition (see figure 17). So, with these two facts, if we want the pasting of an $m$-generator on a $n$-surface to be compatible with an $\omega$-categorical structure, we need to require that generators can only be pasted on segments of $n$-surface. If this hand-waving explanation is not convincing, let see what could go wrong. An example for Street can be found in the figure 18 : a 3-cell $\Gamma$ of source $X_1 \star X_4$ and of target $X_1' \star X_4'$ can be pasted on a 2-surface with generators $X_1 \prec X_2 \prec X_3 \prec X_4$. One can easily see that if we paste $\Gamma$ on the surface, we obtain a cell which is not decomposable, which is a problem, because the generators are not generating. Note that this example does not work for Johnson, because the "no-direct-loops" condition is not satisfied for $X_2$ and $X_3$. But Power found in his paper a (complicated) example showing that the segment axiom was also necessary for Johnson. In a nutshell : 

To answer Chris' (and maybe Ian's) question: The map that Charles describes is nontrivial for q=3 in the cases $G=Z^3, M=Z$ and $G=(Z/2)^3, M=Z/2$, the latter answering the original question (if Charles is right). The proof is easy since the cohomology rings are polynomial, respectively exterior, algebras. 

Ryan, I think this is an open problem. The best related result I know is a theorem of Casson and Gordon [A loop theorem for duality spaces and fibred ribbon knots. Invent. Math. 74 (1983)] saying that for a fibred knot that bounds a homotopically ribbon disk in the 4-ball, the slice complement is also fibred. More precisely, they are assuming that the knot K bounds a disk R in the 4-ball such that the inclusion $S^3 \smallsetminus K \hookrightarrow D^4 \smallsetminus R$ induces an epimorphism on fundamental groups. If one glues R to a fibre of the fibration $S^3 \smallsetminus K \to S^1$ to obtain a closed surface F, then the statement is that the monodromy extends from F to a solid handlebody which is a fibre of a fibration $D^4 \smallsetminus R \to S^1$ extending the given one on the boundary. 

The natural starting point of this story are E-orientations on, say closed, manifolds M. That's just a fundamental class $[M^n] \in E_n(M)$ such that cap product induces a (Poincare duality) isomorphism. Given E, the question becomes which M are E-orientable. In many cases it happens that this follows if the stable normal bundle of M admits a lift through a fibration $X\to BO$. For example, if E=HZ is ordinary Z-cohomology then X=BSO works, if E=KO then X=BSpin works, if E=KU then X=BU or X=BSpin$^c$ works etc. To formalize the idea that every X-manifold has an E-orientation, form the bordism groups $\Omega^X_n$ of X-manifolds and observe that the fundamental classes lead to natural maps $\Omega^X_n(Y) \to E_n(Y)$ for any space Y. In other words, there are natural transformations of cohomology theories $\Omega^X \to E$, or even better, maps of spectra $MX \to E$, where $MX$ is the Thom spectrum associated to the fibration $X\to BO$. In the case X=BU this is called a complex orientation of E and has been studied extensively because it simplifies computations of E-cohomology tremendously. The original and still relevant reference is Adams' little blue book. 

In order to compare Street and Johnson on this particular point, I think that the segment property of Street is stronger than the one of Johnson, since loop-free (iv) asks a segment condition for generators that can be pasted on valid wfps, whereas for Street, the segment condition is true for generators pasted not only on cells, but on any well-formed set of generators. The advantage of Street is that the segment condition is more easily computable than the one of Johnson. Street is not necessarily Johnson Go back to figure 18 and consider all the generators except $\Gamma$. Then it is a sound parity complex, but it is not a pasting scheme because of $X_2$, $X_3$ and the "no-direct-loop" condition. Johnson is not necessarily Street See the pasting scheme on figure 19 which is ruled out as parity complex. Generalization Even though comparing the structures is important, I guess you would also be interested in the fact that Street and Johnson (and surely Steiner) are special cases of a "generalized parity complex". Starting from Street paper, one can easily simplify and generalize the work he has done. Here are the axioms of the structure : 

(Globularity) How a globular structure suited for representing $\omega$-categories is built in these structures ? (Loop-freeness) Since these structures are set-like (no multiple elements), how do these structures rule out categories with loops ? (Since we want these structures to represent polygraphs and that polygraphs are a notion of free-categories, either they must allow multiple elements, or they must rule out loops) (Freeness / Segment condition) How do these structures achieve freeness in the polygraph sense ? In particular, how do the rules of these structures prevent blocked-morphism (non-trivial morphism that can not be decomposed) ? It seems that the solution to these problems rely heavily on what I call the segment condition. 

Hambleton and I found topological 4-manifolds N for which the intersection form is not extended from the integers, in particular 2 doesn't hold. With Friedl and Melvin we showed later that our examples don't have a smooth structure. But now I remember a discussion with Fintushel and Stern who mentioned that they constructed a smooth counterexample to 2 (and hence to the conjecture). 

This can be answered by obstruction theory for the fibration $$ F=SO(4)/U(2) \to BU(2) \to BSO(4) $$ where the fibre is actually a 2-sphere: $F=S^2$. Start with the tangent bundle of an oriented 4-manifold $M$ and ask for existence respectively uniqueness of a lift of its Gauss-map $M\to BSO(4)$, that is, existence respectively uniqueness for an almost complex structure on $M$. The obstructions for existence lie in $H^{i+1}(M;\pi_i(F))$ and the obstructions for uniqueness lie in $H^{i}(M;\pi_i(F))$. Assume for simplicity that $M$ is simply connected and closed and let $X$ be its 2- (and hence) 3-skeleton. The same obstruction theory tells you that the tangent bundle of $X$ has a complex structure and that it's uniquely determined by the first Chern-class. If such a structure extends to $M$, there is a single uniqueness obstruction in $$ H^{4}(M,X;\pi_4(F)) = \pi_4(S^2) = Z/2$$ By naturality, this obstruction is realized by a second almost complex structure on $M$ (with the same first Chern-class) if and only if the quotient map $M \to M/X=S^4$ induces a nontrivial map on cohomotopy: $$ \pi_4(S^2) = [S^4,S^2] \to [M,S^2] $$ It is well known that this map is nontrivial if and only if $M$ is spin, see for example the cohomotopy preprint with Kirby and Melvin on my homepage. This explains the footnote in McDuff-Salamon (where they probably assume that $M$ is simply connected, otherwise there is another uniqueness obstruction in $H^3(M)$ that you found for $M = S^1 \times S^3$). It also answers your question for simply connected almost complex manifolds $M$ as follows: The first Chern-class characterizes almost complex structures on $M$ if and only if $M$ is not spin. Good examples are those Hirzebruch surfaces which are nontrivial $S^2$-bundles over $S^2$.
