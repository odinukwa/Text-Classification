They are not that rare; there are 4 to 6 solar and lunar eclipses each year with an equal number of each (on average). 

The orbit of a moon around the sun depends on the time to orbit the planet and the planet's time to orbit the sun. In the case where the moon takes a long time to orbit the planet (like the Earth-Moon), the orbit just wiggles along the circle. In the case where the moon has a short orbital period compared to the planets year (like Jupiter-Io), the path is like you drew in the first figure. 

The moon orbits the Earth in roughly 29 days. So in 14 days, it would be on the other side of the Earth. 

It's not that the neutrino detectors don't have a chance of detecting a neutrino, but that the neutrinos do not interact with matter (well hardly ever). If there are $6.5\times 10^{10}$ neutrinos per second per $cm^2$ and if the detector has an area of $10^{6} cm^2$, and it detects 1 neutrino per year, then 1 out of $2.05\times 10^{24}$ neutrinos interacts with the detector. $2.05\times 10^{24}$ pass through the detector unnoticed. 

For a star to become a nova, it needs to have a mass at least 8 times greater than our sun. For a supernova, it needs to be larger. The first stage is the hydrogen fusion into heavier elements. The energy created pushes the hydrogen outwards. If there was no fusion, the star would be a low smaller. When the hydrogen fusion in the core slows down (due to a lack of hydrogen), the star shrinks and helium fusion takes over as the main process. At this time, it is believed that the core of the star is about 25% hydrogen and 75% helium. The outer layer of hydrogen doesn't change. Eventually, the star makes iron as a fusion product. The fusion to make an element heavier than iron consumes more energy than what it produces, so when the "iron fusion" (creation of iron) process slows down significantly, the star collapses. This collapse causes a massive pressure and temperature increase in the core, which triggers the fusion of heavier elements; although it is a net loss of energy. This burst of energy blows the star apart. The difference between a nova and a supernova is the amount of fusion that happens before the core is blasted apart. Since fusion only takes place in the core, and the core is less 1/100 the volume of the star, when the star goes nova (or supernova), the outer layer of the star is blown outwards. 

There is no evidence for that. That's either a systematic observation error, or a random result within usual statistical fluctuations, compare this Q&A site. 

The logical consequence is, that an event horizon cannot form, since the first particle slows down asymptotically to zero, just before the event horizon forms (Fermat's infinite descent). The emergence of the event horizon therefore takes infinite time seen from outside. But due to Hawking radiation a black hole exists only a finite time. Hence an event horizon doesn't form. The frustrating thing about this is, that you need to be at least Stephen Hawking, to not be called a geek. The current mainstream way to circumvent this paradoxon is to switch to a purely general relativistic geometry of infalling space-time, which doesn't experience the event horizon. That way you avoid the event horizon as a pole, but you get the singularity at the center of the black hole, governed by yet to investigate physical laws of quantum gravity. 

It's called a black hole merger, or coalescence. Here a simulation video. Even the formation of the event horizons of the two initial black holes takes "super long" in Earth's time. That's similar with the merger. On the other hand we are very close to the completed merger within a short "Earth's" time seen from a distance, as soon as the merger starts. General relativity as well as quantum theory are incomplete with what will happen very close to a presumed singularity or at the presumed event horizon; this will remain disputed until a satisfying theory of quantum gravity is found. Mergers of black holes are likely to occur, e.g. when two galaxies collide, the momentum of the central supermassive black holes (SMBH) is slowed down by consumption of gas, dust and stars, until the SMBHs merge to the central SMBH of the merged galaxy. Here a galaxy merger simulation. Here a simulation of the coalescence of two black holes within a collapsing star. More on black hole binaries on Wikipedia. 

Is the Milky Way a collection of merged galaxies, or has it only been one galaxy that was created from the interstellar media? 

The only light you would see, would be from the stars outside the black hole. Any light that is generated inside the event horizon would be refracted towards the singularity. You wouldn't see the object in front of you since the light would not reach your eye. 

I've read that a gas giant, like Jupiter, doesn't have a rocky surface. But planets must start as a rocky conglomerate of flotsam. 

On the Near Earth Object Program web page from NASA, it lists about 80 objects that passes near the Earth over the next 4 months. Many of them pass within 0.01 AU, the closest one will pass on Oct 24 and be only 0.0038 AU (or 1.5 times the Earth Moon distance) away. From Wikipedia: 

I agree that the crater needs to be lined, but you also have the problem of maintaining a satellite in stationary orbit above the crater. Nearly impossible unless the crater is on the equatorial plane. Also, a stationary satellite around the moon would be influenced by the Earth, so you would need to burn fuel to keep the satellite in position. 

Our sun will eventually become a white dwarf. A star 10 times it mass will become a neutron star. A star 100 times the mass of the sun will become a black hole. So if 100 stars came together into one mass, it would collapse into a black hole. It is currently believed that a super massive black hole (at least 1000 times the mass of our sun) is at the center of our galaxy and also in the Andromeda galaxy. This is where all the iron might be found from this region of space. 

The impact of Phobos, even in one piece (less likely), would be different from Chicxulub. Phobos is probably a little larger than the Chicxulub impactor, but much slower, and comes in almost perfectly tangential. The impact energy would be less than a 10th of the Chicxulub impact, and the energy would be distributed over a large region around the Martian equator. It wouldn't start volcanism, and it wouldn't warm Mars in a relevant way. It wouldn't make Mars more friendly to life by warming. The only noteworthy contribution to habitability would be additional organic matter which Phobos is presumed to contain. Phobos will (probably) desintegrate due to tidal forces, before its fragments will collide with Mars. Any loose rocks, dust, regolith on the surface will separate from Phobos below the Roche limit of $$d=1.26~R_M\cdot\left(\frac{\rho_M}{\rho_m}\right)^\frac{1}{3},$$ with $R_M=3389.5\mbox{ km}$ the radius of Mars, $\rho_M=3.9335 \mbox{ g/cm}^3$ the mean density of Mars, and $\rho_m=1.887\mbox{ g/cm}^3$ the mean density of Phobos. This results in a Roche limit of $$d=1.26\cdot 3389.5\mbox{ km}\cdot\left(\frac{3.9335 \mbox{ g/cm}^3}{1.887\mbox{ g/cm}^3}\right)^\frac{1}{3}=5455.6\mbox{ km}.$$ That's for Phobos' center about 2059 km above the equatorial surface of Mars (taking 3396.2 km as equatorial radius.) Therefore desintegration will start long before the impact. Loose rocks will collide with Phobos and unlock more material. Whether there will be a considerable solid remnant to finally cause a big (tangential) impact is difficult to predict. The orbital speed of the fragments at the time of collision will be about $$v_0=\frac{v_e}{\sqrt 2},$$ with $v_e=5.03\mbox{ km/s}$ the escape velocity of Mars. Phobos' inclination of 1.093° (relative to Mars's equator) is almost neglectable for the calculation of the impact velocity. Mars' equatorial rotation velocity is about 241.17 m/s. The impact velocity will hence be about $$\frac{5030\mbox{ m/s}}{\sqrt 2}-241.17 \mbox{ m/s}=3316\mbox{ m/s}.$$ Phobos' mass is about $1.0659\cdot 10^{16}\mbox{ kg}.$ This results in a kinetic impact energy of $$\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{1}{2}\cdot 1.0659\cdot 10^{16}\mbox{ kg}\cdot (3316\mbox{ m/s})^2=5.86\cdot 10^{22}\mbox{ J}.$$ The heat of fusion of water is about 334 kJ/kg, the heat of vaporization of water at 0°C is about 2504 kJ/kg, together 2838 kJ/kg are needed to evaporate water ice of 0°C. Hence the impact energy of Phobos would be sufficient to evaporate $$\frac{5.86\cdot 10^{22}\mbox{ J}}{2.838 \cdot 10^{6}\mbox{ J/kg}}=2.06\cdot 10^{16}\mbox{ kg}$$ of water ice of 0°C, corresponding to $2.06\cdot 10^{13}\mbox{ m}^3$ of liquid water. Mars' surface area is about 144,798,500 km², or $1.447985\cdot 10^{14}\mbox{ m}^2$. Equally distributed, we could get a layer of water ice corresponding to $$\frac{2.06\cdot 10^{13}\mbox{ m}^3}{1.447985\cdot 10^{14}\mbox{ m}^2}=0.142\mbox{ m},$$ (correspoding to 14.2 kg/m² of liquid water) evaporated by the impact energy. With a surface gravity of 3.711 m/s², this would correspond to a pressure of $14.2 \mbox{ kg/m}^2\cdot 3.711 \mbox{ m/s}^2= 52.8 \mbox{ N/m}^2=0.528\mbox{ hPa}$. The current atmospheric pressure on Mars is about 6.3 hPa, with diurnal, seasonal and regional changes. Thus we could get a maximum of 10% short-term pressure increase in the Martian atmosphere by water vapor, in an ideal case. At the end, an impact of Phobos, or its fragments, would result in a regional reworking of the Martian surface in the equatorial region, but not in a long-term global change. Just melting water ice would lead to a global ocean with a depth of about 1.2 m. But this ocean would boil due to the low atmospheric pressure, and freeze out again. Same with local lakes due to the uneven topography. Model calculatios with a release of carbon dioxide would cause some temporary greenhouse effect, but in the equatorial region a release of carbon dioxide is even more unlikely than a release of water vapor. 

A supernova would vapourise all the planets in the stars planetary system. There is a rule of thumb when estimating the effects of supernovae: however powerful you think they are, they are more powerful. A supernova releases about $10^{44}$ joules in a matter of a few seconds Now, a planet is a pretty small target, only about 1 billionth of the sun's heat hits a planet like (say) Jupiter, but 1 billionth of $10^{44}$ is still $10^{35}$ Joules. This is the same order of magnitude as the gravitational binding energy of Jupiter. In conclusion, a supernova has enough power to completely destroy Jupiter. It is possible that there might be a small core that survives, and would be ejected as part of the supernova remnant. On the other hand, a smaller earth-like planet would be toast (although steam is a closer description, the planet would be vapourised.) 

You can measure the position in the sky of any star; this is its altitude and azimuth. The star's position in the sky depends on its actual position in space, your position on Earth and the rotation of the Earth. Measuring the position requires some kind of angle-measurer. Such as a quadrant or sextant. You also need knowledge of which direction is North. This can be determined, even if the pole star is not visible, from the location of other stars. A telescope can increase accuracy but the same measurements can be done either with or without a telescope. You can use your position, and the position of Gamma Cephei in the sky (by altitude and azimuth) to determine the local sidereal time. You can then use the position of Gam Del and the sidereal time to determine the ra and dec of Gam Del. Other questions discuss the conversion between alt-az to ra-dec Software to convert RA and DEC into ALT and AZ 

If the rotation would stop, we would feel an additional gravity of $0.034 \mbox{ m}/\mbox{s}^2$, or about 0.35%, at the equator, (incorrectly) assuming the shape of Earth isn't changed by the changing rotation. The centrifugal acceleration is $v^2/r$, with $v=465.1 \mbox{ m}/\mbox{s},$ and $r=6378100 \mbox{ m}.$ With shorter rotation period, the other way, as you say. Polar regions wouldn't be affected, with the exception, that the ellipsoid of Earth would change due to changing rotation period. Respecting this, gravity would increase at the poles with faster rotation, since the poles would get closer to Earth's center. In equatorial regions the change of surface gravity would be affected more than in the simplified calculation above. In contrast to the poles, faster rotation would reduce surface gravity more than just by the centrifugal force. 

Yes, there are quite a lot of them, but ISS is by far the brightest. The other satellites can be visible with magnitude fainter than 3. "Can be" means in dusk/dawn, when the satellite is in the sunlight. 

The probabilites are unknown at the moment (March 2014), since there is only one known planet (Earth) harboring life. This doesn't allow any meaningful probability estimates for the occurence of life, based on empirical data. The overall formation of life is too complex to allow simulations based on current technology. Although some intermediate steps can be simulated or performed by experiment, e.g. by the Miller-Urey experiment. The Drake equation is a simplified attempt to decompose the probability into factors. Some of the factors aren't known yet. But there has been much progress in estimating the frequency of exoplanets, and the probability of planets to be habitable. From this news release one could estimate (order of magnitude), that there is one habitable planet around a Sun-like star per about 1,700 (about 12³) cubic light years in our region of the Milky Way ("... the nearest sun-like star with an Earth-size planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away..."). We don't know the probability for habitable planets to develop life, nor to be colonized. Probabilities of complex life forms are even more difficult to estimate (yet). More discussion about habitability of exoplanets on Wikipedia. 

The further north you go, the time between sunset and darkness becomes longer, no matter the season. The reason is due to the velocity at that latitude. If there is 10 min of twilight on the equator, then there is $10\sqrt{2}$ min at 45° latitude, 20 min at 60° latitude, ... Added: I used the website that @barrycarter listed above and discovered that there are 2 maxima and minima during the year. The solstices have the longest twilight times and the equinoxes have the shortest twilight times. 

When the galaxies approach together, gravity will effect the orbits of the stars. Since momentum needs to be conserved, the orbit of most of the stars will be changed radically. The different orbits will hide the spiral arms. Now that I have thought more about it, it is very likely that a few stars will collide, maybe it will take a few billion years. 

It depends on what the job is. For continuous broadcast and reception of signals, a geostationary satellite is best. For obtaining crop information, a low Earth orbit satellite might be better. 

It is estimated that the sun's core is about 1/5 of the radius of the sun (from Wikipedia). I know that the density of the plasma increases substantially the near the center, and that the volume of the core is 0.008 times the total volume. $$\frac {V_{core}}{V_{sun}}=\frac {4/3\pi (0.2)^3}{4/3\pi (1)^3}$$ $$\frac {V_{core}}{V_{sun}}=\frac {(0.008)}{(1)}$$ What is the mass of the core compared to the total mass?
