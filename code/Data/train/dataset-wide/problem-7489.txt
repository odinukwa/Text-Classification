Qingtao Chen and Fei Han have constructed [arxiv:0612055] tons of examples of string manifolds and non-string manifolds as complete intersections in products of complex projective spaces. For integers $s$ and $n_q$ with $1\leq q \leq s$ consider the product $$ Z:=\mathbb{C}P^{n_1} \times ... \times \mathbb{C}P^{n_s} $$ and the projection $pr_q:Z \to \mathbb{C}P^{n_q}$ to the $q$th factor. For further integers $t$ and $d_{pq}$ with $1 \leq p \leq t$ and $1 \leq q \leq s$, consider for $1 \leq p \leq t$ the line bundle $$ E_p := \bigotimes_{q=1}^s \;\; pr_q^{*}\mathcal{O}^{d_{pq}}_{q} $$ over $Z$, where $\mathcal{O}_q$ is the canonical line bundle over $\mathbb{C}P^{n_q}$. Now let $V_{d_{pq}}$ be the intersection of the zero loci of smooth global sections of $E_1,...,E_t$. $V_{d_{pq}}$ is always a smooth manifold, and the statement of Proposition 3.1 of the above paper is: 

Good question! There is a fairly well developed theory of diffeological spaces, with many recent references. The only difference between diffeological spaces and Chen's smooth spaces is that the plots of a diffeological space have open subsets $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ as their domains, while the ones of a smooth space have convex subsets. For questions concerning differential forms and tangent vectors, this seems to be irrelevant, so I'll continue with diffeological spaces. As Dimitri pointed out in his comments, a differential form on a diffeological space $X$ is not just a form $\psi_c$ on the domain $U_c$ of each plot $c: U_c \to X$. It must be required for two plots $c_1: U_1 \to X$ and $c_2:U_2 \to X$ such that one has a smooth map $f: U_1 \to U_2$ with $c_2 \circ f = c_1$, the forms satisfy $$ \psi_{c_1} = f^{*}\psi_{c_2}. $$ As also remarked by Dimitri, vector fields can neither be pulled back nor be pushed forward. Hence there is no analogous definition of vector fields. Yet the concept of a tangent space to a general diffeological space $X$ can be defined. A good reference is the paper "Diffeological spaces" by Martin Laubinger (Proyecciones Journal of Mathematics, Vol. 25, No2, pp. 151-178). Roughly, the tangent space at a point $x\in X$ is the sum of all tangent spaces $T_0U_c$ over all plots $c:U_c \to X$ centered at $x$, i.e. $0 \in U_c$ and $c(0)=x$. Then there is an equivalence relation that enforces the chain rule for maps. Smooth manifolds form a full subcategory of diffeological spaces, by regarding a smooth manifold $M$ as a diffeological space with plots all smooth maps $c:U \to M$, for all open subset $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Thus, for a smooth manifold $M$ we have now the classical tangent space, and the diffeological tangent space. Laubinger proves that both tangent spaces are isomorphic. Apparently less well-known is a theorem of M. Losik showing that Fréchet manifolds also form a full subcategory of diffeological spaces (with the plots defined in the very same way as for smooth manifolds). Thus, for a Fréchet manifold we also have two concepts of a tangent space, the classical one and the diffeological one. I don't know a reference for the statement that both concepts coincide, as in the smooth case, but I have looked at Laubinger's proof and I don't see why the same proof should not work for Fréchet manifolds. Now let's look at the path space $PM$ or the loop space $LM$ or at any other mapping space of a compact smooth manifold into a smooth manifold $M$. I continue with $LM$ for simplicity. There are, a priori, two diffeologies on the loop space $LM$. The first one is the one from the theorem of Losik, i.e. the one where the plots are the Fréchet-smooth maps from open sets $U$ to $LM$. The second one is the one described in the question, it is called the functional diffeology, with plots those maps $c: U \to LM$ whose adjoint $U \times S^1 \to M$ is smooth (demanding continuity for $c$ is superfluous). Luckily, the two diffeologies coincide (see Lemma A.1.7 in my paper Transgression to Loop Spaces and its Inverse, Part I). And here is the result: classical Fréchet theory says that the tangent space of $LM$ at a loop $\tau$ consists of vector fields along $\tau$. The earlier claimed generalization of Laubinger's theorem shows that it coincides with the diffeological tangent space, and the coincidence of the diffeologies on $LM$ shows that it can be defined via plots $c$ whose adjoints $U \times S^1 \to M$ are smooth maps. This is, I think, the best one could hope for. 

I am interested into computational complexity of decision problem: Does a given 2-dimensional simplicial complex contain (any)triangulation of 2-sphere? This problem trivially lies into NP, because certificate is the subset of triangles. I think that it is NP-complete. 

Multicast network design game is a special case of a general network design game ($URL$ in which there is a target vertex $t$ and $n$ rational players. $i$-th player wants to connect $s_i$ vertex of an edge-weighted graph $G$ to target vertex $t$ with a path $p_i$ as cheaply as possible. A strategy for player $i$ can be any path connecting $s_i$ to $t$. The cost for player $i$ is $\displaystyle \sum_{e\in p_i}\frac{c(e)}{n(e)}$ where $n(e)$ is the number of players that use the edge $e$ in their chosen paths. A strategy profile $p$ is a vector of strategies of all players, $p=(p_0,\ldots, p_{n-1})$. A strategy profile is Nash equilibrium if no player can change its strategy $p_i$ to $p_i'$ and improve its cost. The (social) cost of a strategy profile $p$ is the cost of the created network, i.e., the sum of the costs of all edges in the created network, which is, in turn, the sum of all players' costs. Note that in a multicast game an optimum social cost network forms a Steiner tree on the terminals $s_i$ and $t$ for $i=0,\ldots,n-1$. I am interested into the price of stability, which is the ratio of the cost of the best Nash equilibrium strategy profile over the cost of a social optimum. Major part of the work has been done bounding this value as a function of $n$, but my question is in a slightly different direction. After checking small number of players(e.g. 3 players, in $URL$ special type of underlying graphs(e.g. cycles, in $URL$ and $URL$ and the existing worst lower bounds($URL$ I conjecture the following: the worst case price of stability for $n$ players $PoS(n)$ is achieved by games which have unique Nash equilibrium. This is the conjecture in a strong sense. In a weak sense it would sound as follows: $PoS(n)$ is achieved by games with $m\geq n$ players and unique Nash equilibrium. Some motivation why this question might be interesting: 

Games with unique Nash equilibrium are interesting because there is no central authority needed to help players achieve the best equilibrium state. It is not immediate that this question is harder or easier than finding exact bounds of $PoS(n)$ (which on its own is considered to be a difficult problem), and probably it requires different techniques/approaches. One could immediately try to generalize the result to general network design games. I do not have counterexample for that case as well. Another direction for generalization could be towards congestion games, but some care should be taken into congestion functions and defining price of stability. 

There is a unique strategy how to move $n$ disks from the first rod to the second optimally and it takes $2^n-1$ steps, solution is obtained by simple recursion. I am interested into the following question, how many times during this strategy we have $a$ disks on the first rod, $b$ disks on the second and $c$ disks on the third. We can solve this question using dynamic programming and recursive relation for the optimal strategy, the recurrent formula is the following: $dp[a][b][c][n]=dp[a-1][c][b][n-1]+dp[c][b-1][a][n-1]$. If we consider $n=3k$ and $a=b=c=k$, $dp[k][k][k][3k]$ matches the following sequence ($a_k$ is number of ways to arrange $k$ blue, $k$ red and $k$ green balls so that the first one is fixed and no pair of adjacent balls are of the same color, first and last are also considered adjacent): $URL$ on the first 20 numbers, which makes me believe they are the same, though up to now I was unable to prove equivalence of these two sequences. Note that if we take different number of different color balls, the number of arranging them with the same conditions does not match with the number of respective configurations. $URL$ this sequence was suggested in the comments, each number $a_k$ is half of the number in our sequence. Is it just a coincidence or is there any nice way to show the equivalence? Reduction of the original question on any of these two would give a linear time algorithm to find the number of configurations. 

If $X$ has a universal cover $\widetilde{X}$, then $\widetilde X$ is a prinicpal $\pi_1(X)$-bundle over $X$. Suppose $$ A \to E \to \pi_1(X) $$ is a central extension. Then, the corresponding class in $H^2(X,A)$ is the obstruction against a lift of the structure group of $\widetilde X$ from $\pi_1(X)$ to $E$. To see this, suppose $\widetilde X$ has transition functions $g_{\alpha\beta}:U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta} \to \pi_1(X)$. If the open sets are small enough, they can always be lifted to $E$, but the lifts won't satisfy the cocycle condition. The error in the cocycle formula makes up a 3-cocycle $h_{\alpha\beta\gamma}: U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta} \cap U_{\gamma} \to A$. Now, $h_{\alpha\beta\gamma}$ quite obviously represents the obstruction class in $H^2(X,A)$. On the other hand, above procedure takes, on the level of classifying maps, the composite $$ X \to B\pi_1(X) \to BBA $$ with the homotopy fibre of the central extension. And this (I assume) is your "well-known" map. The obstruction class can be represented by a bundle gerbe, the so-called lifting bundle gerbe. The lifting bundle gerbe is a general thing: it represents the obstruction class for lifting the structure group of a bundle along a central extension. Here, it has structure group (or band, if you like) $A$. It is constructed with the fibration $\widetilde X \to X$, and over the fibre product $\widetilde X \times_X \widetilde X$ its "transition bundle" is the pullback of $E \to \pi_1(X)$ along the difference map $$ \delta: \widetilde X \times_X \widetilde X \to \pi_1(X). $$ Bundle gerbes with structure group $A$ have characteristic classes in $H^2(X,A)$, and it is a little exercise to check that the class of the lifting gerbe is the obstruction to solving the lifting problem. 

I'm ashamed to give the following abstract nonsense answer to this excellent question. Also, this is just an expansion of Santiago's first comment above. We'll have to talk about morphisms between Lie algebroids over different base manifolds (these are, for instance, the objects of the Lie groupoids they come from). A morphism between Lie algebroids is a linear, bracket-preserving and anchor-preserving smooth map between the total spaces covering a smooth map between the base manifolds. An isomorphism would be composed of two diffeomorphisms. I am working in the "span picture" and not in the "bibundle picture". I define what a Span of Lie algebroids is, yielding the 1-morphisms of the 2-category Theo is asking for. Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be Lie algebroids with base manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$, respectively. A span $E_1 \to E_2$ is a third Lie algebroid $A$ over some base manifold $B$ together with a Lie algebroid isomorphism $A \to E_1$ covering a diffeomorphism $B \to M_1$ and a Lie algebroid morphism $A \to E_2$ covering a smooth map $B \to M_2$. The 2-morphisms are just Lie algebroid morphisms between these "correspondence Lie algebroids". Without having checked all the details, it looks pretty clear to me that this forms a 2-category, with the composition of 1-morphisms the ususal "span composition". EDIT: One can also make up a version with undirected spans by simply ommiting the condition of being an isomorphism. Of course, this doesn't answer any of Theo's interesting "$\bullet$"-questions, but principally one could now possibly translate this "span picture" into a "bialgebroid-picture". Finally, the consistency check: recall that there is a functor from Lie groupoids + smooth functors to Lie algebroids + algebroid morphisms, the latter in the above sense. Applying this functor to spans of Lie groupoids produces immediately a span of Lie algebroids, both in the directed and undirected version. EDIT II: as Theo points out below, that's not totally correct because this functor does not send weak equivalences between Lie groupoids to isomorphisms between Lie algebroids. 

Associated to every lifting problem posed by a bundle $P$ is an $A$-gerbe over $M$, called the "lifting gerbe" and denoted $\mathcal{G}_P$. This gerbe represents geometrically the obstruction against lifts. Moreover, the actual lifts are in equivalence with trivializations of $\mathcal{G}_P$. The same works if one wants to include connections into the lifting problem. These are results of Murray and Gomi. The category of $A$-gerbes with connection over $M$ is equivalent to a certain category of principal $A$-bundles with connection over $LM$ which are additionally equipped with "fusion products". The equivalence is established by a transgression functor, which has been introduced by Brylinski and McLaughlin. It takes trivializations of gerbes to sections of bundles.
