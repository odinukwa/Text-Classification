If they were unaware of each other, they would be effectively isolated from each other. Like the different "phasing" in the Stargate series or something. Alternately, if the different kinds of people are physically incapable of communicating because they're different species. Like one species is deaf and uses visual communication while the other species is blind and uses audio communication. If you're talking about normal humans, it would be pretty difficult to avoid contact. However, we do have precedent in many cases with various types of racism. Blacks and women have in many cases had different cultures and a different set of laws applied to them. I'm sure there are other examples of similar cases in the past. As long as you're not trying to keep things equitable, it's not hard to have similar sets of cultural schisms in play. 

That's called a perpetual motion machine. It's not how heat engines work. Heat engines work by utilizing differences of temperature to create some type of pressure, then using that pressure to cause mechanical work. The heat can be generated in various ways, but it has to be externally-generated. Otherwise, each time you use the energy, the effect diminishes and pretty soon you have nothing left. For example, you can get heat from the sun (a solar heater), magma (geothermal), chemicals (like gasoline), by generating electricity with a wind farm, etc. Here's a page with numerous examples of practical heat engines that use fossil fuels, coal, etc. to produce mechanical work from heat. This page gives a decent primer on the theory behind heat engines with the so-called Carnot cycle. It has a lot of calculus, but if you're not familiar with calculus you can skim through the math to read the bold and italic parts for the cliff notes. Your creature could potentially live in the relatively cold ground, and stick pods up into the air to absorb heat from the sun, then somehow utilize that temperature difference to produce energy like a Sterling engine. In the winter, the air would be colder than the ground, so it would have to be able to work in both directions (effectively, it's using geothermal heat from the ground to warm up something in the cold air to do work). The only way I could imagine a mobile creature using a heat engine as a primary power source is if it's quite large and capable of transferring hot or cold fluids between opposite environments. You could look up various solar heating options to get ideas. This U.S. Department of Energy site has some more information, but most of those systems also use solar panels (kind of a synthetic photosynthesis) to back it up. Plus they use the heat for the simple purpose of heating the house, not actually, e.g., powering appliances. Here is another page from the same site giving some information on a geothermal power plant in Nevada. Note that they had to dig 10,000 feet into the crust and it's a stationary affair, but you could potentially do something similar if your creatures live near a semi-active volcano or similar. Another method would be to have a symbiotic system, where the mobile creature feeds off some type of plant-like organism that uses solar or geothermal power in some way. What you're really not going to have is a creature who can magically make everything around it cold. The heat has to go somewhere. Generally, it only goes from hot to cold, so the only way to make the ground around you cold is if you are cold. You can cheat it a little using something like refrigeration, but A) you still have to vent all that heat somewhere (your kitchen refrigerator has radiators on the back that make your house hotter while your food gets colder -- the creature could freeze a lake, but it would have to boil something else to do it), and B) you still need some external source of energy to run the compressor to make the process work (this is what was meant by "it takes energy to cause refrigeration" -- you don't gain energy by absorbing heat; you lose energy by creating excess heat to temporarily move some heat from a cold place to a hot place). Here is a basic run-down of how refrigeration works. 

First, note that not all crime is about money. If my girlfriend cheats on me and I decide to murder her, you can't stop that via any kind of currency. Second, the only way to make crime not pay is if you can monitor every single person and therefore detect and prove each crime that's committed, then dole out equitable punishment. Even then, the people in charge of monitoring can be bribed, blackmailed, or otherwise coerced into ignoring specific crimes. And the only way to monitor everyone at all times involves a substantial portion of the population being employed as monitors, which would be hugely inefficient (you'd waste more money stopping crime than the criminals would have stolen from you to begin with). As I pointed out in a comment, stolen goods can always be laundered for money. It's just a matter of selling a stolen item for cheap to someone who doesn't care about legality. The thief can trade "services performed" (such as cleaning or yardwork that don't actually occur) and the stolen item (which isn't listed on the bill of sale) for money or goods. If trading for goods, those goods can then be sold for money, or used directly by the thief, allowing them to save money they would have otherwise spent. However, this being worldbuilding, a valid answer could involve one or more centralized AIs or super-smart aliens, and recording devices surrounding every building in the country/planet. Ideally, you'd want to record the rooms inside the building, but it would be pretty hard to say you weren't guilty when we can show you staking out the house, entering just after the owner left, and walking away with a box full of stuff. You'd still have trouble with jewelry and other easily-concealed items, but as long as people kept that stuff well-hidden, it would be a fairly minor issue (plus, we'd note the breaking-and-entering and when the cops found your pockets full of expensive jewelry, that would be pretty substantial evidence of theft). For major corporations, they often already have recording devices everywhere, so now we'd just have an AI who was capable of almost immediate detection of the crime and tracking the suspect until the police arrived at the scene. For consensual crime, like drugs and prostitution, you're not going to catch every little case unless you've got cameras in every room in the land, and on every tree in the woods. However, an AI would be able to make very good referential deductions and help the police take down major suppliers or brothels, as well as people who make almost all their money off such things. With drugs, taking down the major suppliers would be enough to largely eliminate the problem. Prostitution would be trickier unless sex itself were outlawed, but you'd still catch the career girls/guys/shemale aliens/robots/whatever they're into by this point. 

Note the extreme variability to these answers even in a two-sexed environment. There's no reason to suppose three sexes would suddenly get less complex. 

As mentioned, anti-gravity and or gravity generators will let you pull magic out of thin air, but let's try it without magic. I can't imagine why anyone would bother doing it, but I decided to see what happens and ended up with a totally insane project that uses a lot of carbon nanotube (CNT) and crazy amounts of energy. But, you don't need unproven technologies like anti-gravity or unobtanium. $\ddot\smile$ Creating the Beast The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is $r_s<{2MG\over c^2}$. Solving that for mass, given a ½ ly radius, we get $M<3.19\cdot 10^{42}kg$ to avoid being a black hole. The surface area of a sphere is $A=4\pi r^2$. The volume of spherical shell is $V\approx A\Delta r$ for $r\gg\Delta r$. The mass of the shell is $M=V\rho\approx A\Delta r\rho=4\pi r^2\Delta r\rho$. Solving that for thickness, given ½ ly radius, the mass given above, and the density of CNT (about $1.3 {g\over cm^3}$), we get $\Delta r<8727 km$. The compressive strength of CNT is around 416 MPa. The inside of the sphere feels the pressure of the entire mass weighing down on it. The force is given by $f=Ma$, where $a$ is acceleration at the surface. $a={MG\over r^2}$, so $f={M^2G\over r^2}$. Pressure is $p={f\over A}={{M^2G\over r^2}\over 4\pi r^2}={M^2G\over 4\pi r^4}$. Rearranging gives $M=\sqrt{4p\pi r^4\over G}=r^2\sqrt{4p\pi\over G}$. Solving for mass, given 416 MPa and ½ ly radius, we get $1.98\cdot 10^{41}kg$, which is not a black hole, yay. Using that mass, we can calculate a thickness of 55 km, surface acceleration of 0.0061 g (about $1\over 164$ Earth gravity), not a black hole, and the CNT construction can withstand the pressures. Of course, getting 10 billion solar masses of carbon nanotubes is a bit of a feat, but it's not outside the realm of just-possible. You wouldn't be able to cover the entire thing with people, dirt, etc., and you'd need some source of energy (maybe a Dyson sphere surrounding a super-massive star in the center of your CNT planet?), but it's doable without magic. Add some "Gravity" As Zsolt Szilagy points out, pretty much any kind of rotation you can actually notice is going to wreak havoc with shear forces, but you might be able to spin it just fast enough to get some normal Earth gravity along the equator if you put your people on the inside. Wikipedia says the breaking length of CNT is around 4700 km under 1 g, so the CNT should stay together while being flung outward at 1 g. Centripetal acceleration is given by $a={v^2\over r}$ for uniform circular motion. Solving for speed, given 1 g and ½ ly radius, we get 0.718 c at the equator. Not impossible, but it's going to take a long time to get there. Notes Also, angular kinetic energy is $E={1\over 2}I\omega^2$, and $I={2\over 3}Mr^2$ for a thin, spherical shell. $\omega={v\over r}$, so $E={1\over 2}{2\over 3}Mr^2({v_\text{equator}\over r})^2={1\over 3}Mv_\text{eq}^2$. Solving for energy, given mass of $2\cdot 10^{41}kg$ and $0.718c$ speed, we get $3\cdot 10^{57}J$, which means converting about 8% of the Milky Way's mass to kinetic energy over some insanely long time period to do it. Of note, if you're going to spin the "planet" and put people on the inside, you might as well save a bunch of material and just make it a Ringworld-style ring (it's still going to be insane though). Also, at 0.7 c, we're getting into relativistic territory, so the Newtonian equations aren't perfect, but I don't think it's anything sufficiently advanced scientists can't handle if they made it to this point. I'd be more worried about extrapolating CNT strengths from $\mu m$ scales to $km$ scales. And rogue stars. 

If you want to go further, you can turn weeks into 10-day periods, with 36.5 weeks per year, though obviously there's no way fully convert to a base-10 metric calendar without adjusting the Earth's rotation. Of note, France actually used this exact time system from 1794 to at least 1801, although it was mandatory only until 1795, and they used a 10-day week from 1800ish to 1805. In their system, the clock and units were called "decimal" instead of "metric", even though they introduced the metric system at the same time, and they sometimes used the unit "décime", one-tenth of a decimal hour, or ten decimal minutes. During this era, astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace used a decimal watch that ended up being the basis for astronomers using the decimal time 2012rcampion mentions in his answer. 

Ok, sorry, but I'm going to be the Negative Nancy here and tell you that your entire premise just doesn't work. Note that a lot of what I write here is essentially a duplication of answers to the question you linked here. Although I didn't realize it until I'd already written most of this. The best things you can do are 1) limit magic so not everyone can use it (to keep magic rare like you want), 2) make the magic scroll a physical device that's hard to duplicate properly so you earn money by making reliable scrolls, not designing rune programs (makes piracy worthless instead of preventing it), and 3) implement scroll physics that degrades scrolls over time and/or with use, with better-made, more expensive scrolls lasting longer (or you'll go out of business when all 10 magicians in your town have every scroll they need). Additionally, you might make the "scroll" something small and easy to carry, with "wands" that organize and allow rapid access to the scroll you want. Better scrolls and wands are smaller, lighter, and have better algorithms for accessing the correct scroll. Alternately, you can just handwave it all and say, "When you purchase the spell over the internet, it magically gets inscribed in your brain and nobody else can use it. Because I said so." If magic is as easy as you say, everyone will be using it. If I can just print out several copies of a spell using some special ink, then touch the paper and Boom! fireball happens, people aren't going to randomly stop believing it works. Instead, they're going to go through enormous efforts to figure out how it works until either everyone has access to magic, or the world is destroyed in World War 3. The only way people stop believing in something is if it stops happening. We didn't stop believing in vampires and werewolves and Bigfoot and Nessie because "like, reasons, bro". We stopped believing in them because there's literally zero evidence any of these things exist, and a great deal of evidence that they're all folk tales that have been modified and added to over centuries. If you have a very small number of magicians who very carefully protect knowledge of magic from the rest of the world, you can potentially keep it a secret. If the secret is maintained long enough, people will stop believing in magic. If a spell or two gets cast in front of the muggles here and there, people at large won't think too much of it. But the instant one magician shows the world at large that magic is real, your entire Masquerade just shattered. This is made enormously worse by having readily-copied magic spells. If a vampire is discovered in L.A., the vampire community can sneak in, kill him, and destroy the body. Then, even if there's a good amount of evidence a vampire existed, it's possible the whole thing will eventually be forgotten. But if the vampire turns a hundred people into vampires first, the vampire community will have a very hard time hunting them all down before every other think-tank in the world has a vampire test subject. Likewise, if the ability to cast magic can easily be transferred (without even having to drink blood or burn up in the sun!), the magical community is going to be very hard pressed to keep it a secret. In order to prevent this, you need to create some kind of hard, physical device that mostly or totally prevents muggles from using magic at all: 

I can't help you with the non-historical, but your best bet for historical data is likely to be your local library. If they don't have the books you need, they probably know a library that does, and can get the books sent to your library for minimal charge. Libraries have access to anything from history books to encyclopedias to peer-reviewed journals that cost a small fortune to buy for yourself. My local university library allows non-students to get a card. I'm not sure how typical that is, but it's a good place to start, since universities may have subscriptions a standard library might not pay for. Not that the renaissance has changed in the past few centuries, but you may find recent studies that give you better information than something from the 70s. For something simple, you could try this world-building resource I stumbled across. I have no idea how authentic it is, and it's medieval rather than renaissance, but it looked interesting. He says "this article is a distillation of broad possibilities drawn from a variety of historical reference points", and has a bibliography at the end for example resources.
