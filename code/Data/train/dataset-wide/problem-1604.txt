For each template you can figure out the expected luminosity in the I-band and find the best match. For this method, it's really best to have more than one point for comparison. Since the near IR will likely be a blackbody from your evolved stellar population, you might want to see if you can supplement your I-band data with 2MASS observations. 

All of these effects are related to the 11 year solar cycle. And while we know there are times when the sun is "active" versus "inactive" we aren't necessarily predicting exactly where sunspots or solar flares will occur, but how many we see in total. 

The Van Allen radiation belt, which is outside of the Earth's magnetic field is believed to get its radiation from solar wind. 

Aladin is a good way to do visualization from multiple catalogs. MAST also offers a cross-mission search. 

I believe your confusion is from combining two popular simplifications of our Universe. As we look further away we see further back in time because of the finite speed of light. So these distant objects are also evolving with us, but that light hasn't hit Earth yet. It might help to know that the observable universe may only be 14 Gyr old, but its radius is 46 Gly, not 14 Gly. If the speed of light was infinite, then we wouldn't be observing back in time as we look at more distant objects. 

(See this Wikipedia page) The temperature needed for hydrodgen burning is 10 million Kelvin, so that's how hot a star must be to be considered as a star. It needs to get so hot, because else it will fail to burn hydrodgen and will become a "failed star": a brown dwarf. Edit: Surface temperature can be misleading, since the temperature ranges in which lay stars are not populated only by stars, but also by other objects such as hot Jupiters, with surface temperature ranging from 1000 to 3000 K. 

These different phases are due to the interplay of cooling and heating processes of its own components (Wolfire et al. 1995). The lowest density regions are hot and associated to supernova expansion bubbles. The HII regions (HII for "ionized hydrodgen") are associated with O stars (massive stars that can efficiently ionized their environment). The highest density you can get with no evidence of forming stars are of the order of 10^4 cc (see for example this talk by Ward-Thompson on starless cores). Dense, molecular clouds that are about to collapse and form a star have a density of the order of 10^6-10^7 cc. 

Such objects are surrounded by an accretion disk, that is a disk of gas, the gas being accreted onto the central object. However, at this stage of its life, the accretion disk around the black hole of a binary system like GRS-1915+105 is strongly depleted. Therefore, the accretion rate is not sufficient to support a coutinuous burst. Matter fills the outer disk until a critical density is reached, that triggered an outburst. Mass from the companion star is lost by a Roche lobe overflow mechanism. References: 

With the Tully Fisher relation, the inclination angle is determined from the major-minor axis ratio where $sin(i) = \sqrt{1-q^2} $ and q is the inverse of your ratio. You need to apply the sine of the angle to the rotational velocity because the measure is based on our line of sight observation which must be converted to the true 3D velocity. 

For starbursts, their star formation rates are best estimated by a combination of their ultraviolet and infrared emission. [O II] and [O III] as well as Hydrogen recombination lines can be used to estimate star formation, but like the UV, these suffer from extinction. 

After fooling around with a FITS file(s) (e.g. setting scale, changing color) is it possible to save the session such that there is a file associated with all those tweaks the next time I open it up? Save and Save Image just seem to keep whatever I set it to, but when I load those new saved files back into ds9 the settings are all back to whatever default load settings I have enabled. I would also like to be able to do this if I have FITS files loaded into multiple frames so I don't have to go through the process of loading each individual image. 

Exoplanets: As you see in the resolution B5, this definition is specified for "Planet in the Solar System". It is mainly because it does not really make sense now that it is already challenging to observe planets, so the distinction between a planet and a dwarf planet is not yet crucial for exoplanets. So the official definition of an exoplanet by IAU makes mainly a difference between a planet and a brown dwarf. However, I guess the IAU definition of a planet should be kept for the other planetary systems if we are able to detect objects such as dwarf planets. 

What is it? An IMF, $\Phi(m)$, is defined such as $\Phi(m){\rm d}m$ gives the fractions of stars with a mass between $m - {\rm d}m/2$ and $m + {\rm d}m/2$, and with a normalized distribution $$\int_{m_{\rm min}}^{m_{\rm max}}m\Phi(m){\rm d}m = 1\ M_{\odot}.$$ Note that these boundaries ($m_{\rm min}$ and $m_{\rm max}$) are ill-defined, but typically of the order of 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ and 100 $M_{\odot}$, respectively. IMFs The various IMF used are the following, with their main characteristics: 

More dirty details: There is an excellent talk by Scott Tremaine, given at ESO last year you could watch online. 

So if you want to make a star as we typically observe in our galaxy, you will need also some molecules (hopefully there are plenty of them) and also some carbon. Else, you'll get big, massive, hot and luminous stars. Like the first generation of stars (called Population III stars, you can see here if you want more dirty details) in the early Universe. 

When stars transition from the main sequence core Hydrogen burning to core Helium burning they can experience Hydrogen shell burning. 

Stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes likely form from very different mechanisms. While we have a pretty good idea how stellar mass black holes form, we're still not sure about how supermassive black holes form because they occur very early on in the Universe. 

There is a Dantes Standardized Subjet Test (DSST) in astronomy. I have no idea if and how widely colleges give credit for these exams. Typically, you will start with physics and choose to specialize in astronomy. Therefore, most standardized exams are for physics which may have a handful of astronomy questions. 

Vizier is a good resource for finding catalogs. Searching for "SMC+cepheid" I found a related paper (Udalski et al. 1999) with additional data $URL$ You can also look for "Similar Catalogs" though it may or may not be useful in this case. 

Asphalt roads do a great job at heating up cities! Mars can actually get up to 80F, so part of the challenge is preventing losing that heat in the low pressure atmosphere. 

Take another photograph of the same field that is less exposed. (Doesn't matter if you do this by shortening the exposure time, decreasing the ISO, etc.) This will give you an image with far fewer stars so you can easily pattern match your images. 

That's for the big projects (with a strong European bias, sorry folks I know better what's done on this side of the ocean). You can add to that all the missions to study exoplanets (like Kepler), missions to study our solar system planets (Cassini, Huygens, Messenger, Juno, all the Mars missions etc.), plus all the other facilities around the world to study anything and everything, from stellar dynamic to planet's composition. The main problem is always to understand how such structure (from the large scale structures in the Universe to small scale structures in the galaxy), object (from galaxies to satellites), phenomenon occurs, forms, appears. To understand what are the dominant physical processes at play. Astronomy is still craving for data; the more data you have, the better your statistic will be, and hopefully the better your understanding will also be. 

in orbit around the Sun with a sufficient mass so that self-gravity overcome rigid body forces (that assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium) has cleared its neighbourhood. 

That is an intersting question as this is far from being obvious. Actually, for quite some time it was believed that planets should indeed spin retrograde (we can at least track it back to Laplace in his Exposition du Syst√®me du Monde published in 1976 where he developed his nebular hypothesis). How to prove that planet should spin prograde? We'll have to go back to their formation history. Let's start with an ideal case: particles moving in eliptical orbits around a central object of mass $M$, with a proto-planet of mass $m_0$, and rotating in a eliptical orbit. Let's look at what happens at a given point at a distance $r$ from the central object. First, for a planetesimal in a tangential external orbit, then for a planetesimal in a tangential internal orbit. Tangential external orbit We can write Newton's Second Law ${\bf F} = m {\bf a}$ and project it on the current trajectory axis (normal and tangent), knowing that the acceleration is always something like $v^2/R$, with $R$ the curvature radius (that is different from $r$, the distance to the central object). We get for the normal component: $$\frac{GM}{r^2} \cos \alpha = \frac{v_{ext}^2}{R_{ext}^2},$$ $R_{ext}$ being the curvature radius of the planetesimal in an external orbit. For the proto-planet: $$\frac{GM}{r^2} \cos \alpha = \frac{v^2}{R^2},$$ $\alpha$ having the same value for both object, since it denotes the angle between the direction toward the curvature center and the central object and the orbits being tangential at this specific point, where $r$ the distance to the central object is also the same. Therefore: $$\frac{v^2}{R^2} = \frac{v_{ext}^2}{R_{ext}^2}.$$ As $R < R_{ext}$, we have $v < v_{ext}$. Tangetial internal orbit With the same argument, we can show that $v > v_{int}$ (I let it as an exercice; extra bonus point if you do it with the energy conservation law). Consequences If you go in the reference frame of the protoplanet, you will see the internal planetesimal, rotating at a lower speed, coming backward, towards the proto-planet, and the external planetesimal, rotating at a faster speed, coming forward: 

HUDF suffers from cosmic variance. So while you could choose what you believe is a random and unbiased region of sky, your uncertainty will be larger than just the standard statistical sampling error. There would be additional uncertainty because of large scale structure since galaxies are not randomly distributed on the sky. 

Schindler et al. 1999: Morphology of the Virgo Cluster: Gas versus Galaxies has details for $\beta$ model fits for Virgo and its subclusters. 

You're right, a redshift will give you a measure of a velocity, not an acceleration. I'm assuming when you say acceleration, you're referring to the accelerating expansion of the universe so you're not looking at the particular acceleration of an object (which you could get from examining the force of gravity imparted on that object). So in addition to a redshift, you need to find a way to independently measure the distance. To get out to an appreciable redshift (z~0.5), Type Ia supernova are used as "standard candles". They are considered standard because they're believed to be from white dwarfs that explode because they have reached their maximum possible mass, the Chandrasekhar limit, of 1.4 solar masses. Therefore, when they explode, they should all look about the same and any difference in brightness would be from how far they are away from us. So they measured the distance and the redshift of the galaxy the supernova originated from to determine the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating over time. 

Importance for star formation: They are all relevant to star formation, one way or another. One key property of turbulence is to cascade from large to small scales; therefore, even if you inject turbulence at large scales (galactic scale) you'll get turbulent motions down to the scale of a molecular cloud. A nice illustration of the tubulent cascade is the Larson's relation (Larson 1981): 

The resource you cite, in addition to this full list of crater's names are the official, definitive lists of named craters. Note that you have the coordinates of each crater in the complete list; I guess you could reuse these informations for your project. As for the atlas, it is specified in the "introduction" of the atlas that the list is up-to-date with the approved nomenclature of lunar craters. The IAU (the International Astronomical Union) is the official organisation in charge of naming celestrial objects et al. You can rely on it. 

Origin of Earth rotation There are two main phenomena that explain Earth rotation. First one is linked to the history of the solar system: there is angular momentum in the interstellar medium (ISM), so the collapsing cloud that formed our solar system had an initial angular momentum (rotation of the galaxy and turbulence in the ISM are typically a good candidate for that; see for example Mac Low & Klessen 2004). By conservation of the latter, particles in the collapsing cloud accelerate (the norm of the angular momentum $I$ is $mrv$, with $m$ the mass of the system, $r$ the radius and $v$ the velocity; as the cloud contracts, $r$ decreases and then $v$ has to increase) and due to centrifugal force, a disk will tend to form. By conservation of the angular momentum in the protoplanetary disk, you will also tend to form bodies that rotates. The second phenomena is linked to the formation history of the Earth. Simply put, Earth formation history is due to collisions of planetesimals (let say they are big chunks of rock, formed by a collision history of smaller chunks of rock, formed by...); these planetesimals are orbiting the forming star in the protoplanetary disk, their rotation being linked to the disk formation history (see above). When planetesimals collide, two things can basically happen: either the collision is perfectly central (meaning that the momentum of one of the two colliding objects is pointed toward the center of mass of the second object) and there is no transfer of angular momentum, either the collision is lateral and there is a transfer of angular momentum. Depending on the configuration, you can either transfer momentum that will make the other body rotating on way or the other. That being said, you can then object that there should be a equirepartition of collisions pushing the proto-Earth to rotate in both directions. Which is true, but external planetesimals are rotating faster than internal ones. Therefore, from the proto-Earth perspective (meaning, in a physical sense, in its reference frame), internal planetesimals are seen as coming backward, from front, and external planetesimals are seen as coming forward, from behind. Long story short, there are both transfering momentum in the same "direction", forcing the proto-Earth to rotate in the same direction as the rotation of the protoplanetary disk (see for example Artem'ev & Radzievskii 1965). Rotation around the Sun This one's easy: gravity. The Earth is constantly falling towards the Sun because of gravity, and the centripetal acceleration counteracts perfectly gravity, mainting the Earth on its orbit. 

A high density of stars definitely increases the chances of collisions, however, the high velocity of a halo star orbiting wouldn't increase its chances. Since the halo star is traveling very quickly, the halo star would only spend a small amount of time near the galactic core. Additionally, it would have less time to get deflected, gravitationally, by other stars in the core. 

However, when you burn the Hydrogen in the shell to Helium, it will fall on the core creating a hotter core where the radiation pressure from the Helium burning core will push the Hydrogen further out into the outer envelope. From here you can get a Helium flash which is the cause of Horizontal Branch stars. If you were able to somehow force more Hydrogen to shell burn then you could possibly extend the life for a short while, though the lifetimes post main sequence are much shorter < 1 Gyr compared to the lifetimes on the main sequence. 

Yes, minerals can be observed using spectroscopy on a telescope, typically from their thermal signature. We can determine what type of mineral based on the elements that make up the mineral as well as the type of crystal structure, which will give a different spectral signature
