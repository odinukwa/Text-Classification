Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a model of set theory, and consider HOD (the hereditarily ordinal definable elements) of $\mathfrak{M}$. Let $K$ be any algebraically closed field in HOD of zero characteristic and any cardinality. Is there always a real closed subfield $R$ of $K$ of index 2 such that $R \in $ HOD? Under what condition $R$ is archimedean? Or rather, can we always find an archimedean real closed subfield $R$ of $K$ such that $R \in$ HOD? 

Consider the full Solovay model $N=M[G]$ of set theory. Let HOD be the set of hereditarily ordinal definable elements of $M[G]$. It is known that in $N$ every set of reals definable from ordinals and reals is Baire measurable. My question is: In HOD, is every set definable from ordinals and reals (in HOD) Baire measurable? (i.e. is the property that a definable set is Baire measurable preserved by passage from $N$ to HOD?). If we consider also HOD(HOD) does the same remain true? Edit: I rephrase my question to be: is there a model of set theory $M$ such that in HOD$^{M[G]}$ every set of reals definable from ordinals and reals is Baire measurable? Can we find a model of set theory in which HOD, HOD(HOD) etc.. all satisfy the same property above? 

Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ be a probability space, $\{\mathcal{F}_n \subseteq \mathcal{F}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ an increasing filtration, $S$ a finite set and $X: \Omega \rightarrow S$ a random variable. Denote $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ the space of probability measures on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ and assume that $\{Q_n: \Omega \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\Omega)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ are regular conditional probabilities corresponding to $\mathcal{F}_n$. That is, for any $A \in \mathcal{F}$, $Q_n(\omega)(A)$ is an $\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable function of $\omega \in \Omega$ and for any $B \in \mathcal{F}_n$ $$\int_B Q_n(\omega)(A) P(d\omega) = P(A \cap B)$$ For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, define the information gain $I_n: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \sqcup \{+\infty\}$ by $$I_n(\omega):= D_{KL}(X_* Q_{n+1}(\omega) \mid\mid X_* Q_{n}(\omega))$$ Here, $X_*$ denotes push-forward by $X$, i.e. $X_* Q_{n}(\omega)$ is the probability measure on $S$ s.t. for any $A \subseteq S$ $$X_* Q_{n}(\omega)(A) := Q_n(\omega)(X^{-1}(A))$$ $D_{KL}$ is the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence, i.e. given probability measures $\mu,\nu$ on $S$, regarded as functions from $S$ to $[0,1]$: $$D_{KL}(\mu \mid\mid \nu) := \sum_{s \in S} \mu(s) \ln{\frac{\mu(s)}{\nu(s)}}$$ 

The question is exactly stated by the title, i.e. how complicated is the formula $\psi(x)$ (in the language of set theory) expressing that a given set of reals $x$ is non-measurable? A second question would be: can this formula be deduced from a formula (possibly with ordinal parameters or a countable sequence of ordinals) which involves only quantification over reals and natural numbers? PS: By "deduced" I mean, given a formula $\varphi(x)$ defining a set $x$, then can we have $ZFC \vdash \forall x (\varphi(x) \rightarrow \psi(x))$. 

Let $T$ be a countable first-order theory, and assume that $T$ has exactly one atomic model up to isomorphism in every uncountable cardinality. (By "atomic" I mean a model which omits the non-principal types). Now let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a countable transitive model of set theory, and assume that $T$ is also (countable) in $\mathfrak{M}$. Is the above property preserved in $\mathfrak{M}$? i.e. does it hold in $\mathfrak{M}$ that there exists only one atomic model of $T$ in every uncountable cardinality in $\mathfrak{M}$? 

EDIT: I think I figured out the answer in case $k$ is a field. In this case the tensor product functor is exact (rather than just right exact) Introduce $h$ a formal parameter satisfying $h^2=0$. $\pi$ defines a "deformed" coproduct on $H[h]$ given by $$\Delta'(a):=\Delta(a)+h\pi(a)$$ Thus the category of left $H[h]$-modules becomes a tensor category Denote $\mathcal{M}$ our symmetric tensor category. The tensor product functor is $\otimes$ and its symmetric braiding is $b: X \otimes Y \rightarrow Y \otimes X$ We construct the Abelian category $\mathcal{M}[h]$. An object $X$ in $\mathcal{M}[h]$ is an object in $\mathcal{M}$ equipped with an endomorphism $h: X \rightarrow X$ s.t. $h^2=0$. A morphism in $\mathcal{M}[h]$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{M}$ which commutes with $h$ $\mathcal{M}[h]$ comes with the following functors of interest: 

According to Jackson's inequality, there is $c > 0$ s.t. for any continuous function $f: S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ (where $S^1 := \mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Z}$ is the circle) and integer $n$ there is a trigonometric polynomial $q: S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ of degree $n$ s.t. $$\lVert f - q \rVert_\infty \leq c \, \omega(f,\frac{1}{n})$$ Here $\omega$ is the modulus of continuity: $$\omega(f,\delta):=\sup_{\substack{x \in S^1 \\ h \in [0,\delta]}} \lvert f(x) - f(x + h) \rvert$$ I'm looking for a generalization of this theorem to functions $f: T^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $T^d := \mathbb{R}^d / \mathbb{Z}^d$ is the canonical $d$-dimensional torus. 

The meager sets are sets which are union of $\lambda$ nowhere dense sets where $\lambda < \kappa$ and $\kappa$ is the cardinality of the space. If we consider a model of ZFC $\mathfrak{M}$ in which every (suitably definable) set of reals have the property of Baire, then every (suitably definable) set of a suitably defined toplogical space have the "generalized" Baire property. 

Let $M$ be a saturated model of a theory $T$ in a first-order language $\mathcal{L}$, and let $N$ be a submodel of $M$. Is it possible to have a substructure $A\neq N$ of $M$ such that $N \subset A \subset M$ and every element of $A$ is definable by a formula in $L$ with parameters from $N$? 

In exercise 4 page 456 of Hodges "Model Theory" it is required to show that if an ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ is not $\omega_1$-complete, then every ultraproduct $\prod_I A_i/ \mathcal{U}$ has cardinality $< \omega$ or $\geq 2^\omega$. Does this suggest there can be ultraproducts $\prod_I A_i/ \mathcal{U}$ which have cardinality $\omega$ if we assume that the ultrafilter is (non-principal) $\omega_1$-complete? Is this possible? 

I'm mostly interested in the case of cocommutative $H$. For such $H$, coPoisson structure is morally an infinitesimal deformation away from cocommutativity (the structure needed for "coquantization" preserving bialgebra structure). Also, I'm mostly interested in the Hopf algebra case but this doesn't seem important for the question The category of left modules over $H$ is a $k$-linear Abelian category (just because H is a $k$-algebra) equipped with a tensor product functor (due to the coproduct $\Delta$ on H). For cocommutative $H$ the tensor product is symmetric. The question is: 

Shahn Majid presents in section 9.4 of "Foundatations of Quantum Group Theory" a Tannaka-type reconstruction theorem for producing a $k$-bialgebra out of its $k$-linear monoidal category of modules $\mathcal{M}$. The theorem depends on the presense of a fiber (fogetful) functor $F: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow Vect_k$ and monoidal structure on $F$. The question is: 

Given an algebraically closed field $k$ and a finitely generated commutative $k$-algebra $A$, all simple modules over $A$ are 1-dimensional 

Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a countable transitive model of set theory, and consider HOD (the hereditarily ordinal definable elements of $\mathfrak{M}$). Let $x$ be an object $x \in HOD$. So $x$ is hereditarily definable from ordinals. Can we find a defining formula $\psi(x)$ of $x$ such that $\psi(x)$ contain only quantifiers ranging over the ordinals? PS: by "ranging over ordinals" I mean a quantifier $Qy$ where either we have the restriction $Qy$($y$ is an ordinal ...) or that $Qy \in \alpha$ where $\alpha$ is an ordinal. Edit: After Emil's comment, I am going to allow quantification over elements $y$ such that $y \in x$. The reason for this change is that in the application I have in mind we can allow this. And, yes, we can allow also arbitrary bounded quantifiers. 

Consider an elementary chain of models of some first-order theory $T$: $$ (M_\alpha)_{\alpha < \kappa}, M_\alpha \prec M_\beta \; {\rm for} \; \alpha < \beta .$$ Let also $(N_\alpha)$ be another elementary chain of models of the same theory. Assume, that for every $\alpha < \kappa$ ($\kappa$ a cardinal) we have an isomorphism $f_\alpha: M_\alpha \to N_\alpha$. Is there a way to extend these isomorphisms to an isomorphism $f: M \to N$, $M:= \bigcup_{\alpha < \kappa} M_\alpha$, $N:= \bigcup_{\alpha < \kappa} N_\alpha$, even if we don't assume that the restriction of $f_\beta$ to $M_\alpha$ for $\alpha < \beta$ is equal to $f_\alpha$? 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be Polish spaces and $K$ a Markov kernel from $X$ to $Y$. That is, $K$ is a mapping $X \times \mathcal{B}_Y \rightarrow [0,1]$ (where $\mathcal{B}_Y$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of Borel sets on $Y$) s.t. 

Consider $D$ a set and $X$ a linear space of functions $D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ s.t. for any $f \in X$ and $g: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, if $\lvert g \rvert \leq \lvert f \rvert$ then $g \in X$. Such spaces naturally arise as classes of asymptotic behaviors, for example if $D = \mathbb{N}$ and $h: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we can take $X := \{f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \mid \lvert f \rvert = O(h)\}$. If $D$ has extra structure we can restrict consideration to functions satisfying certain conditions e.g. if $D$ is a topological space we can consider only continuous functions. Is there a name for $X$ like that? 

Fix a ground commutative ring $k$. A coPoisson-bialgebra is a bialgebra $H$ equipped with a linear mapping $\pi:H \rightarrow H \otimes_k H$ s.t. 

Let $M,N$ be transitive models of set theory and $M \subset N$. Assume that in $M$ we prove that there exists an object $X$ that satisfies some set $T$ of first order properties and which is definable from ordinals. (here $T$ means a set of first order formulas with one free variable X in the language of set theory). Does the same conclusion hold in $N$, i.e. does there exist an $Y$ in $N$ satisfying the same properties $T$? Edit: by a proof in M I mean just a fact that is proven about M. 

Given two real closed fields $R_1$ and $R_2$ such that both have cardinality continuum, archimedean, but not necessarily complete. Assume further that they are back and forth equivalent (in the language of rings). Under which conditions can we get that they are isomorphic? Isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$? 

This is a sequel to my previous question with the same title. Let $N:=M[G]$ be the full Solovay model. And let $R$ be an archimedean complete real closed field in $M[G]$ (so $R$ has cardinality $2^{\aleph_0}$ in $M[G]$). Let $X$ be a subset of $R$ (or of $R \times R$) which is definable from a countable sequence of ordinals and $R$ (so $R$ is a parameter in the formula defining $X$). Does is it hold that $X$ has the Baire property in $M[G]$? Edit: In my case, $R \subset HOD$ and $R \subset K \in HOD$ where $K$ is an algebraically closed field, and the field structure on $R$ is induced by that of $K$. Does the result hold in this case? 

The antisymmetry of $\pi$ imposes the following additional condition: Note that $i(X) \hat{\otimes} Y \cong X \otimes Coker \space h_Y$ which follows by observing that $h$ annihilates $i(X) \hat{\otimes} Y$ due to $k[h]$-linearity of $\hat{\otimes}$, applying $Coker \space h$ and using its tensor functor structure We have the short exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow X \xrightarrow{Ker \space h} X[h] \xrightarrow{Coker \space h} X \rightarrow 0$$ We apply $\hat{\otimes} Y[h]$ and use its exactness to get the short exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow X \otimes Y \rightarrow X[h] \hat{\otimes} Y[h] \rightarrow X \otimes Y \rightarrow 0$$ This sequence yields an element $\epsilon(X, Y)$ of $Ext^1(X \otimes Y, X \otimes Y)$ Due to $b$, $\epsilon(X, Y)$ and $\epsilon(Y, X)$ belong to canonically isomorphic spaces. We demand $$\epsilon(X, Y)+\epsilon(Y, X)=0$$ The problem is I need the case in which $\otimes$ is merely right exact. What currently confuses me is that in the bialgebra picture the last sequence is still exact for general $k$ but I can't prove it in the category-theoretic language
