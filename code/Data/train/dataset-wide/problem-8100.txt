(This may sound too simple a question to be asked in MO. But it is a research problem but not an exercise, so I post it here. If it is no appropriate, I will move it to Stackexchange.) Let $0 < a < b$ be real numbers and $p$ a polynomial. The Fourier transforms of $\exp(-ax^2/2)$ and $\exp(-bx^2/2)$ are (up to constant factors) $\exp(-\xi^2/(2a))$ and $\exp(-\xi^2/(2b))$ respectively. The Fourier transform of $p(x) \exp(-ax^2/2)$ is $q(\xi) \exp(-\xi^2/(2a))$ where $q$ is a polynomial of the same degree as $p$'s. Suppose we know that a function $f$ has its Fourier transform $$ \hat{f}(\xi) = \left( q(\xi) e^{-\frac{\xi^2}{2a}} \right) e^{-\frac{\xi^2}{2b}}, $$ then $f$ has a simple expression as the convolution (up to a constant) $$ f(x) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \left( p(y) e^{-\frac{ay^2}{2}} \right) e^{-\frac{b(x - y)^2}{2}} dy. $$ My question is: if a function $g$ has its Fourier transform $$ \hat{g}(\xi) =\left( q(\xi) e^{-\frac{\xi^2}{2a}} \right) e^{\frac{\xi^2}{2b}}, $$ is there a simple formula of $g$ in $p$, analogous to the convolution formula above? A naive extrapolation $$ \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \left( p(y) e^{-\frac{ay^2}{2}} \right) e^{\frac{b(x - y)^2}{2}} dy. $$ does not converge at all. 

No one suggests Weyl's Classical Groups? It was first published in 1939. I don't know if researchers in representation theory and invariant theory value it nowadays, but it is still frequently cited in random matrix literature. 

In Lemma 1.8, "the equation that cut out the cone at the vertex $(c,A(c))$ are $$x_0-A(c)\geq dA(\alpha(\sigma))(x)"$$ should the equations be $$"x_0-A(c)\geq dA(\alpha(\sigma))(x-c)" ????$$ "then the interior normal in the dual space $X^{\ast}_{\mathbb{R}}\oplus\mathbb{R}$ to the corresponding facet is $(1,-dA(\alpha(\sigma)))$", should this be "$(-dA(\alpha(\sigma)),1)$"??? In the same page, "Definition 1.10 We will denote the minimum of the functions $dA\alpha((\sigma))(x)$ in the above lemma by $\eta(x,c)$." Should we define $\eta(x,c)$ to be the maximum of the fuctions $dA\alpha((\sigma))(x)$???? 

The group cohomology of cyclic groups can be computed easily due to the periodity. Now how can one compute the group cohomology $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? As least in some special case, e.g. $M$ has trivial action, or even $M=\mathbb{Z}$? I would like to know the case that $M$ is not $\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, can one compute $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times\cdots\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? 

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of schemes (or algebraic spaces), and $s:Y\rightarrow X$ is a section to $f$, i.e. $fs=1_{Y}$. Question: Is $s$ an (closed) immersion? 

How to determine a functor (natrually arising from geometry or homological algebra) to be locally of finite presentation? Is there any reference for such staff? My example of functors underlying this question is functors of the form $$\mathcal{E}xt^1_S(A,\mathbb{G}_m)$$ for $A$ some group scheme or even some fppf-sheaf of geometric meaning over some base scheme $S$, and $\mathcal{E}xt^1_S(,)$ denotes the 1st fppf extension sheaf in the category of abelian fppf-sheaves over $S$. 

The classical Riemann-Roch theorem for Riemann surfaces makes a connection between the dimension of the space of meromorphic functions and the dimension of the space of meromorphic forms. Thus it is useful for the existence of meromorphic functions on a Riemann surface with prescribed singularities (divisor). By taking differential, a meromorphic function is equivalent to a meromorphic form with vanishing periods, up to a constant, like that $1/z$ is mapped to $z^{-2} dz$. In this sense, Riemann-Roch theorem is a relation between the dimension of meromorphic forms with all periods vanishing and that of arbitrary meromorphic forms. However, the mapping $f \to df$ is not surjective to all meromorphic forms with vanishing periods, but to only the Abelian differentials of the second kind. My question is: Is there a generalized Riemann-Roch theorem, about the relation between the dimension of the space of Abelian differentials of the third kind with all periods vanishing and prescribed singularities, and the dimension of a related space of meromorphic forms? I have a concrete problem in mind: On an elliptic curve, construct a meromorphic form with three singular points and both the two periods vanishing. Around the three singular points, the local behaviours are $(1/z + O(1))dz$, $(-1/z + O(1))dz$ and $(1/z^2 + O(1))dz$. I want to know the existence and uniqueness of the meromorphic form. This question seems not to be a direct consequence of the generalized Riemann-Roch theorem conjured above, but I think they must be related. If you can answer or give a hint to the concrete problem, I also appreciate. 

Given a totally degenerated abelian variety $A_K$ (to make it easier) over a complete discrete valuation field $K$ with $R$, $\pi$ and $k$ the corresponding discrete valuation ring, uniformiser and residue field. Let $S=\mathrm{Spec}R$ and $S_n=\mathrm{Spec} R/(\pi)^{n+1}$. For any $S$-scheme $V$ we denote the scheme $V\times_S S_n$ as $V_n$. In particular, $A_K$ has semistable reduction, $A_K$ extends to a semiabelian scheme $G$ over $S=\mathrm{Spec} R$, and the corresponding Raynaud extension is just a torus $T$ over $S$, analytically $A_K=T_K/Y_K$, and we have a pairing $Y_K\times X_K\rightarrow \mathbb{G}_{m,K}$, where $Y_K$ is the periods lattice and $X$ is the character group of $T$. Moreover, we assume both $X$ and $Y$ (the character group of the Raynaud extension associated to the dual abelian variety $A_K^{\vee}$ which gives $Y_K$) are free $\mathbb{Z}$-modules. Starting from this, we can construction lots of projective models of $A_K$ by using Mumford's construction, see Mumford compositio 1972, Faltings-Chai's book, the 1999 Tohoku paper of Aleexev and Nakamura. Given a nice (being nice see [Mum1973]section 6) $Y_K$-invariant polyhedral decomposition $\Sigma$ of the affine space $E=\mathrm{Hom}(X,\mathbb{Q})$, we can construct a projective model $P_{\Sigma}$ of $A_K$ and cut out the semiabelian scheme $G$ from $P_{\Sigma}$. Over $S_n$ we have group action $G_n\times_{S_n} P_{\Sigma,n}\rightarrow P_{\Sigma,n}$. Now the question is: could we have an action of $G$ on $P_{\Sigma}$ which extends the group operation on $G$ and the actions on the infinitesimal fibres? It seems to me in Aleexev's 2002 Annals paper, the answer is yes, at least for certain canonical models obtained from a given theta divisor of some ample line bundle (since $A_K$ extends to a stable semiabelic scheme over $S$ once you are given a ample line bundle on $A_K$, and being a stable semiabelic scheme implies you have an action on the model, see Theorem 5.7.1 case 2 in that paper), but I couldn't find a concrete argument for this in the paper. Could anyone help me point out where the hidden argument is? Or give me some other reference. I know in dimension $1$ case, the paper by Deligne and Rapoport describes this action in order to define generalised elliptic curves via a different approach (using $\mathrm{Pic}^0$), but seems not easy to generalise to hight dimensional case.
