"Perfectly elastic demand" is not a situation associated with individual consumer demand, it is a concept related to the market demand schedule. And then, it does not describe any rigorous aggregation of individual demands, but instead, it expresses demand as perceived by the firms and is related to firm competition, not consumer preferences: If a firm increases its price it will lose all customers, but because they will shop elsewhere, not because their utility maximization tells them to stop consuming the product. So it does not say that "consumer demand will drop to zero" -it will do so for the specific firm, not for the market. As for decreasing the price, the firm has no reason to do it, since it can sell all the product it can at the going price. 

For $Q_1 = 1, Q_2 =2$, you calculate $$TC(Q_2) - TC(Q_1)=7$$ which is the additional (incremental) cost to produce the second unit of output, and then you compare this to $$\frac {dTC}{dQ} |_{Q=Q_2} = 12$$ which is marginal cost when you are already at production level $Q_2$. From this observation alone, the two are not comparable. As for practical value: assume marginal revenue is a straight line at $P=8$. What to do? The "marginal cost equals marginal revenue" leads to $3Q^2 \leq 8 \implies Q^*= \sqrt {8/3} \approx 1.633$. What's the problem with that? Well, the product we are examining may not be divisible so much as to make incremental cost adequately close to marginal cost. This not-sufficient divisibility may force us to resort to integer-value calculus, and use the concept of incremental cost instead : produce the highest quantity for which incremental cost is lower or equal to incremental revenue - and we will obtain the correct answer $Q^* =2$. Note: "sufficient divisibility" is not a strictly "physical constraint" but is judged also on economic considerations. If we are contemplating producing, say, cars to the range of hundreds of thousands, then, even if each car costs say 20 thousand euros, the pains and computational inconvenience of integer-valued calculus may not worth the small reduction in profits if (by using marginal calculus) we end up producing one unit more than optimal given indivisibility. 

(This ended up being a long post, but I find the approach of the textbook a bit outdated). It is interesting to examine the issue from a (simplistic) game-theoretic point of view. Assume a fixed (no entry) large number $N$ of small identical producers, meaning that the actions of each one individually does not affect the market. The market demand curve and the market supply curve are common knowledge. For next period, the government wants to restrict production below the current market clearing. The government announces that it will pay an amount $T$ to any producer that respects the deal and restrict his production, on top of the revenue he will earn in the market. We assume that each producer has to evaluate the following options: either he conforms with the government plan or he doesn't. In combination with either "all others conform", or "all others do not" (here lies one aspect of simplification). So each individual producer faces four possible future states: 1) All conform 2) He conforms while the rest don't 3) He doesn't conform while all others do 4) Nobody conforms. The motive to not conform comes from the fact that if he alone does not conform, the market price won't be affected, because he is "small". First, a diagram: 

No contradiction. All points in the AC curve indeed reflect the production of the corresponding quantity at minimum cost. This is conditional efficiency, conditional on arbitrarily specifying an output level. Then we ask: what is the output level for which this product is produced at an average cost that it is lower than the average cost for all other output levels, the minimum minimorun, the least of all minima? And we get the minimum of the Average Cost curve. At this output level we cannot do better by varying the quantity (either increase it or decrease it). So it is this quantity that achieves "universal" efficiency. 

Hmm, but in what way? Elsberg paradox is not like other related paradoxes surrounding Expected Utility theory, (like Allais' or Machina's). In the Elsberg paradox something is missing from the framework into which Expected Utility theory confines itself: there are unknown probabilities, or "Knightian Uncertainty" -and Expected Utility theory is not constructed to operate in such an environment. But then, Expected Utility theory is not refuted by the Ellsberg Paradox. What the paradox does, is bringing to our attention that there exist real-world situations where Expected Utility is inapplicable. I.e. it cannot be a universal theory. But that should not be surprising: what theory in Social Sciences holds universally through space and time? The value of the Ellsberg paradox is that it presses us to modify Expected Utility theory, or come up with some complementary theory to handle cases where there exists "Knightian Uncertainty", and decision makers neither know the actual probabilities nor do they form subjective probabilities -but they decide in ways we have yet to fully understand how to model (although "ambiguity aversion", which is the predominant way to rationalize the Ellsberg Paradox has by now been formalized to a large degree). 

If you are looking to understand how Econometrics are and should be grounded in Statistics, read Aris Spanos "Probability Theory and Statistical Inference: Econometric Modeling with Observational Data". Be prepared for a bit of a shock. As for Mathematical Statistics, they are a difficult subject, and there is no magical textbook that has ever succeeded in making them "accessible". 

An axis is characterized not by the variable it measures, but by the unit of measurement. So an axis can measure any number of variables, as long as they are measured in the same measurement unit. In your case, the unit of measurement is "units of output", and both $(n+\delta)k$ and $sf(k)$ are measured in it (capital is measured in units of output, in case you wonder). 

You are asking about the expected value of the leading term of a sequence. There can be no general answer given the assumptions you make, since for example $$x_{t+1} = x_{t} + v_{t+1}, \;\;\;E(v_{t+1}) = 0,\;\;\; x_0 \;\; \text{given}$$ is a unit root process, and its expected value is equal to $E(x_{t+1})=x_0,\;\;\; \forall t$, while $$x_{t+1} = a +x_{t} + v_{t+1}, \;\;\;E(v_{t+1}) = 0,\;\;\; x_0 \;\; \text{given}$$ is also a unit-root process, but $E(x_{t+1}) = x_0 + a\cdot(t+1)$ which is very different compared to the previous case. 

They then move on to a detailed study of many of all the above indices, and they conclude (they have also conveniently summarized qualitative assessments of each index in tables): 

As the OP noted in a comment, Theorem 1 in section 12 of Kolomogorov and Fomin's Calculus of Variations seems to provide some comfort that we can indeed use the Langrange Multiplier method when the number of our variables is infinite. Still, the authors do that in a footnote, writing "the reader will easily recognize the analogy with Langrange multipliers". So no, this does not rigorously show what we want. I think that what we need is a paper like Craven, B. D. (1970). A generalization of Lagrange multipliers. Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society, 3(03), 353-362. which in its summary writes: 

It is important to note that the OP uses a general form of a utility function, where utility is not necessarily separable per period. But in such a general setting, $MU_t$ is not "marginal utility", but only the partial derivative of $u(c_t, c_{t+1})$ with respect to $c_t$. "Marginal utility" is a concept suited for a uni-variate utility function. So it is more accurate to write the optimal relationship as $$\frac{1}{1+r_{t+1}}\frac {\partial u(c_t, c_{t+1})}{\partial c_t} = \frac {\partial u(c_t, c_{t+1})}{\partial c_{t+1}}$$ Indeed, it appears that we are "discounting" the effect of the present, rather than that of the future. But it perhaps becomes more clear if we view it not as dividing the "present" by a discount factor, but rather as multiplying it by the relative price between present and future: We can "buy" one unit of future consumption by trading only $1/(1+r_{t+1})$ units of current consumption (i.e. by saving $1/(1+r_{t+1})$ amount now and obtain $1$ unit tomorrow). So by multiplying the "effect of the present on utility" by $[1/(1+r_{t+1})]$, we express it in terms of the future. 

No. $\mu$ can be thought of as the shadow price of natural resources. Being a "price", it has to be non-negative. Note that if we set $\mu=0$ the problem reverts back to the standard model, which has an intuitive explanation: if "we don't care" about natural resources, their "price" is zero. To see this from another route, for the standard CRRA utility function $$u(c) = \frac {c^{1-\theta}-1}{1-\theta}$$ we would get $$\frac {\dot c}{c} = \frac{1}{\theta}[A-\rho] - \frac{1}{\theta}\frac{\mu}{\lambda}\gamma A$$ So if $\mu <0$ we would obtain a higher consumption growth rate, which doesn't sound very plausible if by $\mu <0$ we would want to express that "we care" about natural resources and so we would lower capital accumulation that hurts them, and consequently lower the consumption growth rate. 

The basic thing that this scenario says is that capacity/supply was below demand, in the sense that the customers would want to be serviced earlier than they did. And whatever the switching costs, by revealed preference it appears these costs were lower than the monetary value of extra utility gained by consumers because now they are serviced earlier. So no, we cannot say that switching costs are low, only that they are lower than the value to be serviced earlier. 

Before intuition. let's determine the outcome. By the Uncovered Interest Rate Parity $$ i_t = i^*_t - [s^e_{t+1 | t} - s_t] \tag{1}$$ where $i_t$ is domestic nominal interest rate, $i^*_t$ is "foreign" nominal interest rate, and $[s^e_{t+1} - s_t]$ is expected appreciation of domestic currency in percentage terms ($s$ is the natural logarithm of "foreign currency per unit of domestic currency" exchange rate). The "Fisher equation" for the relation between real and nominal interest rate in expected inflation is $$i_t = r_t + \pi^e_{t+1|t} \tag{2}$$ where $r_t$ is domestic real interest rate, and $\pi^e_{t+1}$ is expected domestic inflation. Putting $(1)$ and $(2)$ side-by side we have $$r_t + \pi^e_{t+1|t} = i^*_t - [s^e_{t+1|t} - s_t]$$ Assuming that there are no real effects by an inflation shock, and that the international economy couldn't care less (so also $i^*_t$ remains unaffected), using the change operator we have $$\Delta \pi^e_{t+1|t} = \Delta (s_t-s^e_{t+1|t}) \tag{3}$$ where now the right-hand side represents "change in expected depreciation" of the domestic currency (note that the right hand side may be algebraically negative in which case it is "negative depreciation" = appreciation). Now, it is reasonable to argue that expectations for tomorrow will take into account what happens today. Moreover, usually current inflation shocks either affect in the same direction expectations about future inflation, or not at all. So an inflation shock happens in period $t$ which increases the left-hand side of $(3)$. Then so must also increase its right-hand: a domestic positive inflation shock increases expected depreciation of the domestic currency. In other words it creates expectation of currency devaluation. The currency may still be expected to appreciate, but less than before the inflation shock. Mathematically this can come about in different ways but realistically one should expect that what will happen is that $s^e_{t+1|t}$ will go down, i.e. that the domestic currency will be expected to devalue. The main intuition behind this comes if one realizes that, for the people abroad, domestic currency is just another product, that has a price. If due to inflation this "product" is worth less (because now it can buy less of utility-enhancing or productive goods), this should be reflected in its price, which is the domestic exchange rate $s$ (price of domestic currency measured in units of foreign currency), which should get lower. This is the rationale also behind the closely linked "purchasing power parity". Of course, this is a highly stylized analysis and all sorts of real-world imperfections and rigidities will affect what will actually happen. But the tendency is the one described above.
