I have got a barometer in my hall (it's supposed to predict the weather). Sure does move about a lot. You know that of course. So the answer to your question is "YES" , in fact any change in the composition of a gas mixture is likely to change its pressure (other things being equal), but the effect will be small as the other 999,600 ppm of other stuff has a rather bigger effect BUT even if the effect was a 1 or 2% change I doubt you could confirm it by measurement as the normal variation in barometric pressure day to day and hour to hour will rather swamp it. 

I think this is it: ppm(mol)=ppm(v) x (density CO2/density total atmos) x (Molecular Weight total atmos/Molecular Weight CO2)​​​​. Try some number crunching to see if that makes sense. 

I am restricting my consideration, for the moment, to just the troposphere. With regard to our understanding of the GHE do we predict that an increased GHE due to increasing CO2/Water/Methane will change the lapse rate postively or negatively? The dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR), according to my old text books, is easily calculated from the formulae -g/c, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and c is the specific heat capacity of the atmosphere. This is supposed to be a general formulae that can be applied to any planet with a solid surface and a gaseous atmosphere. So for earth is the formulae now -g/c + (GHE) or is it -g/c - (GHE)? The bracketed GHE term being specific to the atmosphere of a specific composition, e.g. including 400ppm CO2. The second part of the question then , after we have the correct sign, is how is the term (GHE) expected to vary as the CO2 (or other greenhouse gas) concentrations vary? 

I answered this question on SustainableLiving.SE. Since no one voted to close this as off-topic, I'll link and summarize my answer here. I'm glad you asked for it by calorie, since answers on that question had found the data by kilogram, which is not a particularly useful measure. The data source for carbon per kilogram is the Meat Eater's Guide from the Climate Working Group (I believe this is the same as the website you linked, as well); I did the kilogram to calorie calculations from nutritiondata.self.com which gets its numbers from the FDA. You can read my entire answer, but I will copy the data table for your convenience. Units are kg carbon per 1000 calories. 

I have been reading a lot recently about agriculture in Africa, and one of the big impediments in a lot of places is the poor quality of the soil. Primarily this refers to a lack of usable molecular nutrients in the soil that plants need (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium, primarily). I understand there are a few different methods of soil enrichment; however, these processes are geological in nature. All of the high-population density subsistence agricultural parts of the wet-and-dry tropics are directly correlated to soils that are enriched by one or more of these mechanisms. The first mechanism is direct deposition of nutrients by volcanism from the last hundred million years or so. This is the mechanism responsible for high population densities around the East African rift, Indonesia, Ethiopia, southern India and the Phillipines. The next mechanism is flood plain deposition of eroded materials from somewhere upstream. This is responsible for fertile, high density regions like north India, Egypt, Nigeria, and most of Southeast Asia. These areas have high population densities (of subsistence farmers) other ares in the tropics have very low densities (northern Australia, most of the Sahel, most of southern Africa). In the temperate regions, however, there is a biological means for creating fertile soils. The plains of the American Midwest or Ukraine have had neither recent volcanism nor extensive floodplains, yet are covered in rich, black chernozem soils. Evidently, these soils are produced by the deposition and incomplete decay (due to hard winters) of grasses. Is there a biological process that can create rich agricultural soils in either the wet-and-dry tropics? EDIT - Despite the introduction, the purpose of this post is not about agriculture, or what we could do today to to rejuvenate poor soils. This is about natural processes that would take place on timescales of tens or hundreds of thousands of years, or longer. 

Another way of looking at the question: I take 2 standard wheelbarrows of bits of plants from my garden. One wheelbarrow is used to fill the compost bin. The other goes to the bonfire. How much ash do I have from burning compared to how much compost from the compost bin. Any gardener will know that the amount of compost will be much larger than the amount of ash. So now we need to compare the chemical composition of the ash with that of the compost. For Wood Ash there are quite a few research articles. Most of the carbon atoms in wood ash will be in the form of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3). Percentage in the ash will vary widely but lets take a median of 50%. Ash as a percentage of original organic matter will be maybe of the order of 8% by weight. For an original 100kg of organic matter (yes, its a big wheelbarrow) we would have 8kg of ash. In this ash would be 4kg of CaCO3. The carbon atoms would be 12% of that (relative atomic masses). So 100kg of organic bits gives you 0.48kg of carbon atoms left in the ash when you burn it. There seems to be fewer research articles on composting but we found the following approximations. For 100kg of organic matter there will be about 9% organic carbon (9kg). Composting will turn 100kg of raw material into around 30kg of compost in which the organic carbon content will be around 25% ( 7.5kg of carbon). These figures are median "pot luck selection" as results can vary widely. We can however see that composting retains massively more (7.5kg) of carbon atoms compared with burning (0.48kg). The difference will be in the atmosphere. 

The specific 36 F temperature anomaly in the linked article points to a single day event. I am aware that it is associated with unusually high temperatures in general this fall/winter, but a single day event is not that unusual. For example, the average January temperature in Dallas is 46 F, and the average monthly high is 76 F. That means every year (on average) sees a temperature that is 30 F above normal. The record high in January is 88 F, meaning that at least once, the temperatures in Dallas were 42 F above normal. That was all the way back in 1969. While this doesn't look great for the polar bears, and is further confirmation that AGW is coming along nicely, I would caution against getting too upset about it in the short term. We aren't out of time yet. After all, the world didn't end after that record January heat in 1969. 

Reality is not as simple as your thought experiment The problem with your thought experiment is that, even though you are holding sunlight intensity identical between your two planets, there are too many factors that actually affect the planet's temperature for any one measurement to give you conclusive proof of the greenhouse effect. There are two primary factors affecting the planet's temperature, given constant sunlight energy: 

Depends on what type of pollution you are talking about Moreno et al., 2015 studied this problem in Barcelona, and compared Metro (subway) to trams, buses, and walking in various parts of the city. There is a massive overabundance of data in this paper that mostly speaks for itself, but let me summarize. The subway was in first place or last place in most measures; it was the only system that didn't occupy the environment of the city streets. So these comparisons are probably exactly what you are looking for. Subway air had the lowest count of particulate matter, and the highest modal particle size; both of these are good. However, at the same time, the PM$_{2.5}$ (fine particulates which are particularly dangerous carcinogens) for subway and bus were notably higher than for tram and walking. The black carbon levels were in the middle of the road; lower than for pedestrians but higher than bus or tram. However, the authors note that black carbon may have been overestimated for the subways; so these levels could have been lower. Carbon monoxide is largely related to combustion engine usage; CO levels were lowest on the electric trams, and higher on the other modes of transportation. Carbon Dioxide, on the other hand, is largely related to other passengers breathing; CO$_2$ was highest on the crowded vehicles and much lower for pedestrians. CO$_2$, unlike the others, I don't think is a chronic health risk at the observed concentrations. Conclusion There is a lot of information in that paper, and I am not really qualified to judge the health risks from one factor against another. I can note that in no health measures does the subway have the worst air quality between the four transportation modes; and there is no other mode that has better air quality than the subway in all measures. I suppose it is safest to say that, in a statistical sense across multiple measures, the subway air is not significantly more unhealthy than street level air. 

At the instant any atom of carbon is taken out of the atmosphere by a plant or animal and incorporated into its structure then that atom is "off the list" as it were with respect to having an effect in the atmosphere. Once in the animal/plant it may be there for eons until it becomes oil, coal,or whatever. So it is not the ultra slow conversion of organic matter to hydrocarbons that is relevant but the amount taken up by living matter on a daily basis which is sequestered into its structure. Looking at the historical record we would therefore need to think about the amount of animal and plant activity on the planet and, to some extent, its type. This is quite difficult as we only have proxy records. however as we know that CO2 is effectively plant food it seems reasonable to assume that if the proxy record shows high levels of atmospheric CO2 we might expect that fairly quickly, a few year/decade timescale, that plant life on earth would respond quickly and become very lush indeed. This is of course only one factor with respect to CO2. Past volcanic activity is likely to also be relevant. 

Climate science is a very exciting field to get into right now. Not only do we have a change at the top in politics in the USA and the prospect of big changes there but the new theory of a Gravity Induced Temperature Gradient is coming to the fore. I recommend researching and reading about both sides of the debate, not just the CAGW theory stuff. If the ideas of Loschmidt (c.1870's) and the recent experimental results of R.Graeff (2007) take precedence over the current consensus theories then there will be great opportunities opening up in this field for those with the right knowledge and background. Good luck with it ! 

The 1967 International Biological Programme has a handbook of suggestions for various methods to calculate primary productivity of forests. A subset of these measures would be effective for measuring litter production. Regarding leaves and other falling litter, 

The Northeast monsoon is different. From Rajeevan et al, 2012 the NEMR (North East Monsoon Rainfall) peaks in the evening for most of Tamil Nadu but the coast facing the Bay of Bengal (including Chennai) peaks in early morning (0330-0630): 

Part a. of the table is kinetic energy, and part b. is potential energy. For the earthquake with parameters in Table 2, released kinetic energy is about $3\times10^{14}\text{ J}$, with about the same going into potential energy of the wave. I couldn't find any reliable sources of equating energy release with earthquake magnitude, but according to Wikipedia, $3\times10^{14}\text{ J}$ is equivalent to about a 6.6 earthquake. Take that for what its worth, I was just trying to get a sense of how powerful the earthquake causing the tsunami in question would be. From here lets see what happens if all that energy (kinetic and potential) is converted to thermal energy. To warm up water noticably, lets say we want a $5\unicode{x2103}$ increase. The specific heat of seawater is $3985 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}\cdot\text{C}}$, and the density is $1025\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}$. Therefore the energy released from this tsunami can heat up $$ \frac{6\times10^{14}\text{ J}\cdot 5\unicode{x2103}}{3985 \frac{\text{J}}{\text{kg}\cdot\text{C}}} = 7.5\times10^{11} \text{kg of water} \cdot \frac{1}{1025\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}} = 7.3 \times10^{8} \text{m}^3 $$ of water. The last question is: is this enough? Well, sort of. Since the energy is radiated in all directions, at a distance of 200 km, the tsunami wavefront has a circumference of $2\cdot \pi\cdot200 = 1257 \text{km}$ so each meter of wavefront corresponds to 580 m$^3$ of heated water. This operates under the assumption that all energy is converted to heat, and that all the tsunami's heat is concentrated in one 580 m$^3$ water slug for ever meter of wavefront at 200 km away. While these assumptions are not perfect, I think a lot depends on the way the wave breaks. If it breaks suddenly (i.e. a suddenly rise from deep water to shallow), you might see a more concentrated conversion of kinetic energy to heat. And 580 m$^3$ is a pretty big mass of water; that would correspond to the heated section of the wavefront being an expanding ring 100m wide and 5.8m deep at 200km distance. So what I conclude from this thought experiment is that it is plausible that a tsunami from a mid-size earthquake could cause the water hitting the beach to heat up several degrees, given that the wave doesn't travel too far, and that it breaks in the right way (whatever that right way is). Regarding Samoa, the earthquake at 7.9 put out more energy than we are dealing with here, and Samoa is about 200km from the Tonga trench (though I don't know where in the trench the quake actually took place), so I'll file the hot tsunami theory under plausible. 

The answer, as already given is "By radiation" . But comments and other answer detail have added extra information which can be useful in understanding this in the wider context, particularly relating to arguments about the Earth's energy budget and climate change. Here is some other extra stuff to consider; We pose the same question for the planet Venus. Venus has an atmosphere composed of nearly pure CO2 (actually about 96.5%). The surface temperature on Venus is around 750K at the equator when facing the sun and drops by a mere 5K overnight. Night and day are about 120 earth days in length so that's a pretty slow axial rotation and a very slow loss of surface heat during the planet's night. Now the atmosphere on Venus is very thick, masses of that lovely CO2, and surface pressure is about 90 times that of earth (9.2MPa). If you calculate the optical attenuation of the atmosphere to incoming solar radiation then the solar flux at the surface is a mere 4W per sq m. It is therefore self evident with such a low solar flux at the surface that the direct radiation from the sun cannot warm the surface to 750K. It is therefore interesting to draw some energy flux diagrams (similar to the Trenberth ones for the earth) and calculate the source of all that extra heat warming the surface. Don't forget to draw 2 diagrams, one for night and one for day to check you understand how a pure CO2 atmosphere works. This is a great exercise for school students (and anybody else) interested in the greenhouse effect of CO2.
