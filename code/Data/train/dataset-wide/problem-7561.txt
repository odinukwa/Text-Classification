A couple of things (I meant to just have this as a comment but it got too long): I think with regard to the first fact, a lot of people realised it all around the same time -- the article by Springer which Ben mentions does all the calculations needed, as he says, but doesn't state the result, while an article not long after by Lusztig and Vogan in 1983 states the result at the end, and it's mentioned elsewhere in the literature that Brylinski also proved it (and I can't believe Beilinson and Bernstein didn't know also). It's now, however, textbook stuff thanks to the book by Hotta Tanisaki and Takeuchi. As to the second, I think Ben is overcomplicating things a little. If I say B-equivariant perverse sheaves, that will force the $\mathfrak h$-semisimplicity, which is what you need e beyond say the equivalence which is proved in the paper of Kashiwara-Brylinski. Of course Ben is right to point out that more care needs to be taken with the derived categories, but there are other references for that -- e.g. Bernstein and Lunts paper. The other classic reference that should be mentioned here is the paper of Beilinson and Bernstein on the Jantzen filtration, which discusses a lot of the issues related to central characters (e.g. considering the centre acting trivially or nilpotently etc.) 

The isn't true: there's a theorem of Stafford which says that any left ideal in the Weyl algebra is generated by two elements so if your claim was true, then the singular support would have to have dimension at least 2n-2 always, which of course isn't the case if n>2. 

Here's an answer which I learned from Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson's paper on equivariant cohomology and Koszul duality: they use some notion of geometric chain which is probably something like subanalytic chains, but anyway, the idea is as follows. Suppose $G$ is a compact Lie group of dimension d. An abstract equivariant $k$-chain $c$ is a $(k+d)$-dimensional chain in some $\mathbb R^n$ (or perhaps it's better to say $\mathbb R^\infty$) equipped with a free action of $G$. Then if $X$ is a $G$-space, an equivariant chain in $X$ is a $K$-equivariant map from an abstract chain to $X$. You can obviously form a chain complex out of these things, and the result gives you the equivariant cohomology of $X$ (in the Borel construction say). 

The basis $\dot{B}$ is usually hard to compute, in the same way the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis for the Hecke algebra is. On the other hand, at least for type A, there is another way to get at this basis via what you might call "quantum Schur-Weyl duality": there's a geometric construction of finite dimensional quotients of the quantum group of type sl_n due to Beilinson-Lusztig-MacPherson, each of which has a canonical basis. More recent work of Lusztig, Ginzburg and Schiffmann-Vasserot showed that these finite dimensional quotients could be put into a compatible family, from which you can recover the whole modified quantum group, and it's canonical basis. How much more explicit this realization is probably depends on what sort of question you're interested in I imagine. With regard to the crystal structure, there's a paper of Kashiwara "Crystal bases of modified quantized enveloping algebras" in Duke which studies this. He shows that the crystal structure reflects the $B\times X\times B$ parametrization you mention, and investigates a crystal basis of a "dual algebra" (a kind of quantum coordinate algebra) for which the crystal structure is a kind of Peter-Weyl theorem (at least for the finite type case). Lusztig investigates something similar in his book. 

Let $(\mathcal A,\mu)$ be an associative algebra. According to usual deformation theory, deformations of $(\mathcal A,\mu)$ as an associative algebra are controlled by a differential graded algebra (DGLA). The latter is known as the Hochschild DGLA $(H(\mathcal A),\delta_\mu,[\cdot,\cdot]_G)$ where: -$H(\mathcal A)$ is the Hochschild graded vector space (where $H(\mathcal A)^i:=Hom(\mathcal A^{\otimes i+1},\mathcal A)$). -$\delta_\mu$ is the Hochschild differential. -$[\cdot,\cdot]_G$ is the Gerstenhaber bracket. Note that the Hochschild operator is nilpotent and compatible with the Gerstenhaber bracket only if $\mu$ is associative. Explicitly, a deformation $\star$ of $\mu\in H^{1}(\mathcal A)$ is a formal power series: $\star=\mu+\epsilon x^{(1)}+\epsilon^2 x^{(2)}+\cdots$ where $x^{(i)}\in H^{1}(\mathcal A)$ such that $x:=\epsilon x^{(1)}+\epsilon^2 x^{(2)}+\cdots$ satisfies the Maurer-Cartan equation: $$\delta_\mu x+\frac12[x,x]_G=0$$ thus ensuring the associativity of $\star$. There is furthermore a natural notion of equivalence between deformations given by the following equivalence relation: Two deformations $\star',\star$ of $\mu$ are said equivalent if there exists a formal power series: $\phi:=Id+\epsilon\phi^{(1)}+\epsilon^2\phi^{(2)}$ with $\phi^{(i)}\in H^0(\mathcal A)$ such that: $$\phi(f\star' g)=\phi(f)\star\phi(g) \text{ for all }f,g\in\mathcal A.$$ This notion of equivalence is also in some sense "controlled by" the Hochschild DGLA as the preceding relation can be expanded in powers of $\epsilon$ and formulated in terms of the Hochschild differential and the Gerstenhaber bracket. For example, the first order in $\epsilon$ reads: $x'^{(1)}-x^{(1)}=\delta_\mu\phi^{(1)}$. This is useful for classifying inequivalent deformations using the cohomology of the Hochschild differential. For example, if two deformations of $\mu$ are equivalent up to order $r$ in $\epsilon$, the obstruction for them to be equivalent up to order $r+1$ lies in the first Hoschild cohomology group. Let us now consider classifying deformations of a non-associative algebra $(V,\lambda)$. Naively, this problem seems trivial as there is no quadratic defining relation to inforce (as the vanishing of the associator in the associative case or of the Jacobiator in the Lie algebra case), so that any formal power series $\star=\lambda+\epsilon x^{(1)}+\epsilon^2 x^{(2)}+\cdots$ would qualify as a deformation of $\lambda$ (without any further relation on the $x$'s). In other words, since there is no quadratic relation, there is no DGLA controlling this deformation problem. However, as in the associative case, there is a natural notion of equivalence relation between deformations given similarly by: Two deformations $\star',\star$ of $\lambda$ are said equivalent if there exists a formal power series: $\phi:=Id+\epsilon\phi^{(1)}+\epsilon^2\phi^{(2)}$ with $\phi^{(i)}\in H^0(V)$ such that: $$\phi(f\star' g)=\phi(f)\star\phi(g) \text{ for all }f,g\in V.$$ As this notion of equivalence is the same as in the associative case, it must be in the same sense "controlled by" the Hochschild DGLA associated to $\lambda$. However, the non-associativity of $\lambda$ prevents $(H(V),\delta_\lambda,[\cdot,\cdot]_G)$ to be a DGLA. Question:Is there a relevant algebraic structure for classifying inequivalent deformations of non-associative algebras? 

Let $(V,\cdot)$ be an associative algebra and $W$ be a vector space endowed with a bimodule structure $\triangleright:V\otimes W\to W$ and $\triangleleft:W\otimes V\to W$ such that the following relations hold: $(f\cdot g)\cdot h=f\cdot (g\cdot h)$ $(f\cdot g)\triangleright X=f\triangleright(g\triangleright X)$ $X\triangleleft(f\cdot g)=(X\triangleleft f)\triangleleft g$ $(f \triangleright X)\triangleleft g=f \triangleright(X \triangleleft g)$. One defines the associated Hochshild differential $\delta:H^i(V,W)\to H^{i+1}(V,W)$ where $H^i(V,W):=Hom(V^{\otimes i+1},W)$ as: $ \delta\Phi(a_0,\ldots,a_{i+1}):=(-1)^i a_0\triangleright\Phi(a_1,\ldots, a_{i+1})$ $-(-1)^i\underset{k,l\geqslant 0}{\sum_{k+l=i}}(-1)^{k}\,\Phi(a_0,\ldots,a_{k-1}\cdot a_k,\ldots,a_{i+1})+\Phi(a_0,\ldots,a_{i})\triangleleft a_{i+1}$. for all $\Phi\in H^i(V,W)$, $a_i\in V$. Question: Whenever $W=V$ and $\triangleright=\triangleleft=\cdot$, the differential on $H(V,V)$ can be extended to a differential graded Lie algebra by defining the Gerstenhaber bracket, for which the Hochschild differential is a derivation. Can one generalise this construction for an arbitrary bimodule $W$ and define a graded Lie bracket on $H(V,W)$ such that the Hochschild differential is a derivation thereof?
