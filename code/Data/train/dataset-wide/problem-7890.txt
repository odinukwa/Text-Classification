The density Hales-Jewett theorem implies that there cannot exist perfect magic hypercubes of fixed side length $k$ and arbitrarily high dimension $n$ whose cells are filled with the consecutive numbers $1,2,\dots,k^n$ and for which the numbers in cells along any geometric line sum to the magic constant $\frac{k(k^n+1)}{2}$. For, take the cells with numbers $ 1,2,\dots,\left\lfloor\frac{k^n}{2}\right\rfloor $. This always has density about $1/2$, and so by the density Hales-Jewett theorem, will contain a hyperline for sufficiently large $n$. But no $k$ numbers from this set of density about $1/2$ can ever sum to the magic constant. 

If one writes the real number $x$ as $$ x=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{a_m}{m!} $$ where $a_m\in \mathbb{Z}$, so that for each $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, $n>0$, one can write $$ x=\frac{c_n}{n!} + \sum_{m=n+1}^{\infty}\frac{a_m}{m!} $$ for some $c_n\in \mathbb{Z}$, perhaps one can try to control the $a_m$ so that $$ \sum_{m=n+1}^{\infty}\frac{a_m}{m!} < \frac{1}{n!} $$ for all $n$? 

Update. A MathOverflow fellow just emailed me expressing his interest in conducting some statistical research on MathSciNet and MathOverflow databases. He asked whether I know how to get access to the corresponding background data, which I actually don't. I am not even sure if it is publicly accessible or free (particularly in the case of MathSciNet and Arxiv). I also suspect that there must be some non-disclosure rules and restrictions which any corresponding research along these lines should follow. It would be nice if somebody who knows how to get access to the raw material needed for any research concerning these databases, sheds some light on these issues. 

Remark 2. Potentially, one may find some questions, related to the possible number/behavior of wild knots of the certain knot invariant (such as bridge, unknotting, stick numbers, etc.) in a forcing extension, interesting. However, for the sake of this question, I preferred to stick to a very specific one concerning crossing number. Please feel free to share your thoughts about other possibly interesting problems along these lines in the comments below. 

Nice question! Maybe Jacobsthal's function might interest you. If the $a_i$s are all distinct primes, and the $A_i$s are the non-zero residue classes modulo the $a_i$s, the best known bounds for Jacobsthal's function, due to Iwaniec and Vaughan, will definitely help your $k$-variate case. The relevant publications are: H. Iwaniec, On the error term in the linear sieve, Acta Arithmetica 19 (1971), 1--30. R. C. Vaughan, On the order of magnitude of Jacobsthal's function, Proc. Edinburgh Math. Soc. 20 (1976-7), 329--331. 

I hope this could be relevant to your nice question. There is a paper by K. Williams where a Mertens' type theorem for arithmetic progressions was proved, K. Williams, Mertens' Theorem for Arithmetic Progressions, J. Number Theory 6 (1974) 353--359. In this paper, the relation $$ \sum_{\chi \bmod q}\chi(p)\bar{\chi}(a) = \begin{cases} \varphi(q), & p \equiv a \bmod q, \\ & \\ 0, & \mbox{otherwise.} \end{cases} $$ for Dirichlet characters is used to derive an expression for $$ \prod_{\substack{p \leq x\\p \equiv a \bmod q}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right). $$ Letting $G$ be the Galois group of $K/\mathbb{Q}$, $C_G(g)$ be the centralizer of $g$ in $G$, $\mathcal{C}(g)$ the set of conjugates of $g$ in $G$, $\sigma_p$ the Frobenius element of $p$, the Schur orthogonality relations $$ \sum_{\chi}\chi(\sigma_p)\overline{\chi(g)} = \begin{cases} \left| C_G(\sigma_p)\right| = \frac{|G|}{|\mathcal{C}(\sigma_p)|}, & \sigma_p, g \mbox{ are conjugate}, \\ & \\ 0, & \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases} $$ where the sum is over all irreducible characters $\chi$ of $G$, can be used in a similar way to derive a formula for the partial Euler product in your nice question by writing, for some fixed $g\in G$, $$ \prod_{\substack{p\\\sigma_p \in \mathcal{C}(g)}}(1-p^{-s})^{-C_G(g)} = \prod_{\chi}\left(\prod_{p}\left(1-p^{-s}\right)^{-\chi(p)}\right)^{\overline{\chi(g)}} $$ where the $\chi$ are irreducible characters of $G$. In the mentioned paper, where the $\chi$ are Dirichlet characters, Williams wrote $$ \prod_{p \leq x}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)^{\chi(p)} = \left(\frac{1}{L(1,\chi)}+O(1/\log x)\right)\left(K(1,\chi)+O(1/x)\right) $$ where $K(1,\chi)$ had some properties that could be stated in the paper. Hence in the case of the product in your nice question, maybe something can be worked out along such lines too. I guess it's more complicated as there are now Artin L-functions. 

In order to answer the above question one may need to figure out the distribution of hyperprime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ which in the case of usual prime numbers is given by Prime Number Theorem that provides the $\frac{k}{ln(k)}$ estimation for the number of $2$-hyperprime numbers in the interval $[1, k]$. 

Remark. Following Joel's comment below, it is worth mentioning that the above definition is NOT the only variant of fast function forcing. There are other versions with slightly different properties. For a more complete argument along these lines see Joel's answer in this MO post. On one hand, preserving Shelah cardinals through lifting arguments often needs dominating the corresponding functions $f:\kappa\rightarrow \kappa$ by functions in the ground model. On the other hand, we know that the fast function forcing $\mathbb{P}_{\kappa}$ adds a very fast (and so non-dominatable) function of this type into the universe (i.e. the fast function) and simultaneously fails to satisfy $\kappa$-cc property which is a usual condition for providing dominating functions in the ground model. 

Not really sure if this should count, but: From Chebyshev's proof using the central binomial coefficient that there exists some constant $C>0$ such that $$ \pi(x) < C\frac{x}{\log x} $$ for sufficiently large $x$, and from the infinitude of primes, we get that $$ \log x \ll x. $$ 

Here's an attempt to say something about your nice question. It surely follows from Igor Rivin's nice sketch and the Math Overflow question he linked to. Fix $r$. The quantity $E_r(x)$ in the edited question satisfies $$ E_r(x)\gg \sum_{\substack{m \leq x \\ \omega(m)=r\\ \mu(m)^2=1\\p|m \Rightarrow p \equiv 2 \bmod 3}}\sum_{\substack{n \leq x/m\\ \mu(n)^2=1\\p|n \Rightarrow p\equiv 1 \bmod 3}}1. $$ The inner sum in the above, by what you wrote about $E_0(x)$, satisfies $$ \sum_{\substack{n \leq x/m\\ \mu(n)^2=1\\p|n \Rightarrow p\equiv 1 \bmod 3}}1 \gg \frac{x}{m(\log x)^{1/2}}. $$ By induction on $r$, say, and using $\sum_{\substack{p \leq x\\p \equiv 2 \bmod 3}}\frac{1}{p}\gg \log\log x$, one has $$ \sum_{\substack{m \leq x \\ \omega(m)=r\\ \mu(m)^2=1\\p|m \Rightarrow p \equiv 2 \bmod 3}}\frac{1}{m}\gg (\log\log x)^r. $$ So one has $$ E_r(x) \gg \frac{x(\log\log x)^r}{(\log x)^{1/2}} $$ where the implied constant depends on $r$. 

The present post is intended to tackle the possible interactions of two bizarre realms of extremely large and extremely small creatures, namely large cardinals and quantum physics. Maybe after all those paradoxes and uncertainty phenomena among weird tiny particles, which follow their own weird quantum logic, and after all those controversies surrounding the right interpretation of what is going on in the sub-atomic universe, the last straw that would break the camel's back could be the discovery of a series of statements in quantum theory which are independent or have large cardinal strength set theoretically. The fact that will send such physical statements beyond the realm in which the so-called usual mathematical tools can afford us a solution. Not to mention that inspired by Hilbert's sixth problem and Godel's incompleteness theorems, some prominent physicists already brought up discussions concerning the possibility of obtaining independence results or existence of undecidable facts/theories in physics. In this direction see Stephen Hawking's lecture, Godel and the end of universe. [The corresponding post on MSE might be of some interest as well]. Anyway the bad (good?) news is that the intersection of large cardinal theory and quantum physics is non-empty (if not potentially large). For example one may consider the following theorem of Farah and Magidor in the Independence of the existence of Pitowsky spin models which contains an assumption of consistency strength of measurable cardinals. [cf. R. Solovay, Real-valued measurable cardinals, Axiomatic Set Theory, 1971.] 

Nice question! For a point of view from the perspective of Goldbach's conjecture, perhaps one can consider also Theorem 3.7 of "The Hardy-Littlewood Method", 2nd edition, by R.C. Vaughan. 

Just a two cents worth here. :) Chess itself might perhaps not be too mathematical, but the chess evaluation functions of any chess-playing computer program seems like a mathematical object. After all, these are maps from the set of chess positions to $\mathbb{R}$ and they are bound to satisfy various properties. Given any two chess programs that are both strong and might be expected to be decent (in terms of current technology) approximations to objective truth, one might probably expect them to be "close" in some meaningful way that one could perhaps attempt to define. 

The following is for a finite board (the question actually assumes an infinite board). For an $N\times N \times N$ board, wouldn't $2N$ rooks suffice? The idea comes from adapting the checkmate with two rooks for the two dimensional case in which the two rooks alternate rows and force the king to the last rank. For the three dimensional case, for each $y$ with $1\leq y \leq N$, place one rook at $(1,y,k)$ and another at $(2,y,k+1)$. Then, for $y$ going from $1$ to $N$, move the rook at $(1,y,k)$ to the square $(1,y,k+2)$. Again, for $y$ going from $1$ to $N$, move the rook at $(2,y,k+1)$ to $(2,y,k+3)$. Each for loop over $y$ involves moving, alternately, the rooks with $x$ coordinate $1$ by increasing their $z$ coordinate by $2$ units, or the rooks with $x$ coordinate $2$ by increasing their $z$ coordinate by $2$ units. We alternate, so that a for loop in which the rooks with $x$ coordinate $1$ are moved is followed by a for loop in which the rooks with $x$ coordinate $2$ are moved, and vice versa. Eventually, either the rooks with $x$ coordinate $1$ or the rooks with $x$ coordinate $2$ will have $z$ coordinate $N$. The effect of this is that a subset of the squares guarded by the rooks form a "floor" of two layers that keeps moving upward. So if the black king is between this "floor" and the top of the $N\times N\times N$ cube, it gets pushed to the top face. The "floor" must be moved upward in such a way that it never becomes disconnected, so that the black king can never escape to beneath the "floor" through some gap. For an infinite board, @Noam Elkies has already mentioned $5N$, so the following is not an improvement: the "ceiling" (and the other walls of the $N\times N \times N$ cube) can be formed by placing $N$ more rooks at $(N,y,N)$, for each $y$ with $1\leq y\leq N$, and $N-1$ more rooks at $(x,1,N)$, for each $x$ with $1 \leq x \leq N-1$, and $N-1$ more rooks at $(x,N,N)$ for each $x$ with $1 \leq x \leq N-1$. 

As some colleagues asked about the validity of the main result in the following paper in the absence of $\kappa$-cc property for fast function forcing, (with the permission of both authors) I would like to post an answer provided by Arthur in order to clarify the situation: A. Apter, J. Cummings, Blowing up the power set of the least measurable, Journal of Symbolic Logic 67 (2002), no. 3, 915--923. 

Finally, one may ask about the analogy of Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in the case of hyperprimes. Although, we are not dealing with a commutative hyperoperator for $n\geq 3$ but it is still meaningful and interesting to wonder whether every natural number has a unique representation in terms of $n$-hyper combination of $n$-hyperprime numbers or not? For instance, $8^{9^{10}}$ is a natural number. While $8=2^3$ and $9=3^2$ aren't $3$-hyperprime but this number has a representation $2^{3^{21}}$ via $3$-hyperprime numbers $2, 3, 21$. Does such a representation exist for every other number? Is it unique? 

I apologize in advance if this question is not of sufficient level. Define a perfect magic hypercube of side length $k$ and dimension $n$ to be one in which the cells are filled with consecutive integers and the sum of numbers over cells in any geometric line is equal to the appropriate constant depending on $n$ and $k$. From the density Hales-Jewett theorem it follows that for fixed $k$, there cannot exist perfect magic hypercubes of fixed side length $k$ and arbitrarily large $n$. My question is: what are simpler ways to prove the nonexistence of perfect magic hypercubes of fixed $k$ and arbitrarily large $n$? Thanks very much. 

Hi there, If you're only interested in heuristics, then if you replace $89$ by $x$, fix $m$ and $n$, fix $\pm$ to be $+$ or $-$, fix one of $a,b$ to be $2$, and let the other variable range over primes less than $x$, then it is in the right form for the Bateman-Horn conjecture to be applied to. See for example, P. T. Bateman, R. A. Horn, A heuristic asymptotic formula concerning the distribution of prime numbers, Mathematics of Computation 16 (1962), 363--367. (Say $a=2$, $b$ ranges over primes less than $x$, $m$ and $n$ are fixed, and $\pm$ is $+$. Then one can use the case of Bateman-Horn for two polynomials simultaneously, one polynomial being $z$, the other one being $z^n+2^m$.) Then depending on which other variables you want to vary, you can apply Bateman-Horn to each case like this. Don't know how accurate it would be for $x=89$ ! But it should be more accurate for $x \rightarrow \infty$. The usual caveat about this still being a conjecture applies.
