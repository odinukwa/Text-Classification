Why would this be the case? A bijective argument (i.e., a bijection on $\mathfrak S_n$ sending $|1|23$ to $|123\circ K\circ S$) might be especially nice! Refinement: Let 

'automatically producing a bijection mapping one statistic to another' is demonstrated in Two statistics on the permutation group and Combinatorics problem related to Motzkin numbers with prize money I. 'automatically producing conjectures' is achieved by clicking on 'search for distribution' on any of the statistics in the statistics database. The result is a list of statistics that are conjecturally equidistributed with the given statistic, but where a map transforming the first into the second might not be known. A classic is $URL$ it is easy to write a script that iterates 2. to find a 'partner' for a given pair of equidistributed statistics. An example is given in the comments to $URL$ Note that this meanwhile has a proof, also (essentially) discovered by FindStat. a different kind of conjectures is provided by the list of 'experimental identities' found when selecting any of the maps at $URL$ I am guessing that not all identities at $URL$ are immediately obvious. I am also working on a new package that checks whether a statistic satisfying given constraints can possibly exist. But that's for later... 

As mentioned in the comments, the FindStat project is aiming at what you want. Concerning the size: it contains currently about 1000 'combinatorial statistics', that is maps $s:\mathcal C_n\to \mathbb Z$ on some (graded) set of 'combinatorial' objects $\mathcal C_n$ and about 150 'combinatorial maps' between two collections. What makes FindStat powerful is the (trivial) ability to compose maps. For example, for Catalan objects we obtain about 1.500.000 a priori different statistics. Let me point out some possible ways of using it, in the spirit of the question. 

This is (at least for now) a question out of curiosity, there is no "deeper" meaning to it I know of. In fact, my main question is: is the observation below obvious? To state the observation I have to define two statistics on permutations $|1|23:\mathfrak S_n\to \mathbb N$ and $|123:\mathfrak S_n\to \mathbb N$, and two maps, $K:\mathfrak S_n\to\mathfrak S_n$ and $S:\mathfrak S_n\to\mathfrak S_n$. Let $\pi$ be a permutation, then an occurrence of the vincular pattern $|1|23$ (warning: notations vary) is an occurrence of the ordinary pattern $123$ such that the first matched entries are the first two entries of the permutation. In other words the number of occurrences of $|1|23$ in $\pi$ is zero, if the $\pi(2) < \pi(1)$, and it is the number of entries larger than $\pi(2)$ otherwise. The statistic $URL$ counts the number of occurrences of $|1|23$ in $\pi$. Similarly, an occurrence of the vincular pattern $|123$ is an occurrence of the ordinary pattern $123$ such that the first matched entry is the first entry of the permutation. The statistic $URL$ counts the number of occurrences of $|123$ in $\pi$. Now, for the maps! Let $K$ be the inverse Kreweras complement $URL$ mapping $\pi$ to $(1,\dots,n)\pi^{-1}$, and let $S$ be the Simion-Schmitt $URL$ map, sending any permutation to a $123$ avoiding permutation (this is not a bijection!). Observation: 

For simplicity, let $(R,m)$ be a Noetherian local ring and $I$ an $m$-primary ideal. The Hilbert function of $I$ is defined as $$ H_I(n): \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0} \to \operatorname{length}_{R/m} I^n / I^{n+1}.$$ If the dimension of $R$ is $d$, then for large $n$, $H_I(n)$ behaves as a polynomial of degree $d-1$. We call this the Hilbert polynomial and write $P_I(n)$. I would like to know how to obtain $P_I(n)$ from some known values of $H_I(n)$. If we know $H_I(n)$ for $d$ different (or consecutive) values of $n$, then we may use the polynomial interpolation to obtain a candidate $P'_I(n)$ for the Hilbert Polynomial. What is an effective way to check that $P'_I(n) = P_I(n)$ given that we can compute $H_I(n)$ for some "small" $n$? Theoretically there exists a number $s$ such that $H_I(n) = P_I(n)$ for all $n > s$ (the Hilbert series can be used to obtain this). Therefore, one can work with large enough values for the interpolation. However, in practice computing large values of $H_I(n)$ is usually an expensive task. 

I would like to know a reference of the following statement (or counter example). Let $S$ be a (commutative) Noetherian standard graded ring over a local ring, i.e., $S = S_0[S_1]$, where $S_0$ is Noetherian local and $S_1$ is finitely generated over $S_0$. If $S$ is an integral domain, then $X = \operatorname{Proj} S$ is a irreducible and reduced. Hence $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is an integral domain for any $x \in X$. But what about equidimensionality? That is 

Not everybody has the book. So it would be nice if you can explain your notation. Perhaps read how to ask question article. I believe that your setting is the following: $(R,m)$ is a Noetherian local ring. Let $I \subseteq m$ be an ideal and $M$ a finitely generated $R$-module. Let $G(-)$ denote $gr_I(-)$, and let $x^*$ denote the initial form of $x$ in $G(-)$. 

To support J.C. Ottem's answer, let me present one example. Let $R = \mathbb{C}[x,y]$ and $I = (x,y^2)R$. What is the minimal graded free resolution of $R/I$, equivalently $I$? That is, $0 \rightarrow R(-3) \stackrel{d_1}{\rightarrow} R(-1) \oplus R(-2) \stackrel{d_0}\rightarrow R \rightarrow R/I \rightarrow 0 $ where $d_1 = (-y^2 \;\; x)$ and $d_0 = (x \;\; y^2)$. Now, ask what are the graded Betti numbers and minimal number of generators for $R/I$. I agree with J.C. Ottem's opinion on reviewing the definitions. I hope this helps.
