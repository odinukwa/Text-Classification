If $\Delta u + b(x) \cdot \nabla u = 0$ and $u$ is bounded, then $u$ is constant provided $|b| = O(1/(1+|x|))$. This follows from scaling, the Harnack inequality and the maximum principle. Indeed, add a constant so that $\inf_{\mathbb{R}^n} u = 0$. Let $v(x) = u(Rx)$ for $R$ large. Then $v$ solves the equation $$\Delta v + Rb(Rx) \cdot \nabla v = 0.$$ By hypothesis, $R|b(Rx)|$ is uniformly bounded in $B_1-B_{1/4}$ for all large $R$, and for $R$ large we may assume by the maximum principle that $\inf_{\partial B_{1/2}}v < \epsilon$ for some $\epsilon$ small. The Harnack inequality, applied to $v$ in overlapping balls in the annulus $B_{3/4}-B_{1/4}$, implies that $v < C(n)\epsilon$ on $\partial B_{1/2}$, so by the maximum principle $u < C\epsilon$ in $B_{R/2}$. Since $\epsilon$ is arbitrarily small and this holds for all $R$ large, $u = 0$. 

Continuity of $d$ does not guarantee that $\nabla u$ is Holder. In fact, the regularity of $d$ is the best regularity one can expect for $\nabla u$. To see this, consider the one-dimensional divergence-form equation $$(du')' = f.$$ Integrating and dividing by $d$, we see that $u'$ is at best the same regularity as $d$. (This is also an easy way to see why we have one less derivative in estimates for divergence-form equations than in those for nondivergence equations). This also shows that the constant $C(d)$ depends on the modulus of continuity for $d$. Indeed, even if $d$ is $C^{\alpha}$ it can oscillate wildly and stay close to $1$, and in the model problem $u' = 1/d$ would have the same behavior. 

I don't think that oscillation decay estimates in the long cylinders are independent of $A$. Indeed, if we let $A^{1/2}R = 1$ so we are working in $Q_1$, and then take $A$ to infinity, this is like saying we have oscillation decay in time at the spatial origin. However, if we take boundary data $\sin(Bt)$ and solve the heat equation, I think that asymptotically the values at the origin are like $\cos(Bt)/B$, so if we took $M_1$ instead to be the the oscillation of $v$ in time at the origin (of order $1/B$) we would violate the inequality for $B$ large. (This is a counterexample to oscillation decay in the long thin cylinders, but not the inequality as stated where we have $M_1$ or order $1$). 

One can build a distributional subsolution which is a Lipschitz extension of $u$ by making an extension with a positive jump in radial derivative across the boundary. Say $u$ is harmonic on $B_1$ and we want to subharmonically extend to $B_2$. Let $v$ be a harmonic function on $B_2-B_1$ with boundary data $g$ on $\partial B_1$ and, say, constant on $\partial B_2$. Since the boundary data are $C^{1,\alpha}$ we have that $|\nabla u|,|\nabla v| < C$ globally. Let $$w(x) = \begin{cases} u(x), \quad x \in B_1 \\ v(x) + C(|x|^2-1), x \in B_2 - B_1 \end{cases}$$ Then $w$ is a Lipschitz extension of $v$ with a positive jump in the radial derivative across $\partial B_1$. Let $w_r^+$ denote the radial derivative from outside and $w_r^-$ denote the radial derivative from inside. We can now show that $w$ is distributionally subharmonic. Since it is harmonic in $B_1$ and subharmonic outside $B_1$, we just need to check on $\partial B_1$. Take any ball $B_{\eta}$ centered on $\partial B_1$ and let $\nu$ be the outer normal to $\partial B_{\eta}$. We compute (using that $w$ is harmonic in $B_1$) $$\int_{\partial B_{\eta}} w_{\nu} = \int_{\partial B_{\eta} \cap B_1^c} w_{\nu} - \int_{B_{\eta} \cap \partial B_1} w_r^-.$$ Since $$0 < \int_{B_{\eta} \cap B_1^c} \Delta w = \int_{\partial B_{\eta} \cap B_1^c} w_{\nu} - \int_{ B_{\eta} \cap \partial B_1} w_r^+,$$ and $w_r^- \leq w_r^+$ we conclude that $$\int_{\partial B_{\eta}} w_{\nu} \geq 0$$ showing the desired property. 

Here's a variation on Dmitri's idea that works as a counterexample: Take the rhombus with long diagonal $2$ and short diagonal $2\epsilon$. Then the area (LHS) grows like $\epsilon$, but the perimeter minus twice diameter goes like $$4\sqrt{1+\epsilon^2}-4$$ which grows like $\epsilon^2$. The idea is that by moving out $\epsilon$ in the "center" rather than the edges will give quadratic growth of the perimeter rather than linear. 

As suggested in the very nice answer of Prof. Eremenko, I think the key point of this kind of inequality is homogeneity, and it is related to some monotonicity formulae for harmonic functions. We expand briefly below. If we take the boundary data of $u$ and extend inwards to have homogeneity $\alpha$, i.e. let $v = r^{\alpha}u(x/r)$ (with $r=|x|$) then it is easy to verify $$|\nabla v(x)|^2 = r^{2\alpha-2}(|\nabla_Tu(x/r)|^2 + \alpha^2u(x/r)^2)$$ where $\nabla_Tu$ is the tangential part of the gradient, giving (in dimension $n$) that $$(n-2+2\alpha)\int_{B_1} |\nabla v|^2 = \int_{\partial B_1} (|\nabla_Tu|^2 + \alpha^2u^2).$$ Furthermore, since $v$ is a competitor for $u$ we obtain $$(n-2+2\alpha)\int_{B_1}|\nabla u|^2 \leq \int_{\partial B_1} (|\nabla_Tu|^2 + \alpha^2u^2).$$ Thus, we get a similar inequality to the one you want in $n \geq 3$ by taking $\alpha = 0$. Furthermore, in $\mathbb{R}^2$ we may take $\alpha$ to be the "homogeneity detected at radius $1$", $$\alpha = \frac{\int_{B_1}|\nabla u|^2}{\int_{\partial B_1}u^2}$$ to get $$\alpha\int_{B_1}|\nabla u|^2 \leq \int_{\partial B_1} u_{\theta}^2.$$ A very important monotonicity formula of Almgren (very much related to the solution given above by Prof. Eremenko) says that for nonconstant harmonic functions $\alpha \geq 1$ (roughly, the homogeneity detected at radius $r$ increases with $r$ and starts off at least $1$ since $u$ blows up to a plane). Some nice notes on Almgren's monotonicity are here. One of its interesting applications is a unique continuation theorem due to Garofalo and Lin, which can be found here. 

For some $C$ satisfying the decay properties, such solutions do exist. Let $v$ be the function which is the fundamental solution $|x|^{2-n}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n - B_1$ (with $n \geq 3$) and $1$ in $B_1$, and let $u = \rho \ast v$ for some smooth mollifier $\rho$ supported in $B_{1/4}$. Then $\Delta u = 0$ outside $B_{2}$ and $u > c(n)$ in $B_{2}$ so $C(x) = \Delta u / u$ is smooth, bounded and vanishes outside $B_2$. 

Here is a rough outline of Caffarelli's argument, leading to my question. We can assume (by subtracting a linear function) that $u(0) = 0, \nabla u(0) = 0$. The theorem above then follows from the statement that for a centered section of $u$, $S_h = \{u < h + l_h\}$ with $l_h$ chosen so that $0$ is the center of mass of $S_h$, we have $$B_{c_{\epsilon}h^{\frac{1}{1+\alpha}}} \cap \{x_2 = 0\} \subset S_h$$ for some small $c_{\epsilon}$. If the conclusion is false, we can find a sequence of functions $u_k$ satisfying the hypotheses and $c_k \rightarrow 0$ for which the conclusion fails at height $h_k$. The fact that $u_k$ are Lipschitz means that for $c_k$ small enough the conclusion will be true for large enough $h$, so it is easy to see that $h_k \rightarrow 0$. Now comes the key step, which says that after rescaling these sections we get a solution on $\{x_2 > 0\}$: Roughly, dilating by $A_k = (c_kh_k^{\frac{1}{1+\alpha}})^{-1}$ in the tangential direction and by a factor $B_k$ in the vertical direction, we rescale the sections into something equivalent to the unit ball. Since quadratic scaling will preserve paraboloids, if we have $\frac{B_k}{A_k^2} \rightarrow 0$ we are in the desired situation, which gives a contradiction. Caffarelli uses $C^{1,\sigma}$ regularity to say that the sections $S_{h}$ go out at least $h^{\frac{1}{(1+\sigma)}}$ in the vertical direction, giving $B_k \leq h_k^{-\frac{1}{1+\sigma}}$. (This is the only place where $C^{1,\sigma}$ regularity is used). We conclude that $$B_k/A_k^2 \leq c_k^2h_k^{\frac{2}{1+\alpha}-\frac{1}{1+\sigma}}.$$ (In Caffarelli's paper, in the middle of page $478$, the analagous quantity is $c_kh_k^{\frac{1}{1+\alpha}-1/4-\gamma/2}$ for some $\gamma < 1/2$, where the $\gamma$ inequality comes from $C^{1,\sigma}$ regularity.) At this point in the argument, he says "...$<c_kh_k^{S}$ for some $S(\alpha) > 0$, as long as $\alpha < 1$." However, it seems clear that even if $\sigma = 0$ (using only that $u$ is Lipschitz), if $\alpha < 1$ we get the desired result.
