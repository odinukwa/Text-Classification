For algebraic topology: 1) there is no extension of $\mathrm{id}: S^1\to S^1$ to $D^2\to S^1$ 2) there are no maps $S^{2n-1}\to S^n$ of Hopf invariant $1$ for $n\not\in \{ 1, 2, 4, 8\}$. 

This is semiexplicit. For any H-space $G$ with multiplication $\mu$, the projection maps $p_1, p_2: G\times G\to G$ have the property that $$ [p_1] \cdot [p_2] = [\mu] \in [G\times G, G]. $$ So if you have two different multiplications $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ on $S^3$ with induced multiplications $*_1$ and $*_2$ on $[-,S^3]$, you'll have $$ [p_1]*_1 [p_2] = [\mu_1] \neq [\mu_2] = [p_1]*_2 [p_2] $$ in $[S^3\times S^3, S^3]$. 

No, this is false. According to the Sullivan Conjecture (Miller's Theorem), $\mathrm{map}_*(B\mathbb{Z}/p, S^n) \sim *$ for all $n$, which means $$ [\Sigma^n B\mathbb{Z}/p, S^k] = * $$ for all $n$. So if we let $f: \Sigma^k \mathbb{Z}/ p \to *$, the induced map $$ f^*: \pi^k(*) \to \pi^k ( \Sigma^n B\mathbb{Z}/p ) $$ is the equivalence $* \to *$. Since $f$ is not a homotopy equivalence, this counterexamps the conjecture. Perhaps it would be more interesting to restrict attention to maps $f:X\to Y$ between finite complexes. EDIT (further thoughts): If $K$ and $L$ are finite complexes, then something like your co-Whitehead statement is true! Theorem 1: If $f: K\to L$ is a map of finite complexes such that $\pi^k( \Sigma^n f)$ is an isomorphism for all $k\geq k_0$ and all $n \geq n_0$, then $\Sigma f$ is a homotopy equivalence. Corollary 2: In Theorem 1, if both $K$ and $L$ are simply-connected, then $f$ is a homotopy equivalence. The proof uses a theorem of mine: Theorem M: If $X$ is simply-connected and of finite type and $\mathrm{map}_*(X,S^k) \sim *$ for all sufficiently large $k$, then $\mathrm{map}(X,Y)\sim *$ for all finite-dimensional CW complexes $Y$. Proof of Theorem 1: The hypotheses imply that the cofiber $C_{\Sigma^{n_0} f} \simeq \Sigma^{n_0} C_f$ satisfies $\mathrm{map}_*(\Sigma^{n_0} C_f, S^k) \sim *$ for all $k \geq k_0$. Theorem M implies that $\mathrm{map}_*(\Sigma^{n_0} C_f, \Sigma^{n_0}C_f) \sim *$, which implies $\Sigma^{n_0} C_f \sim *$ and hence that $\Sigma C_f \sim *$. This suffices to show that $\Sigma f$ is a homotopy equivalence. 

Suppose the primes are periodic mod $k$, and let $p$ be a prime divisor of $k$. Then there must be infinitely many primes of the form $p + nk$, which is divisible by $p$. Bad news. EDIT: More precision: we define $q: \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}/k$ to be the canonical quotient and $f: \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Z}$ by $f(n) = p_n$, the $n^\mathrm{th}$ prime. Suppose that $g= q\circ f: \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{Z}/k$ is periodic, with period $t$ and $k> 1$. Let's say $p_m = f(m)$ divides $k$. Then $$ p_{m+t} = f(m+t) \equiv f(m) = p_m\qquad \mathrm{mod}\ k $$ which means $p_{m+t} = p_m + nk$ for some $n$, and this forces $p_m$ to divide $p_{m+t}$, which is impossible. So $g$ cannot be periodic. This leaves the question: can the primes be eventually periodic? And of course the dumb answer is yes: mod $2$, the primes are eventually $1,1,1,1,\ldots$. 

My understanding is that if (P) satisfies condition 1, then (P) is called a hereditary property. CLARIFICATION: My main question is really: is there existing terminology for such a property? I will, however be happy to consider suggestions on the secondary question: if not, then what should I call it? 

If $p: E\to B$ is a fibration, is the map $q:M_p \to B$ from the mapping cylinder of $p$ also a fibration? I know that it is if $p$ is trivial, or locally trivial; and I know (from Strøm's "The Homotopy Category is a Homotopy Category") that the topology of $M_p$ can be slightly modified to make $q$ a fibration. I wonder 

It is well known that for simply-connected rational spaces, every suspension splits as a wedge of rational spheres and every loop space splits as a product of rational Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. What are the best/original references for this? 

For me, I can’t. I need a pencil and a quiet spot. I’ve applied for grants but never had any idea why, apart from institutional pressure. 

If $p:E\to B$ is a Serre fibration (assume it is surjective), then for each $b\in B$ we get a comparison map $p^{-1}(b) \to F_b$, where $F_b$ is the homotopy fiber of $p$ over $b$. It is easy to see that these maps induce isomorphisms on $\pi_n$ for $n\geq 1$, but I wonder about $\pi_0$. Question: Is it true that $p^{-1}(b) \to F_b$ is a weak homotopy equivalence? 

Suppose $A$ is an abelian torsion group, with no elements of order $p$, and let $P$ be an abelian $p$-group (i.e., the order of each element is a power of $p$). It sure seems to me that $$ \mathrm{map}_*( K(A,n), K(P,m) ) \sim * $$ for all $n, m\geq 1$. Unfortunately, I want to prove this without homology or (explicitly) cohomology. If $A$ is finite, then we can boil the question down to the case of a cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/a$ with $(a,p) = 1$; then there is a cofiber sequence $M\to B\mathbb{Z}/a \to X$ where $M = S^1 \cup_a D^2$ is the "$1$-dimensional Moore space" for $\mathbb{Z}/a$ and $X$ has a cone decomposition using Moore spaces $M(\mathbb{Z}/a,k)$ for $k\geq 2$. Since (as is easily shown) $\mathrm{map}_{*}( M(\mathbb{Z}/a,n), K(P,m) ) \sim \star$, we get $ \mathrm{map}_{*}( B\mathbb{Z}/a, K(P,m)) \sim *$, and then homotopy colimit stuff proves the assertion for finite $A$. Question: Is there such an "elementary" argument for the general case? 

Why not list the authors in the references/bibliography, and then as, say, [23] in the body of the paper? 

Assuming the conjectures, you can find the optimal arrangement for $n$ cubes (if there is one) by finding $m$ such that $m^3 \leq n < (m+1)^3$, then looking at $n - m^3$. 

Problem #3 is about noncancellation phenomena. Peter Hilton (often with G. Mislin and/or J. Roitberg) wrote about ten papers on the subject. There are plenty of examples, generally related to localization. Probably a good start: Hilton, P. Non-cancellation phenomena in topology. Topics in topology (Proc. Colloq., Keszthely, 1972), pp. 405–416. Colloq. Math. Soc. Janos Bolyai, Vol. 8, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1974. 

If I were talking about sets instead of tuples, then the second condition would mean that such a collection is a simplicial complex. Since I need tuples, I thought that $\mathcal{C}$ could be thought of as a simplicial set. But the reason I want to use tuples is to allow for repetitions (such as $(1,2,2,3,4)$); and the tuples with repeats are in no way degenerate in my context. So maybe I'm thinking about something like a sub-fat-simplicial-set inside the fat nerve (fat meaning "no degeneracies") $B_\mathbf{fat}\mathbb{N}$? Can someone point me to some useful terminology or results about collections $\mathcal{C}$ like this? 

In the category of rational spaces, loop spaces split as products of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces and SUSPENSIONS split as wedges of (rational) spheres. I wonder if anything of the following form is true: (*) Any functor $F$ from spaces to spaces which splits suspensions and loop spaces as above must factor through the rationalization. EDIT 1: Greg raises some fine questions, but I stand by my wording. This is a question that arises from curiosity, not because I need it for anything, so I'd be happy with "anything like" the given statement. EDIT 2: At least for simply-connected spaces, rationalization commutes with loop and suspension. But, it seems to me that the power of the property is that the suspension of any F-space splits and the loops of any F-space splits. So I would go with: the suspension of any rational space splits as a wedge of rational spheres and the loops of any rational space splits as a product of rational Eilenberg-Mac Lanes spaces. Thus, we'd be looking for functors to some model-esque category with some relatively manageable list of objects whose products exhaust the homotopy types of loop spaces and whose wedges exhaust the homotopy types of suspensions. 

It depends on your definition of Hopf invariant. One definition is to look at the cup product structure in the integral cohomology of the cofiber. It then takes a bit of work to show it is a homomorphism, but once done the fact that the Hopf invariant of the Hopf map is $1$ is the standard calculation for projective spaces. 

Hahn–Mazurkiewicz Theorem: Suppose $X$ is a nonempty Hausdorff topological space. Then the following are equivalent: 

Write $E_A = p^{-1}(A)$. Under mild conditions, the inclusion $$ (E_A \times I)\cup (E \times \{ 0\}) \to E\times I $$ will be a cofibration and a (weak) homotopy equivalence. Now set up the lifting/extension problem
