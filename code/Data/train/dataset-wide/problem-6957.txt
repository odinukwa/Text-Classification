We can now add a subside to the consumers, let's say 2 monetary unit/quantity unit, and the result is to shift up the demand curve, so that the new equilibrium can be easily obtained setting for example the prices equal in the new apparent demand curve $Q_dsub = 28-4p$ and the supply curve, and we find equilibrium quantity with subside $Q^{*sub} = 52/3$, eq. price with subside for the producers $P^{*sub}_{S} = 8/3$ and eq. price for the consumers with subsides $P^{*sub}_{D} = 2/3$ The problem is that if I try to obtain that results by maximisation of the total surplus as before, I obtain: $$TotalSurplus = - \frac{3}{16}Q^2+\frac{9}{2}Q + P^{*sub}_{S} * Q^{*sub} - P^{*sub}_{D} * Q^{*sub}$$ When I account for $P^{*sub}_{S} = P^{*sub}_{D} + 2$, I obtain: $$TotalSurplus = - \frac{3}{16}Q^2+\frac{9}{2}Q + 2 * Q^{*sub}$$ And here I don't know how to continue, as the equilibrium point doesn't write off any more. 

I am trying to understand the time path of extraction and royalty (price) for a non-renewable resource under a monopolist framework. The problem is that in the main books on environmental/resource economics and in the resources that I could find on internet the "results", either quantitative or qualitative, are given without proof, and the assumptions are not given ("most cases" :-( ). Using optimal control, I have no problem to find that the Hotelling rule is here applied to the marginal profit over the extraction quantity, or that its discounted value remains constant and it is below the market price. But what are the specific assumptions required to claim that (a) the initial price is higher than under perfect market competition/benevolent social planner; (b) that the depletion time is longer and finally (c) that the growth rate of price is lower than the (constant) growth rate of marginal profit ? 

My answers are respectively: $d_t$ is dividend income and $d_t=\pi/N$ For agent problem: $$max [ln c_t + \gamma ln n_t]$$ Subject to $ c_t\le d_t+ w_t (1-\tau n_t)$ Lagrangian $L= ln c_t + \gamma ln n_t +\lambda [c_t- d_t- w_t (1-\tau n_t)]$ FOCs (1) W.r.t $c_t$: $(1/c_t)+\lambda =0$ (2) w.r.t $n_t$: $\gamma / n_t +\lambda w_t \tau =0$ (3) w.r.t. $c_t-d_t-w_t+w_t \tau n_t=0$ By (1) and (2): $$\frac{(1/c_t)}{\gamma / n_t }=\frac{\lambda}{\lambda w_t \tau}$$ So, $c_t= n_t\tau w_t$ …(4) When substitute (4) into (3) $n_t\tau w_t-d_t-w_t+w_t \tau n_t=0$ $$n_t=\frac{\pi /N+w_t}{2\tau w_t}$$ which is labor supply schedule. For firm’s maximization problem $$max [Y_t-w_tL_t-X_tr_t]$$ $$max [Y_t= A\bar{X}^{1-\epsilon}L_t^{\epsilon}—w_tL_t-\bar{X}r_t]$$ By FOC w.r.t. $L_t$ $\epsilon A\bar{X}^{1-\epsilon}L_t^{\epsilon -1}-w_t=0$$ Then $$L_t= (W_t / \epsilon A)^{1/(1-\epsilon )}$$ which is labor demand sechedule. ———— So far, I have written all question with my answers in order to give information about the general framework of the question. And I will be glad if you let me know when see any mistakes so far. But my actual question is posted below: 

I do that For labor market clearing: $N_{t+1}=L_t$ Then, $$N_{t+1}/N_t= L_t/N_t$$ $n_t=e_t={Nw_t-\tau \over 2N}$ But after that, I cannot proceed my solution. Help me to do this part? Thank you. 

Two alternative approaches to compute a market equilibrium (in static analysis) are either to minimize the differences (either using abs() or a quadratic diff) between supply-demand quantities and prices in a given market or maximise the total surplus. Which are the advantages of these two approaches and when to prefer one over the other? I noticed that many partial equilibrium models (e.g. 1, 2 (p 42)) use the max surplus method, but I wonder why. 

Let's assume a market with linear demand and supply functions, let's say $Q_d = 20 - 4p$ and $Q_s = -4 +8p$ respectively. We can easily find the market equilibrium by either setting $Q_d = Q_s$ (or $P_d = P_d$ in the inverse demand and supply functions) or by maximising the total surplus, as done in the following screenshot: 

never work on weekends :-) What you really do here is to find the total surplus in terms of $Q*$ and then maximise it setting the derivative to $Q*$ equal to zero. So, you just maximise $$TotalSurplus = - \frac{3}{16}Q^{*2}+\frac{9}{2}Q^{*} + 2 * Q^{*}$$ for $Q*$ and you obtain the expected results. 

In the Green Book (page 97) it is stated "the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption (μ) with respect to utility". What is it? Is it an error ? I always heard of the elasticity of the marginal utility with respect to consumption... 

Usually additive functionals are defined for (strong) Markov processes with continuous sample paths (diffusions) but I suppose you do have a Markov---AR(1)---time series and $\{ Y_t \}$ is indeed additive. So, in your case, $$ X_t = a_0 + a_1 X_{t-1} + W_t, $$ and you would like \begin{align*} Y_t - Y_{t-1} &= r_1 + (M_t - M_{t-1}) + r_2 (X_t - X_{t-1}) \\ &= a_0 + W_t + a_1 X_{t-1}. \end{align*} If such a decomposition exists, then conditioning on $\sigma(X_1,...X_{t-1})$ gives necessary conditions \begin{align*} r_1 + r_2 (a_0 + (a_1 -1) X_{t-1}) &= a_0 + a_1 X_{t-1} \\ \end{align*} with solutions \begin{align*} r_1 = (1-\frac{a_1}{a_1 -1})a_0, \;r_2 = \frac{a_1}{a_1 -1}. \end{align*} One can then substitute $(r_1, r_2)$ into $$ a_0 + W_t + a_1 X_{t-1} - r_1 - r_2 (X_t - X_{t-1}) $$ and check that it gives a martingale difference sequence $\frac{-1}{a_1 -1} W_t$. 

For a nice, and gentle, functional analytic treatment on this, see the chapter on welfare theorems in Stokey and Lucas. (Although what they call "inner product" is definitely not standard functional analytic language. That term is reserved strictly for Hilbert spaces in functional analysis.) Prices are elements of the dual as you and previous answer stated. Where one needs to be more careful in the general setting is specifying a topology. You want the value of bundles to be continuous---hence prices are continuous (i.e. bounded, if the commodity space is Banach) with respect to the topology chosen on the commodity space. 

(III) if the highway was privately owned, how can I find what tool would a profit maximizing owner collect during peak and non peak hours. And how can I find how many cars would use the toll highway? Does the private ownership of the highway result in allocations efficient? 

Another part’s solution: $$\text{profit}=t_N(x_N)k-Nx_N$$ Subject to $q(x)u(w-t_N(x_N))\ge 0$ But again for this part I couldn’t set up the equation. What I thought is $$max_{(t_N(x_N), t_A(x_A))} \ \ q(x_A)[t_A(x_A)-kx_A]+q(x_N)[t_N(x_N)-kx_N]$$ First order conditions W.r.t. $(t_N(x_N)$ $$q’(x_N)(t_N(x_N)-kx_N)+q(x_N)[t’_N(x_N)-k]=0$$ $$t_N(x_N)={q’(x_N)kx_N-q(x_N)[t’_N(x_N)-k]\over q’(x_N)}$$ Similar for Andrew $$t_A(x_A)={q’(x_A)kx_A-q(x_A)[t’_A(x_A)-k]\over q’(x_A)}$$ 

Let us imagine a city where demand for car travel ( either on the freeway or side streets) is perfectly in elastic but the level shifts to a high value during peak rush hours and returns to a low value during non peak hours. All car travel is between home and work and is equidistant for all commuters. All commuters drive own car and don’t carpool. An unlimited amount of side streets are available. And commuters can always get to or from work in 60 minutes using side streets. The average commute time on the freeway is given by 

Edit: for adding my solution for remaining parts Take that Nichole is risk neutral. I end up. $${\partial u \over \partial x}[q’(x)(w-t(x))-q(x)t’(x)]=0$$ $$q’(x)(w-5(x))-q(x)t’(x )=0$$ and differentiate this w.r.t. w. $${\partial q’(x) \over \partial x}{\partial x \over \partial w}(w-t(x))+q’(x)[{\partial w \over \partial w}-{\partial t \over \partial x}{\partial x \over \partial w}-\frac{\partial q(x)}{\partial x}{\partial x \over \partial w}t’(x)-q(x){\partial t’(x) \over \partial x}{\partial x \over \partial w}=0$$ After calculations $${\partial x \over \partial w}=+{q’(x)\over -q”( x)(w-t(x)+2q’(x)t’(x)+q(x)t”(x)}>0$$ 

For economics, both micro and macro, written in mathematics as mathematicians would know it, try the Handbook of Mathematical Economics series, 4 volumes in total. See for example, this very nice article by Mas-Colell and Zame in volume 4 on general equilibrium. (Microeconomics, for example, by Mas-Colell-Whinston-Green falls far below this standard of rigor.) 

As you say (how did $\sin t$ in the initial problem become $\cos t$?), $\mathbb{Q}$ is a measure under which $W_t$ becomes $\tilde{W}_t - \sin t$, where $\tilde{W}_t$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-Brownian motion. So Girsanov's theorem would say $$ L_t = E[\frac{ d \mathbb{Q} }{ d \mathbb{P} }|\mathcal{F}_t] = e^{ - \int_0^t \sin s dW_s - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^t \sin^2 s ds} $$ is one such measure. As for uniqueness, if we take $\Omega$ to be the canonical path space $C[0, T]$ with $\mathcal{F}$ generated by the cylinder sets. Then the Wiener measure would be unique, simply by the fact that the Brownian law says any two such measures must agree on the cylinder sets and therefore all of $\mathcal{F}$. In general, the Girsanov $\mathbb{Q}$ is unique up to the Brownian filtration $\mathcal{F}_{W} \subset \mathcal{F}$, since it is constructed $W$-pathwise. 

$L^{\infty}$: the (Banach, usually) space of bounded measurable functions modulo the equality almost everywhere. Like all function spaces not involving holomorphic functions, it's really a space of equivalence classes. weak-$^*$ topology: the topology on the dual $X^*$ of any topological vector space $X$ induced by the $(X, X^*)$-pairing. "embedded in $L^{\infty}$": a (say) topological vector space $Y$ is said to be embedded in $L^{\infty}$ if there is an injective continuous linear map from $Y$ to $L^{\infty}$. (This is the usual meaning. In your paragraph, "embedded" just means viewing those indicator functions as representatives of their classes. The weak-$^*$ topology on $L^{\infty}$ is given by the identification $L^{\infty} = (C_0)^*$.) 

where x is the number of cars on the freeway. During non peak times the demand is less than 20 cars but during the rush hours hunderds of cars are travelling. Assume everyone time is worth 0.10 dollar per minute. I want to ask that (I) firstly without no tolls, how many people will use the freeway during rush hours? 

I only put this image to show the graph. Thirdly, I try to drive utility maximizing labor supply function $H^*$ by assuming that $(1-a)w-2y_g>0$ $$u(y_d, H)=y_d/(1+H)^2$$ $$u(y_d, H)=((1-a)y_e+y_g)/(1+H)^2$$ Derivative with respect to $H$ $${(1-a)w(1+H)^2-((1-a)wH+y_g)2(1+H)\over (1+H)^4}=0$$ $$\iff$$ $$(1+H)[(1-a)w(1+H)-2(1-a)wH-2y_g]=0$$ Since H>0, $(1+H)≠0$ So, $$[(1-a)w(1+H)-2(1-a)wH-2y_g]=0$$ $$H*={[(1-a)w-2y_g\over (1-a)w}>0$$ Additionally, $$\partial H^*/\partial y_g=-w/((1-a)w)<0$$ By intuition, as the guaranteed income $yg$ increases labor supply will decrease. $$\partial H^*/\partial a=-2y_g/. ((-a)^2w)<0$$ So for each dollar the person earns the reduction amount of a in the single cash transfer increases iff the labor supply decreases. these intuitions are enough? What do you say about these results ? Then, Fourthly What is the utility maximizing labor supply when $(1-a)w-2y_g\le 0$ In this case I said that $$H*={[(1-a)w-2y_g\over (1-a)w}\le 0$$ Thus, the labor supply will be optimally zero. I am stuck at this point. Is what I said true? And then, Assume that the government wants to choose its policy $(y_g, a)$ in such a way that a citizen utility is maximized subject to the constraint that the net transfer is zero How can I derive the optimal policy? I tried to derive it. But I guess my solution is not true. How do you derive it? Is it correct? This point is really important. $$u(y_d, H)=Y_d/(1+H)^2=((1-a)wH+y_G)/(1+H)^2$$ Subject to $ T=Y_G-aY_E=0$ So $y_g=aY_E=awH$ So $$u(y_d, H)=Y_d/(1+H)^2=((1-a)wH+awH)/(1+H)^2=wH/(1+H)^2$$ Derivative w.r.t. H; $$(w(1+H)^2-wH2(1+H))/(1+H)^4=0$$ $$(w(1+H)^2-wH2(1+H))=0$$ Iff $$w+wH-2wH=0$$ So $H^*=1/2$ So, $y_g^*=aw/2$ and $a^*=2y_g^*/w$ I am really stuck at this part. And my last question is based on above assumption. But different citizens earn different wages. What do you think about the merit of this policy? Thank you in advance. 

Economics models usually assume that the structure of the economy is common knowledge among agents. Mathematically, an event is common knowledge if it lies in the meet of all agents' information sets. (The meet of a family of $\sigma$-algebras is the finest common coarsification of all $\sigma$-algebras in the family. See Aumann 1976.) However, in the literature when a paper makes the common knowledge assumption, one almost never sees the meet of any information sets anywhere. Let me give an example (Grossman and Stiglitz 1980). Grossman-Stiglitz model This is a model where two traders with (essentially) mean-variance utility are asymmetrically informed about the mean. By assumption, structure of the economy is common knowledge and traders are rational. Equilibrium price must therefore, first, clear the market and, second, be consistent with the uninformed trader's expectation. Details given as follows. Let $I$ and $U$ denote the informed and uninformed traders respectively. The traders have same CARA utility, $u_I(W) = u_U(W) = - e^{-\gamma W}$. The risk-free rate is $r$. The price of risky asset tomorrow is $P_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{P}, \sigma^2) | \bar{P}$. The informed trader $I$ knows $\bar{P}$; the uninformed trader $U$ only knows the prior distribution $\bar{P} \sim \mathcal{N}(P_0, \sigma_0^2)$. Let both trader have wealth endowments $E$. (CARA utility has no wealth effect, so $E$ plays no role in portfolio choice below.) Given today's price $P_1$ for the risky asset, trader's wealth tomorrow is $W(\phi) = rW + \phi (P_2 - rP_1)$ if he choose to hold $\phi$ units of risky asset. Maximizing expected utility, a traders' demand is $$ \frac{E[P_2|\mathcal{F}] - rP_1}{\gamma Var(P_2|\mathcal{F})} $$ conditional on his information set $\mathcal{F}$. For $I$, $\mathcal{F}_I = \{ \bar{P}, P_1\} $. For $U$, $\mathcal{F}_U = \{ P_1 \}$. The supply $x$ of risky asset is distributed $\mathcal{N}(\bar{x}, \sigma_x^2)$. Equilibrium is a price function $P_1(\bar{P}, x)$ such that $$ \frac{\bar{P} - r P_1(\bar{P}, x)}{\gamma \sigma^2}+ \frac{E[P_2|P_1(\bar{P}, x)] - r P_1(\bar{P}, x)}{\gamma Var(P_2|P_1(\bar{P}, x))} = x. $$ In other words, market clears and the uninformed trader computes his demand using the correct pricing function in equilibrium. Now in this CARA-normal setting, things are linear and one can solve for equilibrium by guessing a pricing function $$ P_1(\bar{P}, x) = A\bar{P} + Bx + C $$ and find $A$, $B$ and $C$ by matching coefficients. For example, compute $$ E[P_2|P_1] = P_0 + \frac{A \sigma_0^2}{A^2 \sigma_0^2 + B^2 \sigma_x^2} [A(\bar{P} - P_0) + Bx] $$ and $$ Var(P_2|P_1) = \frac{B^2 \sigma_x^2}{A^2 \sigma_0^2 + B^2 \sigma_x^2}\sigma_0^2 + \sigma^2 $$ Substituting into the market clearing equation and some tedious algebra gives endogenous constants $A$, $B$, and $C$. Instead, Grossman and Stiglitz do something more elegant. They point out that uninformed trader $U$ can condition on the residual demand for any realization of $(\bar{P},x)$ $$ D_{resid} = x - \frac{\bar{P} - r P_1 }{\gamma \sigma^2}. $$ What's even more clever, they note that, since $P_1$ is observed in in equilibrium, they first conjecture that $P_1$ and $$ \tilde{D}_{resid} = x - \frac{\bar{P} }{\gamma \sigma^2}. $$ are informationally equivalent. Then equilibrium condition becomes $$ \frac{ r P_1(\bar{P}, x)}{\gamma \sigma^2}+ \frac{E[P_2|\tilde{D}_{resid}] - r P_1(\bar{P}, x)}{\gamma Var(P_2|\tilde{D}_{resid})} = \tilde{D}_{resid}. $$ Now things are much less tedious and there are no endogenous constants $A$ and $B$ to solve for. $E[P_2|\tilde{D}_{resid}]$ is an affine function of $\tilde{D}_{resid}$ and $Var(P_2|\tilde{D}_{resid})$ is an exogenous constant. So that $P_1(\bar{P}, x)$ can be backed out immediately. Since $P_1$ is an affine function of $\tilde{D}_{resid}$, it is verified ex-post that they are informationally equivalent. Question To have the uninformed trader $U$ condition on the residual demand, the common knowledge assumption is used. Or, at least, $U$ knows that $I$ knows so that $U$ can put herself in $I$'s shoes and compute $I$'s demand. However, the meet of the information sets does not appear anywhere---as it should. Result of $U$'s calculations should be measurable with respect to the meet. If one is to formulate this mathematically, where would that appear? 

The dark sentences are the questions given. And I add some solutions in the yellow box. What I want is that please check these solutions. If Any missing part exist, how can I correct it? Secondly, we couldn’t give any answer to the question “Does the private ownership of the highway result in allocations efficient?“ what do you think? How can I answer it? Many Thanks. 

Consider a welfare system u dear which a single cash transfer(guaranteed income ) is given to every citizen. Then for each dollar the person earns the payment is reduced to by a where 00 you get a transfer. If t<0, you pay taxes. If t=0, you don’t pay taxes or receive transfers. Suppose that te wage rate is $w>0$. And so a person who works H hours gets $y_e=wH$. A typical individuals utility function is $$u(y_d, H)=y_d/(1+H)^2$$ The question has multiple part. I tried to do most of them. But I’m not sure please check my solutions also I cannot do some parts. First of all I write an expression for individual’s disposable income $y_d$ as a function of $y_g$ and $y_e$ and other parameters. $$y_d=(1-a)y_e+y_g$$ secondly I try to draw indifference curves for that utility function and his disposable income line as follows
