Our model is $Y=X(\beta_0)+u$, where $u\sim IID(0,\sigma_0^2I)$, and $X(\beta)$ is a non-linear function of the beta. When trying to minimize the $SSR(\beta)$ we get the following FOC: $\nabla X(\beta)^T(Y-X(\beta))=0$, where $\nabla X(\beta)$ is the gradient. Well, the FOC is equivalent to $n^{(-1/2)}(\nabla X(\beta)^T(X(\beta_0)+u-X(\beta))=0$. If we apply a taylor expansion of the first order to each component $X_t(\beta)$ of $X(\beta)$, we obtain $X_t(\beta)=X_t(\beta_0)+\nabla X(\bar\beta_{(t)})^T(\beta-\beta_0)$, where $\bar\beta_{(t)}$ is a point in the line segment that joins $\beta$ and $\beta_0$. This point may be different for each taylor expansion we do, and that's why it's indexed by $t$. Inserting the taylor expansion in the FOC: $n^{(-1/2)}(\nabla X(\beta)^T(u-\nabla \bar X^T(\beta-\beta_0))=0$, where $\nabla \bar X$ is the matrix with $\nabla X(\bar\beta_{(i)})$ as each i-th column. Are all of the above calculations correct? I ask this because in this book, the authors state in page 225 that we should obtain a term with second derivatives of $X(\beta)$... I do not understand why this is. Any help would be appreciated 

In Wickens' Macroeconomics book, in page 552, the author states the following: «The stochastic problem can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers, but there is a problem with this solution.» However, if I'm not mistaken, it's very usual to see other books using lagrange multipliers to solve this type of problems. Are they wrong? Am I wrong? Is there a way to go around this apparent limitation? Any help would be appreciated. Here's a the image: 

In the linear regression model $E(y|X)=x'\beta$, and so we're capable of interpreting a $\beta_i$ as $\Delta E(y|\text{all fixed except } x_i)=\beta_i \Delta x_i$. I'm thinking in discrete changes. Hence, we're able to interpret the estimator of $\beta_i$ as an estimation of what happens on average. I was wondering if this interpretation of the coefficients' estimators is also preserved when we have a log-log model... $ E(\%\Delta y|\text{all fixed except } x_i)\approx \beta_i \%\Delta x_i$ Any help would be appreciated. 

Why is that? What approximation did he use? I've tried several to linearize the fraction $\frac{(1+\eta)^{\sigma}}{\beta}$ around those values, but I don't get the same... 

Here's my take: From your article «its[India's] overseas shipments had contracted for the seventh consecutive month in June its industries like steel and tyres are reeling under cheaper Chinese imports.» If the Chinese companies gain more market, they become more desirable, specially when the yuan suffers a devaluation, because with the same amount of dollars you can buy more of companies that are expanding. 

In this OECD link we have the US General government debt. The value is close to 120% of GDP. However, the wikipedia has the US Federal Gov debt at 80%. Why is there such a difference? What debt is being considered by the OECD, that is not by the wikipedia graph? Any help would be appreciated 

In a state-space representation, the measurement equation is something of this form $O_t=H_t s_t + u_t$, where $O_t$ are the observational data at time $t$, $H_t$ is a possibly time-dependent matrix relating the state $s_t$ and the observational data. We can see $u_t$ as the measurement errors at time $t$. However, in Herbst and Schorfheide book (Bayesian estimation of DSGE models), we have $s_t$ dependent on $y_{t}$, but not $y_{t-1}$, while the measurement equations are of the form: 

Does anyone know the meaning of the notation x%p.a.? I'm reading a text on seigniorage, and the authors have used that notation to state the usual empirical limit to the seigniorage revenues just before the inflation rates effects outweigh the money growth effect. 

In «New Introduction to Multiple Time Series», page 90, we have the following formulas for the ML estimators of a stable Gaussian VAR$(p)$ process: 

If there's none who will sell foreign assets, or borrow from the domestic country, then it means that foreign country is paying in domestic currency by borrowing from a country other than the domestic. Since, the foreign country is paying in domestic currency, to prevent a change in the exchange rate(in case of a fixed regime), the CB will accumulate the foreign currency. However, what would be the need in the case of a flexible regime? In both cases, the CB could finance the government(private) spending, by buying govt(corporate) bonds, issuing more money. 

(This is part two of a series of questions I've posted here under "Negative interest rates") Motivation: I've happen to stumble on two articles, with some weeks, that the central bank(CB) of switzerland, due to Russia ruble crisis, and , has decided to use a negative interest rate for reserve deposits of banks at the CB, to facilitate the exchange rate peg. Bank of Japan(BoJ) also seems have implemented a negative interest rate, even if for different reasons(not sure...). In all textbooks, the topic of negative interest rates is easily dismissed, or simply tought of as impossible, and so the authors work with non-negative lower bound(ex:deflation trap). Now, how is this negative rate going to affect the theory? Almost every part of the economic theory is going to be influenced by this. Hence I'm dividing my question into several. This part is for Fiscal Policy. With negative interest rates, what changes for demand-side policy(scope, effects,debt repayment capabilities etc.) can we expect? Any help would be appreciated. 

I'm reading these notes in the RBC model. In page 14, the author, tries to explain the direction of the arrows, in the space $(\tilde C_t,\tilde K_t)$ (tilde refers to proportional deviations from steady state) , to explain the dynamics. If I look at equations (47) and (49), the ones that are used to derive the isoclines (equations (50) and (51)), I do not understand how to see the directions Up/Down, Left/Right... Any help would be appreciated. 

In matching theory, the matching function $m_t=m(u_t,v_t)$, where $m_t$ is the number of matches(new hires) between unemployed looking for work($u_t$) and vacancies($v_t$). This matching function is usually assumed to be increasing in its arguments, i.e. partial derivatives are positive. What's the rationale for this? Is there any data allowing us to conclude that it should be so? Any help would be appreciated. 

Well I'm having a some difficulty in understanding completely what the following sentence means and I would like to be sure. «(...) a country running a trade deficit is buying more from the rest of the world than it is selling to the rest of the world. In order to pay for the difference between what it buys and what it sells, the country must borrow from the rest of the world. It borrows by making it attractive for foreign financial investors to increase their holdings of domestic assets- in effect, to lend to the country.» How does this borrowing(in italic) work? I'm not understanding the italic part. Does the country A sells bonds in domestic currency, receives foreign currency, when the foreign investor buys the domestic currency of A to buy the domestic bond of A? Also why should the current account plus the capital account be equal to zero (up to a statistical discrepancy)? 

In hint 1 substitute $\hat{\beta}-\beta$ by little o, and remember that the sum of little o 's is still little o's. Then substitute on the LHS of your equality abouve. and you get what you want. (multiplication of $x'x$ by little o is also little o) I hope this is enough. If not, I'll show more later. I'm pressed for time right now... sorry 

Below we have a diagram for a bail-in. According to it, as the big company/bank takes a loss in the asset side, the first to absorb those losses, in the liabilities side, is equity. How is this possible? Do the Resolution Authority take the equity from shareholders and sells it on the market? When a company divulges its results, and the market sees the loss, the equity immediately dives (dis)proportionally... Or is this what's called absorbing the loss? Your equity being valued at zero? 

I'm having a hard time understanding how one interprets the graph, together with the explanatory text right below the figure. Can someone help me? Also, if someone knows where they got their graphs, I would appreciate.
