This is either a very weird auction problem with symmetric players (I also assume the players are risk-neutral) or a very odd lotteries/game-theory game. How would you approach this question mathematically speaking and what answer do you get for it? There's no prize for me getting the right answer to the site's riddle, I'm just curious. My intuition tells me that the optimal cutoff is 0.5, since you have a 50-50 chance of being higher or lower than your opponent's number, regardless of whether he/she repicks their random number or not, but I am not sure. 

I assume 3. is some sort of "monotonicity" condition. How would I approach the proof for this condition? Any hints would be appreciated. I also am wondering what this Lemma is leading up to, so I can study for that in advance. Does anyone have any idea? 

Consider the standard utility maximization problem: $$\begin{align}\max_{\vec x} & \quad U(\vec x) \\ & \quad \vec p \cdot \vec x \leq Y \end{align}$$ Here utility is your objective function, and the price inequality is the constraint. You solve for the optimal bundle via a Lagrangian. Now consider its dual problem. $$\begin{align}\min_{\vec x} & \quad p \cdot \vec x \\ & \quad U(\vec x) \geq \bar U \end{align}$$ Now the objective function is expenditure, and a desired minimum utility is the constraint. The utility that you gain from the maximization solution, if that is set to be $\bar U$, then the solution bundle to the minimization problem will be the same. This holds if you solve the bundle for the minimization problem first. From this result (which you can verify for yourself) eventually comes the ever useful Roy's Identity. $${x^m_i}^* = - \frac{\frac{\partial V}{\partial p_i}}{\frac{\partial V}{\partial Y}}$$ Where $V(\vec p,Y)$ is the indirect utility function. 

The last section is probably the hardest for me to be precise about. Is poverty about absolute standards, relative standards, or being most at risk to suffer greatly from unemployment? What is everyone's marginal cost for eliminating poverty (especially problematic since it is probably a function of actual income)? Nevertheless, I think it's some of the most compelling material we have to deal with in economics; the reason we care about all this is because of human interest, and this is where we'll find the most competing interests. 

Considering your specific case: $$U(Y_s) = -\frac{1}{2}(\alpha - Y_s)^2$$ implies $$U(L) = \sum_{s=1}^{S}\pi_s (-\frac{1}{2}(\alpha - Y_s)^2)$$ You can technically work with either finding $\int U(L) \text{d}L$ or $\int U(Y_s) \text{d}L$. Best of luck with your work. Edit: Working in the discrete case will mean using expected values may prove helpful. 

If price (marginal benefit), was suppose, forced to be higher, so that you moved along the marginal cost curve where MC $\neq$ ATC, then the supply curve would shift, because the optimal production quantity would increase for all firms at this price control. And the market would then not clear. 

There are too many questions to play out each situation individually (and not enough information given in each scenario either), but we can answer your underlying question. What causes inflation within game economies? Inflation is just sustained price increases. The way inflation increases is by increasing the money supply, or making it easier to borrow money. Most online games I know don't have any proper banking system, and my rough guess is that places don't create informal banking sectors. Assuming that, we are left with just money supply. Unless the amount of money players gain from killing monsters and doing quests is exactly offset by how much gold is sunk into NPC vendors, then there will be inflation if players are gaining too much gold. 

We've delved into questions about the history of economics. We've pondered what the most important equations in economics are. But in every science, academic culture inevitably forms a special set of ideas that further our understanding of the most fundamental ideas we use in our work: jokes. Jokes are only funny if they set you up to have a false assumption about the material at hand, and then subvert it. In this way, jokes can be used to reveal underlying assumptions we economists might take about the world that are very well absurd, but important nonetheless to moving towards more sophisticated models. Even within mainstream economic schools, ideas like using cardinal vs. ordinal utility, or utilitarianism itself can be contentious. John Rawls's veil of ignorance or Nozick's more libertarian epistemology? Are sticky wages really realistic? What are some jokes you have encountered that would be useful for addressing an underlying assumption of an economic theory, or economics itself? (Any further recommendations for improving this question are appreciated. It can even be a community question if that would be best.) 

Seeing Ubiquitous's answer, I want to offer a concrete model I learned originally from an Exercise in Jianjun Miao's "Economic Dynamics in Discrete Time", which looked at McCall's (1970) job search model. It asked to describe the model as an optimal stopping problem. 

Hint: In second price sealed bid, it is optimal to bid your own valuation for the good. So in a reverse auction, it is optimal for each person to bid their lowest possible price they are willing to supply at. Intuitively, if one individual deviates from that strategy, it doesn't increase their chance of winning the auction or increase their chance at getting a higher priced contract, since the price they supply is based on other contractors' bids. So the expected revenue is going to be the average value of the second lowest bidder amongst ten bidders. Try to set up an integral to describe the distribution and go from there. For a normal second price auction (not reverse): $F(x)$ is the probability that the price will be less than or equal to some given $x$, and $f(x)$ is the corresponding density function. $$F(x) = \frac{x-50}{50}; \quad f(x) = F'(x) = \frac{1}{50}$$ Probability that second highest bid is $x$, with $n$ bidders: $$h(x,n) = n(n−1)f(x)(1−F(x))F(x)^{n−2}$$ Expected value of $x$ (the price): $$\int^{100}_{50} x h(x, n) dx$$ So you can easily apply a similar logic to your reverse auction. Set up $F(x)$ so that it represents the probability that the price will be greater than or equal to some given $x$. 

It doesn't really make sense to ask what the "minimum" conditions are for a market equilibrium to be Pareto efficient. By minimum do you mean least restrictive? Do you mean simplest conditions? You have to specify what market we're looking to put conditions on, because otherwise I can make up a really trivial market, give it some conditions, and say that it has a Pareto efficient equilibrium. For example, I could specify a market with two goods. Person A only likes good 1 and Person B only likes good 2. They start off with 1 unit of their preferred good. Then I say the market does not allow trading. This market is now in equilibrium and is Pareto. But it has no practical interpretation really. I'm going to interpret your question as what sort of conditions are absolutely necessary for a market equilibrium to be Pareto. In that case, just use the First Welfare Theorem: 

This question has a historical predecessor in my opinion. My answer will be inspired by Gresham's Law: bad money replaces the good. Obviously people aren't going to go around calculating the discounted value of money based on the time until expiration. Even with an expiration date, there is still going to be a face value of money, and that's going to be important. Consider in old times with gold. If you have two types of gold coins in circulation, one with more gold and one with less gold, and these two types of coins have the same face value, then people will want to keep the coins with more gold content and circulate the coins with less gold in them. Hence, "bad" money drives out the "good". The good coins could be melted down (illegally) or hoarded. The same thing would happen in modern times if you had money expire. People would circulate the bad money (close to expiring) and good money would leave (perhaps through international trade to countries that are not held to the same legal tender laws as the domestic currency's country). Today, money that is too worn out or dirty is naturally destroyed by the government or disappears, and the government reprints money to replenish the base in response. I imagine the same would happen if currency had an expiration date. 

First off, it's important to note that in the aggregate, most people tend to haggle over big ticket items more often than small purchases. However, if the preferences are flip flopped, it could be because of: 

So what are some key questions in economics? Here are some common, relevant ones, that are for the most part solved: 

At first, you could consider simply putting weights on GDP per capita and the GINI coefficient for your measure of social welfare ($W$). $$W = Y^\alpha (1-G)^{1-\alpha}$$ So social welfare depends both on income inequality and GDP. A few problems arise with this naive model. 

One of the assumptions of perfect competition is that firms are price takers. Ultimately price is determined by the quantity of goods supplied, and with perfect competition, there are infinite (or an arbitrarily large) number of firms, so a firm that changes their price by itself will simply have no business, since there are cheaper places to buy from. The quantity supplied will also not change, and will leave the prices unchanged. So what happens if all infinite of these firms tried to unilaterally raise their prices to the same level? This is maybe in some cases a Nash equilibrium, but not a coalition-proof Nash equilibrium. So firms could also unilaterally deviate from the higher price to take the whole market between themselves. 

So what are some ways of solving these issues? 1.) You could try to guess what politicans treat $\alpha$ as by looking at the GINI and GDP per capita over time and find the $\alpha$ that maximizes discounted welfare over that time period, though that makes the assumption that on average, competing/bargaining for constituent interests maximizes social welfare. 2.) The GINI coefficient is measured as $\frac{A}{A+B}$, relative to the Lorenz curve, so you could put weights on A and B as well to show that perfect equality/perfect inequality is not preferable, but then that is a whole other subjective animal. The idea is that even long term equality or inequality can affect long term GDP growth, even if current GDP looks okay. 3.) For the last point, I don't have any particular recommendations of dealing with it, except maybe accounting for lag values. That would be my general guess for approaching this kind of question anyhow. Take it for what you will. 

So going off of my comments, there's no reason to believe that just price or just quantity sold have to remain the same; when you change price, you end up moving along the demand curve. A country may indeed only import what it "needs," but if the item in question is a unit of production, and the price of it effectively falls, then that lowers the marginal cost of production for any firms who want to import that good, so that will allow them to demand more of the good. If the item in question is a final good and preferences are monotonic and locally non-satiated, then a lower price would mean more people would want to import the good if the price fell. Selling more product could lead to a higher profit if $q'p' - c(q') > qp - c(q)$, where the primes indicate new quantity and new price, and cost is a function of quantity. In the case where the benefit of a good does cap out completely, and firms/consumers in a country really don't want more of the good, then a country doesn't benefit in respect to that good when they devalue the currency, but you'll be hard pressed to find examples of that. 

Full disclosure: this problem was part of a final exam that none of our class could really solve definitively. Below the general form is a specific utility function we worked with that I'll try to replicate my work for. Any help on the solution method would be good; specifically, it seems Euler's equations/steady states would be better for this particular form of question rather than using a Bellman, but any guidance on either method would be appreciated. 

First, looking at the book's argument. We create a sequence $(\alpha^m)_{m \in N} \to \alpha \in \mathbb{R}_+^N$. Then if $U$ is continuous, we should get $$(\alpha^m)_{m \in \mathbb{N}} \to \alpha \implies U(\alpha^m)_{m \in \mathbb{N}} \to U(\alpha)$$ $\exists \ \delta > 0$ s.t. $\alpha^m \leq (\delta,...,\delta) \ \forall \ m$ Since $U(\delta,...,\delta)$ is finite, $z \to u(\sum_n \delta z_n)$ is integrable. Since $u(\cdot)$ monotone and returns are nonnegative with prob. zero: $$u(\sum_n \alpha_n^m z_n) \leq u(\sum_n \delta z_n) \ \forall \ m, (z_1,...,z_N)$$ Since $u(\cdot)$ continuous, $$u(\sum_n \alpha_n^m z_n) \to u(\sum_n \alpha_n z_n)$$ for almost all $(z_1,...,z_N)$ Here the book decides to apply Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem. We are in some measure space $(S, \Sigma, \mu)$ which states that for some sequence of functions ${f_n}$, if it pointwise converges to some function $f$ and $$\mid f_n(x) \mid \leq g(x) \ \forall n \quad \text{in index}, \ \forall x \in S$$ (recall we constructed $g(x)$ earlier) Then $F$ is integrable and $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_S \mid f_n - f \ \mid d \mu = 0$$ $$\implies \int_S \mid f_n - f \ \mid d \mu \to f d \mu$$ So $$\int u(\sum_n \alpha_n^m x_n) dF(x_1,...,x_N) \to \int u(\sum_n \alpha_n x_n) dF(x_1,...,x_N)$$ $$\implies U(\alpha^m)_{m \in \mathbb{N}} \to U(\alpha)$$ 

I'd like to see exactly who said this as well, if you have the citation. Otherwise it's just hearsay. I think your uncles and aunts have been influencing you with a little bit of their hindsight bias. 3.) You noted that, 

In this case, this law on markets could be applied to your money market. Of course, Say's law has its weaknesses and doesn't always uniformly hold, given that markets aren't always in equilibrium. It is probably still a good guiding principle for the money market though. For example, debt and fractional reserve banking seem to indicate, as you note, that money supply doesn't match money demand, but people are consumption smoothing creatures. Their behavior may be matching their demand over multiple periods with supply (their time-path of income) over multiple periods. A simpler explanation: money supply is also more than just the money base of course. Modern measures of the money supply are meant to capture the reserve rate. 

Or in other words, for any efficient (Pareto) allocation, there exists a price vector such that the price vector and optimal bundle represent a quasi-equilibrium with transfers. Also note that you need preferences to be convex and locally non-satiated and the production set must be convex. So now what happens when $U_i(c_i) = \min \left\{\frac{c_1^P}{\alpha_1},...,\frac{c_N^P}{\alpha_N}\right\}$? It is indeed continuous, locally non-satiated and quasi-concave. 

You are trying to find the solution of $K$ and $L$ in terms of $Q$ to derive the total cost function with respect to quantity. Page 13 of this lecture has the exact question you are interested in. (Google is your friend.) 

I do not understand your query about "what about $a$ and $b$?" The answer to your question at large is yes. Utility functions represent the same preferences when monotonically transformed. That is, 

It should come to no surprise that some government debt is sometimes optimal, even if the country can pay off all its debt. The present value of paying off the interest rate on a loan in perpetuity and paying off the entirety of the loan in one go are equal to each other, but you can imagine a government might not be indifferent between those two options. For example, a short-sighted government will want to put off paying back any loans to the next government, for all else equal. (There are of course other reasons to hold some debt, outside the scope of this question.) Speaking of which, now consider a country that chronically keeps increasing its debt relative to its output. As suggested under Ricardian Equivalence, consumers won't respond to fiscal policy, because they know taxes will have to increase in the future. There are plenty of different exceptions that can break Ricardian Equivalence (e.g. consumers can be shortsighted too) but a high GDP to debt ratio suggests that a government will not only face increasing payments/spending on interest instead of government goods and services, but also that fiscal policy will become less effective. 

The question you are showing work out for where $S(w) = 0.01W - 100$ means that you will have no nurses who want to work unless you have a minimum wage of over 10,000 per week, and since the marginal benefit of every nurse is 2,000 per week, this hospital will not be in business. Your original question you typed at the very beginning is making you work with $S(w) = 0.1W - 100$. So let's try approaching that question instead. It also seems you need some help understanding how to get expenditure, so let's go through that too. First, we find inverse supply. $$W = 10S + 1000$$ Expenditure is the price of labor times quantity of labor. $$E = WS = 10S^2 + 1000S$$ The derivative of this is your marginal expenditure. $$\frac{dE}{dS} = 20S + 1000$$ Set up the profit maximization problem and take the derivative (which we set to zero). $$\begin{align} \pi & = 2000S - (10S^2 + 1000S) \\ \frac{d\pi}{dS} & = 2000 - 20S - 1000 = 0\\ & = 1000 = 20S\\ \implies & \boxed{S^* = 50} \\ \end{align}$$ Then to calculate wage, you just plug in the optimal supply to your inverse supply function. To find dead-weight loss, try drawing out a graph for labor supply and demand. Labor demand should be a straight line across from $W = 2000$. Labor supply was given to you. Notice where the labor supplied equals labor demand. What would $S$ equal there and what wage would be set there? It should be different from the $S^*$ we got. That should give you enough insight to the rest of the question.
