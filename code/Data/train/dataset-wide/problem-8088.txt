Here are six fairly specific examples that I know of; in each case, the writers have welcomed collaboration. 

Let $\Omega_n^O$ denote the abelian group of cobordism classes of closed, unoriented manifolds of dimension $n$, and let $d(n) := \lvert\Omega_n^O\rvert$. What are the asymptotics of $d(n)$? It's possible to express $\log_2 d(n)$ as a modified partition function: by work of Thom, $\Omega_n^O$ is an $\mathbb F_2$-vector space with a basis of the form $$\{x_{\ell_1,\dotsc,\ell_j}\mid \ell_1 + \dotsb + \ell_j = n, \ell_i \ne 2^r - 1\},\qquad\qquad (*)$$ so $\dim_{\mathbb F_2}\Omega_n^O = \log_2 d(n)$ is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into numbers that are not one less than a power of 2. Hence if $P(n)$ denotes the usual partition function, $d(n) = O(2^{P(n)})$. Is this sharp? What about lower bounds? 

I've noticed a couple of conference titles which reference something called "topology in dimension 3.5," such as this one and this one. This subject seems quite mysterious to me — it looks like it's part of geometric topology, but I'm guessing it's not about 3.5-dimensional manifolds, so what kinds of things are studied in 3.5-dimensional topology? 

In order for integration of differential forms to make sense, we need $M_1,\dotsc,M_k$ to be oriented. Let $\omega_i\in\Omega^m(M_i)$ be such that $\int_{M_i}\omega_i = 1$. Since $M_1,\dotsc,M_k$ are pairwise disjoint, compact subsets of $\mathbb R^n$, then they have open neighborhoods $U_1\supset M_1,\dotsc, U_k\supset M_k$ such that the $U_i$s are pairwise disjoint (see this Math.SE post). Let $h_i$ be a smooth function supported in $U_i$ and equal to 1 on $M_i$; it's a theorem that these functions exist. The $\alpha_j$ in question is $$\alpha_j := \sum_{\ell=1}^k \lambda_{\ell j} h_\ell\omega_\ell.$$ When restricted to $M_i$, $h_i = 1$ and $h_j = 0$ if $j\ne i$, so $\alpha_j|_{M_i} = \lambda_{ij}\omega_i$ and $$\int_{M_i} \alpha_j = \lambda_{ij}.$$ 

It's not true. Let $C_2$ denote a group of order 2, $X$ be a point with a trivial $C_2$-action, and $Y = C_2$ with action by left multiplication. Let $EC_2$ denote a contractible space with a free $C_2$-action, e.g. the infinite-dimensional sphere with the antipodal map, so that $(-)^{hC_2} = \mathrm{Map}_{C_2}(EC_2, -)$. The crush map $EC_2\to \mathrm{pt}$ is the unique map $EC_2\to X$, and is equivariant, so $X^{hC_2} = \mathrm{pt}$. However, $\mathrm{Map}_{C_2}(EC_2, Y) = \varnothing$, because $EC_2$ is connected, so any map $f\colon EC_2\to Y$ must factor through one of the connected components of $C_2$. The $C_2$-action on $EC_2$ preserves connected components, but the $C_2$-action on $Y$ does not, so $f$ cannot be equivariant. Hence $X^{hC_2} * Y^{hC_2} = \mathrm{pt} * \varnothing = \varnothing$. $X*Y$ is homeomorphic as a $C_2$-space to $[-1,1]$ with the sign action (that is, the nonidentity element of $C_2$ sends $x\mapsto -x$). Hence $(X*Y)^{hC_2} = \mathrm{Map}_{C_2}(EC_2, [-1,1])$, and this is nonempty, e.g. it contains the map sending $EC_2$ to $0$. 

Here's an approach that works up to about dimension 7, outlined by Freed-Hopkins, §10, and explained in more detail by Campbell. There's a weak equivalence $\Sigma^{-1} \mathrm{MPin}^-\simeq \mathrm{MSpin}\wedge \mathrm{MTO}_1$, where $\mathrm{MTO}_1$ is a Madsen-Tillman spectrum, the Thom spectrum of the virtual vector bundle $(\underline{\mathbb R} - S)\to B\mathrm O_1$, where $\underline{\mathbb R}$ is the trivial line bundle and $S\to B\mathrm O_1$ is the tautological line bundle. Hence, to understand $\Omega_d^{\mathrm{Pin}^-}(B\mathbb Z/2)$, it suffices to understand the homotopy groups of $\mathrm{MSpin}\wedge\mathrm{MTO_1}\wedge B\mathbb Z/2$. We'll use the Adams spectral sequence, but there's a key trick that makes it simpler. Let $\mathcal A(1)$ denote the subalgebra of the Steenrod algebra generated by $\mathrm{Sq}^1$ and $\mathrm{Sq}^2$. Then, Anderson, Brown, and Peterson proved that, as $\mathcal A$-modules, $$ H^*(\mathrm{MSpin};\mathbb F_2)\cong \mathcal A\otimes_{\mathcal A(1)} (\mathbb F_2\oplus M),$$ where $M$ is a graded $\mathcal A(1)$-module which is $0$ in dimension less than 8. Thus we can invoke a change-of-rings theorem for the $E_2$-page of the Adams spectral sequence for $\mathrm{MSpin}\wedge\mathrm{MTO_1}\wedge B\mathbb Z/2$: using the Adams grading, when $t -s < 8$, \begin{align*} E_2^{s,t} &= \mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{s,t}(H^*(\mathrm{MSpin}\wedge\mathrm{MTO_1}\wedge B\mathbb Z/2; \mathbb F_2), \mathbb F_2)\\ &\cong \mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{s,t}((A\otimes_{\mathcal A(1)} \mathbb F_2)\otimes H^*(\mathrm{MTO_1}\wedge B\mathbb Z/2; \mathbb F_2), \mathbb F_2)\\ &\cong \mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal A(1)}^{s,t}(H^*(\mathrm{MTO_1}\wedge B\mathbb Z/2; \mathbb F_2), \mathbb F_2). \end{align*} Explicitly calculating this is tractable, because $\mathcal A(1)$ is small and we're only going up to dimension 7. 

Yes. Let $E\to T^2$ be the $S^2$-bundle over the torus $T^2$ obtained by gluing the trivial bundle over $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ by the identity map in the first coordinate and a reflection in the second coordinate. The torus admits the structure of a smooth complex projective variety, but $E$ isn't orientable, so cannot be diffeomorphic to a smooth complex variety. 

This does not work in general: the problem is you have no control over $m$. Let $r = 1$. There's a sequence of embeddings of fields $$\mathit{GF}(p)\subset\mathit{GF}(p^2)\subset\mathit{GF}(p^4)\subset\mathit{GF}(p^8)\subset\dotsb.$$ Let $S = \mathit{GF}(p^2)$, so $n = 2$. Let $W$ be any $2$-dimensional subspace of $\mathit{GF}(p^4)$ containing the identity but not equal to $S$. Let $K = \mathit{GF}(p^8)$. $W$ is still a $2$-dimensional subspace of $K$, but since $\mathit{GF}(p^8)\hookrightarrow K$ as a subfield, any element of $W$ can generate at most $\mathit{GF}(p^4)$, which is not all of $K$. For $r\ne 1$, you can do the same thing with $$\mathit{GF}(p^r)\subset\mathit{GF}(p^{2r})\subset\mathit{GF}(p^{4r})\subset\mathit{GF}(p^{8r})\subset\dotsb.$$ 

Regarding preexisting references, I found a few examples of people using Grothendieck groups of oriented or spin vector bundles, but no cohomology theories or spectra. I'll leave them here in case anyone else is interested. For $\mathit{KSpin}$: 

In all of these examples, the torsion information is essential: a $\mathbb Z/2$ classification means there's a phase which is nontrivial, but such that two copies of it stacked together can be continuously deformed to a trivial phase. Examples of such phases have come up in condensed-matter theory and are expected to display this behavior in experiments. 

The existence or nonexistence of a spin structure on a smooth manifold $M$ is a topological question, in that it does not depend on the choice of a Riemannian metric on $M$. Spin structures are obstructed by the second Stiefel-Whitney class $w_2\in H^2(M;\mathbb Z/2)$, in that $M$ admits a spin structure iff $w_2(TM) = 0$. Since $M^2 = [s_0,\infty)\times S^{n-1}$, its tangent bundle decomposes as $$TM^3 \cong \pi_1^*T([s_0,\infty)) \oplus \pi_2^*TS^{n-1},$$ where $\pi_1,\pi_2$ are the projections from $M^n$ onto its two components. Since $[s_0,\infty)$ is contractible, its tangent bundle is trivial. The tangent bundle to $S^{n-1}$ is stably trivial, since embedding $S^{n-1}\hookrightarrow\mathbb R^n$ realizes $\underline{\mathbb R}^n \cong T\mathbb R^n|_{S^{n-1}} = TS^n\oplus\nu$, where $\nu$ is the normal bundle to the embedding, and $\nu$ is a trivial bundle. Since $w_2$ is a stable characteristic class, it vanishes on stably trivial vector bundles, so $w_2(M^n) = 0$, and therefore $M^n$ admits a spin structure. 

The idea is that Khovanov homology is a functor out of a category of tangle cobordisms. Bar-Natan's notes are a great reference for this. Khovanov (2002) sets this up in a "tangle 2-category:" the objects are sets of even numbers of oriented points. The 1-morphisms are planar diagrams of cobordisms between them (so that which line in a crossing is on top is important). Hence a 1-morphism is a (diagram of a) tangle, and 2-morphisms are diagrams of oriented tangle cobordisms. Khovanov constructed Khovanov homology as a 2-functor from this category to a category built out of chain complexes of abelian groups. There are subtleties to this setup, however: Jacobsson (2003) showed that it's not functorial when generalized to $\mathbb Z[c]$-modules. However, this is not why people say Khovanov homology is the categorification of the Jones polynomial. Mike Shulman's comment is right: categorification doesn't just mean "turn things into categories," but is a vaguely defined process of adding categorical structure to things: replacing sets with vector spaces or abelian groups; functions with functors or sheaves; rings with tensor categories; and so forth. Replacing a polynomial with a bigraded abelian group fits into this paradigm, even in the absence of an explicit category or functoriality. The many answers to this question are great for explaining how to think about categorification. 

Through extended TQFT and the cobordism hypothesis, many questions in topological quantum field theory have been turned into explicit questions about higher category theory. A TQFT is formalized as a symmetric monoidal functor $Z\colon\mathsf{Bord}_n\to\mathsf C$, where $\mathsf C$ is some symmetric monoidal $(\infty, n)$-category and $\mathsf{Bord}_n$ is the symmetric monoidal cobordism $(\infty, n)$-category. Given a group homomorphism $\rho\colon H_n\to \mathrm O_n$, it's possible to consider manifolds with $H_n$-structure, e.g. $\mathrm{SO}_n$ gives an orientation, $\mathrm{Spin}_n$ gives a spin structure, and define a cobordism category of manifolds with $H_n$-structure and hence TQFTs with $H_n$-structure. The cobordism hypothesis says that a TQFT is determined by the object of $\mathsf C$ it assigns to a point, and further characterizes which objects can occur: a TQFT with $H_n$-structure is the same data as an $H_n$-homotopy fixed point in the subcategory of fully dualizable objects in $\mathsf C$. (For more on the cobordism hypothesis, check out Dan Freed's exposition.) For example, an $\mathrm{SO}_2$-homotopy fixed point in the Morita 2-category of algebras is the same thing as a semisimple Frobenius algebra, and this implies that a semisimple Frobenius algebra determines and is determined by a 2D oriented TQFT. More generally, given a dimension and a symmetry type $H_n\to\mathrm O_n$, we would like a similar algebraic characterization, so that we can study TQFTs with algebra and then use algebra to construct TQFTs. In dimension 3, there are examples of algebraic constructions of TQFTs, most notably the Turaev-Viro-Barratt-Westbury (TVBW) construction, whose input data is a spherical fusion category. So these should relate to $\mathrm{SO}_3$-homotopy fixed point structures in some symmetric monoidal 3-category, and characterizing these is as far as I know an open question. This and several related questions are examined by Douglas, Schommer-Pries, and Snyder, among others. 

Eric Peterson's formal geometry notes, on using bordism operations and some formal algebraic geometry in homotopy theory. Though the class is complete, the notes are still in progress. Eric Peterson's vector fields on spheres notes, from a class taught by Haynes Miller. These notes are still in progress. Sanath Devalapurkar's notes from two algebraic topology classes taught by Haynes Miller. Andy Neitzke's notes on applications of quantum field theory to geometry, for a class currently being taught at UT Austin (so the notes are still in progress). Andy Neitzke's notes on the moduli space of Higgs bundles, from a class taught a few years ago. My notes on equivariant homotopy theory, from a class taught by Andrew Blumberg. The notes are stable, but not completed. 

There are other places integral information is, well, integral: for example, if an electron moves in a loop $\ell$ around a magnetic monopole, the value of the action depends on the winding number of $\ell$, producing discrete invariants. 

The example $G = \mathbb Z/2$ and $M = \mathbb{RP}^3$ works. The inclusion $\mathbb Z/2\to\{\pm 1\}\subset\mathrm U(1)$ induces an isomorphism $H^3(B\mathbb Z/2, \mathbb Z/2)\to H^3(B\mathbb Z/2, \mathrm U(1))$, so we can pull the cocycles back to $\mathbb Z/2$ cohomology and evaluate on the $\mathbb Z/2$ fundamental class. $\mathbb{RP}^3$ has two isomorphism classes of principal $\mathbb Z/2$-bundles, the trivial bundle $\varepsilon$ and the connected double cover $\xi$. Each determines a classifying map to $B\mathbb Z/2$, and hence a map in cohomology $\phi^*\colon H^*(B\mathbb Z/2; \mathbb Z/2)\cong \mathbb Z/2[\alpha]\to H^*(\mathbb{RP}^3; \mathbb Z/2)\cong \mathbb Z/2[x]/(x^4)$. For $\varepsilon$, this is the zero map; for $\xi$, this is the ring homomorphism induced by $\alpha\mapsto x$. Since $H^3(B\mathbb Z/2;\mathbb Z/2)\cong\mathbb Z/2$, there are two cohomology classes of cocycles. Let $\omega$ be a coboundary, so that $\phi^*\omega = 0$ for all principal $\mathbb Z/2$-bundles, and hence the Dijkgraaf-Witten partition function is $$\mathrm{DW}_{\mathbb Z/2, 0}(\mathbb{RP}^3) = \underbrace{\frac{e^{i\pi(0)}}{2}}_{\text{from } \varepsilon} + \underbrace{\frac{e^{i\pi(0)}}{2}}_{\text{from } \xi} = 1.$$ Let $\omega$ be a cocycle in the other cohomology class (in the notation above, $\alpha^3$). Then, $\varepsilon$ pulls it back to $0$, but $\xi$ pulls it back to $x^3$, and $\langle x^3, [\mathbb{RP}^3]\rangle = 1$, so $$\mathrm{DW}_{\mathbb Z/2, \alpha^3}(\mathbb{RP}^3) = \underbrace{\frac{e^{i\pi(0)}}{2}}_{\text{from } \varepsilon} + \underbrace{\frac{e^{i\pi(1)}}{2}}_{\text{from } \xi} = \frac 12 - \frac 12= 0.$$ 

Unoriented cobordism: can be read off from the structure of the unoriented cobordism ring (calculated in Thom's thesis): $\Omega_6^O = (\mathbb Z/2)^3$, $\Omega_7^O = \mathbb Z/2$, $\Omega_8^O = (\mathbb Z/2)^5$, $\Omega_9^O = (\mathbb Z/2)^3$, and $\Omega_{10}^O = (\mathbb Z/2)^8$. Oriented cobordism: in Milnor and Stasheff, Characteristic Classes, end of §17, p. 203. $\Omega_1^{SO} = 0$, $\Omega_2^{SO} = 0$, $\Omega_3^{SO} = 0$, $\Omega_4^{SO} = \mathbb Z$, $\Omega_5^{SO} = \mathbb Z/2$, $\Omega_6^{SO} = \Omega_7^{SO} = 0$, $\Omega_8^{SO} = \mathbb Z^2$, $\Omega_9^{SO} = (\mathbb Z/2)^2$, and $\Omega_{10}^{SO} = \mathbb Z/2$. 

Schwede's symmetric spectra book project provides point-set models of many important spectra as symmetric spectra, including (in §I.1) the sphere spectrum, Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra, several Thom spectra, and $\mathit{ku}$ and (in §I.3) endomorphism ring spectra, matrix ring spectra, group ring spectra, and algebraic $K$-theory. Is there an analogous reference for examples constructed as orthogonal spectra? I'm hoping to use them to better grasp the concept of orthogonal spectra and how to manipulate them. So far, the best reference I've found has been Schwede's notes again: the constructions of $\mathit{MO}$ and $\mathit{ku}$ pass through orthogonal spectra, and I should be able to adapt this to some other situations. May-Quinn-Ray also discuss Thom spectra as orthogonal spectra (under the name $\mathscr I^*$-prefunctors). 

On $\mathbb R$, one can construct a sequence of $C_c^1$ functions $u_n$ such that $\|u_n\| > n-1$ but $\|u_n'\| \le 2$, providing a counterexample for any $C$, so this inequality cannot hold. The idea is to let $u_n$ be $1$ on $[1,n]$, be $0$ on $\mathbb R\setminus (0, n+1)$, and not change too quickly in between. An explicit example is given by $$ u_n(x) = \begin{cases} 1, &x\in[0,n]\\ x^2, &x\in[0,1/2)\\ 1 - (x-1)^2, &x\in [1/2, 1)\\1-(x-n)^2, &x\in(n, n+1/2)\\(x-(n+1))^2, &x\in[n+1/2, n+1)\\0, &\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}$$ $u_n$ is supported in $[0,n+1]$, and since $u_n\ge\chi_{[1,n]}$, then $\|u_n\|_{L^2}\ge \|\chi_{[1,n]}\|_{L^2} = n-1$. $u_n'$ is supported in $[0,1]\cup[n,n+1]$, is continuous, and is bounded above by $u'(1/2) = 1$, so $\|u_n'\|_{L^2}\le 2$. 

If $H\to\mathrm O$ is a tangential structure (e.g. orientation, spin), let $\mathsf{Bord}_2^H$ denote the category whose objects are 1-dimensional manifolds with $H$-structure and whose morphisms $M_1\to M_2$ are diffeomorphism classes of bordisms from $M_1$ to $M_2$ with $H$-structure. This category is symmetric monoidal under disjoint union. The structure of the oriented bordism category $\mathsf{Bord}_2^{\mathrm{SO}}$ is well-known, as part of the proof that a 2D oriented TQFT is equivalent to a Frobenius algebra. (Joachim Kock has a good set of notes on the subject.) The structure of the spin bordism category was worked out by Moore and Segal in "$D$-branes and $K$-theory in 2D topological field theory," and further discussed in a paper of Gunningham. My question is: have descriptions of the categories $\mathsf{Bord}_2^{\mathrm{Pin}^+}$ and $\mathsf{Bord}_2^{\mathrm{Pin}^-}$ been written down? I'm interested in particular in 2D extended TQFT, hence in the relevant bordism 2-categories, but a nonextended description would still be helpful. 

The state space $Z_{\mathcal T}(M^{n-1}) := \mathbb C[[M, \mathcal T]]$, so for $n = 3$, the first property doesn't hold: $\dim Z_{\mathcal T}(S^2) = |\pi_2(\mathcal T)|$. A similar problem occurs for $n = 2$. If $n > 3$, then $[S^{n-1}, \mathcal T] = 0$, so the first property holds. The second property does not quite hold: $[S^n, \mathcal T] = 0$, but we have to calculate the weighting. Since $\mathrm{Map}(S^n, \mathcal T)\simeq\mathrm{Map}(\mathrm{pt}, \mathcal T)\cong \mathcal T$, $$Z_{\mathcal T}(S^n) = \frac{|\pi_2(\mathcal T)|}{|\pi_1(\mathcal T)|},$$ which is frequently not equal to 1. I don't know about the unweighted version you mentioned, since it doesn't come from a TQFT as far as I know. 

I don't know very much about this, but Chuu-Lian Terng and Karen Uhlenbeck have used loop groups and some Lie theory to solve certain PDEs: $URL$ 

A priori, the above method cannot detect torsion away from the prime 2. But $\Omega_*^{\mathrm{Pin^-}}(B\mathbb Z/2)$ cannot have any $p$-torsion for an odd prime $p$: the $E^2$-page for the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence computing $\Omega_*^{\mathrm{Pin^-}}(B\mathbb Z/2)_{(p)}$ is $$E^2_{q_1,q_2} = H_{q_1}(B\mathbb Z/2; \Omega_{q_2}^{\mathrm{Pin}^-})_{(p)},$$ but the homology of $B\mathbb Z/2$ has no $p$-torsion when $p\ne 2$, so the spectral sequence vanishes. Therefore its $E^\infty$-page, the $p$-localization of $\Omega_*^{\mathrm{Pin^-}}(B\mathbb Z/2)$, is trivial, so the above method suffices (for $*\le 7$). 

If $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space, we can consider the Grothendieck ring of real vector bundles on $X$, $\mathit{KO}^0(X)$, and this extends to a generalized cohomology theory represented by a ring spectrum $\mathit{KO}$. Using complex vector bundles, we get another generalized cohomology theory, represented by $\mathit{KU}$. Using quaternionic vector bundles, we get a third one, represented by $\mathit{KSp} \simeq \Sigma^4\mathit{KO}$. In the same way, one can define the Grothendieck ring of oriented vector bundles $\mathit{KSO}(X)$, spin vector bundles $\mathit{KSpin}(X)$, and so on for any $G$-structure. Do these constructions extend to spectra $\mathit{KSO}$, $\mathit{KSpin}$, and so on? If not, what issues arise? The first concern I would imagine is a failure of Bott periodicity, but $\pi_k(\mathit{SO})$ and $\pi_k(\mathit{Spin})$ agree with $\pi_k(O)$ for $k\ge 2$, so in at least these cases some sort of construction might be possible. An alternative approach sidestepping Bott periodicity would be to use algebraic $K$-theory: if $\mathsf{Vect}_{k}$ denotes the topological symmetric monoidal category of $k$-vector spaces, then $K(\mathsf{Vect}_{\mathbb R}) = \mathit{ko}$ and $K(\mathsf{Vect}_{\mathbb C}) = \mathit{ku}$. So if $\mathsf{Vect}^{\mathrm{or}}$ denotes the topological symmetric monoidal category of oriented real vector spaces, would it be reasonable to define $\mathit{kso}:= K(\mathsf{Vect}^{\mathrm{or}})$? Is this an interesting object? This could also generalize to $G$-structures. Someone must have thought about this, but I can't find it written down anywhere. Edit: Though I've accepted Denis' excellent answer, I would still be interested to learn of existing references which consider these kinds of cohomology theories/spectra. 

As Kevin Walker pointed out in a comment, Dijkgraaf-Witten invariants are weighted by $1/\mathrm{Stab}(\rho)$. In the same way, the Yetter invariant for $\mathcal T$ and $M$ is generally defined such that it's weighted using the 2-groupoid cardinality of $\pi_{\le 2}\mathrm{Map}(M, \mathcal T)$, so that the invariant is $$\sum_{[f\colon M\to\mathcal T]} \frac{|\pi_2(\mathrm{Map}(M, \mathcal T), f)|}{|\pi_1(\mathrm{Map}(M, \mathcal T), f)|}.$$ If we use this normalization, the Yetter invariants are the partition functions of a TQFT $Z_{\mathcal T}$, usually called the Yetter model. In this case, a different MathOverflow answer by Kevin Walker tells us that $Z_{\mathcal T}$ is multiplicative under connect sum iff
