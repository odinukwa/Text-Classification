Is there a single suitable reference to study for the smooth manifold (geometry) half of a typical Topology/Geometry PhD preliminary exam at an average AMS group I school? (Note: I know details about the presentation of these prelim tests varies, but at many schools there is a single Topology/Geometry exam, half of which is roughly smooth manifolds "Geometry" and the other half algebraic topology "Topology") Being a bibliophile, I've invested some time looking around at various qualifying exam syllabi until something stuck out: for Topology, relatively fewer books are listed. It seems quite often a book like Algebraic Topology by Hatcher is listed along with one or two others (seemingly to cover certain small gaps). Also, for Algebra, a few books often suffice... the books by Lang, Jacobson, and Dummit & Foote are often listed. One or two of these together with an outlier often suffice. Compare that to the situation with smooth manifolds. One site (which I lost track of... UCR?) I saw listed as many as 8 books as references for the topic! Many universities seem to use Guillemin & Pollack despite teaching manifolds abstractly, rather than as submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is understandable, but somewhat pedagogically suspect and in my own experience as a student, confusing. It appears that the topic of smooth manifolds needs an expository text that fills the same role for Geometry as does Algebraic Topology (Hatcher) does for Topology. Some sensible criteria: 

I asked this question already in mathstackexchange but got no answer, so I ask it again here. Let $\mathbb{H}_{g}$ be the Siegel upper half space, i.e., the set of complex symmetric $g\times g$ matrices with positive-definite imaginary part. Royden in his article "inavariant metrics on Teichmüller space" gives the inifinitesimal form of the Kobayashi distance (metric) on $\mathbb{H}_{g}$ as the operator norm $\frac{1}{2}||Y^{-1/2} dZ Y^{-1/2}||$. My question is what is the Kobayashi distance between two given points on $\mathbb{H}_{g}$? For example, when $g=1$, (i.e., $\mathbb{H}_{g}=\mathbb{H}_{1}$ is the upper half plane) it is well-konwn that the Kobayashi distance (finite version of the Kobayashi metric given above) between $z$ and $w$ in $\mathbb{H}$ is the usual hyperbolic distance $d_{\mathbb{H}}(z,w)$. What is the generalization of this to the upper half space? 

TVS's $V$ of larger and larger cardinality become more and more pathological / difficult / intractable or, There is a cardinal $A_{max}$ so that almost all pathological behavior exhibited in any TVS is exhibited in a TVS of density $A$ less than or equal to $A_{max}$. 

First, some background: recently in learning more about functional programming I saw one use for coproducts that surprised me a little bit: A function $f: A \rightarrow B \coprod C$ may result when considering a computation that starts with an $a \in A$ and results with an element of $B$ unless "something exceptional happens" in which case it results in an element in $C$ that describes / paramaterizes some sort of 

If $f: X \rightarrow C$ is the universal family of false elliptic curves (i.e. abelian surfaces $A$ such that $End(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is a totally indefinite quaternion algebra over $\mathbb{Q}$), then $C$ is a Shimura curve. My question is : How does the the variation of Hodge structures(VHS) of this universal family look like? Of course I know that for any family of abelian varieties over a Shimura curve, the VHS has the form $R^{1}f_{*}\mathbb{C}= (\mathbb{L} \otimes \mathbb{T}) \bigoplus \mathbb{U}$ where $\mathbb{U}$ and $\mathbb{T}$ are unitary and $\mathbb{L}$ is uniformizing, but I want a more specific description in the case of a universal family of false elliptic curves. 

If $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is a cyclic cover of $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ with Galois group $\mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$ and thus with the (affine) formula $y^{m}= (x_{1}-a_{1})^{t_{1}}....(x_{n}-a_{n})^{t_{n}}$ there is a Galois group decomposition on the cohomolgy $H^{1}(C, \mathbb{C})$ (or more generally on the sheaf $R^{1} \pi_{*} \mathbb{C}$ ) and the dimension of the eigenspace with respect to the character $j \in \mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$ is given by the formula $-1+ \sum_{i=1}^n < jt_{i}/m> $ (where $< x>$ denotes the franctional part of the number $x$ ) . Now if the Galois group of the covering $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is not cyclic, is there a formula that computes the dimension of the eigenspaces? Or generally how can one compute the dimension of the eigenspaces? For simplicity you can always assume that the covering $\pi$ is abelian (i.e. the Galois group is abelian) and thereof the fiber product of cyclic covers. 

More concretely, are there other cardinality related restrictions one can put on a TVS to obtain decent results, or are such pursuits apparently fruitless? Is any cardinality restriction looser than separability useful? [Note: Model Theory would have a lot to say about this, but I'm looking for additional perspectives as well. In addition, we could ask the same question about other structures, but I'd like to start with something concrete.] 

First, some setup: So: given a commutative ring $R$, let $Ideals(R)$ be set of ideals of $R$ and let $IdealClosure(R)$ be the set of closure operations $cl: \mathcal{P}(R) \rightarrow Ideals(R)$. In other words, let $IdealClosure(R)$ be the set of functions $cl: \mathcal{P}(R) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(R)$ such that 

If $f: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}_{2g+2}$ is a general family of hyperelliptic curves (defined over $\mathbb{C}$), we know that the algebraic connected monodromy group $Mon^{0}$ of this family is equal to the full symplectic group. Now if we have a 1-parameter family of hyperelliptic curves given for example by the expression $y^{2}= (x-h_{1}(t))....(x-h_{2g+2}(t))$ where $t$ is the parameter in $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ and the $h_{i}$ are holomorphic functions in $t$, is the group $Mon^{0}$ of this family also equal to the full symplectic group $Sp_{2g+2}$? if not, how can one compute the monodromy group of such family? 

In the literature, in many places the computations of Cohomology of the affine singular and projective smooth models are done interchangeably. Let us work with curves. For example, if $\pi:Y\to \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is a cyclic cover of the $\mathbb{P}^{1}$, then $Y$ is projective and smooth but in in practical cohomological computations the affine singular model $X$ defined by the equation $X:=\{y^l=\prod (x-a_k)^{d_k}\}$ is used. Of course $Y$ is the normalization of $X$ and I know that $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})\cong H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$. But for example when the curve is defined over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$ and you compute the Hasse-Witt matrix $F:H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})\to H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ how can one still use the basis of $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$ and computations be in terms of $a_k$ and $d_k$ above (which come from $X$)? The precise example that I have in mind is the following: (Taken from the paper I. Bouw, The p-rank of ramified covers of curves. Compositio Math. 126 (2001), 295–322.). The standard way of computing the above Hasse-Witt matrix is to decompose the cohomology $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ in to eigenspaces $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})_{i}$ of the natural $\mathbb{Z}/l \mathbb{Z}$-action for $1\leq i\leq l-1$. Then a basis for $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})_{i}$ is computed by taking two open sets $V_1=\pi^{-1}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus \infty)$ and $V_2=\pi^{-1}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus \{0\})$. Then $\Gamma(V_1,\mathcal{O}_{V_1})=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{l-1} k[x]v_i$ where $v_i=y^i \prod (x-a_k)^{-[id_k/l]}$. My problem/question is: $v_i$ is only a rational section (not regular) and on $X$ (not $Y$) so how can it be viewed as a regular section? If you pull it back to $Y$ to become a regular function, then first of all the equation of $v_i$ certainly changes and secondly, how come that the resulting matrix $F$ is still the same, although we are using a basis of $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$ (instead of $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$)? (Because if $F:V\to V$ and you change the basis, of course the matrix of $F$ changes too!) 

Recently I have come across the books Combinatorial Commutative Algebra by Miller and Sturmfels along with Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra by Stanley. I will soon own a copy of each. I also purchased a used copy of Multiplicities and Chern Classes in Local Algebra by Roberts. My question is about the edge of research in commutative algebra. Which books (such as the above?) represent the edge of current research? By that I mean complete comprehension of such a book would prepare one to tackle a valuable (but doable) open problem for graduate research. Perhaps this edge is better represented by articles and papers. Are there a lot of these being published and how has this varied over time? I'm trying to get at the current state of the area of commutative algebra by considering the more concrete topic of current literature on the topic, especially the literature that is spawning new open problems. 

Let $X$ be a compact Shimura curve. If we remove finitely many points from this curve, do we neccessarily get a "non-compact Shimura curve"? I have some reasons to believe that the answer is negative, but don't have a proof nor a counter example. However if the answer is really No, does there exist a well-known structure / property for this punctured Shimura curve? 

I am trying to understand the Segal-Sugawara construction from the book "vertex algebras and algebraic curves" by Frenkel, Ben-Zvi in 3.4.8. As an absolute layman in the area of mathematical physics and vertex algebras, I have difficulties to understand the arguments there, as it seems many details in the proof have been omitted. More concretely, the computations of $S_n.J^{b}_{-1}v_k$ for $n=-1,0,1$ are still obscure for me. Could anyone explain these computations with more details?
