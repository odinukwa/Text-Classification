Let $M$ be a closed orientable $n$-manifold containing the compact set $X$. Given an $n-q-1$-cocyle on $X$ (I am choosing this degree just to match with the notation of the Wikipedia article to which you linked), we extend it to some small open neighbourhood $U$ of $X$. By Lefschetz--Poincare duality on the open manifold $U$, we can convert this $n-q-1$-cocylce into a Borel--Moore cycle (i.e. a locally-finite cycle made up of infinitely many simplices) on $U$ of degree $q+1$. Throwing away those simplices lying in $U \setminus X$, we obtain a usual (i.e. finitely supported) cycle giving a class in $H_{q+1}(U,U\setminus X) = H_{q+1}(M,M\setminus X)$ (the isomorphism holding via excision). Alexander duality for an arbitrary manifold then states that the map $H^{n-q-1}(X) \to H_{q+1}(M,M \setminus X)$ is an isomorphism. (If $X$ is very pathological, then we should be careful in how define the left-hand side, to be sure that every cochain actually extends to some neighbourhood of $X$.) Now if $M = S^{n+1}$, then $H^i(S^{n+1})$ is almost always zero, and so we may use the boundary map for the long exact sequence of a pair to identify $H_{q+1}(S^{n+1}, S^{n+1}\setminus X)$ with $H_{q}(S^{n+1}\setminus X)$ modulo worrying about reduced vs. usual homology/cohomology (to deal with the fact that $H^i(S^{n+1})$ is non-zero at the extremal points $i = 0$ or $n$). So, in short: we take a cocycle on $X$, expand it slightly to a cocyle on $U$, represent this by a Borel--Moore cycle of the appropriate degree, throw away those simplices lying entirely outside $X$, so that it is now a chain with boundary lying outside $X$, and finally take this boundary, which is now a cycle in $S^{n+1} \setminus X$. (I found these notes of Jesper Moller helpful in understanding the general structure of Alexander duality.) One last thing: it might help to think this through in the case of a circle embedded in $S^2$. We should thicken the circle up slightly to an embedded strip. If we then take our cohomology class to be the generator of $H^1(S^1)$, the corresponding Borel--Moore cycle is just a longitudinal ray of the strip (i.e. if the strip is $S^1 \times I$, where $I$ is an open interval, then the Borel--More cycle is just $\{\text{point}\} \times I$). If we cut $I$ down to a closed subinterval $I'$ and then take its boundary, we get a pair of points, which you can see intuitively will lie one in each of the components of the complement of the $S^1$ in $S^2$. More rigorously, Alexander duality will show that these two points generate the reduced $H^0$ of the complement of the $S^1$, and this is how Alexander duality proves the Jordan curve theorem. Hopefully the above sketch supplies some geometric intuition to this argument. 

I've always wondered this too. I think that if $L$ over $K$ is unramified, then we just take the $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-module for $V$, which is a $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-module over $\mathcal E_L$, and regard it as a $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-module over $\mathcal E_K$ (which is a subfield of $\mathcal E_L$). (Probably you already knew this, assuming it is correct.) In the ramified case, I'm not sure; hopefully Laurent Berger will see this and answer! 

Given that you want to know the structure of the Galois group and ramification, I think that you are best off working with the kernel of the norm map between connected components of idele class groups, as you yourself suggest. These groups are very explicit: for $K := \mathbb Q(i)$, one obtains $\hat{\mathcal O}_K^{\times}/\{\pm 1,\pm i\}$, and for $\mathbb Q$ one obtains $\hat{\mathbb Z}.$ (Here $\hat{}$ denotes the profinite completion.) Apart from the diagonally embedded $\{\pm 1,\pm i\}$ quotient in the group for $K$, both groups factor as a product over primes, and the norm map is given component wise. So the kernel of the norm map is equal to $$\bigl(\prod_p (\mathcal O_K\otimes_{\mathbb Z}\mathbb Z_p)^{\times, \text{Norm } = 1}\bigr)/ \{\pm 1,\pm i\}.$$ This should be explicit enough to answer any particular question you have. 

I should add that one can now handle certain questions about non-totally real field, say question related to conjugate self-dual Galois reps. over CM fields, because these are still related to a Shimura variety context. This plays a role in the recent progress on Sato--Tate for higher weight forms by Barnet-Lamb--Geraghty--Harris--Taylor and Barnet-Lamb--Gee--Geraghty, and is also the basis for a recent striking theorem of Calegari showing that if $\rho:G_{\mathbb Q} \to GL_2({\mathbb Q}_p)$ is ordinary at $p$ and de Rham with distinct Hodge--Tate weights (and probably $\overline{\rho}$ should satisfy some technical conditions), then $\rho$ is necessarily odd! 

ADDED: As pointed out in the exchange of comments by unknown and KConrad, unknown's example doesn't work as stated. Nevertheless, it suggests a concrete test for one interpretation of the question, which might be interesting to investigate. 

In Langlands's Antwerp article (LNM 349) he proves local-global compatibility (what you are refererring to as "Carayol's result") in the case of principal series or special representations (so not just good reduction), using a comparison of trace formulas. He wasn't able to get the supercuspidal case in this way (and that is what led Deligne to write his letter to P.S.). 

Dear Barinder, Re. your comment "there cannot be a common generalization of Artin and Hecke $L$-series", to the contrary, there is such a common generalization, namely the $L$-series of a representation of the global Weil group. These will (conjecturally) have an analytic continuation and functional equation, and they include all Hecke $L$-series (Hecke characters, by which I mean idele class characters, are just one-dimensional reps. of the global Weil group), and all Artin $L$-series (which are reps. of the global Weil group which factor through the map to $G_K$). Regards, Matthew 

These are some comments that originally appeared on the OP's earlier question (linked above), gathered together here as an answer: The notion of automorphic representation (as an irreducible representation of an adelic group) is a generalization of the notion of Hecke eigenform. This aspect of the theory of automorphic forms (i.e. the theory of Hecke operators and their simultaneous eigenvectors) was initiated by Hecke, as a means of understanding and generalizing Mordell's proof of Ramanujan's conjectured multiplicative relations for the $\tau$ function. The notion of automorphic form itself arose as a generalization of the notion of modular form. The latter arose out of the study of elliptic integrals and elliptic functions. The generalization to automorphic forms took place over a long period of time, and was placed in a representation theoretic context by Gelfand and his school (as far as I know): they shifted the focus from functions on $G/K$ satisfying an automorphy condition under the action of $\Gamma$ to functions on $\Gamma\backslash G$, which then admit a $G$-action. (Here $G$ is a real semisimple group, say.) From this point of view, the interpretation of Hecke operators in terms of an adelic group action is not so remote. But there are lots of other traditions feeding into the modern theory of automorphic forms, too. I believe that Maass was motivated to introduce his Maass forms in response to Hecke's theory relating Grossencharacters for imag. quad. fields to CM modular forms; Maass introduced automorphic forms that can play the same role for real quad. fields. I think that Selberg was motivated by Maass's papers to then study the spectrum of the Laplacian on modular curves, which led him to develop his trace formula, and, along the way, to effect the analytic continuation of Eisenstein series. It was generalizing this result to arbitrary groups that then led Langlands to discover general automorphic $L$-functions (see his book Euler products). From the beginning of the theory of modular forms, theta series (generating functions of quadratic forms) had played a key role, and Siegel's work on more general automorphic forms was aimed at, among other things, generalizing this theory. It was Tamagawa (I think) who saw how to phrase some of Siegel's main results in terms of properties of the adelic quotient $G(\mathbb Q) \backslash G(\mathbb A)$, and he (and then Weil in his book Adeles and algebraic groups) are thus responsible for introducing adelic groups into the subject (and for a reason not directly related to the theory of Hecke operators). The realization that algebraic number theory and automorphic forms were related by (what we now call) modularity was something that evolved slowly, over a long period of the twentieth century. Even when it became concretely articulated, in the 60s and 70s, there were several strands of development feeding into it: of course there is the work and ideas of Langlands, who defined automorphic L-functions in general, and saw directly the relationship between his functoriality conjecture and Artin's conjecture, and more broadly saw that his $L$-functions were candidates to be Hasse--Weil (i.e. motivic) $L$-functions; but there was also the work and ideas of Taniyama and Shimura about modularity of elliptic curves, Shimura's work on (what are now called) Shimura varieties (which gave another, previously unknown, link between arithmetic and automorphic forms), Serre's ideas about 2-dimensional Galois representations attached to modular forms, Weil's converse theorem (which was certainly a decisive result, showing as it did that if Hasse--Weil $L$-functions had the anticipated properties, they were going to have to be automorphic $L$-functions) --- a result which generalized earlier results of Hecke, and so on. To quote Langlands on the subject of automorphic forms: It is a deeper subject than I appreciated and, I begin to suspect, deeper than anyone yet appreciates. To see it whole is certainly a daunting, for the moment even impossible, task. 

As far as I know, the standard computation of the torsion in $Pic(X$) proceeds as follows: one considers the exact sequence $0 \to Pic^0(X) \to Pic(X) \to \mathbb Z \to 0,$ the map to $\mathbb Z$ being the degree map. This shows that the torsion subgroups of $Pic(X)$ and $Pic^0(X)$ coincide. One then shows that $Pic^0(X)$ is an abelian variety of dimension $g$ (this is the algebraic theory of the Jacobian), and one applies the general theory of abelian varieties to compute its torsion. An (apparently) alternative approach is as follows: one uses an $n$-torsion line bundle on $X$ to construct a degree $n$ cyclic cover of $X$, and thus classifies the $n$-torsion of the Jacobian in terms of the maps from the etale $\pi_1(X)$ to $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$. But I don't know how (in positive characteristics, where one can't resort to analytic arguments) to concretely compute the group of such maps without going back to the computation in terms of $Pic^0(X)$ and the theory of abelian varieties. 

As has already been noted: there are two reasons to cite a paper, an email, a letter, or anything else: (1) To give credit. (2) To refer to a result you need. If a citation is for reason (1), you should cite anything and everything that is appropriate. If someone explained a result to you in an email, cite them, or at least acknowledge them in the paper. If you rely on the results of a preprint, or a preprint proves important results germaine to your own work, you should cite it (whether it appeared on the arxiv or not!). As for reason (2), it is up to you. In general, you shouldn't be relying on results unless you are confident that they are true. Typically, it is up to you to determine your own threshhold of confidence, and if publication in a peer-reviewed journal increases your confidence, you can take that into account. But in this context you must still take into account criterion (1): i.e. even if you avoid relying on an unpublished result out of a sense of caution, but that unpublished result is closely related to what you are doing, you should still mention it. (A typical situation might be that you need a special case of an unpublished result that it is easy for you to prove directly, and you prefer to do so rather than rely on the unpublished result; then you can certainly do so, but you should point out that what you have proved is a special case of the more general result, and cite that more general result.) One thing to note is that some journals may not accept your paper if it relies crucially on unpublished results (including unpublished results of yours!). Thus, if you rely on such results, you may want to include a sketch of the proof, so as to make your presentation somewhat self-contained. In this case, if you giving a sketch of the proof of someone elses result, be sure to include appropriate citations from category (1) above!
