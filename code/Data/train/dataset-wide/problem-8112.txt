English books are Hardy, Divergent series, and P. Dienes, Taylor series: an introduction to the theory of functions of a complex variable. Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1957. (The title is somewhat misleading. This is a large book that indeed contains an "introduction to complex variables" but it is also the most comprehensive book in English on analytic continuation). But the best book on my opinion is L. Bieberbach, Analytische Fortsetzung, Springer Berlin, 1955, which is available in German and Russian only. (Russian translation by Evgrafov is better because many mistakes are corrected, and some proofs simplified). 

Yes, this is so. And much stronger statements are available: See the beautiful survey paper MR2567024 Rashkovskii, Alexander Classical and new loglog-theorems. Expo. Math. 27 (2009), no. 4, 271–287. also available on the arxiv All results in this paper are actually for subharmonic functions, so this settles the questrion for both analytic and harmonic functions. 

I clearly remember seeing a paper where the dynamic of the anti-conformal map $f(z)=\overline{z}^2+c$ was studied (the bar means complex conjugation). There was a picture of the analog of the Mandelbrot set, which looks very different from the usual one. Can someone help me to locate this paper ? EDIT. Thanks to Benjamin Dickman. Another common name is Mandelbar, which escaped my memory. Once you know these two names, Tricorn and Mandelbar, the search becomes trivial. EDIT 2. More information. Apparently this setting was introduced in the paper "On the structure of Mandelbar set by four authors, in Nonlinearity, 2 (1989), 541-553. I contacted one of the authors, and he told me the following story: someone wanted to draw a Mandelbrot set with a computer, but made a misprint in the program. The result looked interesting... Tricorn was discovered by Milnor (independently of this) in his experiments with a holomorphic (cubic) family. EDIT 3. If someone is curious why I asked this, see the Comment in the end of this preprint: $URL$ 

Probably by "their own field" you mean the whole of mathematics. There are plenty of mathematicians who work and make important contributions in several fields of mathematics, sometimes very remote from each other. But here are some outstanding examples of contributions outside of mathematics: 

Yes, this is a general fact. If $K_1\subset K_2$ are convex, then the surface area of $K_1$ is at most that of $K_2$. 

At some points of the boundary of M, the Hausdorff dimension is not continuous, these are points of "parabolic implosion", see MR2521938. 

A closed curve where $\Im \phi(z)=0$ is the boundary of a bounded region in the upper half-plane where $\Im \phi(z)<0$, or in the lower half-plane, where $\Im\phi(z)>0$. (This follows from the maximum Principle). Such region $D$ in the upper half-plane always exists, because $\Im \phi(it)<0$ for small $t$, and this region has some interval $(-t,t)$ on the boundary. There are exactly two regions of this kind: one in the upper half-plane another symmetric in the lower half-plane. I will consider the one in the upper half-plane. Now the question is reduced to this: is the region $D$ bounded? Here is a criterion: it is bounded if and only if it contains no critical point of $\phi$. For example, if all critical points of $\phi$ are real, $D$ is bounded, and its boundary is a closed curve. More generally, if $\Im\phi(z)\leq 0$ at all critical points in the upper half-plane, $D$ is bounded and you have a closed curve. In principle, one can make an algorithm which will check the exact condition on computer. 1. Find critical points of $\phi$. 2. For each critical point in the upper half-plane whose critical value has negative imaginary part, draw a ray to infinity in the upper half-plane which does not pass through other critical values. This ray has two preimages. If one preimage ends at $0$, there is no closed curve. If both end at $\infty$, and this happens for all such critical points, there is a bounded curve. Of course one has to be more careful if there is a critical point in the upper half-plane with real critical value, but this is a rare (non-generic) case. 

Let me expand Aaron's answer: there is a mean value theorem with any centrally symmetric surface. You integrate your harmonic function on the surface against the harmonic measure at the center, and you recover the value of your function at the center. You can also generalize this to non centrally symmetric surfaces, but the statement becomes a bit longer. Harmonic measure on a surface can be defined by this property, and the fact is that it exists for all reasonable surfaces. You can generalize even further, and dispose of the surface:-) Just consider measures such that convolution with a harmonic function reproduces this harmonic function. (They are called Jensen measures if I remember correctly). EDIT: I remembered incorrectly: Jensen's measure at $x$ is a measure such that $$u(x)\geq\int ud\mu$$ for all superharmonic functions. The measures I was writing about apparently have no name. 

I will address the case of $C$-action (as time). In the case when the phase space is also $C$, you are right, there are only Moebius transformations, which can be loxodromic (elliptic, hyperbolic) or parabolic. That is up to conjugacy by an arbitrary Moebius transformation you have $z\mapsto e^{\alpha t}z$ and $z\mapsto z+t$, where $t$ is your complex "time". In the case when the phase space is $C^n$, we have a lot of possibilities. There is a hudge (infinite-dimensional) continuous group of analytic bijective transformations of $C^n$ onto itself. You can take any complex 1-parametric subgroup of this group. For $n=2$, there is a very nice paper of Milnor on this group.

Yes, here is a sketch. Let $A$ be your doubly connected domain, wlog $0$ and $\infty$ are in different components of the complement. Consider the preimage of $A$ under $\exp(z)$. This is an unbounded simply connected domain $D$ with two boundary points at infinity. This domain will be periodic: $z\mapsto z+2\pi i$ will map it onto itself. Now using the Riemann mapping theorem, map $D$ by some function $g$ onto the vertical strip $0<\Re z<1$, so that the infinite points on the boundary of $D$ correspond to the infinite points on $\partial D$. By the uniqueness in the Riemann theorem, your map $g$ will satisfy $g(z+2\pi i)=g(z)+c$ with some constant $c\neq 0$. Multiply $g$ on $k=2\pi i/c$ to obtain a new function $g_1=kg$ which satisfies such an equation with $c=2\pi i$. Function $g_1$ will map $D$ on the strip $0<\Re z<k$. Now the function $\exp\circ g_1\circ\log$ will map $A$ onto the round ring $1<|z|<\exp(k)$. 

Yes, there is an explanation, but not in all cases. Rotational symmetries of polynomial Julia sets are explained in the paper MR0951972. For the case of rational functions, see also MR1092156. And also MR1625697 about translational symmetries. And several papers of Beardon, titled Symmetries of Julia sets. 

Such polynomials were studied in my papers with Peter Yuditskii: Uniform approximation of sgn(x) by polynomials and entire functions, J. d'Analyse Math., 101 (2007) 313-324, and Polynomials of the best uniform approximation to sgn(x) on two intervals, J. d'Analyse math., 114 (2011) 285-315. We obtained asymptotic estimates (when the degree is large, $\beta-\alpha$ and $\delta-\gamma$ small. But it is clear from these papers how to obtain minimal degree for given $a,b,\alpha,\beta,c,d,\gamma,\delta$ in the cases when this degree is not large, using a computer. We have pictures of some extremal polynomials, and some representation of them.

This is an extended remark. It is easy to see that there is a minorant $g(n)$ of all such increasing sequences with fixed $f(1)$: put $g(1)=f(1)$, $$g(2^{n+1})=\sum_{1}^n g(k),$$ and $g(k)=g(2^n)$ for $2^n<k<2^{n+1}$. These conditions define $g$ uniquely, and we have $f(k)\geq g(k)$ for all $k$. The equation for $g$ suggests that we consider the continuous analog: $$F(2x)=\int_0^xF(t)dt, \quad\mbox{or}\quad F'(x)=(1/2)F(x/2).$$ Adding the initial condition $F(0)=1$ we obtain the unique entire solution $$F(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^{-n(n+1)/2}\frac{z^n}{n!},$$ the famous entire function which Alan Sokal calls the "deformed exponential". The growth rate of this $F$ is easy to find with the standard methods of the theory of entire functions: it is $\log F(x)\sim \exp (c\log^2x)$, where $c=1/(2\log 2)$. (The growth of $F$ is like the maximal term in its Taylor series. In our case this maximal term dominates the whole sum). Ref. A. Sokal, Some wonderful conjectures... $URL$
