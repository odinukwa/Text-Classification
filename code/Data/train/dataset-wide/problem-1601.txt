If it stands very close to the horizon, so that the total column of air that the light passees (the "airmass") is very high. If this is the case, it should also look a bit redder than usual. If observed close to some building that emits heat, like an exhaust, so that the light passes through parcels of hot and cold air on small scales. If an airplane passed by, emitting hot air. 

No, a black hole, or any other gravitationally attracting object for that matter, does not change spacetime permanently, but only affects spacetime around it. The easiest way to see this, is to view the BH in its own frame of reference. Here, the BH is stationary, and spacetime around it is described by the Schwarzschild metric. If a BH came by you and left a physical imprint on spacetime after it (like a wake), then from the BH's frame that would mean that you would fly by it, and it would start producing a wake in the direction that you moved. You don't have such an effect on BHs. 

$^\dagger$This is somewhat imprecise, since galaxies weren't created instantly after Big Bang, and since all galaxies weren't created at the same time. But for the sake of the arument, let's pretend they were. 

The temperature of a gas is a measure of the kinetic energy of the particles. For molecules you can have rotational and vibrational energy, while for single atoms you just have translational energy, or "thermal motion". At a given temperature, the particles don't have exactly the same energy, but a distribution of energies, and hence velocities. Most (>90%) of the gas in the Universe is hydrogen. The energy needed to knock the electron off (i.e. ionize) a hydrogen atom is 13.6 eV. For a gas of $T \gtrsim 3000\,\mathrm{K}$, the fraction of particles with sufficient energy to ionize hydrogen is so high, that the majority of the atoms are ionized$\dagger$, i.e. split up in protons and electrons. This was the case in the beginning of the history of the Universe. Everytime a proton and electron met and recombined to form a neutral atom, the electron would almost immediately be knocked off again by a high-energy particle (usually an electron, but it could also be a proton or photons, since all particles were in "thermodynamic equilibrium", i.e. shared the same distribution of energies). As the Universe expanded, the gas cooled. At some point, 380,000 years after Big Bang, the temperature had decreased enough that it was no longer possible to keep the atoms ionized, so over a rather short period of time ($\sim10^4$ years), they all recombined. This epoch is hence called the epoch of recombination. Until this point, all photons kept scattering on the free electrons. With the electrons "trapped" in atoms, they could now stream freely, and "decouple". They have been traveling freely ever since, but since they travel through an expanding Universe, they become redshifted along the way. Since then, the Universe has expanded by a factor of ~1100, and so have the wavelength of the photons, so that today they have temperature of $3000\,\mathrm{K}/1100\simeq2.7\,\mathrm{K}$. This is what we see as the cosmic microwave background. 

Two-point correlation function To quantify this clustering, usually a correlation function is used, either in 2D ($x$ and y position on the sky), or 3D (if redshifts are available for the galaxies, giving the $z$ dimension). The (two-point) correlation function $\xi(r)$ gives the excess probability of finding two galaxies at a distance $r$ from each other, relative to a random (Poisson) distribution. If $\bar{n}$ is the mean number density of galaxies, then the probability $dP$ of finding a pair of galaxies at a separation $r_{12}$ in volume elements $dV_1$ and $dV_2$ is $$ dP = \bar{n}^2 (1 + \xi(r_{12})) dV_1 dV_2. $$ The power spectrum $P(k)$ of the galaxies is related to the two-point correlation function by $$ \xi(r) = \frac{1}{2\pi^2} \int dk\,k^2\,P(k)\,\frac{\sin kr}{kr} $$ Observationally it is found that the two-point correlation function is given by a power-law: $$ \xi(r) = \left( \frac{r}{r_0} \right)^{-\gamma}, $$ where $r_0$ is the correlation length (of the order $5\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$) and $\gamma=1.7$–$1.8$. Note that the value of $r_0$ depends on galaxy type; brighter and redder galaxies have a longer correlation length, i.e. they are more strongly clustered (e.g. Wang et al. 2008). Excursion set theory Using a formalism know as excursion set theory, the mass fraction in knots, filaments, sheets, respectively, can be predicted analytically. The idea of this theory is to model the collapse of structure in an expanding Universe as a stochastic process, where an overdensity fluctuates and forms a structure if it crosses a given threshold. See e.g. Shen et al. (2006). Dynamical classification Forero-Romero et al. (2009) proposed a dynamical classification of the cosmic web, based on evalution of the deformation tensor $$ T_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial r_\alpha \partial r_\beta} $$ of the gravitational potential $\phi$, counting the number of eigenvalues above a certain threshold at each grid point in a cosmological N-body simulation, where the case of zero, one, two or three such eigenvalues corresponds to void, sheet, filament or a knot grid point. Other methods I quick googling leads me to other methods I don't really know anything about, e.g. "the Shapefinder diagonistic" (Prakash (2016)), and large-scale halo ellipticity–ellipticity and ellipticity–direction correlations (Lee et al. (2008). 

Yes, exactly. The angular diameter distance is defined such that it is compatible with "regular" trigonometric rules, just as the luminosity distance is compatible with regular relations between flux, distance, and luminosity. Only for at flat and non-expanding universe would these distances coincide with each other, and with the "true" distance, which is what you would measure if you lay out meter sticks (after freezing the Universe in time, so it doesn't expand more before you're done). 

As is the case even in Newtonian gravity, the gravitational attraction from a spherical body exterted on a far-away object is identical the that exterted by a point mass located at the the center of the body. This is the so-called shell theorem. To an outside observer, due to the infinite time dilation at the event horizon of a black hole (BH), all mass that has ever fallen into the BH has actually never reached the event horizon, but is instead placed in a shell around the BH, still falling ever-so-slowly toward the BH. Thus, what we feel is in fact the gravitation not from a point mass, but from a shell of matter, but there is no way for us to tell the difference. Now you may ask, "What if we drop a massive object, e.g. a planet, into a symmetric black hole? Since it never reaches the BH, won't the effective gravitational potential be asymmetric?" What happens is that the way that space is "warped" around the black, the gravitational field is bent along with it in such a way that sufficiently far from the BH+planet, the gravitational field looks symmetric. Sort of like the following drawing shows close to (left) and far from (right) the BH. 

Yes. As has been commented, the amount of damage taken by an interstellar spaceship depends on its velocity $v$, as well as the number of gas and dust particles that it encounters on its way. This number is usually measured per area, in which case it's called column density $N$, and is equal to the total distance $d$ traveled times the particle density $n$, i.e. $N = nd$. For instance, if a spaceship travels 1 lightyear ($10^{18}\,\mathrm{cm}$) through a region with a density of $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\!$, each square centimeter of the spaceship will encounter $10^{19}$ particles. That is, the faster you go, the farther you go, and the more dense regions you go through, the more your spaceship is damaged. The Breakthrough Starshot project aims to reach our nearest-neighbor stellar system $\alpha$ Centauri in ~20 years, with a gram-sized satellite reaching $0.20c$ by means of a light sail. Today, there was a paper by Hoang et al. calculating the amount of damage taken by such a satellite. The total column density of gas from Earth to $\alpha$ Cen is $\sim10^{17.5\mathrm{-}18}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, and assuming (fairly) a dust-to-gas ratio of 1% and a carbonaceous/silicate dust grain population with a Weingartner & Draine (2001) size distribution, they calculate that this journey to $\alpha$ Cen will erode the surface of the spacecraft to a thickness of the order of 1 mm. Most of the damage is caused by dust, not gas, but in principle gas may slowly heat up the spaceship. However, at $v=0.2c$, as long as the density is $\lesssim10\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, the temperature is insufficient to cause any melting. Molecular clouds — the dense clouds where stars are born — have densities from $10^2\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and even up to $10^6\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, i.e. many orders of magnitude higher than the roughly $1\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ found in the more dilute interstellar medium. To reach even more distant stars in a tolerable time, you would have to go faster than $0.2c$, and thus it seems that it is in fact a good idea to evade these clouds. 

The gravitational effect of the planets on the Sun can be calculated very accurately. The acceleration of a planet of mass $M$ at a distance from the Sun of $r$ is $$a = \frac{G M}{r^2}.$$ If you plug in the numbers, you'll find that the largest effect comes from Jupiter due to its enormous mass. The gravitational acceleration of Jupiter on the Sun is $2\times10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$. Even if all planets were aligned so to add up all their gravitational accelerations, the total would only be $2.8\times10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$. However, the acceleration is not what is important; rather it is the tidal forces, which are proportional to $1/r^3$ instead on $1/r^2$. The tidal acceleration felt over a distance $\Delta r$ at the surface of the Sun is $$a_{\mathrm{tidal}} \simeq \frac{2GM}{r^3} \Delta r.$$ Now I didn't really bother to read the paper in detail, but the guy doesn't seem to write what exactly in the Sun's atmosphere should be affected by the planets. But even if we say that it's all of Sun's corona, which has a thickness of $\Delta r \sim 10^6$ km, the combined effect of all eight planets standing on a line would be roughly $\mathbf{10^{-9}}$ m/s$\mathbf{^2}$, a minor effect compared to the difference in the Sun's own gravitational field over the same distance, which is 11 orders of magnitude higher. 

The answer is sort of trivial. If you travel 1000 ly so fast that in your own reference frame it takes one year, then you will have aged by one year in your own reference frame. To do so, you will need a speed of almost the speed of light, so in the reference frame of Earth, you will have spent just a tad more that 1000 yr to travel 1000 ly. In general, the time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ so to be exact, your speed must be $$ 1000^2 = \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} ⇒ \\ v = (1-10^{-6})^{1/2}\,c = 0.9999995c $$ so your journey will take $$ t = \frac{d}{v} = 1000.0005\,\mathrm{yr}, $$ i.e. 1000 years, 4 hours, and 23 minutes in Earth's reference frame. "Realistic" acceleration As David Hammen comments below, this assumes that your spaceship accelerates instantaneously to $v$. There are infinitely many ways to achieve that speed. The proper time $\tau$ (i.e. the time experienced by the traveler) to reach a distance $d$ when traveling at a constant acceleration $a$ is $$ \tau = \frac{c}{a} \cosh^{-1} \left( \frac{ad}{c^2} +1 \right). $$ Solving for $a$ yields the acceleration needed. The most pleasant way would arguably be accelarating at $a\simeq 19.2\,\mathrm{G}$ for half a year, and the decelerate at the same amount for the rest of the journey. A more pleasant way in the beginning, but less pleasant in the end, would be to accelerate at $a\simeq9.6\,\mathrm{G}$ for one year, and then crash into planet WASP-142b, which lies at a distance of roughly 1000 ly. Your journey, as measured by people on Earth, would then take $$ t(\tau) = \frac{c}{a} \sinh \left( \frac{a \tau}{c} \right), $$ which works out to roughly 18 and 36 days more, respectively, than in the instantaneous case. The reason that it doesn't differ that much is that you actually reach relativistic speeds pretty fast at this acceleration. The largest G-forces can be with endured in the "forward direction", i.e. corresponding to lying on your back and accelerating upwards (accelerating along the direction of your spine tends to break it, and accelerating "backward" makes your eyes pop out). According to Wikipedia, "acceleration pioneer" John Stapp withstood 25 G for 1.1 seconds, so you might want to send him instead of yourself.
