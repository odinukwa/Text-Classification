You're doing the traditional mistake of people not familiar with Econometrics: You mistake correlation and causality. You look at a change in the USD, assume it to be exogenous, and then predict an impact onto the S&P. However, changes in the USD are not exogenous. For example, an increase in US productivity (compared to the productivity of firms in other countries) will both increase the S&P and valuate the USD. For what you're trying to do, you need to separate different effects, which is virtually impossible - or look for random variation in the USD, of which I'm also unfamiliar with. 

where the first four correspond to the individuals employment status (but not in different months), and the last for correspond to the number of employees linked to the individual (and similar). Clearly, the information must be there somewhere. So, How does the CPS CEPR store employment information for the non-ORG months? 

Prices (and hence price ratios) carry information about what people want, and what is supplied. You're only changing initial endowments, hence you're not affecting what is supplied. However, as you change the initial distribution, you change what each individual wants, and possibly (not necessarily) also what the economy as an aggregate wants. This change in wants and haves is reflected in prices. 

Introduction of money into your economy doesn't need to connect it to real world cash, but you need to make it valuable. Connecting it to real world cash at some rate would immediately determine its value. Say, if you allow modwizdollar at 1-to-1 rate to the USD, your dollar has immediately the same value as the dollar, and also its inflation rate. In Diablo, players find gold and items over time, as they kill enemies. Therefore, the objective value of gold is the time it takes a player to earn that much gold, devalued by how much that time is worth to the player. The more time it takes for players to find items, the more valuable these are. For money to be work as a store of value, it is sufficient to keep finding modwizdollars costly in terms of time. How to set prices It depends on what your goals are, and I suppose people could write Bachelor papers on the complexity of these systems, and in fact, an economist of late publicity did exactly that for Valve. 

This refers to the discussion on whether bubbles exist or not (look at the previous year nobel laureate's talks). If you believe that bubbles might exist, the following can be the (simplified) story. Take the Spanish housing market, under the Euro bubble. We saw that financed through low prices, an over investment into houses happened, paying workers in that industry high wages (due to the high demand). 

Many economists suspect (based on a strong prior that there should be an employment effect) that this is due to poor data (Matt Rognlie's comment), or long-term effects of minimum-wages (adjustment costs in technology) that we are not capable of measuring/estimating precisely (Sorkin (2015) (IDEAS)). Why doesn't the minimum wage affect employment? The counter-effect to some part is the political process. People are not stupid, they will accept raises in the minimum wage to some degree, but not if you go bananas. Also, there are natural counter-forces in the economy: 

In order to circumvent problem #1, people often assume that the DGP process behind different countries are the same, increasing observations from perhaps 60 to 600. In order to attack #2, many people add timing assumptions. However, this is still no clear identification, these are still assumptions. To see the issue: Imagine high inflation at $t-5$, and low growth at $t$. Using a standard timing assumption, the former caused the latter. However, we like to think about agents as forward looking. Can we be certain that expectations w.r.t. the latter didn't influence the former? Especially because of #2, this type of regressions have lost popularity. Also, there is not really much more to do. tl;dr: No important new results that I know of. 

Real prices are fundamentally determined by supply, demand, and the market structure. As you say, it cannot be a supply effect, as the supply of, say, coconuts, appears to be constant to you. It could be an increase in nominal prices at the rate of inflation. In that case, prices for some goods just become more expensive because the relative supply of money is growing, real prices do not change. Alternatively, you could be facing more international demand for your goods. If international demand for coconuts goes up, exports and local demand have to "fight" for the supply of coconuts, leading to an increase in prices. 

Debt being cheaper than ever doesn't mean that it is optimal to borrow. Unless you plan to invest the borrowed money into projects that yield higher returns with certainty (we would call this arbitrage), any debt implies a tradeoff between the welfare of current versus future generations. 

Consider a world where an intermediate good is produced using a linear production function in a competitive market: $$ Y = qAL$$ where $q$ is the price of the intermediate good, $A$ is productivity. Due to perfect competition, profits are given by $$ 0 = \pi = (qA-w)L$$ where $w$ are wages. Due to perfect competition, we have that $w = qA$. Now consider a final production sector where some market power exists. Why is - I believe - irrelevant to the exposition here. Due to some cost of entry to the final sector, we can determine the measure of firms in the final sector, $S$. Each of these final good firms $i$ then will sell the final good at price $p_i$. That is, we have some non-degenerate price distribution in the final sector. Now, we have a measure $S$ of final sector firms that require the intermediate good. Assumption 1 Let's assume for simplicity, that they all will purchase the same quantity (although the quantity is irrelevant due to the linearity of the intermediate good's production function). How would the price $q$ be determined in this setup, with and without assumption 1? 

No Time To Argue Most importantly, there cannot be an "18 months period of notice". Tt has to be decided suddenly and there cannot be any period in which individuals could respond to the new plan by withdrawing their money and moving cash from one of the member countries to any of the others. New Currencies Each country has to have its own currency. These currencies should be free floating against each other, which on the other hand means that some will value up and some down. That is, Germany's new currency will probably value up against whatever Greece will have. Capital Controls Therefore, it will be of higher value to have your Euro exchanged for German money than for Greek money. Any bank account will have to immediately be translated into local currency. Also, no one will be allowed to move cash Euro between the member countries. One way to immediately establish the new currency would be to simply stamp the old money with country specific stamps. Citation Note that Greek's new finance minister implied that their train of thoughts follows exactly these lines of thinking [my own translation]: 

Here's another way, using the same notation as Adam, to get to the same result: $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = P(\text{searching twice | being matched})\cdot P(\text{another match | searching twice}) $$ Now, $$P(\text{searching twice | being matched}) = \frac{P(\text{searching twice and being matched})}{P(\text{being matched})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s} $$ $$P(\text{another match | searching twice}) = \frac{P(\text{another match and searching twice})}{P(\text{searching twice})} \\ = \frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} $$ So, $$P(\text{another match | being matched}) = \frac{\psi_u 2 \nu_s}{(1+\psi_u)\nu_s}\frac{\psi_u \nu}{\psi_u} = \frac{2\psi_u\nu}{(1+\psi_u)}$$
