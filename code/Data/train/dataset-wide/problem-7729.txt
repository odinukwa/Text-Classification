There is a similar formula $$ \small{\left(P_n^m(\cos\theta)\right)^2=(\sin{\theta})^{2m}\frac{(m+n)!}{(n-m)!}\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}\frac{(-1)^k}{4^{k+m}}\binom{n+m}{k+2m}\binom{n+k+m}{n+m}\binom{2k+2m}{k+m}\sin^{2k}{\theta}} $$ obtained from the following representation for associated Legendre polynomials $$ P_n^m(z)=(-1)^m \left(\frac{1-z}{1+z}\right)^{\frac{m}{2}} \frac{(m+n)!}{m! (n-m)!} \, _2F_1\left(-n,n+1;m+1;\frac{1-z}{2}\right) $$ and the formula (6.1) from the paper W.N. Bailey, Some Theorems Concerning Products of Hypergeometric Series, Proc. London Math. Soc. 38, 377–384 (1935): $$ {}_2F_1(a,b;c;x){}_2F_1(a,b;a+b-c+1;x)={}_4F_3\left({a,b,\tfrac{a+b}2,\tfrac{1+a+b}2\atop a+b,c,a+b-c+1};4x(1-x)\right). $$ 

First of all this has nothing to do with the inflection point of $e^{-\alpha x^2}$. According to Poisson summation formula (see Whittaker, Watson, Modern analysis, chapter 21.51) $$ \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\alpha (x-n)^2}=2{\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}}}\left(1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\frac{\pi^2}{\alpha}n^2}\cos2\pi n x\right),\quad \text{Re}~\alpha>0.\tag{1} $$ From this formula one can see that when $\alpha>0$ is small, the Fourier coefficients $a_n=2{\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}}}e^{-\frac{\pi^2}{\alpha}n^2}$ of the resulting function decreases rapidly with increasing $n$. When $\alpha=1/2$ one has $$ \frac{a_1}{a_0}=2e^{-2\pi^2}\approx 5.4\times 10^{-9}. $$ I don't know any conceptual explanation for this in mathematics, but there is such an explanation that comes from physics. Consider a quantum particle with mass $m$ on a ring of radius $a$. We assume the ring is pierced with magnetic flux $\phi$. We want to calculate partition function of this system at temperature $T>0$ in two different ways. On the one hand, it is known that the energy spectrum of the particle is given by $$ E_n=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^2}\left(n+\frac{\phi}{\phi_0}\right)^2, $$ where $\phi_0$ is the so called magnetic flux quantum. Then partition function is given as the Gibbs sum $$ Z=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-E_n/T}=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^2T}\left(n+{\phi}/{\phi_0}\right)^2}.\tag{2} $$ Here one immediately recognizes the sum analogous to the LHS of $(1)$. On the other hand, partition function is related to the trace of the density matrix $\rho_{\theta_1,\theta_2}$, i.e. to $\int\rho_{\theta,\theta}d\theta$. It is possible to calculate the density matrix of this system in imaginary time representation by solving a certain differential equation. Details of this calculation can be found for example in this book, chapter 4.3. Consider first the more simple case of unbounded line $-\infty<\theta<+\infty$; then the answer is $$ \rho_{\theta_1,\theta_2}=Ce^{-\frac{mTa^2(\theta_1-\theta_2)^2}{2\hbar^2}}, $$ where $C$ is some normalization constant. Magnetic flux does not enter this expression because there is not any nontrivial loop in the system. On a ring there is a nontrivial loop, and let $n$ be the winding number. It is known that the partition function is a sum over all homotopy classes multiplied by corresponding phase factor. In this case the phase factor comes from the magnetic flux (Aharonov-Bohm phase) and equals $e^{2\pi in\phi/\phi_0}$. As a result we have \begin{align} Z&=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{2\pi in\phi/\phi_0}\int\rho_{\theta,\theta+2\pi n}d\theta\\ &=2\pi C \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\frac{2\pi^2mTa^2}{\hbar^2}n^2+2\pi in\phi/\phi_0}.\tag{3} \end{align} Combining $(2)$ and $(3)$ one obtains the transformation in $(1)$. One can see from this physical interpretation that when the temperature $T$ increases, then the higher Fourier harmonics decrease. This corresponds to the physical intuition that the higher the temperature the more chaotic the system becomes and the effect of the Aharonov-Bohm phase averages out due to thermal fluctuations. 

Hello All! Recently I've been working on a C++ prime generator that uses the Sieve of Atkin ( $URL$ ) to generate its primes. My objective is to be able to generate any 32-bit number. I'll use it mostly for project euler problems. mostly it's just a summer project. The program uses a bitboard to store primality: that is, a series of ones and zeros where for example the 11th bit would be a 1, the 12th a 0, and the 13th a 1, etc. For efficient memory usage, this is actually and array of chars, each char containing 8 bits. I use flags and bitwise-operators to set and retrieve bits. The gyst of the algorithm is simple: do a first pass using some equations I don't pretend to understand to define if a number is considered "prime" or not. This will for the most part get the correct answers, but a couple nonprime numbers will be marked as prime. Therefore, when iterating through the list, you set all multiples of the prime you just found to "not prime". This has the handy advantage of requiring less processor time the larger a prime gets. I've got it 90% complete, with one catch: some of the primes are missing. Through inspecting the bitboard, I have ascertained that these primes are omitted during the first pass, which basically toggles a number for every solution it has for a number of equations (see wikipedia entry). I've gone over this chunk of code time and time again. I even tried increasing the bounds to what is shown in the wikipedia articles, which is less efficient but I figured might hit a few numbers that I have somehow omitted. Nothing has worked. These numbers simply evaluate to not prime. Most of my test has been on all primes under 128. Of this range, these are the primes that are omitted: 23 and 59. I have no doubt that on a higher range, more would be missing (just don't want to count through all of them). I don't know why these are missing, but they are. Is there anything special about these two primes? I've double and triple checked, finding and fixing mistakes, but it is still probably something stupid that I am missing. anyways, here is my code: 

Since the main contribution to the integral comes from $t<<1$, analytically one has \begin{align} \lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_c^{\pi/2}\frac{c}{t}\sqrt\frac{1+t^2}{t^2-c^2}dt&=\lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_c^{\pi/2}\frac{c}{t}\sqrt\frac{1}{t^2-c^2}dt\\ &=\lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_{2/\pi}^{1/c}c\sqrt\frac{1}{1-c^2t^2}dt\\ &=\lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_{2c/\pi}^{1}\sqrt\frac{1}{1-t^2}dt\\ &=\int_{0}^{1}\sqrt\frac{1}{1-t^2}dt\\ &=\frac\pi{2} \end{align} 

$\bf{Step~1}.$ $B_{n,a}(q)=B_{n,n-a}(q)$. $\it{Proof}$. Write $$ \sum_{n\geq1}\dfrac{B_n(t,q)}{t^{n/2}}\frac{z^n}{(q;q)_n}=\frac{e(z/\sqrt{t};q)-e(z\sqrt{t};q)}{\dfrac{e(2z\sqrt{t};q)}{\sqrt{t}}-\sqrt{t}~e(2z/\sqrt{t};q)}\left(\dfrac{e(z\sqrt{t};q)}{\sqrt{t}}+\sqrt{t}~e(z/\sqrt{t};q)\right). $$ The rhs is symmetric under $t\to 1/t$, so $\dfrac{B_n(t,q)}{t^{n/2}}$ is also symmetric: $$ \dfrac{B_n(t,q)}{t^{n/2}}=t^{n/2}{B_n(1/t,q)}.\tag{1} $$ We know that $B_n(t,q)=B_{n,0}t^0+...$ starts with the power $t^0$. Due to $(1)$ this means that the highest power of $t$ in the polynomial $B_n(t,q)$ is $n$, and $B_{n,a}(q)=B_{n,n-a}(q)$ as required. $\bf{Step~2}.$ $\displaystyle{\binom{\alpha}a_q+\sum_k\binom{\alpha}k_q2^{\alpha-k}B_{k,b}(q)= \binom{\alpha}b_q +\sum_k\binom{\alpha}k_q2^{\alpha-k}B_{k,a}(q)},~ a,b,\in \mathbb{N},~a+b+1=\alpha.$ $\it{Proof}$. According to q-binomial theorem $e(z;q)=\sum_{n\geq0}\frac{z^n}{(q;q)_n}=\frac{1}{(z;q)_\infty}$. Now we equate the coefficients of $z^n$ in both sides of \begin{align} \left(\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{(2tz)^l}{(q;q)_l}-t\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{(2z)^l}{(q;q)_l}\right)\cdot\sum_{k\geq1}B_k(t,q)\frac{z^k}{(q;q)_k}={(e(z;q)-e(tz;q))(e(tz;q)+te(z;q))}\\ =\left(\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{z^l}{(q;q)_l}-\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{(tz)^l}{(q;q)_l}\right)\left(\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{(tz)^l}{(q;q)_l}+t\sum_{l\geq0}\frac{z^l}{(q;q)_l}\right) \end{align} and obtain $$ \sum _{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}_q\frac{B_k(t,q) \left(t^{n-k}-t\right) }{2^{k-n}}-\sum _{k=1}^n \left(1-t^k\right) \left(t^{n-k}+t\right) \binom{n}{k}_q=0. $$ The coefficient of $t^{a+1}$ in the above formula is (note that for $a\in \mathbb{N}$ we have $a+1\neq1$ and for $b=n-a-1\in \mathbb{N}$ we have $a+1\neq n$, so the 'boundary' terms with $t$ and $t^n$ don't make any contribution in the formula below) $$ -\sum _{k=1}^n\binom{n}{k}_q \frac{B_{k,a}(q) }{2^{k-n}}+\sum _{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}_q\frac{B_{k,a+1+k-n}(q)}{2^{k-n}}+\binom{n}{a}_q-\binom{n}{b}_q=0. $$ Finally, taking into account $B_{k,a+1+k-n}(q)=B_{k,k-b}(q)=B_{k,b}(q)$ we have $$ \binom{n}{b}_q+\sum _{k=1}^n\binom{n}{k}_q \frac{B_{k,a}(q) }{2^{k-n}}=\binom{n}{a}_q+\sum _{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k}_q\frac{B_{k,b}(q)}{2^{k-n}}. $$ 

It was shown by Paul Ehrenfest in 1917 that Coulomb interaction is unstable at spatial dimensions higher than three P. Ehrenfest, In what way does it become manifest in the fundamental laws of physics that space has three dimensions? Proc. Netherlands Acad. Arts Sci., 20 (1917), 200 - 209.: In $R_n$ for $n>3$ the planet falls on the attracting centre or flies away infinitely. In $R_n$ for $n>3$ there do not exist motions comparable with the elliptic motion in $R_3$,- all trajectories have the character of spirals. This analysis has been extended to quantum mechanics in Tangherlini, F. R. (1963). "Atoms in Higher Dimensions". Nuovo Cimento. 14 (27): 636. 

You have $W_n(I,n)= XX^{T}$ where $X$ is $n \times n$ with the rows of $X$ iid from $N(0,I_{n})$, so then it seems to me that as $n \rightarrow \infty$, $W_{n} \rightarrow nI_{n}$ almost surely? This is because $X$ is almost surely an orthogonal matrix, and the entries along the trace will converge to their expectation by the strong law for iid RVs which is $E[\chi^{2}_{n}] = n$ by construction. Edit: As noted below this answer is incorrect, but possibly the discussion below is interesting so I'll keep this post up until it starts getting downvoted. 

"Is there a good book which takes a very streamlined (if perhaps hard to understand) approach to proving the existance of bases" Michael Artin's Algebra Ch 3, S 3 does what you are asking for in under four pages (and is not hard to understand). 

Is it too abstract to motivate complex numbers in terms of the equations we can solve depending on whether we choose to work in ${\mathbb N, \mathbb Z, \mathbb Q, \mathbb R, \mathbb C}$? The famous "John and Betty" ($URL$ takes such an approach. 

Not quite what you asked for, but possibly useful if you haven't yet read it, is Baraniuk et al, A Simple Proof of the Restricted Isometry Property for Random Matrices. This was one of the most readable introductions that I found when I was learning about CS. For the basics of Kolmogorov Complexity you could do worse than Cover and Thomas, Elements of Information Theory. 

The function $$ f_q(x,y,z)=\sum_{cyc}e^z\frac{\theta_q\left(e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3}+x-z}\right) \theta_q\left(e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3}+y-z}\right)}{\theta_q\left(e^{x-z}\right) \theta_q\left(e^{y-z}\right)} $$ satisfies all $4$ conditions and also has been confirmed numerically. 

The conjectured identity $$ f(q)=(q;q)_\infty\left(1+\sum_{k=1}^\infty q^k(-q;q)^2_{k-1}\right)=\sum_{\substack{m,n\geqslant0\\n\ne1}}(-1)^mq^{\frac{(m+n)(3m+n+1)}2},\tag{1} $$ using Euler's pentagonal number theorem $(q;q)_\infty=\sum _{m=-\infty}^\infty (-1)^m q^{\frac{1}{2} m (3 m+1)}$ can be brought to an equivalent form $$ (q;q)_\infty\sum_{k=1}^\infty q^k(-q;q)^2_{k-1}=\sum_{\substack{m\ge0}}\sum_{\substack{n\ge 1}}(-1)^mq^{\frac{(m+n)(3m+n+1)}2}.\tag{1a} $$ By identity $(4.1)$ in Rhoades' paper the sum on the LHS of $(1a)$ is $$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty q^k(-q;q)^2_{k-1}=\frac{1}{2(q;q)_{\infty }} \sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{q^{\frac{1}{2} n (n+1)}}{q^n+1}-\frac{1}{4}\sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac{q^{k^2}}{(-q;q)_k^2},\tag{2} $$ while the double sum in $(1a)$ \begin{align} \sum_{\substack{m\ge0}}\sum_{\substack{n\ge 1}}(-1)^mq^{\frac{(m+n)(3m+n+1)}2}&=\sum _{m=0}^\infty \sum _{k=m+1}^\infty (-1)^mq^{\frac{k(k+1+2m)}2}\\ &=\sum _{k=1}^\infty \sum _{m=0}^{k-1} (-1)^m q^{m k+\frac{1}{2} (k+1) k}\\ &=\sum _{k=1}^\infty q^{\frac{k^2}{2}+\frac{k}{2}} \frac{1-(-1)^k q^{k^2}}{1+q^k}.\tag{3} \end{align} Since $\sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{q^{\frac{1}{2} n (n+1)}}{q^n+1}=\frac{1}{2}+2 \sum _{n=1}^\infty \frac{q^{\frac{1}{2} n (n+1)}}{q^n+1}$ $(2)$ and $(3)$ contain the same sum $\sum _{n=1}^\infty \frac{q^{\frac{1}{2} n (n+1)}}{q^n+1}$. This sum cancels out after $(2)$ and $(3)$ are substituted in $(1a)$ resulting in $$ \frac14-\frac{(q;q)_{\infty }}{4}\sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac{q^{k^2}}{(-q;q)_k^2}=-\sum _{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n q^{\frac{3 n^2}{2}+\frac{n}{2}}}{1+q^n},\tag{1c} $$ and equivalently $$ \sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac{q^{k^2}}{(-q;q)_k^2}=\frac{2}{(q;q)_{\infty }}\sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n q^{\frac{3 n^2}{2}+\frac{n}{2}}}{1+q^n}.\tag{1d} $$ $(1d)$ corresponds to the special case $x=-1$ of the identity $$ \sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac{q^{k^2}}{(x q;q)_k(q/x;q)_k}=\frac{1-x}{(q;q)_{\infty }}\sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n q^{\frac{3 n^2}{2}+\frac{n}{2}}}{1-xq^n},\tag{4} $$ which can be obtained from Watson-Whipple transformation formula (see the paper "Modular transformations of Ramanujan’s fifth and seventh order mock theta functions", Ramanujan J. 7 (2003), 193–222. by Gordon and McIntosh). $(4)$ also can be proved directly by partial fractions expansion and the following limiting case of q-Gauss summation $$ \sum _{k=n}^\infty\frac{q^{k^2}}{(q;q)_{k-n}(q^{n+1};q)_{k}}=\frac{q^{n^2}}{(q^{n+1};q)_n}\sum _{k=0}^\infty\frac{q^{k^2+2kn}}{(q;q)_{k}(q^{2n+1};q)_{k}}=\frac{q^{n^2}}{(q^{n+1};q)_\infty}. $$
