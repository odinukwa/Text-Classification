This is again false. The pupils who practice sports all got either 8 or 9. There were 9 people who got less than 8 (and so must not practice any sport). If anyone got a 10, then it must have been someone who also does not practice any sport. But, if so, there would be at least 10 people who do not practice any sport, and in this case it would be impossible, as discussed above, that we had 13 cyclists, 11 swimmers and 8 skiers without at least some pupils practicing all three sports. 

If to reincarnate I must forget everything I know, in what sence it can be said that "I" am reincarnating? What is left of "me" if all my memories, ideas, feelings, etc., are gone? 

Arguably, it is capitalism that "reduces humans to social insects, devoid of individuality", and its defenders should be the ones pejoratively called "collectivists": as we see, the well being of individuals is of no concern, only the well being of "the economy" (which is a collective entity) should be taken into account, and indeed the interests of individuals must be sacrificed to ensure that the economy goes well (and, apparently, the well being of the economy systematically requires that individuals, or the great majority of them anyway, get screwed - so it is not an abstract problem of whether individuals or collectives are more important). 

Those seemed to be the most common and applicable terms when I was reading Marx. EDIT: Thanks Google! 

It is most likely in your own best interest to respect teachers so that you don't put them on edge and learn less than you could've from them. So I think it's in your best interest, yes, which I suppose is a type of justification. If you considerable evidence to believe you aren't going to learn something from a teacher or would become less educated under a teacher, then respect would be less necessary as a teacher, but I believe you should still respect that teacher as a person if nothing else. 

I find it extraordinarily unlikely that the most intelligent of domestic animals and primates don't exhibit higher forms of consciousness than some humans that have been ascribed consciousness. Especially in prolonged interactions with animals, its easy to ascribe to them the same thoughts and feelings humans have, though in a way somewhat affected by mental faculties. Other animals haven't developed to think and feel as we do, so there should be some expectation for difference. However, I think saying that any deviation from human mind confers a deviation from consciousness is quite arbitrary and difficult to separate philosophical arguments from those made on basis of apathy or ignorance. In general I believe: 

Fallacies are logical flaws in reasoning. If there is no reasoning, there is no fallacy (there may be other things, even worse than fallacies). In your Alice x Bob example, there is a reasoning by Bob: 

In this system, the individual human being becomes an object, a "hand", to use the terminology fashionable when Marx wrote Das Kapital, and, as such, is de-humanised; he is no longer "working together to make the world different from what it is", but merely serving as a tool for those who rent his humanity for a wage. This is, in my vision, how Marx speaks of a "human essence", and still keeps a "materialist" view of things. 

An atheist is a person who believes God(s) do(es)n't exist. A multitude of views can be held by people who believe that. These can go from Dawkins' "God doesn't exist, and religion is evil" to "God doesn't exist, but we shouldn't tell that to the masses, or civilisation would crumble". A person who doesn't believe in God(s) but is also not certain of it's/their inexistence is not an atheist, but an agnostic. 

Because your intelligence is yours, and yours only, but your "race" is a common feature of millions of people. Because you can actually do something with your intelligence, while your "race" is useless. So, no, intelligence and "race" are not "qualitatively the same". And there is no overwhelming evidence that intelligence is "nothing but genetics". While there may be some - not "overwhelming" - evidence that there are genetic factors for intelligence, this trait is quite obviously related to environmental factors. Feral children never really develop their intelligence, nevermind how favoured by genetics they can be. "Education" and intelligence are also two different things. While it is difficult to get very educated without being at least somewhat intelligent, many people are intelligent and uneducated, and a few are relatively educated without being really bright. Pundits who take "uneducated voters" as a synonym for "dumb voters" are talking bullshit. Education is a variable that can be measured in electoral polls. So the pollster can publish a result such as "non-college voters prefer the Republican candidate by 58%-42%". Intelligence is a variable that cannot be measured by electoral pollsters, so they do not publish anything like "voters with IQ under 90 prefer the Republican candidate". It is not their fault that pundits may distort one thing into the other. And you are evidently wrong to say that "race is off bounds in such conversations". You will hear that "Blacks and Latinos voted for Clinton" as much, if not more, than "the uneducated dumb ones voted for this or that candidate". The only difference is that most people do not conclude that Blacks and Latinos are dumb, while the misconception that people without college are unintelligent is common (and, frankly, tells more about the intelligence, or lack thereof, of the person making the comment than anyone else's). Related to that, "race" is thought of as a motivation for political behaviour - and, unfortunately, this line of thinking is not without reason. Few Jews will have supported the Nazi party in Germany. That's because, oh, the Nazi party overtly proposed policies that were noxious to Jewish people. (If the Republican party wonders why it doesn't get more votes from Blacks or Latinos, perhaps it should start thinking why its policies are unnatractive for Blacks or Latinos, instead of complaining that Blacks or Latinos vote along racial lines.) But everybody knows that lack of intelligence is not a motivation for political behaviour. The unintelligent do not vote as a block, based on their political interests as unintelligent people. The implication is that they vote against their real interests, because they cannot do the reasoning that leads from their interests to their vote. This is also evidently false. Uneducated people vote differently, because they do have different political interests. They may vote against their real interests, but not because they are "dumb" - as educated people also often vote against their real interests - its because the way they construct their interests may be flawed, and because they may be deluded about how the policies their chosen candidates will act upon such interests. (And if the Democratic party wonders why it doesn't get more votes from non-college voters, then they should start thinking why their policies are unnatractive for non-college voters, instead of blaming them for voting for the opposition...) 

Pascal's wager is a special case of Pascal's mugging in which the mugger claims infinite power. I'm not really clear on which formations of the wager and mugging you're discussing as they seem to differ for the originals that I am familiar with, but I will attempt to shed some light on your questions. ================================================================================== 

Data is what information in encoded in as symbols on the tape of a universal Turing machine for model in which the Universe runs on a Turing machine. Information would be the location and velocity of all particles in the Universe as well as any knowledge derived from that. Data is uninterpreted encryption of that information. ================================================================================== It was not my understanding that philosophy functioned on meaningful different (rather just more specific) definitions than general language on this issue. The definitions of each per Google here: 

Good morning is an extension of your best wishes - a method of voicing support. Supporting your teacher should enable that teacher to teach better, unless that teacher is functioning under non-standard social protocols, and enable that teacher to better provide instruction. 

(b) Objective standards are fundamentally pointless. Well relativism doesn't really specifically address whether objective standards have a point or not. Mainly, it places limits on societies to practice imperialism but in no way enforces the validity of this belief. So, for example, while a cultural relativist will not take a strong stance against sexism, relativism does not innately reject this stance as wrong or useless, merely as unreasonable. (c) What has happened in the past is irrelevant Cultural relativism, to me, seems to have two purposes: 

Let's suppose that I have a cat that loves purple. She only lies on the mat if the mat is purple. If the mat is any other colour, she will sleep elsewhere. Evidently, she also sometimes sleeps on the floor, or on the couch, even if the mat is purple. But if she is on the mat, then the mat is purple. So, lets look at the composite proposition P1, of the P2 → P3 kind: 

No. The nominalist position is that a name is only a name and does not express any "deeper" reality about what it names. A cat obviously "is" many things, a mammal, a carnivore, an awfully cute critter with retractible claws that licks itself clean. And, as famously described in philosophy, an animal that is sometimes on a mat. To a nominalist, the name "cat" doesn't contain in itself all those determinations of being a cat. And evidently, if we call a cat something else, it doesn't turn into that something else; it remains a cat. And nominalists would recognise this, and so it isn't correct to propose that "nominalism is to assert something is what we call it". 

So here we get to the case where P1 can no longer be true. If the cat is on the mat, then the mat is purple. But we have now empirically verified that the cat is on the mat, and the mat is blue, or pink with yellow polka dot. So, when P2 is true, and P3 false, the implication itself is false. This gets confused because when in common parlance we hear "if... then" we tend to associate this with causation, as if P → Q meant "P causes Q". But in logic-ese "if.. then" doesn't work like that. The mat isn't purple because the cat is on it, and the cat isn't on it because it is purple (she is on it because she is tired, or sleepy, or bored, or some other cat reason; the mat being purple is a condition, but not the cause, of the present cat-on-the-matness). What P → Q means in the context of logic classes is exactly this: "P is never the case when Q is not the case". Hope this helps. 

I know that, at least, in my moral theory, there's no action that can be taken to remove a life forms rights completely. However, developing life forms capable of sacrificing more easily and readily for the collective would seem to me to be a moral pursuit in an environment where sacrifice is necessary. In the case of the Restaurant, since technology should've developed to the point where sentient life no longer must sacrifice other life to survive, I don't believe there's any way the cow could be killed morally. In this case, I would use advanced simulation technology developed instead of the cow to convince people that they are experiencing what is described in the book, but are actually just be induced into a certain mental state. I think that answers a few angles of the question. Hope that helps! ================================================================================== Moral theory in question: 

Happiness is to be earned. Kindness is to be earned. Justice is important. The value of life is a function of its genetic similarity to myself. Rules are relative. 

All crime is preventable by government. Implement nuclear holocaust, exterminate all human life, crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Well, maybe that's not what we want to do. Maybe we want government to guarantee certain rights. Say one of those is the right to life (the government loses the death penalty). Sterilize all humans. Wait for the second to last person to die. All crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Okay, maybe we need a right to procreate. Distribute all humans in such a manner they can never interact with each other, but provide for IVF. Without the possibility of any human interaction, all crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Perhaps we want to have a right to live anywhere we choose. Sedate all humans such that they are incapable of any action. All crime rates drop to zero per unit time. This method requires autonomous care-takers. These might seem like unreasonable arguments, so I would ask - what is the fundamental philosophical difference between between these methods and a totalitarian police state? To me, there isn't one, and one of the reasons I think this question even came up is that some people today live under governments that do not guarantee sufficient rights that they have rights as a reason to not guarantee zero crime. The point being, all crime is preventable by government. What then, are the restrictions on crime prevention: 

Talking about empathy, it is often repeated that a psychopath is someone who is devoid of empathy. But empathy is a complicated thing; as someone else put it, if you break your leg, do you want a physician who painfully pulls it into the right position, or a physician who hugs you and cries together? "Empathy" can be paralising in this sence. If no empathy makes one a psychopath, unqualified empathy may turn one hysteric. Most of us are by far more empathetic towards our own relatives, friends, neighbours, etc, than towards people we do not know and live far away. And the idea that you should not mourn your grandmother because you didn't properly mourn the victims of a hurricane in Texas or an earthquake in Mexico is somewhat disturbing - at some point, all-encompassing empathy veers dangerously in the direction of no empathy at all. 

Positivism does not conceive knowledge as an activity: to positivists, the object of their study tells them what they need to know, thence they are stuck in contemplation of reality. As Marx pointedly remarks, 

The problem with your approach is that it is impossible to properly assess meaning without context. As Setargew Fantaw puts it, 

Not that any member of the set that never transitions from not yet existing to existing is not a part of everything, a contradiction, and there was once (presumably) nothing, so all members of everything experience at least one state transition. Ah hah, no we're getting into the subtleties of grammar. Is the Statue of Zeus a concept? In which case, the concept still exists. Is the Statue of Zeus an arrangement of matter? If so, no matter still exists in that arrangement, but the actual nature of the arrangement still exists as a possibility. Is the Statue of Zeus a specific incidence of an arrangement of matter? If so, then that specific incidence has experienced in second transition into formerly existing. So let's take members of the set of everything to also have the following attributes: an arrangement (for concepts we can use bit-modeled neural arrangements) and an incidence. So every member of the set of everything has a state, an arrangement, and an incidence. Take anything to be a member of the set of everything that is either in the state of not yet existing or formerly existing. Then anything does not exist but is still anything because it exists at another point in time. Similarly, the corollary for space would bundle a location with a member, so that if the Statue of Zeus at Olympia were moved to say, Missoula, then the Statue of Zeus at Olympia would no longer exist and therefore not exist, even though a member of everything with the same arrangement, incidence, and state would still exist. Alternatively, incidence could be tied to location. 

If both premises are true, then the conclusion is also necessarily true. It can be perhaps argued that 1. is not true; there could be other reasons why kidnappers would not blindfold their victims. Sheer incompetence, or having some kind of power over the victim that will prevent the latter from seeking the police after the fact, come to mind. If so, not the full reasoning, but the major premise may be characterised as a black-and-white, or excluded middle, fallacy. But if 1. is true (ie, the victim knows that the kidnappers are not incompetent, and cannot think of any reason why s/he won't immediately seek the police to get justice done), I can see no fallacy there. So, barring any doubts of the kidnappers incompetence or the possibility of an ongoing blackmail after ransom and release, option (d), no fallacy. (And, in practical life, if you are kidnapped and not blindfolded, yes, fear for your life, and attempt to escape whenever possible. Do not let concerns about the competence of your kidnappers or the possibility of blackmail stop you from trying.) 

Here the person uttering the sentence is admiting to being dishonest (which brings the question, why would we believe what they are telling us, but that is a digression). But is that person being honest about her own dishonesty, and how can they assess the existence of honesty in other people? This brings on a very interesting issue: that of statements that imply the impossibility of any verification. Any person that tries to answer to this with a sentence by asserting their own honesty will probably be told that this in fact "proves" the inexistence of honesty, as their answer is itself one more instance of lying. Similarly, the assertion of the existence of invisible green pixies: "of course you cannot see them; as I told you, they are invisible". 

Oh no, you asked an extension question about taking a position. Well that makes this harder. I would argue that being sufficiently informed to produce a position on any issue will necessarily introduce non-zero bias. However, we may be able to further refine our answers. For example, perhaps we can eliminate one of the above cases with the following definition: 

It is fairly straight-forward to construct a Turing machine from a given finite start space and a given Turing machine that, in a finite number of states and finite amount of time (which is constant) produces a given start state and then runs the given Turing machine on the input. That is to say, it reduces to standard computation. 

I think that perhaps the biggest point here is that chemically identical but ethically "clean" dairy products could be developed using humane methods, and this would allow consumption with no ethical ramifications. However, that isn't immediately viable or what you're asking, so I've attempted to address your sub-points more closely. a) To borrow from economics, animals could reasonably be held to own everything they produce themselves. I believe that technology is the long term solution to no intervention: eventually we put all the humans in spaceship and fly off, leaving Earth as a nature reserve (maybe clean it up a bit first). The costs of doing this immediately would be incredibly high, even just measuring in terms of animal welfare, but in the mean time I believe equal consideration is a fairly reasonable guide as a global utilitarianism (across species). As plants don't implement nervous systems, they can be reasonably held to either have no utility curve, or at the very least, the worst possible endocrine distress a plant can experience can be held to be less costly than that of any organism with a nervous system. I would argue that equal consideration does hold for plants, it's just that they experience pain and utility to a lesser extent due to their structure's natural tendency toward stoicism. b) Reproduction and associated overhead are not zero cost processes, that is, even if there is sufficient milk for offspring, a maternal mammal would still have to more rapidly deplete her body to provide additional milk. As this is nonconsensual by definition, it is relatively difficult (but not impossible) to defend morally. Attempted defense: It is important to consider that this probabilistically increased milk production and associated body degradation is a low cost operation, and violation of rights in this case may be globally optimal in equal consideration as, for example, the provision of milk for a human caretaker may be considered a form of mutual welfare or a service purchased with labor. In some cases, the greater good invalidates the need for consent. Just as paramedics are permitted to assist unconscious patients incapable of communication, it is not unreasonable to argue that a non-consensual partnership between humans and other animals is not just ethically acceptable, but possibly necessary. Perhaps a better example is the idea of spaying and neutering cats and dogs- non-consensual, a violation of individual liberties, but generally considered a moral mandate. As mentioned earlier, eggs are an even more difficult argument, but it could still be made.
