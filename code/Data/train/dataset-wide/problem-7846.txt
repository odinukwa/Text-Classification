I agree with Ryan and Victor, except that you don't need presentations. The subgroup $[G \ltimes H,G \ltimes H]$ is generated by $[H,H] \cup [G,H] \cup [G,G]$, so you can write $$(G \ltimes H)^{ab} = (G \ltimes H) / \langle [H,H] \cup [G,H] \cup [G,G] \rangle.$$ If you apply the relators $[H,H]$, you get $G \ltimes H^{ab}$; then if you apply the relators $[G,H]$, you get $G \times (H^{ab})_G$; then finally if you apply $[G,G]$, you get $G^{ab} \times (H^{ab})_G$. You can add this as an extra half-paragraph or footnote rather than giving a citation. I don't think that the referee has the right to demand a longer explanation than this, unless maybe you are writing a textbook. 

A Hecke algebra describes the most reasonable way to convolve functions or measures on a homogeneous space. Suppose that you have seen the definition of convolution of functions on a vector space, or on a discrete group --- the latter is just the group algebra of the group or some completion. Then how could you reasonably define convolution on a sphere? There is no rotationally invariant way to convolve a general $f$ with a general $g$. However, if $f$ is symmetric around a reference point, say the north pole, then you can define the convolution $f * g$, even if $g$ is arbitrary. This is the basic idea of the Hecke algebra. The $(n-1)$-sphere is the homogeneous space $SO(n)/SO(n-1)$. A function $g$ on the sphere is a function on left cosets. A function $f$ on the sphere which is symmetric about a reference point is a function on double cosets. If $H \subseteq G$ is any pair of compact groups, if $f$ is any continuous function on $H\backslash G/H$, and if $g$ is any continuous function on $G/H$, then their product in the continuous group algebra is well-defined on $G/H$. The functions on double cosets make an algebra, the Hecke algebra, and the functions on left cosets are a bimodule of the Hecke algebra and the parental group $G$. It is important for the same reasons that any other kind of convolution is important. A particular case studied by Hecke Iwahori and others from before quantum algebra was the finite group $GL(n,q)$ and the upper triangular subgroup $B$. This is "the" Hecke algebra; it turns out that it is one algebra with a parameter $q$. Or as Ben says, this generalizes to the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of an algebraic group $G$ with a Borel subgroup $B$. 

I don't quite have in mind any construction that fully singles out this element, which is called the Weyl element $\rho$, as the most important one. To an extent you don't even expect that in the non-simply-laced case, because a dual elements, half of the sum of the coroots, is sometimes comparably important. However, I know that the Weyl element has long been important for $q$-analogue" reasons, which in more modern work has become more and more important because it points to quantum groups and eventually even categorification. Consider the elementary fact that there are $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ subsets of size $k$ of the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. This counting fact is a special case of the Weyl dimension formula for the dimension of an irreducible representation of a complex simple Lie algebra. In this model case the representation is $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$ acting on $\Lambda^k(\mathbb{C}^n)$. You could look at the same counting problem again with multiplicative weights for the elements of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. If you make the weight of $j$ be some variables $x_j$, the total weight is an irreducible polynomial --- equivalent to the full character of $\Lambda^k(\mathbb{C}^n)$. Magically, if you let $x_j = q^j$ for a single variable $q$, you get (up to a power of $q$) the Gaussian binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}_q$. This is a special case of the Weyl $q$-dimension formula which gives the character of the Weyl element. That is, the dimension of an irreducible representation $V_\lambda$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ is given by a tidy ratio, and the $q$-dimension still is. The full character is not as simple, and therefore neither are most 1-variable specializations. Bourbaki, and maybe Weyl himself, used the $q$-dimension to prove the dimension formula by plugging in $q=1$. (It can happen in combinatorics that a $q$-analogue is easier than the original question.) In modern representation theory the $q$-dimension is even more important, because it's also (after centering the powers of $q$) the quantum dimension of the same representation $V_\lambda$ (or we can say, the same-named representation) of the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. The Weyl element also arises in many other ways in the representation theory of the quantum group. Actually, that's an understatement: This $q$ is the variable of the Jones polynomial and its generalizations. All of this $q$-structure remains important in the even newer categorifications of quantum groups. (A caveat: Because half-integer powers of $q$ commonly arise, there is a substitution of $q^2$ for $q$ in passing from $q$-analogues to quantum groups. I never liked this mismatch of conventions, in fact as a student I didn't even realize/believe it, but it is an established standard.) There is another formula for the Weyl element: It's the sum of the fundamental weights. It's already interesting that these two formulas agree. 

The Lagrange inversion formula is meant to give you the Taylor series expansion of $f^{-1}$ at the point $f(0)$. If $f$ has a Laurent series instead, then it means that $f(0) = \infty$ and that $f$ is meromorphic. The Taylor series at $\infty$ of $f^{-1}$ then doesn't particularly mean anything unless you change to a different coordinate patch on the Riemann sphere, for instance $\zeta = 1/z$. So you can first switch to the function $1/f$, which has a usual Taylor series, and then use the standard Lagrange inversion formula for $(1/f)^{-1}$. (If I have understood the question correctly. Maybe this answer is too straightforward to address the real question.) 

The categorical answer is that (in characteristic zero) this is the only way that you can make a suitable symmetric tensor category, other than by using group representations. There is a Tannakian theorem of Deligne to this effect in the algebraic setting. One of the physical answers is equivalent to the categorical answer. "Parastatistics" is the topic of self-consistent linear actions of the symmetric group on identical quantum-mechanical particles. The parastatistics theorem in physics (or theorems or conjectures; the level of rigor of the real point is not entirely clear) is a lot like Deligne's theorem. It says that parastatistical particles come in two kinds, parafermions and parabosons, and that they can all be modeled as fermions and bosons together with internal state spaces which are group representations. Bosons and fermions may not look exactly the same as commutative or supercommutative algebras. But they are the same topic, because (if you apply second quantization in reverse) the values of their fields commute or anticommute. For particles in 2D, the correct group action is the braid group, not the symmetric group. So in this case, the parastatistics theorem does not hold and you can have "anyons". Then the allowed statistics is given by a unitary ribbon tensor category. However, since the category in question is no longer symmetric, there is no clear way to define commutativity; at least, nothing that's clearly important. Note also that isn't just that the principle of available symmetric tensor categories comes from category theory and is needed in physics. It's also needed in topology. The most traditional supercommutativity in mathematics is cohomology. 

The other place that the Hecke algebra arises is as an interesting deformation of the symmetric group, or rather as a deformation of its group algebra. It has a parameter $q$ and you obtain the symmetric group when $q=1$. As I said, it is also the Hecke algebra of $GL(n,q)/GL(n,q)^+$, where $B = GL(n,q)^+$ is the Borel subgroup of upper-triangular matrices (all of them, not just the unipotent ones). There is a second motivation for the Hecke algebra that I should have mentioned: It immediately gives you a representation of the braid group, and this representation reasonably quickly leads to the Jones polynomial and even the HOMFLY polynomial. When the Jones and HOMFLY were first discovered, it was simply a remark that the braid group representation was through the same Hecke algebra as the convolutional Hecke algebra for $GL(n,q)/B$ (or equivalently $SL(n,q)/B$). Even so, it's a really good question to confirm this "coincidence", as Arminius asks in the comment. Particularly because it is now a fundamental and useful relation and not a coincidence at all. As Ben explains in his blog post, the first model of the Hecke algebra is important for the categorification of the second model. The coset space of $GL(n,q)/B$ consists of flags in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, and you can see these more easily using projective geometry. When $n=2$, there is an identity double coset 1 and another double coset $T$. A flag is just a point in $\mathbb{P}^1$, and the action of $T$ is to replace the point by the formal sum of the other $q$ points. Thus you immediately get $T^2 = (q-1)T + q.$ When $n=3$, a flag is a point and a line containing it in $\mathbb{P}^2$. The two smallest double cosets other than the identity are $T_1$ and $T_2$. $T_1$ acts by moving the point in the line; $T_2$ acts by moving the line containing the point. A little geometry then gives you that $T_1T_2T_1$ and $T_2T_1T_2$ both yield one copy of the largest double coset and nothing else. Thus they are equal; this is the braid relation of the Hecke algebra. When $n \ge 3$, the Hecke algebra is given by these same local relations, which must still hold. 

Based on a conversation with Dan Romik, here is a generalization of Doug's bounds on volume. Let $H(n,t)$ be the hypergraph of all $t$-tuples of a set with $n$ elements, and let $n > k > t$ be another integer. Suppose each hyperedge $T$ is colored by an i.i.d. random variable $x_T$ that takes values in some measure space $X$. Suppose furthermore that for each subset of $k$-subset $K$, there is some non-trivial symmetric, measurable restriction $R \subset X^{\binom{k}{t}}$ on the colors $x_T$ for $T \subseteq K$. Let $P(n)$ be the probability that all of the restrictions on the coloring of $H(n,t)$ are satisfied. Theorem: For every $m \ge k$, $$\limsup_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log P(n)}{n^t} \le \frac{\log P(m)}{m^t}.$$ Corollary: The limit $$\alpha = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log P(n)}{n^t}$$ exists, and one obtains better and better bounds on $\alpha$ by computing $P(m)$ for specific values of $m$, beginning with the case $m=k$ which implies that $\alpha < 0$. In general one obtains $\alpha \in [-\infty,0)$. Proof. The theorem is a corollary of Rödl's theorem that there exists a packing of blocks of size $k$ which are disjoint on hyperedges of $H(n,t)$, and which cover a fraction of the $t$-tuples that converges to 1 as $n \to \infty$. Theorem: (1) If the condition $R$ contains a cube $I^{\binom{k}{t}}$, where $I \subset X$ is some event with positive measure, then $\alpha > -\infty$. (2) If there is a finite partition $\{I_i\}$ of $X$ such that $R$ is disjoint from each $I_i^{\binom{k}{t}}$, then $\alpha = -\infty$ because $P(n) = 0$ when $n$ is large enough. For instance, suppose that $X$ is a compact Riemannian manifold with Riemannian measure. Then condition (1) is satisfied if the interior of $R$ contains at least one point on the diagonal. Condition (2) is satisfied if the closure of $R$ is disjoint from the diagonal. Proof. Case (1) is just the remark that the probability $P(n)$ is at least the probability of landing in $I^{\binom{n}{t}}$. Case (2) follows from Ramsey's theorem. 

(Edit: My notation for #4 was not strictly correct.) I think, although I can't really speak with authority, that these are all of them. I thought that I knew all of these rings, but that was naive. One point is that among algebras over $\mathbb{Z}/p$, the length is too small to see anything non-toric. But you can also have local rings that look like these toric local algebras (which I listed first), but have carries. The most creative one is the fourth one of length 3, namely $(\mathbb{Z}/p^2)[\sqrt{p}]$. You can express an element of this ring as three digits in base $p$, say $d_2d_1d_0$. Then addition carries from $d_0$ to $d_2$. I would also guess that all of these generalize to $\mathbb{F}_q$, using the Witt vector construction in the cases with carries. And maybe it is again all of them. 

Google Scholar finds three papers with the phrase "Artin-Schreier root" or "Artin-Schreier roots" (with quotes). The papers are by Jing Yu, Thomas Scanlon, and Spencer Bloch + Helene Esnault. This is not all that many, but maybe enough for some kind of standard. Various people, probably enough to call it standard, also use the notation $\wp(x)$ (Weirstrass p, or \wp in amslatex) for the Artin-Schreier polynomial. So you could use the notation $\wp^{-1}(x)$ for an Artin-Schreier root of $x$. (The notation is unambiguous, because which polynomial you take is determined by the characteristic of the field containing $x$.) The notation is often used to mean the first Artin-Schreier polynomial with $q=p$, which is unambiguous but only in a lame sense. (As Pete was too polite to emphasize in his comment, I should have read the question more carefully.) 

The Wikipedia article is more technical than it should be, and for the reader in a hurry not all that well written. Here is a summary of the main points as best I understand them: Complex manifolds are analogous to smooth complex algebraic varieties, not to the singular ones. But that discrepancy is surmountable, because you can also have complex analytic varieties which can have similar singularities. Then the first and most important relation is that every complex algebraic variety is a complex analytic variety. Every Zariski open set is analytically open; analytic gluing maps are more general than algebraic ones; and the allowed analytic charts are more general than the allowed algebraic charts. Also every algebraic morphism is an analytic morphism, so you get a morphism between categories. But the connection is better than that because of the GAGA principle (globally analytic implies globally algebraic). My understanding of GAGA is very sketchy, but I think that the following is correct. Among other consequences of GAGA, a closed analytic subvariety of a proper (equivalent to compact) algebraic variety is algebraic. An analytic isomorphism between two proper algebraic varieties is algebraic. I would suppose that there is a similar principle for compact fibrations as well. So, if you make compact analytic varieties algebraically, you can't escape from the algebraic class some of the main constructions of complex manifolds do not escape from the algebraic class. (But not all: deformations and infinite group actions can escape.) All projective analytic varieties are algebraic, and in dimension 1 all compact curves are projective. Moreover, there are limited ways for a compact analytic manifold to avoid being projective, by Moishezon's theorem and Kodaira's theorem. In practice, then, most of the complex manifolds that people make are algebraic. Also, most of the analytic calculations on a proper algebraic variety are algebraic: Many global calculations are algebraic by GAGA, and many local calculations are algebraic just by truncating Taylor series. Contrast all this with real algebraic vs real analytic. It is still true that (the real points of) a smooth real algebraic variety is a real analytic manifold. More strongly than in the complex case, although it is highly non-trivial, every compact real analytic manifold is real algebraic. But the real algebraic structure is massively not unique, even for a circle, and that makes all the difference. 

Now that I read on a bit more of the paper, the authors give some constructions of quivers with rigid potentials. For instance, they establish that the existence of a rigid potential is a mutation-invariant property of quivers. They also provide an example of a rigid quiver which does not mutate to an acyclic quiver. You can go a little further: In studying the cyclic part of the path algebra of a quiver, you can restrict attention to its strongly connected components. So you can start with any collection of strongly connected, rigid quivers, then connect them any way you like acyclically, and then mutate that. It sounds like the status quo of the question is that there are several constructions of quivers that do not have rigid potentials, and several constructions of quivers that have rigid potentials, but that finding a good characterization of the dichotomy is an open problem. Also, clearly the quivers that do not have rigid potentials are recursively enumerable. (I.e., there is an algorithm to confirm that a quiver does not have a rigid potential, but it might not terminate if it does have one.) Maybe a good remaining question is whether quivers with rigid potentials are also recursively enumerable, i.e., that the dichotomy is recursive.
