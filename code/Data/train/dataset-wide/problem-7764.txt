I am interested in the proof of the following result which gives an estimate on the Schwartz Kernel of a $\Psi$DO. There is one aspect the proof that is not clear to me which I would like to ask the mathoverflow community about: The theorem Suppose that $q(x,D)$ is a pseudodifferential operator acting on distributions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with symbol $q$ in $S^{-s}_{1,0}$ and define $\displaystyle \tilde \Phi(x,z) = \int q(x,\xi) e^{ix\cdot\xi}\,\text{d}\xi\,.$. In his book "Pseudodifferential Operators" from 1981, Michael E. Taylor claims in Proposition 3.1 of Chapter XII that for $|\xi| \leq C$ and $s < n$, we have the estimate $\displaystyle |\tilde \Phi(x,z)| \leq C |z|^{-n + s}\,. $ Note: $C$ is a generic constant, so the meaning of $C$ may change from one line to the next. The beginning of the proof and my question Firstly, Taylor observes that it suffices to consider symbols that do not depend on $x$. Furthermore, he observes that $q \in S^{-s}_{1,0}$ implies that the family of functions $q_r(\xi) = r^sq(r\xi)$ where $r$ runs from $1$ to $\infty$ forms a bounded set in $C^\infty(1 \leq |\xi| \leq 2)$. I assume he means here that all the derivatives are uniformly bounded. What I do not understand is the following part: Taylor claims that the above facts imply that $q$ can be written as $\displaystyle q(\xi) = q_0(\xi) + \int_{0}^\infty p_\tau(e^{-\tau}\xi)\,\text{d}\tau$ where $q_0(\xi) \in C^\infty_c$ and $e^{s\tau}p_\tau(\xi)$ is bounded in the Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $0 \leq \tau < \infty$. Unfortunately, I do not see how this follows. The rest of the proof I give a sketch of the rest of the proof here for completeness sake: Firstly, we have $\displaystyle \hat q(z) = \hat q_0(z) + \int_{0}^\infty e^{n\tau} \hat p_\tau(e^{-\tau}z)\,\text{d}\tau$ We observe that $e^{s\tau} \hat p_\tau(z)$ is also bounded in $\mathcal{S}$, which leads to the estimates $e^{s\tau} |\hat p_\tau(z)| \leq C_N(1 + |z|)^{-N}$ with the constants independent of $\tau$. Then, we can estimate $\displaystyle |\hat q(z)| \leq C + C_N |z|^{s-n}\int_0^\infty e^\tau|z|^{n-s}(1 + |e^\tau z|)^{-n}\,\text{d}\tau$. Using a transformation of the form $\tau \mapsto \tau + \log(|z)$, one can bound the last integral and finish the proof. 

My example comes from algebraic geometry, specifically in the theory of $\lambda$-rings, which are used in K-theory and representation theory (and possibly other places of which I am unaware). If you look in Lecture Notes in Mathematics 308 $\lambda$-rings and the Reprsentation Theory of the Symmetric Group by Donald Knutson, on pp 27, there is a theorem which is called--quite appropriately--the "Verification Principle", and it is used to do exactly the kind of thing you're asking about. The statement is: If $\mu$ is a $\lambda$-ring operation, then $\mu$ is uniquely a polynomial in the $\lambda$-operations and for any particular polynomial $f(\lambda^1,\lambda^2,\ldots , \lambda^n,\ldots)$ it is sufficient to check that $\mu = f$, operating on a sum $\xi_1+\ldots + \xi_r$ of elements of degree 1, for all $r>0$. If you read the first part of the book (i.e. up to page 27 where you read this) you learn that this is a very handy thing indeed, especially given the generating function polynomials that show up in the study of these objects and how much easier it is to check for things which are polynomials in the $\lambda$-operations (as they are called). It is this that so nicely ties this kind of ring in with the representation theory of the symmetric group, in particular the elementary symmetric functions, as Knutson mentions on p. 10 of the same publication. Another useful technique is one that comes up in algebra, when you check something for general elements by checking on a basis. Eg. testing something for all the elements of your tensor or exterior algebra by testing it on the "pure" or "completely decomposable" tensors which form a generating set. 

Every book on Riemann surfaces should. My personal favorite is Rick Miranda's "Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces" but there's also Farkas and Kra, which gives a more analytic point of view. 

When the curve is a plane curve of degree $d$, the formula is simple (and in fact, this works for any hypersurface) you take $f(x,y)=0$ and replace it by $z^d f(x/z,y/z)=0$. This will be homogeneous of degree $d$, and when $z\neq 0$, you recover your curve. Now, if you have a more general affine variety, given by $\langle f_1,\ldots,f_k\rangle$ in $k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, then you first compute a Groebner Basis, which you can learn how to do using Cox, Little and O'Shea's "Ideals, Varieties and Algorithms" (assumes no background whatsoever) and then you do this same trick with each polynomial in the Groebner basis. Why can't you just use any basis? Look at the twisted cubic. $t\mapsto (t,t^2,t^3)$. This is cut out, in affine space, by $y-x^2$ and $z-x^3$, though $y-x^2$ and $xy-z$ are better to use. But still, $yw-x^2$ and $xy-zw$ don't give the twisted cubic! Bezout tells us that they give something of degree four containing the cubic, and it's not a hypersurface, so you get the twisted cubic plus a line. To get the cubic itself, you have to use a third quadratic polynomial that you get in the ideal, $y^2-xz$, which is not in the ideal given by the homogenized generators. These three, however, form a Groebner basis for the ideal, and then homogenization gives the homogeneous ideal of the projective twisted cubic. 

The question I consider the Laplacian $\Delta = \partial_1^2 + \partial_2^2 + \partial_3^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. By the "standard" fundamental solution of the Laplacian, I mean the function $$ \displaystyle E(x) = C|x|^{-1} $$ where $C$ is some normalization constant. I would like to know if one can construct a fundamental solution of the Laplacian that decays faster than any rational function at infinity. I have an idea how one could maybe construct this, but I'm not sure if my idea is correct as the idea of a suspicious fundamental solution seems highly suspicious to me. In the following, I sketch my idea: An attempt at an answer I already know that one can construct a rapidly decaying parametrix $F$ by multiplying $\hat E \sim |x|^{-2}$ with a cutoff function $\chi$ supported in the complement of the unit ball and then taking the inverse Fourier transform. Then, one has $$x^\alpha F(x) = \int D^\alpha(\chi\hat E)(\xi)e^{ix\xi}\text{d}\xi $$ and the right hand side is absolutely convergent for large $\alpha$. This proves the decay at infinity. I want to modify this construction in order to turn the parametrix $F$ into a proper fundamental solution. To do this, I want to use a simplified version of the construction by HÃ¶rmander (see "Distribution" by Duistermaat and Kolk, Theorem 17.11). Letting $\eta$ be a unit vector, I set $$ G(x) = (2\pi)^{-n} \int \frac{1- \chi(\xi)}{2\pi i}\int_{|z| = 100} \frac{e^{ix\cdot(\xi + z \eta)}}{|\xi + z\eta|^2}\frac{\text{d}z}{z}\text{d}\xi\,.$$ With Cauchy's integral theorem, one can show that $$\tilde E = F + G$$ is indeed a fundamental solution. The idea here is that we avoid the singularity at $0$ by taking a contour integral around it. It seems as if one can use the same trick that one used for $F$ to show the rapid decay of $G$. This suggest that one can indeed find a rapidly deacying fundamental solution. 

So, let's say we have a symplectic variety over $\mathbb{C}$, $M$, of dimension $2n$, and $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ Poisson commuting functions with $df_1\wedge\ldots\wedge df_n$ generically nonzero. Further assume that the fibers of the map $f:M\to\mathbb{C}^n$ determined by the $f_i$ is an open subset of an abelian variety and the vector fields $X_{f_i}$ are linear. We call such a thing an algebraically completely integrable Hamiltonian system. Now, I'm told that there's a definition of integrable system in PDEs that acts as some sort of stability condition, though I don't understand it. I've also been told that there's a way to, from an integrable system of PDEs, construct an integrable Hamiltonian system (just drop the condition that fibers be in abelian varieties), and that these two types of objects should be equivalent. My questions: 1) What's the correct formulation for PDEs to make something like this work out? (I know virtually nothing about PDEs, and would be quite grateful just to be pointed at a good reference, if there's too much I need to read to get a quick, understandable answer) 2) Is there a general method of going from an algebraically completely integrable Hamiltonian system, which is algebro-geometric in nature to working out the PDEs explicitly? Does it help if the symplectic variety is known to be the cotangent bundle of something? How about if the base is unirational? rational? 

The definitions of a divisible group that I have seen all seem to assume abelian is an a priori property of the group. My question is as to whether or not it is known that--given a non-torsion element $\tau\in\mathbf{G}$* and $n\in\mathbb{N}$, do we know if $\exists \tau'\in\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\tau=\tau'^n$? The motivation is that--if this never happens--then the fields $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}^\tau$ should be sort of "maximal" subfields of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ since fixing by the generator would be equivalent to fixed by any power of it. Edit: anon has noted that quotients of divisible groups are divisible, so we can lay to rest that $\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ is not divisible. Can we tell if the opposite is true? I.e. the answer to "can I find such a $\tau '$ given $n$" is "no", but how about the somewhat interesting and related question: If I have a cyclic subgroup of the absolute Galois group, $C=\langle\tau\rangle$ can we find a maximal (with respect to inclusion), cyclic group containing $C$? Of course this is equivalent to a minimal field in a chain, so it seems like if that is so something interesting must be going on. The other related question which deals with the original spirit of the problem is: are there $\tau$ such that $\langle \tau^n\rangle$ fixes $k\subseteq\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ then $\langle\tau\rangle$ fixes $k$? i.e. is $k=\overline{\mathbb{Q}}^\tau$ equivalent to $k=\overline{\mathbb{Q}}^{\tau^n}$ possible for some $\tau$ non-torsion? If so can such elements be characterized? The immediate observation is that, by the FTGT, if we identify $\langle\tau\rangle\cong\mathbb{Z}$ and write $[n]$ for the index $n$ subgroup, that--in the topology of $\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$--necessarily $\overline{[n]}=\overline{[1]}$. I.e. the monothetic group $\overline{[1]}$ has every element is a generator. If $\overline{[1]}$ were connected, of course this would be trivial to check since the set of generators has Haar measure 1 in this case, and a finite index subgroup has positive Haar measure, and so contains a generator, but the topology here is totally disconnected so it is not easy to see one way or the other. *My TeX was not rendering properly when I wrote $\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ here, so I just included it as a sidenote rather than have it look like a mess. 

So, a basic set-up in modern enumerative geometry is that you have some object $X$ (say, a "nice" stack, for whatever definition of "nice" you need) and then you want to "count" the curve of genus $g$ intersecting a bunch of cohomology classes and of degree $\beta$, so you look at $\bar{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}(X,\beta)$, then pull back the classes, intersect, and get a Gromov-witten Invariant. Famously, this gives the Kontsevich formula counting rational curves in the projective plane passing through $3d-1$ points. And though GW-invariants can be negative and rational, there are nice cases where they do count something legitimate, such as the genus $0$, $n\geq 3$ case into a homogeneous space. So, enough background, here's my question (and this is largely idle curiosity, so no specific motivation): can we do this in higher dimensions? For instance, given a (smooth?) variety $V$ and marking a bunch of subvarieties $W_1,\ldots,W_n$ (maybe restricting them to points?) can we form $\bar{\mathcal{M}}_{V,(W_1,\ldots,W_n)}(X,\beta)$ a moduli space of stable mappings of varieties deformation equivalent to the one we started with into our space, represented by a given cohomology class $\beta$ and with $W_1,\ldots,W_n$ intersecting some cohomology classes, so that we can get something that can be called higher dimensional Gromov-Witten invariants? If this has been studied, under what conditions does it actually count subvarieties? For instance, if $X$ is $\mathbb{P}^N$ and $V=\mathbb{P}^2$, and maybe if we loosen things to just needing rational maps, could we use something like this to count rational surfaces, satisfying some incidence conditions? 

Well it seems to me the Cauchy-Riemann equations say quite a lot. After all once you know the real and imaginary parts are harmonic, then you know their derivatives are as well, and $$f'(z)=u_x(z)+iv_x(z)$$ so you can do it again. I don't think this is boot-strapping it, but if anyone greater on the complex food-chain cares to disagree, I'm likely retreat quickly at their word. 

Fix an algebraic closure, $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ for the rationals and consider the set, $B_p$, of all places of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ over a fixed (possibly infinite) prime, $p$, of $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $G_\mathbb{Q}=\text{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$. 1: Let $G_\mathbb{Q}$ act on $B_p$ in the natural way. Then what is the structure of the stabilizer, $H_v$ of $v$, for $v|p$ an element of $B_v$? Infinite primes are just embeddings of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ into $\mathbb{C}$, so the case $p=\infty$ is really asking for the stabilizer of the action of left multiplication in $G_\mathbb{Q}$, and for finite $p$ it should be the inverse limit--over finite, Galois extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$--of the decomposition groups of primes $\mathfrak{p}|p$. However, actually getting ones hands on the structure of the stabilizers in question seems to be a hard question, at least no one I've talked to so far seems to know much more than the obvious things stated here. 2: Is is perhaps easier to describe the cosets $G/H_v$? If so, what should they look like? 

Let $X$ be a quasi-projective variety. Suppose that we (perhaps partially, if either enough is known) compactify to $\bar{X}$ with $\bar{X}\setminus X=D$ is a divisor. Say that we know the canonical bundle $K_X$. Then $K_{\bar{X}}=K_X+nD$ for some $n$. 

There is a map $d\log:H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X^\times)\to H^1(X,\Omega_X^1)$ taking a line bundle to it's Chern class (at least, when everything is over $\mathbb{C}$, I believe this works). An ample class is then the Chern class of an ample line bundle. 

My intuition for the symplectic form in mechanics is that it tells you which coordinates are conjugate. By Darboux's Theorem, you can always write it as $\sum dx_i\wedge dp_i$, and being able to match a "position" coordinate with a "momentum" coordinate is essential to being able to do classical mechanics and to have equations of motion. More concretely and rigorously, Steve's answer says essentially the same thing, about turning the Hamiltonian into a vector field so that there will be a flow. 

Today, I heard that people think that if you can prove the Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties, then it should be true in general. Apparently this case is important enough (and hard enough) that Weil wrote up some families of abelian 4-folds that were potential counterexamples to the Hodge conjecture, but I've never heard of another potential counterexample. Anyway, in short: 1) Does the Hodge Conjecture for abelian varieties imply the full Hodge conjecture? 2) If not, is there an intuitive reason why abelian varieties should be the hardest case?
