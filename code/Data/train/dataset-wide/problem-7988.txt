An explicit (but quite complicated) answer can be found here: MR0224803 Kuzʹmina, G. V. Estimates of the transfinite diameter of a certain family of continua and covering theorems for schlicht functions. (Russian) Trudy Mat. Inst. Steklov 94 1968 47–65. 

The hard part is about simply connected Riemann surface. (Sometimes THIS is called the uniformization theorem). The reduction of the general case to the simply connected case is by the universal covering. (You can pull back all metrics, conformal structures etc. to the universal cover). There are several ways to prove the theorem for a simply connected surface. One of the simplest ways is Lavrentjev's proof which can be found in Goluzin's book Geometric theory of functions of a complex variable. This proof assumes that we already know that the surface is triangulable. (This is a purely topological consequence of a) and b) above, but again, not completely trivial. Of course, if you are interested only in COMPACT case, then it is not necessary to pass to the universal covering, many topological difficulties disappear, and more methods are available. Like the Ricci flow, for example. 

A non-trivial example is $CP^3$ minus 5 hyperplanes in general position. According to a theorem of Borel every holomorphic image of $C$ in this manifold is contained in a plane. (And there are finitely many of these planes). So every image of $C^2$ is also contained in a plane. And it is easy to see that the images can "fill" several planes. So $k=2$ according to your definition. 

You have to define what a "lacunary function" means. There are various lacunary conditions in the literature. If you mean sufficiently large lacunas so that your series have a whole circle of singularities, like in the example you give, such functions cannot be constructed as a finite composition of algebraic, exponential, and logarithmic ones. 

No this is not enough. You were given counterexamples on the web site you mention in 4. Yes, there are such functions, for example $(\sin x^3)/x$ It is hard to tell what is necessary, besides the trivial condition $\psi\psi'\to 0$. Compact support is sufficient but not necessary. You wrote the formula incorrectly: your RHS is $0$. Physicists frequently do not state their conditions precisely, you should accept this when you read physics literature. 

BTW, I disagree with designation "pre-modern" for the period before 1900. From my point of view, "modern period" begins with Abel. There is no substantial difference between Laguerre or Stiletjes and XX century mathematics. 

You wrote a series. If you mean that it converges for all $x\in R^n$ than this is an entire function that is the series also converges for $x\in C^n$. An entire algebraic function is a polynomial, indeed. This follows from the growth estimate and Cauchy's inequalities, for example. 

Just do what your adviser tells you to do and don't worry. Adviser has to approve your thesis before you defend or publish it. With his/her approval who can blame you in plagiarism from your adviser? EDIT. Concerning all other sources (other than your adviser) you should do all you can do to make sure where the ideas come from and give proper references. 

The answer is no, even in dimension $2$. Consider a simply connected region $D$ in the unit disc which approached the boundary with infinite spiraling (that is such region where a continuous branch of the $\arg z$ exists and tends to $+\infty$ as $|z|\to 1$ in the region). Let $u=Re f$, where $f$ is a conformal map of $D$ onto the right half-plane, so that every boundary point of $D$ inside the unit disc goes to the imaginary axis. Alternatively, $u$ is the positive harmonic function in $D$ zero on the part of the boundary of $D$ which is inside of the unit disc. Extend this $u$ to the rest of the disc by setting it to $0$. The resulting subharmonic function has no radial limit on any radius (upper limit is $+\infty$ and lower is $0$). Similar examples exist in any dimension. Function $u$ exists in any dimension by Martin's construction, for example: $$u(z)=\lim_{|\zeta|\to 1} g(z,\zeta)/g(z_0,\zeta),$$ where $g$ is the Green function of $D$, and $|\zeta|\to 1$ in $D$. Just take $D$ which intersects every radius nicely. 

There is a well-known Routh-Hurwitz stability condition (condition in terms of coefficients for the roots of a polynomial to lie in the left half-plane). By composing with a fractional linear transformation which maps the left half-plane onto the exterior of the unit circle, you obtain a condition for the roots to be in the exterior. (Of course, composition is a rational function, but just take its numerator). Similarly, you can obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the roots to be in the unit disc, or on the unit circle, or in any disc or a circle. The stability condition is written in terms of certain determinants made of coefficients; it can be found in books and papers on polynomials and on control theory. 

This is a special case of the Inverse Problem of the spectral theory. One can construct such a matrix (symmetric 3-diagonal) even with rational operations (without square roots). This construction has a very nice mechanical interpretation. I recommend the paper of M. Krein, On a remarkable problem for a string with beads, and on continued fractions of Stieltjes. This paper is available as an appendix to the book Gantmakher and Krein, Oscillation matrices and kernels... which has been recently translated into English, MR1908601. 

$V$ is pluripolar. Let $v$ be a plurisubharmonic function which is $-\infty$ on $V$. Then $\phi+\epsilon v$ is plurisubharmonic for $\epsilon>0$ (the definition of plurisubharmonic function is easily verified for it). Therefore when $\epsilon\to 0$ the limit must be plurisubharmonic. 

Probably it does not exist. I checked Zentralblatt; it usually reviews all translations. It has the Russian translation mentioned in the comments, but no English one. (In general, translations from French to English are rare in mathematics, probably because the demand is negligible: the languages share 60% of all vocabulary (I mean roots), and in Mathematics even more). 

A good reference on the subject is W. Wasow, Asymptotic expansions for ordinary differential equations. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York-London-Sydney 1965. It is not difficult to obtain the answer for small $n$, but computation for arbitrary $n$ may be complicated. Anyway, there is an algorithm of obtaining these asymptotics. 

You can construct a polynomial $p$ with prescribed values at all your points. Take $\exp(p)$, and then approximate this by sufficiently long partial sum of the Taylor series, so that the result does not have zeros in your square, and the values at the points of interest satisfy the desired inequalities. 

There are several complete characterizations of real entire functions whose all derivatives have all roots real: a) this is a closure of polynomials with the same property, and b) this class is represented by the formula $$f(z)=cz^me^{-az^2+bz}\prod_{k}\left(1-\frac{z}{z_k}\right)e^{z/z_k},$$ where $a\geq0$, $b,c$ are real, $m\geq 0$ is an integer and $z_k$ real, with $$\sum\frac{1}{|z_k|^2}<\infty.$$ This is a parametric description: each such function is represented by this formula, and each function represented by this formula has the stated property. This class of function has a standard name: Polya-Wiman class. These results are due to Wiman, Polya, Hellerstein and Williamson. For recent generalizations and survey, see arXiv:math/0510502. 

EDITED. I use the definition of "elementary function" of Liouville and Ritt (also repeated in Wikipedia). See Ritt's papers in TAMS 25 (1923) 211-222, and TAMS 27 (1925) 68-90. This definition includes the analytic continuation through removable singularities. These elementary functions are analytic and can be multi-valued. Of course, other definitions are possible, and the answer will depend on the definition. Your new definition of "elementary functions" is close to the classes of "elementary functions" and "naive elementary functions", defined by Laczkovich and Ruzsa except that they allow all constants in the definition, and you allow only $1$. The difference between their classes is in where exactly is $\arcsin$ defined. So it is important to state a more precise definition. Ref. M. Laczkovich and I. Ruzsa, Elementary and integral elementary functions, Illinois J. Math., 44, 1 (2000) 161-182. For elementary functions in the sense of Liouville and Ritt, the answer is probably different, depending on what you mean by the limit. (Existing of a limit as $x\to a$ when $x$ is complex is a much stronger condition then existence of a limit when $x$ is real). 

Q1: Plurisubharmonicity is not sufficient. $\log F$ is plurisubharmonic, which is a stronger property, but still far from sufficient. Plurisubharmonic functions may not be continuous. In fact $F$ is continuous and $\log|F|$ is pluriHARMONIC on the set where $F\neq 0$. But this is also not sufficient (consider the case of dimension $1$). In dimension 1, the characterization will be: $F$ is continuous, $\log|F|$ is subharmonic and $(1/2\pi)\Delta\log|F|$ is a discrete measure with integer atoms.
