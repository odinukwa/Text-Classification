Later parts of table 2.2 give a breakdown of types of services. Travel (for all purposes including education) - which should not include transport - seems to be a large part of US exports of services to China 

There is no particular reason to believe exactly the same things would happen in other housing crises or in other countries, but it is reasonable to expect a housing crisis to reduce consumption (the construction sector shrinks while others feel poorer) possibly leading to a recession and perhaps lower inflation. 

The Fisher equation as $$r=i-\pi$$ is little more than an approximation to the definition of the real interest rate $$r=\dfrac{1+i}{1+\pi} -1$$ where $r$ is the real interest rate, $i$ is the nominal interest rate and $\pi$ is inflation (the proportionate change in prices). You can complicate things by "coninuous compounding" but it makes little actual impact. Looking backwards you should look at actual interest and actual inflation at the time of the loan. Looking forward, if you do not know what inflation or interest rates will be then you can only use estimated values and forecaster often prefer to estimate inflation and real interest rates, turning the Fisher equation round to give $$i = r+ \pi$$ 

The percentages are of quarterly GDP. If you wanted exact annual percentages then you should add up the four quarterly figures in Euros and divide by the sum of the four quarterly figures for GDP in Euros (from a different Eurostat table), but you will get a close approximation if you take the average of the four quarterly percentages. So for Greece it might represent a government deficit of around 7.7% in 2015 Be aware that the numbers are not seasonally adjusted: it looks as if a lot of Greek government revenue and expenditure comes in Q4. 

The first point is that this is a flow statistic: it is the annual excess of income over consumption, in contrast to level statistics such as gross national debt which are largely accumulations of past flows. As what gross national saving is for: it funds investment, which affects future income and thus future consumption. Indeed, one of the tautologies of macroeconomics is that Savings = Investment. A low savings/GDP figure may indicate excessive consumption or insufficient income. It may lead to either inadequate domestic investment or the need to borrow from foreigners to fund domestic investment. A high savings/GDP figure may indicate insufficient consumption or excessive income. It may lead to either unproductive domestic investment or the need to lend to foreigners to recycle the funds. There is no optimal figure for savings. Comparative figures for different countries and global trends over time are published, for example from the World Bank. 

The effects can be quite different from a price (wage) ceiling. The baseline case where you have homogeneous, inelastically supplied labor that's free to move across different "types" of work produces no supply response in reaction to a wage ceiling, but leads to complete specialization in one type of labor or another in the case of enforced bounds on relative wages which rule out the competitive market allocation. For companies, enforcing internal wage ceilings may be a way of trying to address problems of corporate governance - the shareholders may be trying to address a principal-agent problem by getting such a policy instituted within the company. In that case, it may well improve efficiency, but it's hard to say if there would be a significant impact on the supply of executives available for corporate management. 

In general, "Ponzi schemes" in the context of asset pricing refer to "rational bubbles", or a failure of the transversality condition you need when passing from a flow identity to a present value identity. They are not "fraudulent schemes". For instance, there can be a rational bubble on a "fundamentally" worthless asset in a perfect foresight world if its price grows at the real interest rate available in the broader economy. (This is actually what you're talking about, in case it's not clear to you - each investor assumes they can offload the asset at a higher price to another investor, and you push the problem of the "greatest fool" to infinity, which makes the assumption a rational one ex post.) Is there any evidence for the existence of such rational bubbles? Cochrane (2002) points out that rational bubble theory does not account for the association of "bubbles" with high trading volume. In a rational bubble, it is rational to hold the asset in every period: there's no reason to observe high turnover along with high prices. They are also silent on the association of high prices with high volatility - in a rational bubble context, volatility (induced by shifting from one equilibrium to another) is always present, and the choice of equilibrium (the fact that we're on an explosive price path) does not produce more volatility than usual. Rational bubbles appear to be a poor explanation of events that people have historically described as "bubbles" (and of the price behavior of cryptocurrencies). In contrast, the convenience yield theory outlined in Cochrane (2002) and also in this blog post seems to fit the data much better. If "overvaluation" is driven by a liquidity premium induced by shorting constraints and a short-term constraint on supply, then we would expect to see the standard prediction of monetary economics that high prices should be associated with high turnover. In that case, overvaluation relative to "fundamentals" should also require shorting constraints - in the case of dollars vs treasuries, for instance, it's illegal to print banknotes or close substitutes to money to finance a purchase of bonds, which is a kind of shorting constraint. Indeed, shorting constraints are what we see in the cryptocurrency market: BTC futures have only recently started trading on stock exchanges, and even then the "electronic paper" that you hold when you take the long side of a BTC futures contract is not the same thing as holding BTC directly, so what appears like a possibility to short BTC through these contracts is in fact not so. (It satisfies "speculative demand", so it's possible to "bet on cryptocurrencies" without having to hold any, but it's not possible to use these contracts in the place of cryptocurrencies in transactions.) If you want to ask whether cryptocurrencies are a bubble, then you have to define what "bubble" means. If it is "overvaluation relative to fundamentals", then is USD a bubble? After all, it's trading at a premium relative to T-bills. If you include any convenience yield the asset may have in your definition of "bubble" so that USD is not one, then it's likely that cryptocurrencies are not "bubbles" either. It's very difficult to say anything about whether cryptocurrency valuations are "justified" or not by this explanation, since the convenience demand of cryptocurrencies, like of cash, has components which are not transparent. We're mostly in the dark, and I wouldn't try to outguess the market price of an asset in a circumstance where we know next to nothing about the factors which are driving the convenience demand for it. 

EUR/USD should be the value of one euro divided by the value of one dollar. Right now that seems to me to be about $1.1275$: in other words, $1$ euro is worth about $1.1275$ dollars. I suspect this is the final number in your expression. If it had been USD/EUR then I would expect the reciprocal value $0.8869$ so $1$ dollar is worth about $0.8869$ euros My guess is that $-0.04\%$ is the percentage change in the EUR/USD rate so the euro would have fallen by a tiny amount against the dollar. Whether this is since opening of the market today, or since the close yesterday or since a year ago is less clear. 

It is an national accounting reason, rather than the Irish people have higher incomes or being more productive It seems that some companies previously deemed to be foreign are now deemed to be Irish, and so their profits now count towards Irish GDP (and, to the extent they are not a subsidiary of a foreign company and retain their profits, also to Irish Gross National Income). The Irish Central Statistics Office said a 26.3% increase in GDP and 18.7% in GNI from 2014 to 2015 at constant prices What may have happened is inversion where United States companies are notionally taken-over by Irish companies (though the old US shareholders remain shareholders of the new merged company), largely to take advantage of Ireland's generous corporation tax regime. That makes their production/value-added/profits appear to be Irish this year, boosting Ireland's GDP compared with last year Further reading from 10 months ago when this was noticed: 

I suspect your induction hypothesis should be an expression for $P_t$ not $P_{t+j}$ , and should be discounting $P_{t+j}$ not $s$ times but $j$ times i.e. $$P_{t} = \left(\sum\limits_{s=1}^{j} \frac{D_{t+s}}{(1+k)^s}\right) + \frac{P_{t+j}}{(1+k)^j}$$ for $j \ge 1$, which reduces to your initial statement $P_t = \frac{D_{t+1}}{(1+k)} + \frac{P_{t+1}}{(1+k)}$ when $j=1$ Now consider your initial statement replacing $t$ by $t+j$ to give $P_{t+j}= \frac{D_{t+j+1}}{(1+k)} + \frac{P_{t+j+1}}{(1+k)}$ and substitute this into your induction hypothesis to give $$P_{t} = \left(\sum\limits_{s=1}^{j+1} \frac{D_{t+s}}{(1+k)^s}\right) + \frac{P_{t+j+1}}{(1+k)^{j+1}}$$ which proves that the corrected induction hypothesis follows from your original statement 

There is a futures market for crude oil: for example $URL$ gives a price now for May 2018 of US$\$49.54$ compared with a cash price now of US$\$47.82$ The futures price being higher than the cash price is described as contango and is why there are excess stockpiles of crude oil. In the past the comparison has sometimes been reversed, described as backwardation and associated with low stockpiles. For a graph of this over time, see $URL$ though the relationship is more complicated than described there For historical oil prices the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has several sets of numbers, such as $URL$ going back to 1946 

Intuitively, you test for cointegration because if two variables are cointegrated, they represent only a "one dimensional" family of data points - even if you have a million data points from that sample, they will all fall close to the same subspace, and in general that will mean that you will have many values of parameters for your regression problem which will give a good fit (spurious regression). Consider the linear regression case - say that you have $ y = Ax + \varepsilon $ as your regression problem, where $ x $ is a column vector, $ A $ is a row vector and $ y $ is a real number. Let's say further that the "structural" relationship we are looking for is $ y = Bx $, where $ B $ is also a row vector. Take an extreme case of cointegration - $ x $ is $ 2 $-dimensional, and we have a linear relationship between its coordinates, i.e $ x_2 = c x_1 $ for some constant $ c $. In this case, any linear functional $ A $ which is equal to $ B $ when restricted to the subspace spanned by $ (1, c) $ will give a perfect fit, and the regression won't be able to distinguish between them. (There's a one dimensional family of such functionals, i.e row vectors $ A $.) What VECM analysis does is to take advantage of deviations when the relationship is not perfect. In real econometric applications, you never have a relationship that's as clean as $ x_2 = c x_1 $ (or $ y = Bx $) for your entire dataset - cointegration allows for transitory white noise in the linear combination $ x_2 - c x_1 $. If the variance of the white noise is relatively small, a standard regression will still return similar $ R^2 $ values for many different operators. Instead, what you do is look at first differences: a good fit should also fit these, i.e we should have $$ Ax_{t+1} - Ax_t \approx y_{t+1} - y_t $$ where the subscripts denote the time of observation. Running the regression this way allows you to capture the white noise in the cointegration process and use it to your advantage - it's a way of capturing the information which a naive linear regression is going to miss. 

Falling oil prices may or may not lead to a lower price level depending on how you're measuring the price level and what measure of inflation the monetary authority is trying to target. Is the relevant inflation figure the GDP deflator? The PCE deflator? The CPI? The "core" CPI? Ignoring any nominal effects of falling oil prices if they exist at all, the mantra here is "never reason from a price change". Why is the price of oil falling? Is it because we've invented a new technology which allows us to synthesize oil at low cost, or is it because there was a recession in China which is leading to lower global demand? In the latter case, clearly the experience of the US and of China would be different. There's also the fact that higher productivity of the kind that would be caused by a new technology allowing easier production of oil may not necessarily translate into higher employment. In general, there are competing income and substitution effects in these situations - as you become wealthier you want to work less, but as wages are higher you want to work more. It's not clear a priori which effect would dominate. Finally, "unemployment" as used in "natural rate of unemployment" is meant to be a proxy for output gaps - if unemployment is higher than the "natural rate", then there's a negative output gap, and vice versa. In down-to-earth terms, we define "unemployment" as the state of not working but actively looking for a job, and the unemployment rate is the ratio of the number of such people to the size of the labor force. A change in the employment rate (the employment-to-population or employment-to-working age persons ratio) need not have any effect on the unemployment rate. Unemployment in a time of negligible output gaps is mostly the result of search frictions in the labor market. If a technological development made it easier to match potential employees with employers we would expect the "natural rate of unemployment" to fall, but it's not clear if or how an oil price change would lead to such an outcome.
