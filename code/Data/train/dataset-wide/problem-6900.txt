In one word: Technology. It's a bit abstract of course, but it summarises a lot of things very well. It's usually the A parameter in the models we have in growth theory (we augment e.g. Labour by Technology). In empirical studies it has been tried to asses productivity by coming up with a measure called TFP (Total Factor Productivity). A lot of specific things could potentially be subsumed under this broad term. Most importantantly it is the stock of knowledge (e.g. books, blueprints,...) that we improve and build upon. The growth of technology usually depends on the actual stock of knowledge in a certain economy. It can be achieved by Research & Development (in case the economy is on the technology frontier) or simply by technology adoption (e.g. in the case of catch-up economies). Example: Knowing how to build a tractor, we only need one unit of labour (the guy who drives the tractor) to harvest, say, 100 kilos of grain per day instead of 50 workers that have to cut the same amount by hand. This would be a tremendous increase in productivity because the other 49 people can now do another job in which they potentially add to the economy's output. For building a better tractor (that drives with less fuel, can harvest more, ...) the economy needs the blueprint of the first tractor to build upon, and so on and so forth... 

The answer is, that this is not possible. A fixed effect by itself is nothing that is measured. It just means that you allow for different intercepts for different individuals. It seems that what you want to do is checking the sensitivity of your specification. Do so by going to the "econometrics kitchen". Run y just on x1 without fixed effects, then with fixed effects. Then y on x2, x3 and so on. Than you will get a feeling for whats going on in the data. 

In his Quantity Theory of Money article M. Friedman uses the following formula for the money multiplier: $$ M = H \times \frac{\frac{D}{R}(1 + \frac{D}{C})}{\frac{D}{R}+\frac{D}{C}} $$ where $M = $ money supply under fractional reserve, $H$ = high-powered money, $D$ = deposits, $R$ = bank reserves, $C$ = currency in the hands of the public. Why did he write the formula in this unusual form? Are there any insights to be seen from it? For me the usual form is the one given for example in Mankiw: $$ M = H \times \frac{C+D}{C + R} = H \times \frac{\frac{C}{D} + 1}{\frac{C}{D} + \frac{R}{D}}$$ 

But Macroeconomics by G.Mankiw (2012) mentions neither this difficulty nor Clower constraint. So has this difficult task been solved and the model that formally explains why money is used in transactions when it is dominated as a store of value has been created? 

The above is obviously a toy model of Supply and Demand. But since nobody will start building a new car having only a toy model of it, I suppose that there must be some empirical research showing how Supply and Demand curves behave in real life and how equilibrium is reached which are used by economists for decision-making etc. Is there any article or probably textbook which contain an example of working model (i.e. an opposite of the toy model) of Supply and Demand? I'd like to grasp the difference between toy and working model of Supply and Demand. 

In Lectures on Macroeconomics by O.Blanchard and S.Fisher (1993) stated that (the emphasize is mine): 

Thus for a production of wage-goods the first postulate can be written as $$ P_w \cdot W_r(N) = P_w \cdot \frac{dQ_w}{dN}(N)$$ or $$ W_r(N) = \frac{dQ_w}{dN}(N)\tag{1}\label{wg}$$ where $Q_w(N)$ is a physical production of wage-goods. For non-wage-goods (or as we call them today investment goods) the equation will be different: $$W_r(N) = \frac{P_{n-w}}{P_{w}}\frac{dQ_{n-w}}{dN}(N)\tag{2}\label{nwg}$$ where $P_{n-w}$ and $P_{w}$ are prices of non-wage-goods and wage-goods respectively. Essentially we can't "pay" employees in non-wage-goods! Now we can comprehend three out of "four possible means of increasing employment:" 

In optimal control theory there is the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation which per se is a PDE. (As usual when it comes to advanced Math in conjecutre with Econ) It's more like a cooking recipy to solve PDE's. The HJB equation is both necessary and sufficient for an optimum. Optimal control is virtually used in all fields of micro (and thus HJB as well). In macro it's usually applied when it comes to micro-foundations. The ramsey(-cass-koopmans) model for instance (I've seen that adressed with HJB equations as well). Another sub-field where PDEs are typically solved is Differential Game Theory (which goes somewhat in a pure math direction but for instance has applications in Industrial Organization). See here for instance for an intro. That's absolutely not my field but one famous guy of whom I know that uses that in IO is Luca Lambertini. 

To understand why some countries are rich and others are not, we need to understand what happened to each of them in the past. How and why they developed depends to a large extent on events that took place decades or even centuries ago. This is what economists broadly refer to as path dependence. Brian Arthur was probably one of the first economists to point that out in the late 1980's. Recently this type of arguing was appreciated again by mainstream economics. There is a growing number of scholarly articles that show how and why some countries developed the way they did. With huge implication for future economic development. Two good summaries are Nunn - The Importance of Economic History for Economic Development and Nunn - Historical Development. So the conclusion would somewhat be like that one can't ignore history if she wants to understand why some countries are poor. And more generally why some things are the way they are (one prominent example was the somewhat random event of why we have a QWERTY keyboard system that is a lot slower than other potential alignments of letters on a keyboard. It was determined once by "luck" let's say, and we never switched back...) So all in all I would argue that knowing (and potentially understanding) some history is essential to understanding how our world works. It's certainly nothing that you can sell as a key feature in your CV (like a specific programming skill), but knowing sufficient history would certainly alter anyone's view of the world. And in order to not repeat huge mistakes that were made in the past (as a "society"), we actually need to know what they were and how and why they came about. 

i.e. the function on the right side of $\eqref{wg}$ shifts up so intersection with the function on the left side of the equation shifts to the right. And finally: 

i.e. $W_r(N)$ in equations $\eqref{wg}$ and $\eqref{nwg}$ is shifts down so intersection with the function on the right side of equations shifts to the right. 

i.e. increase of the ratio $\frac{P_{n-w}}{P_{w}}$ in $\eqref{nwg}$ effectively shift the marginal product of labour for non-wage goods expressed in wage-goods $\frac{P_{n-w}}{P_{w}}\frac{dQ_{n-w}}{dN}$ up so the intersection with $W_r(N)$ will move again to the right. Please note that Keynes aims to refute (some of) the above speculations. 

In his book "Patterns of Speculation: A Study in Observational Econophysics"(2002) Bertrand Roehner makes a bold assertion: 

According to conventional analysis, a key factor in exchange rate determination is the state of the balance of payments. An increase in imports gives rise to an increase in a demand for foreign currency. To obtain the foreign currency importers will sell the domestic currency for it. Obviously, this will lead to the strengthening in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the domestic currency. Conversely, if there is an increase in exports, all other things being equal, then once the exporters exchange their foreign currency earnings for domestic currency this sets in motion a strengthening in the domestic currency exchange rate against the foreign currency. Is there any model which relates the changes in exchange rate with balance of payment quantitatively? 

Was he right? Has the situation changed since 2002? Are there economic journals which are publishing puzzling empirical observations, i.e. those observations which have no clear interpretation within the existing theoretical framework? 

or $$ W(N) = P \cdot \frac{dQ}{dN}(N) $$ where $W(N)$ is a money wage, $N$ is an employment level, $Q(N)$ is a physical productivity of labour at that employment level and $P$ is a price of goods or as we call it today price level. In accordance with the principle of diminishing returns $\frac{dQ}{dN}(N)$ is a decreasing function of an employment level $N$. $W(N)$ is a non-decreasing function for those who agree to work for a smaller wage are hired first. Then the money wage $W(N)$ is equal to $P_w \cdot W_r(N)$, where $P_w$ is a price of wage-goods (or as we call it today consumer or final goods) and $W_r(N)$ is a real wage. Keynes uses it in the second postulate of classical theory: 

ad 2. This phenomenon has been studied a lot. Broadly it is referred to as the demographic transition. A good overview is given by the respective Wikipedia article. In the field of Long-term macro there are several publications. One of the latest top-journal publications is: Cervellati M.; Sunde U., Life Expectancy and Economic Growth: The Role of The Demographic Transition, «JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GROWTH», 2011, 16(2), pp. 99 - 133. Demographic elements can for sure be endogenised into every macro model. But I doubt that it would be very useful for short run DSGE things, since all demographic changes take place with huge time lags. If you want to study those interesting phenomena, you probably have to go more into Long-run Macro / Economic Growth (Unified Growth Theories put emphasis on demographic elements for instance) 

This is a very patchy answer due to the patchy nature of the question. To me it seems that it is being tried to link behavioural economics to the million dollar question of why some countries are rich and others not. First of all let's put forward what behavioural economics actually tries to do: it aims to explain divergences of economic decision making from what standard neo-classical theory would predict. Now to the part of why some countries "lead" and others don't: we still don't know nearly everything concerning that question, but usually two major factors are being put forward: culture & institutions (and very recently there is a strand of literature that tries to make the point that (random) historical events had quite an impact as well - this would correspond to the "luck" point in e.g. Acemoglu's textbook). There is still a debate ongoing whether it was culture or institutions between people like Acemoglu, Rodrik, Sachs, Shleifer... Recently there was one between Joel Mokyr and Deirdre McCloskey on institutions which later was published in the Journal of Institutional Economics. The only thing where behaviour could potentially play in is the culture part. This term is not well-defineable of course, but loosely speaking we mean everything which relates to social- and societal-norms. One important of this cultural component is trust. Trust in government but most importantly mutual trust. The powerful implication for development would be that if people do not trust each other (nor the government), sound businessmaking is rather impossible. When people don't trust each other they don't engage in all kinds of things that usually tend increase a countrys productivity etc... These parameters have been tried to measure through individual surveys like the World Value Survey (WVS). Economists then found empirical evidence later on for the things I described above. Which brings me to the last part: "Theories or analysis?". I think you rather meant to say theory or empirics. Usually those questions are tackled through empirical investigations.
