Let ${\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ be a $n$-variable polynomial ring over a complex number field ${\Bbb C}$. For its maximal ideal $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$, we define the geometric regular local ring as $R \colon= {\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]_{(X_1,\ldots,X_n)}$, which is the localisation of ${\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ at $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. $R$ has the unique maximal ideal $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. We shall consider the polynomial ring $R[X]$ over $R$ and choose $m$ Weierstrass polynomials \begin{align} & f_1(X) = c_{1,0} + c_{1,1}X + \ldots + c_{1,e_1}X^{e_1} \\ & {\phantom{AAA}} ... \\ & f_m(X) = c_{m,0} + c_{m,1}X + \ldots + c_{m,e_{m}}X^{e_m}, \end{align} where $c_{1,0},\ldots,c_{i,j},\ldots,c_{m,e_m} \in (X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. Suppose that ${\mathrm{GCD}}(f_1(X),\ldots,f_m(X)) = 1$. Now for a function $F(X) \in R[X]$, we consider the following condition$\colon$ $(\sharp)$ $\quad F(\alpha) \in (f_1(\alpha),\ldots,f_m(\alpha))\phantom{A}$ for any $\alpha \in {\Bbb C}$, where $(f_1(\alpha),\ldots,f_m(\alpha))$ is the ideal of $R$. Q. Does $F(X) \in (f_1(X),\ldots,f_m(X))$? 

We shall suppose that for any couple $m, n$ with $m > n$, ${\frak a}_m \mapsto {\frak a}_n, f_m \mapsto f_n$, respectively by the natural quotient surjection $A_m \twoheadrightarrow A_n$, i.e., eliminating variables $X_{n+1},...,X_m$ in $A_m$. Now, I should like to pose the following conjecture: Conjecture: Suppose that $m \gg n$ and $k(m) \gg k(n)$. Then the following inequality holds$\colon$ $l(m) > l(n)$. 

I shall only propose an outline of the possible proof below, where Claim 1, Claim 2 and Claim 3 have not yet been proved rigorously. We shall begin the outline. So suppose that every element of $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_e$ contains every parameter of $X_3,\ldots,X_m$ in its presentation of the formal summation. Then, we consider the specialisation defined as follows$\colon$ $$(\lozenge) \quad X_i = S(X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m) \in K[[X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]].$$ Some sort of Bertini argument, i.e. Bertini irreducibility theorem for the hyperplane section, might justify the following Claim 1$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\, 1.}$ After the specialisation, by which I mean simply to insert $(\lozenge)$ into the irreducible polynomial $f$ at ${Q}\,2$ in the above, the specialised polynomial $s(f) \in K[[X_2,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]][X_1]$ remains still irreducible as long as $S(X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m)$ is sufficiently general. Moreover, conditions in the question remains unchanged with only the number of variables dropped by one. Thus we can use the induction on $m$ when $m \geq 4$. That is, the ideal $I_1$ of the ring $K[[X_1,\ldots,X_m]]$ turns into another ideal $K_1$ of the ring $K[[X_1,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]]$ after specialisation. Besides, the number of generators of $K_1$ is bounded by the constant $C$ due to the induction hypothesis. Finally, we propose the following result$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\,2.}$ There exists at least one general specialisation $(\lozenge)$ such that both numbers of generators of ideals $I_1$ and $K_1$ coincide with each other as long as $I_1 \not\supset (X_3,\ldots,X_m)$ (i.e., $I_1$ does not contain every parameter $X_3,\ldots,X_m$). The assumption of $Q\,2$ ensures that actually $I_1 \not\supset (X_3,\ldots,X_m)$ holds, for otherwise $J_1$ might not be monomial. Now, we proceed as follows. Since the number of generators of $K_1$ is bounded by $C$, Claim 2 ensures that the number of generators of $I_1$ is also bounded by $C$ as desired as long as $m \geq 4$. So eventually, the induction argument obliges us only to show the following claim$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\,3.}$ $Q\,1$ is correct. Wishfully, this outline should be justified rigorously at least in the case where every element $\alpha_i$ of $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_e$ contains every $X_3,\ldots,X_m$ in its presentation of the formal summation, i.e. $\alpha_i = \underset{e_2,\ldots,e_m}{\Sigma} c_{e_2\ldots,e_m \in {\Bbb Z}_{\geq 0}}\,X_2^{e_2} \cdots X_m^{e_m}$. 

Let $A \colon= {\Bbb C}[S_1,\ldots,S_n]$ with $1 \leq n < \infty$ $B \colon= A[X_1,\ldots,X_d]$ with $2 \leq d < \infty$. $O \colon= (0,\ldots,0)$ be the origin of ${\mathrm{Spec}}\,B$. Suppose ${\frak P}$ be a prime ideal of $B$ such that ${\frak P} \cap A = 0$. Scheme-theoretically, this is equivalent to the following condition$\colon$ ${\mathrm{Spec}}\,B/{\frak P} \to {\mathrm{Spec}}\,A$ is dominant, i.e. surjective after taking the closure of the image. Let $H$ be a hyperplane of ${\mathrm{Spec}}\,B$ whose defining equation $h$ satisfies the following condition$\colon$ $h = \Sigma_{i=1}^{i=d}a_iX_i\, ;\, a_i \in B, \phantom{i}^{\exists}a_i \not= 0 \,\,{\mathrm{s.t.}}\,\, a_i \in {\Bbb C}$. and define the intersection $D \colon= ({\mathrm{Spec}}\,B/{\frak P}) \cap H$. There is a natural morphism $\phi \colon D \to {\mathrm{Spec}}\,A$. Q. Is it possible to choose $H$ such that the following three conditions are satisfied? (i) $D$ passes through $O$. (ii) $D$ is irreducible. (iii) $\phi$ is dominant. 

I am having a look at the paper Explicit CM-theory for level 2-structures on abelian surfaces by BrÃ¶ker, Gruenewald and Lauter, and there is an argument which I don't understand. The main reason being that the argument is not explicitly written down, but justified by the wild card "it is not hard to check". Here is the situation (lemma 6.5 in the paper). We are given a cyclic, CM-field $K$ of degree 4 (i.e., a cyclic extension $K/\mathbb Q$ of degree 4, such that $K$ is a totally imaginary quadratic extension of a totally real quadratic number field $K_0$). Let $\sigma$ be a generator of $\mathrm{Gal}(K/\mathbb Q)$, and define the map $$m : \mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O_K) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O_K) : [\mathfrak p] \longmapsto [\mathfrak p \mathfrak p^\sigma],$$ for degree 1 prime ideals $\mathfrak p$ (any ideal class can be represented by such a $[\mathfrak p]$). They claim that the image of $m$ contains all the squares of $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O_K)$. This is described as "not hard to check", but I have to admit that I cannot find any simple argument. 

Let $K$ be a finite field, and $\overline{K}$ its algebraic closure. It is well known that two curves are isomorphic over $\overline{K}$ if and only if they have the same $j$-invariant. If two such curves are also $K$-isogenous, I believe we can conclude that they are $K$-isomorphic, but I cannot find any reference or elementary proof of this fact; is it easy to see, or does anyone have a reference? (it seems that this result is implicitly used in the algorithms for isogeny graphs of elliptic curves, like Kohel's, where the isogenous curves are encoded by there $j$-invariant). As a side question, given a $j \in K$, how many curves over $K$ have this $j$-invariant, up to $K$-isomorphisms? For example, a (non-supersingular) curve and its quadratic twist both have the same $j$-invariant, but are not $K$-isogenous, so not $K$-isomorphic, so we have at least two $K$-isomorphism classes; is this it? 

I am interested in the following situation: given a braid $B$, it induces a link $L$ in a pretty straightforward way ("glue" the endpoints, like here). For a braid $B$, we know how to represent it in a normal form, which provides in particular a complete invariant of the braid (two braids have the same normal form if and only if they are equivalent). The computation of a normal form can be done efficiently. But once the link is formed... what can be done? I don't think we know any computable normal form for links... But do we know any good invariant? By "good invariant" I mean: 0) If two links are equivalent, their invariant is the same (definition of an invariant, nothing new here), 1) It can be computed in polynomial time, 2) If two links are not equivalent, they have same invariant with negligible probability (for some notion of "negligible probability"...) 

In Cox's book "Primes of the form $x^2 + ny^2$", he proves that in a quadratic imaginary field $K$, if $\mathcal O$ is an order of conductor $f \in \mathbb Z$, we have that the class group $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O)$ of $\mathcal O$ is isomorphic to the quotient $I_K(f) / P_{K,\mathbb Z}(f)$, where $I_K(f)$ is the free abelian group generated by the prime ideals of $\mathcal O_K$ coprime to $f\mathcal O_K$, and $P_{K,\mathbb Z}(f)$ is the subgroup of principal ideals $\alpha \mathcal O_K$ where $\alpha$ is congruent mod $f\mathcal O_K$ to an integer coprime to $f$ (proposition 7.22). So $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O)$ is a quotient of the ray class group relative to $f\mathcal O_K$. I suspect a more general result, but I cannot find any reference. Let $K$ be a number field, and $\mathcal O$ an order of conductor $\mathfrak f \subset \mathcal O_K$, 

We shall define the infinitely-many-variable formal power series ring $A = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_{\infty}]]$ over a finite field ${\Bbb F}_q$ as the following$\colon$ $A \colon= \underset{n \geq 1}{\varprojlim}\, {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]$. For example, $\Sigma_{n = 1}^{n = \infty} X_n = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots \in A$. The ring $A$ is a non-noetherian local ring with the unique closed maximal ideal. I would like to pose the following theorem on which please let me know the correctness$\colon$ Theorem. $A$ is coherent. Proof. Let us fix a positive integer $l \geq 1$ and for an arbitrarily chosen elements $a_1,\ldots,a_l$ consider the linear equation $(*) \quad a_1Y_1 + \ldots + a_lY_l = 0 \quad (a_1,\ldots,a_l \in A).$ We shall define ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as the set of the whole solutions of $(*)$ in the ring $A$. We shall show the finiteness of the number of generators of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as an $A$-module. We define ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as the image of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m} \colon= A/((X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m,X_{n+1},X_{n+2},\ldots)$. We have simply $A_{n,m} = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]/(X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m$. Lemma. For sufficiently large $n, m$, the $A_{n,m}$-module ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ has generators whose number is less than or equal to $l$. Proof. Obviously, ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ can be viewed as the subset of the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$. But the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$ has its cardinality less than or equal to $|A_{n,m}|^l$. Consequently we have $|{\mathrm M}_{n,m}| \leq |A_{n,m}|^l. $ When we view ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as a $A_{n,m}$-module and set the number of the generators of ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ to be $\delta_{n,m}$, the following inequality holds$\colon$ $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |{\mathrm M}_{n,m}|. $ In short we have $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |A_{n,m}|^l.$ We can see the equality $|(A_{n,m})^{*}| = \frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|$ because $A_{n,m}$ can be divided into $q$ disjoint cosets as $c + {\frak m}$ with $c \in {\Bbb F}_q$ and ${\frak m}$ being the maximal ideal of $A_{n,m}$. Thus we obtain ${\delta_{n,m}} {\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|) \leq l\,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)$. So, we have ${\delta_{n,m}} \leq l \,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)/{\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|)$. When $n,m \to \infty$, we have $|A_{n,m}| \to \infty$, which ensures that the positive integer ${\delta_{n,m}}$ must be less than or equal to $l$ for sufficiently large $n, m$. Q.E.D. Now, by Lemma we can conclude that ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ has the set of generators with its cardinality less than or equal to $l$ as $A$-module because we have the equality ${\mathrm M}_{\infty} = \underset{n,m \geq 1}{\varprojlim} {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$, where all natural transition maps ${\mathrm M}_{n',m'} \to {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ with $n' > n, m' > m$ are surjective. Q.E.D. 

Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be integral schemes of finite type over a field $K$ (i.e., locally affine opens are finitely-generated algebras over $K$). Suppose we have the following condition$\colon$ $f \colon Y \to X$ is finite. We consider a dominant morphism $g \colon Z \to X$. Q. Suppose that ${\cal O}_Y \cap {\cal O}_Z = {\cal O}_X$. Then is it possble that $Y \times_X Z$ is not integral while $Y \times_X \eta_Z$ being integral ? As in the answer below in the case $Y = Z$, there is an example as $Y$ being a normalisation of $X$. 

Let us define $A_n, f_n, {\frak a}_n, k(n), \iota_n, {\frak b}_n$ and $l(n)$ by the followings$\colon$ $A_n \colon= K[[X_1,...,X_n]]$, i.e. a $n$-variable formal power series ring over a field $K$. $f_n \colon= f_n(X_1) = c_n + c_{n-1}X_1 + ... + c_1X_1^{e-1} + X_1^e \in K[[X_2,...,X_{n}]][[X_1]]$. ${\frak a}_n \colon= (f_n, g_1, ... , g_{k(n)-1})$, an ideal of $A_n$. $k(n) \colon= {\mathrm{the ~number~ of~ generators~ of}}\,{\frak a}_n$. $\iota_n \colon K[[X_2,...,X_n]] \to K[[X_2,...,X_n]][[X_1]]/(f_n) = A_n/(f_n)$, a finite ring extension. ${\frak b}_n \colon= \iota_n(K[[X_2,...,X_n]]) \cap \overline{{\frak a}_n} \quad \!\! {\mathrm{in}}\,A_n/(f_n)$. $l(n)\colon= {\mathrm{the~ number~ of~ generators~of}}\,{\frak b}_n$.
