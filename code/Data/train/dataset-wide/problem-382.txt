1 Okay, it's a bit more than that because gravity's involved, so there's going to be some accretion. In particular, gravitational focusing will give an effective cross-section (p. 22) (see also here) of $$A_{eff}=A\left[1+\frac{v_{esc}^2}{v_0^2}\right]$$ where $v_{esc}$ is the scape velocity at the surface of the planet and $v_0$ is the initial relative velocity of the gas and the planet. Let's assume that the planet's escape velocity is the same as that of Earth, $\sim11\text{ km/s}$. The speed of the ejected gas is expected to be $0.1-0.2c$. This means that $v_0\gg v_{esc}$, and so $A_{eff}\approx A$. 

I came up with some basic ideas before posting the question: Space weather Radiation problems can severely damage a spaceship's instruments, making navigation and flight severely dangerous or impossible. Additionally, impacts from micrometeroids/debris can damage the ship, even if protections like Whipple shields are in place. While the spaceliners should be prepared to deal with a minimal level of such problems, and unforeseen impact could mean substantial delays. Additionally, electromagnetic events could cause damage a spaceship's communication systems, which would be imperative for any journey. There's virtually no other way for control centers to track it, or to know the status of the mission. Without communications, the ship is crippled. Fixing the systems could cause a decently long delay. Fuel/oxygen leak Apollo 13 had to be aborted because of the explosion of an oxygen tank. While the astronauts made it home, thanks to some ingenuity on Earth and in the ship, it was an extremely close call. Airplanes do have issues with depressurization, and have crashed because of explosive decompression, but in a long space mission, losing even a tiny bit of fuel or oxygen can be devastating. It's nine months to Mars; a small leak before leaving the space station could kill the crew. If there is a problem with this, there will almost certainly be delays. Delayed Earth-to-station shuttles People have to get to the space stations via small shuttles, which are quite more extensive than airport monorails or taxicabs. If one is delayed or has a problem, approximately ten people could be left on the ground, or could be dead. Spacelines will be very reluctant to let flights go before everyone has boarded in such a case - except in cases of extreme shuttle delays - because space travel is not too cheap, and not exactly regular. If you miss your flight, you could be set back days or weeks, and spending that time on a space station is not fun. At the same time, going back to Earth is expensive. It's since been pointed out that alignment issues could mean that flight windows are narrow. A large amount of flights in a short time could mean that a person could always maybe catch a later flight, and waiting just for the sake of a few passengers could set the others back a long time. It seems that the spaceline might prioritize the rest of the flight. 

The answers so far have assumed that the galaxy in question is a spiral galaxy - and if we're talking about the Milky Way, then that's all well and good. But galaxies are pretty diverse, both in shape, size, mass and composition. Most look nothing like our own. It turns out that if you're willing to set your story in a different galaxy, you can get some pretty interesting effects from the removal of a large black hole. I'll look at the ratios between the mass of a certain black hole in a galaxy/star cluster and the mass of the galaxy itself: $M_{\text{BH}}/M_{\text{galaxy}}$. For reference purposes, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, has a mass of $\sim4\times10^6$ solar masses, while the Milky Way itself has a mass of $\sim1\times10^{12}$ solar masses, giving us $M_{\text{BH}}/M_{\text{galaxy}}\approx0.000004$. That's small; removing Sagittarius A* from the Milky Way won't do squat. Globular clusters and intermediate-mass black holes Globular clusters are dense, gravitationally bound sets of stars, gas and other objects, usually of around . They're usually quite old - in the case of the Milky Way's globular clusters, as old as the galaxy itself. Now, what's interesting for our purposes is that there's not really a firm dividing line between certain globular clusters and dwarf galaxies, which may contain up to $\sim10^8$-$10^9$ solar masses. In fact, a few globular clusters, such as Mayall II and Omega Centauri, may contain intermediate-mass black holes, a putative class of objects with masses of up to $\sim10^6$ solar masses. In the case of Omega Centauri - where the existence of the black hole is disputed - the maximum mass is $\sim10^4$ solar masses. The mass of the globular cluster itself is $\sim4\times10^6$ solar masses, meaning $M_{\text{BH}}/M_{\text{galaxy}}\approx0.0025$. Mayall II gives a ratio that's roughly the same, maybe a bit lower. If the black hole in one of these two globular clusters was removed, it would influence the orbits of the innermost stars. This is perhaps more dramatic than in the case of a normal galaxy, because globular clusters have density distributions strongly peaked towards the center. In other words, yes, many orbits would be disrupted, although I doubt that it would be enough to disrupt the cluster. Remember, the mass ratio is still less than 1%. Massive elliptical galaxies Some supermassive black holes have masses on the order of $\sim10^9$ to $10^{10}$ (1 billion to 10 billion) solar masses, three of four orders of magnitude greater than Sagittarius A*. These black holes yield much better mass ratios than smaller supermassive black holes. One issue, unfortunately, is that some of these ultra-high mass supermassive black holes are found in very massive elliptical galaxies, which can be up to several trillion solar masses in size. Consider NGC 1600. Its central supermassive black hole likely has a mass of $\sim2\times10^{10}$ solar masses, while the galaxy itself has a mass of $\sim10^{12}$ solar masses. That's not bad; we get a mass ratio of $M_{\text{BH}}/M_{\text{galaxy}}\approx0.02$. NGC 4889, a supergiant elliptical, has a central black hole of similar mass; its total mass is $\sim10^{13}$ solar masses, yielding $M_{\text{BH}}/M_{\text{galaxy}}\approx0.002$ - possibly smaller, if non-luminous matter exists there in large quantities. Dwarf galaxies and supermassive black holes Omega Centauri (and certain other high-mass globular clusters) may be the cores of dwarf galaxies, stripped apart by tidal forces from the Milky Way. As I said before, the dividing line doesn't really exist. However, a high-mass dwarf galaxy is certainly different from a low-mass globular cluster. Now, consider a set of dwarf galaxies called ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs). Their masses are on the order of $\sim10^8$ solar masses. One UCD that particularly excites me is M60-UCD1. This galaxy has a mass of $\sim10^8$ solar masses, and might house a supermassive black hole of $\sim2\times10^{7}$ solar masses - five times the mass of Sagittarius A*! This leads to a mass ratio of $\sim0.15$, which is enormous! The orbits of many stars in the galaxy - which is only about 200 light-years across - are quite strongly influenced by the black hole. Removing it would certainly disrupt a number of orbits. I will say that I don't think you can get any better than this. Compared to the Milky Way, M60-UCD1 is an excellent candidate for this sort of setting. It's also extremely dense, and quite massive for an ultra-compact dwarf. The high density means that, just like in a globular cluster, you can probably find plenty of exotic objects inside, from blue stragglers to Thorne-Żytkow objects. 

The effects of two eyes Building one Death-Star-telescope is one thing. Building two - and operating them together, as a cohesive unit - is another. I alluded to some of the challenges before (perhaps it was a mistake for me to use the word "benefits" before), so now I'll got into some more detail. 

As you can tell, there’s a mix of planets in P-type orbits (circumbinary) and S-type orbits (around just one star). The planets in S-type orbits seem to orbit close to the primary. It could be argued that this is an observational artifact; after all, it’s much easier to detect giant planets close to their parent star, using transit and radial velocity methods. I would guess that this plays a role in the lopsided data we have, just as it plays a role in the distribution of all the exoplanets we know of.1 However, there is another factor. Planets in S-type orbits do have a maximum semi-major axis, as first explored by Graziani & Black (1981). This distance is accepted to be about one-fifth of the separation between the stars. Likewise, for planets in P-type orbits, there is a zone of (according to the above page) one third to 3.5 times the separation in which stable orbits are not possible (see e.g. Donnison & Mikulskis (1991)), though Wikipedia cites the more recent Welsh et al. (2013) in extending the innermost stable orbits to 2-4 time the stellar separation. These are some basic ranges; Hypnosifl also suggested Holman & Wiegert (1998), who studied the long-term stability of both S-type and P-type orbits, allowing for non-zero values for the eccentricity $e$ of the orbits of the stars. Thus, their empirical formulae (with coefficients derived using least-squares techniques) may be more accurate than models which assume that $e=0$. I’d highly recommend consulting them if you want to do some basic calculations for your stellar/planetary system. An even better resource might be Jaime et al. (2014). They discuss the applicability of stability to habitable zones, including the continuum between habitable zones around each star to habitable zones around both stars: 

Baumgardt et al. (2004) worked with tidal energy generated in stars orbiting black holes. They found that
