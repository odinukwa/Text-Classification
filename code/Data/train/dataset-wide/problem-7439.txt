Yes. One way to prove this (and the Jordan theorem too) is to use Complex Variables:-) A good reference is Milnor, MR2193309 Dynamics in one complex variable. Third edition. Annals of Mathematics Studies, 160. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 2006. A chapter in this book contans the best exposition of these questions that I know. 

Let $K_0$ and $K_1$ be two bounded, disjoint convex sets in $R^n,n\geq 3$, and $u$ the equibrium potential, that is the harmonic functon in $R^n\backslash\{ K_0\cup K_1\}$ such that $u$ has boundary values $1$ on $K_1\cup K_2$ and $u(\infty)= 0$. Denote $$r_j=r_j(K_0,K_1)= \int_{\partial K_j}\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}ds,\quad j=0,1,$$ where $n$ is the inner normal and $ds$ is the surface area element. 

One outstanding problem goes back to Maxwell: let $u$ be a potential of $m$ positive (or even unit) charges in $R^3$. How many zeros can the gradient of $u$ have? One conjecture is that always finitely many. But suppose we know that. How many? Maxwell said at most $(m-1)^2$. Believe me or not, but this is unproved even for $m=3$. Here is another old problem: is it true that the gravity force created by an infinite discrete set of positive masses in $R^3$ equals to zero at some point? Even in $R^2$ this problem is not completely solved. You may look at $URL$ for discussion of the last two problems. 

Such functions were constructed by I. N. Baker: The Iteration of Entire Transcendental Functions and the Solution of the Functional Equation f{f(z)} =F(z). Math. Ann. 129 (1955), 174-180. $URL$ It is Theorem 2 (iii) of this paper. 

This is a very simple fact which is verified by hands. You just plug a formal power series for $y$, and see that all coefficients can be uniquely determined. (Condition that $y$ belongs to the maxial ideal is just a fancy way to state that the constant term of $y$ is zero, that is "$y(0)=0$"). It is included in many old books on analytic functions and differential equations. For example H. Cartan, Théorie élémentaire des fonctions analytiques d'une ou plusieurs variables complexes. (There is an English, Russian and German translations). G. Valiron, Fonctions analytiques. This is a part of the standard proof of existence of analytic solutions. If in addition the series for $F$ converges, then so does the series for $y$. 

The answer is "no" in a very strong sense to (1), (2). For example $y"+zy=0$ defines Airy functions, and Liouville proved that they cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions or their (indefinite) integrals. (See, for example Kaplanski, Introduction to differential algebra). The rest of the questions are ill-defined. What does it mean "in terms of integrals"? Integrals of what and with respect to what? For example, solutions of the Airy equation (above) can be expressed as Laplace transforms of elementary functions. Is this counted as "in terms of integrals" or not? Even less clear is the last question. What sort of "expressions in terms of $p$, $q$" is allowed? If there is at most one regular singularity, there are power series solutions which converge everywhere. If you do not care about everywhere and want to represent your solution somewhere, then choose a regular point and write a power series at this point "in terms of $p$ and $q$". EDIT. from the edited question I conclude that a convergent series (for example when $0$ is a regular singularity) is considered a summed'' via Borel's summation method. Which means that there is an integral representation (Lalace transform) with some explicit convergent series under the integral. Coefficients of this series can be computed explicitly in terms of coefficients of $p$ and $q$. 

No. $f(x)=x^2$ on the whole real line is not Lipschitz, but the derivative $f'(x)=2x$ is. However, if the function is defined on a bounded interval, then the statement is true. Indeed, if $f'$ is Lipschitz, then it is continuous and thus bounded, and a function with bounded derivative is Lipschitz. 

This algorithm is called the Newton Polygon, and it was really invented and carefuly described by Newton, with examples, see for example, MR1836037 Fischer, Gerd Plane algebraic curves. Translated from the 1994 German original by Leslie Kay. Student Mathematical Library, 15. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2001. or any other book with a similar title, or Mathematical Papers of Newton himself. In XIX century this algorithm was a part of high school curriculum, at least in England, see, for exapmple JFM 31.0103.05 Chrystal, G. Algebra. Elementary textbook. 2. edition. Part II. (English) London. 632 S. Published: 1900 I think, for this reason, those who wrote university algebra textbooks in XX century did not care to include it (Lang, Van der Waerden,...). 

Let $C$ be the Riemann sphere, $p=0$. Then $$\omega(z)=\left(\sum_{-\infty}^\infty c_nz^n\right)dz.$$ Here the part with negative powers converges for $|z|>0$, while the part with positive powers converges in some disk $|z|<r$. Your functions $f$ are meromorphic on $C$, regular except at $0$, so they are of the form $p(1/z)$ where $p$ is a polynomial. Consider for example $f_n=z^{-n}$, $n\geq 0$. Then the condition $\mathrm{res}_0{f_n\omega}=0$ implies $c_n=0$ for all $n\geq-1$. So the Laurent series of $\omega$ has only negative powers, and must converge in $C\backslash 0$. So we see that your $\omega$ is holomorphic on $C\backslash \{ p\}$. (As the highest degree in Laurent series is $-2$, $\omega$ is holomorphic at $\infty$). This proves your statement for the case of the sphere. 

Take one Jordan block with zero eigenvalue. Suppose it is of size mxm. It has zeros everywhere except on the diagonal next to the main, total m-1 ones, so the rank is m-1. Now square this matrix (squaring the whole matrix is equivalent to squaring all its Jordan blocks. The result is the matrix which has zero everywhere, except the ones on the diagonal, SECOND from the main. (That is $a_{i,j}=1$ if and only if $j=i+2$. So there are $m-2$ non-zero rows. Thus the rank of $A^2$ is less than that of $A$. 

M. Berger, Geometrie, vol. V. MR0536874 Edit. Let me sketch a proof for the spherical triangle. Let the sphere have area $4\pi$. First you derive the area of diangle. It is $2\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the angle, by completely elementary reasons. Now consider a triangle. Extend its sides to three full great circles. These three circles make several diangles and two equal triangles (the second one is centrally symmetric to the original one). Make a picture showing how these three circles partition the sphere. As the areas of all diangles are known the area of a triangle is simply derived by the exclusion-inclusion formula! Notice: this proof is truly elementary in the sense that it only uses the existence of the area for a diangle and triangle, its invariance with respect to rotations, and finite additivity. Euclid COULD give a rigorous proof of this. As rigorous as his investigation of areas of Euclidean triangles. 

A more advanced/comprehensive course can be based on Atkinson's book Discrete and continuous boundary problems. No functional analysis is required, neither for Hilbert-Courant nor for Atkinson. (When Courant wrote the first volume of HC, functional analysis did not exist yet:-) Another book which studies some of these questions in depth (and without any functional analysis) is Gantmakher-Krein, Oscillation matrices and kernels. (Gantmaher, Gantmacher...) Is it worth offering such a course? The answer depends on whether you can find enough students who will enroll. This depends on your local conditions. Of course this is a beautiful and useful subject and worth learning. 

The answer is yes. Let me address the last stated form of the question. Functions $F$ with $F^{(n)}\geq 0$ are called totally monotone, and S. Bernstein proved that all such functions are Laplace transforms of positive measures, that is $$F(x)=\int e^{xt}d\mu(t).$$ Your functional equation $F(x+1)=eF(x)$ then implies $$\int e^{xt}(e^td\mu(t))=\int e^{xt}(ed\mu(t)).$$ From this follows $e^td\mu(t)=ed\mu(t)$ by the uniqueness theorem for the Laplace transform. This means that $\mu$ is an atom at the point $1$. This means that $F(x)=ce^x$, and your normalization implies $c=1$. The references for Laplace transform are Widder, Laplace transform, and Feller, An introduction to probability... vol. II. Widder has Bernstein's theorem and uniqueness theorem. 

The answer is yes. Let $X$ be this full preimage, from your condition, for every $x\in X$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ which is mapped on a neighborhood $V$ of $f(x)$. By compactness, there is a covering of $X$ by such neighborhoods, and this implies that $X$ is a compact $1$-dimensional manifold embedded to the sphere. So it is a finite union of disjoint Jordan curves. 

Ergodic theory is about transformations of a space equipped with a measure (and the transformation preserves this measure). The measure is given in advance. The last 3 notions you mention are related to this situation, and express the various degrees of "mixing". Topological dynamics is about continuous transformations of a topological space. The first 3 notions you mention are related to "mixing" in the topological sense. In general, there is no measure given in advance. 

For the equivalence of definitions of quasiconformal maps the reference is J. Heinonen, Lectures on analysis on metric spaces, Springer 2001. Notice that the $K$ in the definiton you cite is not the same $K$ as in the Ahlfors definitions. So your definition of quasiconformality is equivalent to the usual one, but with a different $K$. Another reference is Lehto and Virtanen, Quasiconformal mappings in the plane, Springer 1973. The equivalence of all these definitions is a non-trivial fact. 

If all $m_{i,\lambda}\geq 0$, the answers to all these questions are "yes". The key observation is that $1/(s-\lambda)$ has positive real part when $s$ is in the right half-plane, while $\lambda$ is in the left half-plane. Therefore even if your series converges at ONE point $s$, then $\Re f_j(s)$ is a series with positive terms, from which all your statements immediately follow. Same if all $m_{i,\lambda}\leq 0$. EDIT. In general, without positivity assumption, this is not true. The following example was given by user fedja. For $n\geq 2$, let $p_n$ be rational functions with single (multiple) pole at $-n$, $p_n(z)\to \phi$ uniformly in the right half-plane. Here $\phi$ is an arbitrary bounded analytic function in the half-plane $\Re z>-1$. Such functions $p_n$ are polynomials of $1/(z+n)$ and they exist by Runge's theorem (in fact one does not need Runge's theorem for approximating on a disk). For each $n$, let $Q_n$ be polynomials, partial sums of $e^z$, of sufficiently high degree $d_n$. The degree is such that the zeros of $Q_n\circ p_n$ are all in the disc $|z+n|<1/2$. This is possible because $Q_n(z)\to e^z$ as $d_n\to\infty$ uniformly on compact subsets of the plane, and $e^z$ has no zeros. (Zeros of $Q_n$ tend to $\infty$ but $p_n$ is close to $\infty$ only near the point $-n$.) Consider now the rational functions $g_n=Q_n\circ p_n$. They converge to the function $e^\phi$ uniformly in the right half-plane. Zeros and poles of $g_n$ are in the left half-plane, and they tend to $\infty$ as $n\to\infty$. We take the set of all these zeros and poles as our sequence $\Lambda$. Finally, $$F_n(z):=g_n'(z)/g_n(z)= \sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\frac{m_{\lambda,n}}{z-\lambda},$$ where the sum is finite, and $m_{\lambda,n}$ are integers. This sequence tends to $\phi'$ uniformly in the right half-plane. But $\phi'$ was more or less arbitrary, so you can arrange it to have any singularities in the left half-plane. Now convert the sequence $F_n$ into a series, if you wish. 

Another example is coin tossing and other probabilistic models. Coin tossing was studied long before Brownian motion. Discrete probability precedes continuous probability.

I think this idea is correct in certain sense. If you include preparation to a war. Yes, some individual scientists were killed in action or in some other way as a result of the war. But on the other hand, if you mean by "war" the military competition in general, is not it clear that governments finance science, physics and mathematics first of all, to preserve their ability to develop top military technologies? I witnessed a real boom in mathematics and science education, and in financing research both in Soviet Union and in the USA during the Cold war, and have no doubts about the real reasons of this boom. Especially nuclear bombs and space technology convinced the governments and the public that one has to invest in fundamental science and mathematics. (I don't have to explain that the whole enterprise of space exploration is a byproduct of military technology development during the Cold war, and also Internet, by the way, and computers too). And examples from the earlier epochs in history are also ample and well-known. Governments financed research in Astronomy and Celestial mechanics in 18th century for the needs of navigation, to maintain their colonial empires, Napoleon created the principal French scientific centers, etc. There is no doubt that design of war machines gave jobs to physicists and mathematicians in Hellenistic times (Archimedes, for example). War by itself is bad, of course. For science and for everything else. But preparation to war always was a powerful engine of development of science. EDIT. Why this point of view is widespread among the former Soviet mathematicians. Soviet Union was a much more militarized society than Western countries. This partially explains the strength of Soviet mathematics (and physics). In other sciences Soviet Union was much weaker. So one can say that Soviet math/science education was so good, and here so many jobs for mathematicians because Soviet Union was a militarized society. After the launch of the first satellite (a byproduct of development of ballistic missiles), Americans made huge investment to the exact sciences and science education.
