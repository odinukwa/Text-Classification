While looking at sunspot information in connection with Amateur Radio, I found that the Sun rotates on a period from 27 days to 31 days. Its rotation is differential, at the equator it spins at a rate of about 27 days, while at the poles it's closer to 31 days. Earth's moon also rotates at a rate of 27.3 days. I suspect this is nothing more than coincidence, but was wondering if there is more than a coincidental connection between these two rates of rotation, similar to how tidal locking forces the moon's rotation and orbit around earth to be the same rate. 

Well there are some things to consider. Initially if you could make sure that after you blow up an asteroid you will end up with numerous but small enough pieces so that they will either: one, burn up in the atmosphere or two, be headed away from Earth (and not hitting us five years later) then we are OK, and blowing up the asteroid with a missile would be a fair solution. The problem here lies in the fact that we know little about the internal composition of asteroids in general, and presumably even less about a particular one, so it is very hard to predict exactly where the pieces of the asteroid generated by an impact are or aren't going to end up or, be headed towards or even its size. Another scenario could be that if you effectively smashed the asteroid into small pieces that could then burn into the atmosphere, and if those pieces were coincidentally to end up being consumed by Earth's atmosphere, it would heat up provoking presumably an unpleasant day on Earth of course depending on the mass of the object. But there is a much better solution than that Armageddon-Hollywood inspired one. It is call gravitational tethering. There is something we know, and we know very well about asteroids, and that would be their trajectory paths or orbits. Even when a new asteroid is discovered, its orbit can be computed pretty quick and with great accuracy (because we know the solar system's gravity very well). So if an asteroid is to impact Earth, it is likely that we will know with years, probably decades in advance. And so we can just send a space vehicle (called gravity tractor), with enough mass and time in advance, and place it just beside the asteroid, hence allowing us to tilt its orbit by just a tiny amount, due to the gravitational pull between the two objects. Now when you consider the effect of that tiny amount in the long run, it effectively deflects the path of the given asteroid from that of the Earth so that it won't hit us 20 or 30 years later. And this is something we have control over, and something we can predict with great accuracy. It is the (safe) way to go. If you are still not happy with my answer, you can listen to Neil de Grasse Tyson himself explaining it in this 5 min video.

Fire is actually the rapid oxidation of a combustible material. Smoke is the airborne particulates and gases that result from the combustion, or from pyrolysis. The sun is not undergoing an oxidation reaction, so it's not producing particulates that one might refer to as smoke. The process the sun is undergoing is nuclear fusion, where hydrogen are combined and create helium. This reaction is very energetic and releases heat, visible radiation, and other radiation along a wide swath of the electromagnetic spectrum. The reaction is self-sustaining - as long as there is fuel, the emissions of fusion reactions cause nearby fuel to react as well. No oxygen or oxidizing agent is required. Further, the resulting helium is comparatively heavy, and the sun being a huge mass keeps both the hydrogen that is the fuel and the helium that is the product nearby - they don't leave like hot smoke does from a fire. So there is no smoke as we might consider it - just helium gas (plasma), and even if there were it would simply drop into the sun, there is no such thing as "rising" from it as one might consider smoke does on earth-borne fires. You might find this music video provides further instruction on composition and reaction of the sun. 

This is a low accuracy - yet simple - answer It allows you to calculate only radial alignment configuration of the planets. If you would like an approximation, let's say, you approximate the position of the planets as hands in a clock, you could work the math out by something like this. Assume $\theta_i$ is the initial angle for planet $i$ at time $t_0$ - measured from an arbitrary but fixed position, and $l_i$ is the length of the year - in days - for planet $i$. Then it resumes to solving this system of equations: $$ x \equiv \theta_i \left( \ mod\ l_i\right) $$ From here you would then simply apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Finding the minimum x, will give you the angle that the planet that at $t_0$ had angle $\theta_i = 0$ would have travelled until an alignment configuration was reached. Asuming you choose Earth as the mentioned planet, then divide that angle by a complete revolution ($360^{o}$) and you will get the number of years for that configuration to be reached - from the $t_0$ configuration. The different $\theta_i$ in degrees for all the planets on 01 Jan 2014 - you can use this as your $t_0$: \begin{align} Mercury &\quad 285.55 \\Venus &\quad 94.13 \\Earth &\quad 100.46 \\Mars &\quad 155.60 \\Jupiter &\quad 104.92 \\Saturn &\quad 226.71 \\Uranus &\quad 11.93 \\Neptune &\quad 334.90 \end{align} Source The different $l_i$ in days for all the planets: \begin{align} Mercury &\quad 88 \\Venus &\quad 224.7 \\Earth &\quad 365.26 \\Mars &\quad 687 \\Jupiter &\quad 4332.6 \\Saturn &\quad 10759.2 \\Uranus &\quad 30685.4 \\Neptune &\quad 60189 \end{align} Finally under an integer values aproximation and using this online solver for the system of equations the answer is $x = 4.0384877779832565 \times 10^{26}$ which divided by $360^{o}$ gives you roughly $$1.1218 \times 10^{24} \quad\text{years}$$ Edit 1 Just found this site you may like to play around with. It's an interactive flash application with the accurate position of the planets. I also know that the all the information can be obtained from this NASA page and that is as accurate you can get, but it is just incomprehensible for me now. I will try to revise it later when I find time. Also this book by Jean Meeus called Astronomical Algorithms covers all the fundamental euqations and formulas - it has nothing to do with programming algorithms though. Edit 2 Seeing that you are a programmer, it could be worth for you checking out the NASA site I mentioned above, the data for all the planets can even be accessed via $\tt{telnet}$. Or this Sourceforge site where they have implementations for many of the equations described in the book also mentioned above. 

Assuming that human beings, or life, still exists on Earth at that time, they will have survived so much due to the ongoing death of the sun, that the gravitational pertubations due to the galactic collision will be nothing. Keep in mind that in about 1-2 billion years, the sun will be so hot and large that all the water will have boiled off the earth into space. About 3 billion years from now, the surface of the Earth will be so hot that metals will be melting. Any life that has survived those events and still lives on Earth will surely take a galactic collision in stride. I imagine, though, that most humans will have fled Earth - if not for distant star systems, then at least for planets in our own system that are going to be warming up enough for human habitation. 

Now, in the orbital plane, the radius of the planet orbit is given as $$ r(\nu) = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos(\nu)} $$ If I define the x-axis to align with the ascending node, I can write the position vector as $$ \vec{r}_{orb} = r(\nu) \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega+\nu) \\ \sin(\omega+\nu) \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} $$ To move to a Cartesian coordinate system aligned with the invariable plane I have to apply a rotation of angle $i$ about the x-axis, so $$ \vec{r} = R_x(i)\vec{r}_{orb}= r(\nu) \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega+\nu) \\ \sin(\omega+\nu)\cos(i) \\ \sin(\omega+\nu)\sin(i) \end{bmatrix} $$ So now I have an expression for $r_z$, I just need to know how $\nu$ relates to the planet longitude in the invariable plane, $\lambda_{planet}$. I can find the longitude of the planet relative to $\lambda_{asc}$ as $$ \lambda'_{planet} = \arctan( \frac{r_y}{r_x} ) $$ such that the actual longitude is $$ \lambda_{planet} = \lambda_{asc} + \lambda'_{planet} $$ Inverting this last expression gives $$ \nu(\lambda) = \arctan( \frac{\tan(\lambda - \lambda_{asc})}{\cos(i)} ) - \omega $$ Now I have all the equations to answer the question: If the planet is along the observer's line of sight, then is has a true anomaly of $\nu(\lambda_{obs})$, which gives a height above the plane $$ r_z(\nu) = r(\nu)\sin(\omega+\nu)\sin(i) $$ If $|r_{z}| < R_{sun}$ the planet can be seen in transit. 

As soon as possible. When interstellar voyage becomes possible, we should start sending out ships to colonize other planets and star systems. This will likely take a long time, but if we are to survive more than a billion years, it is necessary. Keep in mind that the Sun and Andromeda are events we can predict. We don't know, and can't predict, the next cataclysmic asteroid strike, which is likely to happen in a shorter time than a billion years. There are lots of reasons to exit the planet, we should be worried about the ones we can't predict or see, not the ones we can predict. 

Dark matter, is just a name for something we know nothing of. It was named to account for an extra gravity source for which there have been indirect observations, but yet we cannot explain. The force of gravity exerted by light is negligibly small yet we have measured the gravitational pull of Dark Matter to be big enough to affect whole galaxies; it is what binds galaxies together. Furthermore, we have included everything we can observe (all ordinary matter including photons) when we do the calculations for the amount of gravity there should be. So light is already there. 'Dark matter' is that extra gravity which we cannot account for. 

Yes, but in small steps. Manned missions to space, to the moon, and living aboard the ISS have provided significantly valuable information that will be used in such interstellar missions. As we continue to push the boundaries of our ability to survive in space we eventually will be able to live in space, perhaps whole lifetimes will be spent in space. As engine technology progresses beyond simply lifting people out of Earth's gravitational well, we will eventually be sending people on long voyages outside our solar system. It's a very, very long way off, but each advance takes us closer to that eventual goal.
