In your situation, if your $f$ satisfies the conditions of this theorem for all $n$, then we deduce that $f$ is an $n$-equivalence for all $n$ and hence that $E$ is weakly contractible because $C$ is contractible. 

Suppose I have a category $\mathbf{C}$ and classes of morphisms $\mathcal{W}$ and $\mathcal{C}$, and I would like to know that $\mathcal{W}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ are the weak equivalences and the cofibrations of a model category structure. I can certainly write down what the fibrations $\mathcal{F}$ would have to be, and I'm wondering if there are any theorems to provide shortcuts in verifying that the classes $\mathcal{W}$, $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ actually satisfy all the conditions of a model category. 

I think isos up to dimension $n$ is enough to deduce $f_*:[A,X]\to[A,Y]$ onto when $dim(A)\leq n$. This gives a right inverse to $f$ which also induces isos up to $n$ and hence has a right inverse. So $f$ has a homotopy inverse. 

An $f$-equivalence is a map $\alpha:X\to Y$ which induces a weak equivalence $\alpha^\ast:map_\ast(Y,Q)\to map_\ast (X,Q)$ for all $f$-local spaces $Q$; equivalently, $L_f(\alpha)$ is a weak equivalence. Therefore the assumption implies that every $g$-local space is $f$-local, so an $f$-equivalence $\alpha$ is also a $g$-equivalence; so $L_g(\alpha)$ is a weak equivalence. 

I don't have a reference, but here is an easier argument, based, like John's, on the homotopy invariance of the homotopy pushout. The invariance implies that you can replace the maps $i: A\to B$ and $j: A\to C$ with homotopic maps and get the same homotopy pushout, up to homotopy type. So assume they are cellular. It is easy to give the inclusions $A\hookrightarrow M_i$ and $A\hookrightarrow M_j$ finite CW structures so that $A$ is a subcomplex of each, and then the union $M_i \cup_A M_j$ inherits a finite CW structure. 

This is how far I can get without checking a book. Since $v_4 = \pm {1\over 2} [i_4, i_4]$, you are interested in the triple Whitehead product $\alpha = {1\over 2}[ [i_4, i_4],i_4]$. Since it is a Whitehead product, its suspension is trivial. The Jacobi identity for Whitehead products shows that $[ [i_4, i_4],i_4]$ has order $3$; so $\alpha$ has order either $3$ or $6$. 

My favorite example---admittedly kind of historical fiction, since I'm not an expert on the history---is Apollonius' On Conics. He proves all sorts of theorems that could be described as interesting only to those with the right mindset things of the form: if you draw this line and then this other line, and connect it to this other thing then it crosses through this other point that you might agree is an interesting point. But two thousand years later, Newton pulled a great many of these things together in his demonstration that the force of gravity being proportional to the inverse square of distance results in orbits that are conic sections, thereby explaining Kepler's laws and giving really compelling evidence for his theory. 

Let $K$ be the rationalization of a simply-connected finite CW complex. Then the Samelson product gives $\pi_*(\Omega K)$ the structure of a graded Lie algebra, and the Hurewicz map $h: \pi_*(\Omega K) \to H_*(\Omega K)$ carries brackets to Pontrjagin commutators (and if $K$ is a suspension, $h$ is universal enveloping). Thus the image of $h$ is a Lie subalgebra of $H_*(\Omega K)$. My questions: 

subrings of $R\subseteq\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Z}/n$, products $R\times \mathbb{Z}/n$ with $R\subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ and every divisor of $n$ invertible in $R$ colimits of these. 

I'm teaching Calc 1 this semester, and I've stumbled onto something that I like very much. First of all, I start (always) by having my students draw bunches of tangent lines to graphs, compute slopes and draw the "slope graphs" (they also do "area graphs", but that's not relevant to this answer). They build up a bit of intuition about slope and slope graphs. Then (after a few days of this) I ask them to give me unambiguous instructions about how to draw a tangent line. They find, of course, that they are stumped. In the past, I went from this to saying "we can't get a tangent line, but maybe we can get an approximately tangent line" and develop the limit formula. This semester, I said, "we have an intuitive notion of tangency; suppose someone offered a definition of tangency -- what properties would it satisfy?" We had a discussion with the following result: tangency at point $x = a$ should satisfy: 

Here is a theorem due (I think) to E. Dror Farjoun (it is Theorem 9.A.11 in his book on homotopy localization). Theorem: Let $f:X\to Y$ be a surjective map of connected pointed simplicial sets. Then the homotopy fiber $F_f$ of $f$ is in the smallest closed class containing $f^{-1}(\sigma)$ for every simplex $\sigma$ in $Y$. A closed class is a class $\mathcal{C}$ of spaces which is closed under weak equivalence and (pointed) homotopy colimit. For pointed spaces use pointed homotopy colimit; for unpointed ones, restrict to homotopy colimits of diagrams whose nerve is contractible. It follows, in particular, if every $f^{-1}(\sigma)$ is weakly contractible, then $f$ will be a weak homotopy equivalence (Corollary 9.B.3.1). 

According to Mac Lane (as I remember it from Categories for the Working Mathematician), Eilenberg and Mac Lane invented categories so they could talk about functors, and they wanted to talk about functors so they could define "natural." 

If $X$ is simply-connected, then the homotopy groups will be countable iff the homology groups are countable; and then one can build $X$ by a homology resolution using Moore spaces for countable groups, resulting in countably many cells. 

One way to do this is to use a very nice theorem of Weingram: if $G$ is finitely generated, then no nontrivial map $\Omega S^{2n+1} \to K(G, 2n)$ can factor through a finite-dimensional CW complex. Now if $X$ is a Lie group and $\pi_2(X) \neq 0$, then we get (using the James construction) a map $\alpha: \Omega S^3 \to X$ nonzero on $\pi_2$, and a cohomology class $u: X\to K(G,2)$ such that $u \circ \alpha \neq 0$. Since $X$ is a Lie group, this contradicts Weingram's theorem. Reference: Weingram, Stephen On the incompressibility of certain maps. Ann. of Math. (2) 93 (1971), 476â€“485. 

My gut reaction is always to work with CW complexes because, being a topologist, I like to work with spaces. Simplicial sets, as nice as they may be, are definitely not spaces. 

In homotopy theory, this happens when you use stable splittings of spaces to analyze homotopy types. For example, (writing $X_+$ for $X$ with a disjoint basepoint), $X_+ \not\simeq X \vee S^0$ (as pointed spaces, generally), but $$ \Sigma ( X_+ ) \simeq \Sigma X \vee S^1 \simeq \Sigma ( X_+ \vee S^0 ). $$ Also $\Sigma (X\wedge Y) \simeq (\Sigma X) \vee Y \simeq X \wedge \Sigma Y$ (since $\Sigma X = S^1 \wedge X$ and $\wedge$ is commutative and associative). From this we get, for example $$ \Sigma ( (X\times Y)_+ ) = \Sigma( X_+ \wedge Y_+) \simeq \Sigma ( (X\vee S^0) \wedge (Y\vee S^0) ) = \Sigma ((( X\vee Y \vee (X \wedge Y))_+). $$ This is a pretty painless way to show the stable splitting of products. Another simple formula that is useful for this kind of argument is the James splitting $$ \Sigma ( \Omega \Sigma X) \simeq \Sigma \textstyle\left( \bigvee_{n\geq 0} X^{\wedge n} \right). $$ This is used by B. Gray, for example, in his nice proof of the Hilton-Milnor theorem. 

I asked a mixed-up version of this question earlier. The Lie algebras I have in mind are the homotopy Lie algebras of wedges of finitely many spheres (in dimensions greater than $1$). Thus each element has a degree and the bracket is the Whitehead product, which satisfies a graded version of the Jacobi identity, etc. The homotopy Lie algebra of a wedge of spheres is free on generators $x_1, \ldots , x_n$ in bijective correspondence with the spheres in the wedge. Inside of any (graded) Lie algebra $L$ we may form the span of the iterated brackets of the $x_i$ with no repeated factors -- call any element in this span "square-free". Note that Jacobi rewrites of square-free brackets are also square-free. A sum of $i$-fold brackets is said to have weight $i$. So let $L = L(x_1, \ldots, x_n, x_{n+1})$ be the free (graded) Lie algebra on the given generators, and let $L_i \subset L$ be the subalgebra $L(x_1, \ldots,\widehat{x_i}, \ldots x_n, x_{n+1})$. For each $i = 1, \ldots , n$, choose a square-free weight $n$ element $w_i \in L_i$, not all of which are zero. Is it true that $$ \mathcal{Z} = \{ [w_i, x_i]\ | \ i = 1, \ldots, n\} $$ is a linearly independent set? I have verified this with MAPLE for $n\leq 4$, and I'd be happy even for an answer for the special case of ordinary Lie algebras. An answer to the general question would be helpful in resolving some questions about the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of rational spaces.
