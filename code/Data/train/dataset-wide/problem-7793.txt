Consider a recollement situation, with notation the same as on the nLab page. That is, we have adjunctions $i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!$ and $j_! \dashv j^* \dashv j_*$ between the abelian categories $\mathsf{A}' \xrightarrow{i_*} \mathsf{A} \xrightarrow{j^*} \mathsf{A}''$ such that 

J. S. Milne's notes on affine group schemes start from the functorial point of view. He has quite a few collections of notes on his website, so I'm sure there's plenty more functorial geometry to be found there. 

Given a vector bundle $E \to M$ with connection $\nabla$, we get a twisted de Rham sequence using the exterior covariant derivative: $$0 \to \mathcal{E} \xrightarrow{d^\nabla} \Omega^1_M \otimes \mathcal{E} \xrightarrow{d^\nabla} \Omega^2_M \otimes \mathcal{E} \xrightarrow{d^\nabla} \cdots$$ Here, I am using $\mathcal{E}$ to denote the sheaf of smooth sections of $E$. We say that the connection $\nabla$ is flat if $(d^\nabla)^2 = 0$, and in this case we get an actual complex. In this situation, the sheaf $$\mathcal{L} := \mathrm{Ker}\left(\mathcal{E} \xrightarrow{d^\nabla} \Omega^1_M \otimes \mathcal{E} \right) $$ of parallel sections is a local system and we can use this de Rham complex (a soft resolution) to compute its sheaf cohomology and cohomology with compact support. But what if the connection is not flat? We obviously no longer have a complex, but the differential operators are sheaf homomorphisms, so we still have a sequence of sheaves, and their kernels and images are not necessarily acyclic. Can we use sheaf cohomology or D-module theory to say anything interesting in this case? 

I am curious if (any of) the various inequivalent constructions of the real line in constructive mathematics can be used to build a model of Kock and Lawvere's synthetic differential geometry? In other words, do any of the constructions of the real line (in say HoTT) satisfy the Kock-Lawvere axiom for a class of functions which deserve to be called smooth? If not, how can we "augment" the real line with nilpotent infinitesimals for this to be true? I am a complete novice when it comes to constructive mathematics, but I'm reasonably comfortable with Anders Kock's synthetic differential geometry texts. Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to read the Models of SDG text yet, so I apologize if this is covered there. 

The sheaf of smooth functions on a manifold is fine and hence soft, so we can extend sections on closed subsets to global sections. However, it is not generally flabby (flasque): local sections on open subsets do not in general extend to global sections. Note that only discrete manifolds can have a flabby sheaf of smooth functions, which is the case because every subset is open and hence closed. Modules over the sheaf of smooth functions are also soft, but not in general flabby (except for the zero module, for trivial reasons). Since the sheaf of vector fields is such a module, we wouldn't usually expect vector fields on open subsets to extend to global sections. For example, if you have any sort of open (proper) subset which is diffeomorphic to an open ball, just take a smooth function that blows up as you go to the boundary of the ball. Then you can rescale any vector field that does not decay to zero at the boundary to a vector field which fails to globalize. H. H. Rugh's example in his answer is also very good because it shows that even without blow ups, a smooth vector field on an open set (which in his case is diffeomorphic to an open disk) can fail to extend globally due to the topology of the sphere. As mentioned by Ben McKay in the comments, you can have a look at Charles Fefferman's paper proving a sharp version of the Whitney extension theorem. It's available here. 

I was reading the paper Towards Constructive Homological Algebra in Type Theory by Thierry Coquand and Arnaud Spiwack, and they state that constructively, the category of abelian groups fails to be abelian, because we cannot verify that every monic and epic map is normal. In particular, they say that given a monic map $u:A \rightarrowtail B$, we cannot prove constructively that it is the kernel of $B \to B/\mathrm{Im}(u)$. I'm new to constructive mathematics, so it isn't obvious to me exactly where the issue is. At what stage do we use excluded middle or some form of choice when proving that monos and epis are normal? Also, could we correct this lack of normality somehow with some additional assumptions on the groups (countably or finitely generated, for example)? 

There is a series of four recorded lectures by Rod Gover introducing conformal geometry and tractor calculus. Tractor bundles are natural bundles equipped with canonical linear connections associated to $(\mathfrak{g}, H)$-modules. Tractor connections play the same role in general Cartan geometries that the Levi-Civita connection plays in Riemannian geometry; for general Cartan geometries the tangent bundle does not have a canonical linear connection. There's also a set of introductory notes on conformal tractor calculus written by Rod Gover and Sean Curry. If you have the book in your library, I would also suggest having a look at Cap & Slovak's Parabolic Geometries text. This is the modern bible on Cartan geometry, and parabolic geometries in particular. It is more terse than Sharpe, but also covers much more. Parabolic geometries are Cartan geometries modelled on $(\mathfrak{g}, P)$ where $\mathfrak{g}$ is semisimple and $P$ is a parabolic subgroup. Parabolic geometries include conformal, projective geometry, CR geometry, and many more geometries of interest. In the parabolic setting representation-theoretic tools are often used to construct invariant differential operators. For instance, there are so-called BGG sequences of operators associated to irreducible representations, which in the flat case compute the same sheaf cohomology groups as the twisted de Rham sequence. 

Here's a somewhat more abstract answer, which hopefully clarifies the "general framework" for induced and coinduced representations. In general, if $R$ is a commutative ring, then representations of a group $G$ on $R$-modules are the same thing as $RG$-modules, where $RG$ is the group $R$-algebra. Thus, if $\phi: H \to G$ is a group homomorphism, then we have an $R$-algebra homomorphism $R\phi: RH \to RG$ and the restricted, induced and coinduced representations are really just special cases of the change of rings operations: restriction, extension, and coextension of scalars. Likewise, representations of a Lie $R$-algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ on $R$-modules are the same as $U\mathfrak{g}$-modules where $U$ is the universal enveloping algebra functor. Again, restricted, induced, and coinduced representations are just special cases of the corresponding operations on ring modules: restriction, extension, and coextension of scalars. However, note that the convention for which is called the "induced" module and which is the "coinduced" module often differ. I usually see the extension of scalars being called the "induced" module when dealing with Lie algebras, whereas for Lie groups this is often called the "coinduced" module. Also, in general the extension and coextension of scalars will differ; there is a theorem of Morita that says that it is sufficient and necessary that a ring homomorphism $f: R \to S$ be Frobenius in order for the extension and coextension along $f$ to be the same (up to unique natural isomorphism). 

D-modules are related to flat connections on vector bundles, end hence local systems. The theory of D-modules (and related notions such as crystals etc.) seems to be very popular in complex analytic geometry, real analytic geometry, and algebraic geometry. However, it seems to me (as an outsider) that the literature on D-modules does not treat the case of smooth manifolds. I have a few related questions: 

Anders Kock mentions Lie monoids and some of their properties in his book on synthetic differential geometry. Basically, in SDG, a Lie monoid is a microlinear monoid object. It is easy to show that the tangent space at the identity of a Lie monoid is an $R$-Lie algebra, defined in the same way as for a Lie group, and isomorphic to the left- or right-invariant vector fields on the monoid (depending on your bracket convention). We also still have a Lie functor, taking Lie monoids to their Lie algebras, and Lie monoid homomorphisms to Lie algebra homomorphisms. For example, for any microlinear space $M$ the mapping space $M^M$ is a Lie monoid, with the composition of maps as the multiplication. Then the Lie algebra of $M^M$ is the space $\frak{X}$$(M)$ of vector fields on $M$. Since each infinitesimal transformation is invertible, it follows that this is also the Lie algebra of $\text{Diff}(M)$. One thing to note is that since we do not have an inversion map on a Lie monoid, then I do not see how would have a canonical isomorphism of Lie algebras between left- and right-invariant vector fields on the monoid. Usually the isomorphism would be given by pushing forward a left- or right-invariant vector field by the inversion map. 

Here's my (partial) reasoning for why I suspect the proposition in the question should be true: I remember reading somewhere (probably in Kashiwara & Schapira, but can't find the result at the moment) that if a sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ is c-soft and flat, then $\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{A}$ is c-soft for any other sheaf $\mathcal{A}$. I assume this should still be true if we replace the words "sheaf" by "chain complex of sheaves", so that both $\mathcal{A}^\bullet$ and $\mathcal{F}^\bullet$ are complexes of sheaves, and $\mathcal{F}^\bullet$ is degree-wise flat and c-soft. Assuming this is true, this should give the result I want, since sheaves of vector spaces are always flat, and so the de Rham complex is degree-wise c-soft and flat. In detail, we have a quasi-isomorphism $\mathbb{R}_M \xrightarrow{\sim} \Omega_M$ by the usual de Rham resolution. Since tensoring sheaves of vector spaces is exact, then for any complex of sheaves of vector spaces $\mathcal{A}^\bullet \in \mathsf{Chain}(\mathbb{R}_M \mathsf{Mod})$ tensoring with $\mathcal{A}^\bullet$ should preserve the quasi-isomorphism, and hence give us a quasi-isomorphism $\mathcal{A}^\bullet \cong \mathcal{A}^\bullet \otimes \mathbb{R}_M \xrightarrow{\sim} \Omega_M^\bullet \otimes \mathcal{A}^\bullet$. Is this reasoning correct? For some motivation about why it would be interesting to know if this is true, in Riehl's Categorical Homotopy Theory text, she shows that given a functorial right deformation $R: \mathsf{M} \to \mathsf{M}$, $r: 1 \overset{\sim}{\Rightarrow} R$ for a functor $F: \mathsf{M} \to \mathsf{N}$ between homotopical categories, we can compute a point-set right derived functor $\mathbb{R}F = F \circ R: \mathsf{M} \to \mathsf{N}$. This point-set derived functor depends on the choice of deformation, but descends to the usual (deformation-independent) total derived functor $\mathbf{R}F: \mathrm{Ho}(\mathsf{M}) \to \mathrm{Ho}(\mathsf{N})$ between the homotopy categories. In my case we would have $\mathsf{M} = \mathsf{Chain}(\mathbb{R}_M \mathsf{Mod})$ and we would want to compute point-set derived functors for $f_!$ and $\Gamma(M,-)$ using the de Rham complex. 

Here is the motivation for this question. Consider the specific recollement situation of sheaves of abelian groups on topological spaces for the inclusions $Z \overset{i}{\hookrightarrow} X \overset{j}\hookleftarrow X \setminus Z$ where $Z$ is a closed subspace of $X$. In this case, we know that the inverse image of sheaves is exact, so in particular $i^*$ is also exact. In this sheaf recollement situation, $j_!$ is usually proved to be left exact using a specific construction of the functor. For example, the exactness of $j_!$ is stated in proposition 5.4.2 of Etale Cohomology Theory by Lei Fu. I am wondering if the exactness of $j_!$ here follows only from "abstract nonsense," the recollement axioms, and exactness of $i^*$, or if we actually need to construct the functor $j_!$ in order to verify its exactness? 

What are your thoughts? Are there any journals that accept this sort of "folklore" publication? Or am I better off just sticking the proof in my current paper or posting the proof on arXiv or nLab? 

Since algebraic geometers (I confess that I know very little algebraic geometry, and my sheaf theory is pretty rudimentary) seem to prefer to work with quasicoherent sheaves and locally free sheaves rather than dealing with vector bundles as spaces, I suspect that these notions of morphisms of sheaves would be commonly used. Anyway, I apologize if this question is a bit vague. I am working in differential geometry, and my motivation for asking this question is that I am trying to correctly write down the correct "sheafified" versions of the definitions of a natural bundle functor and natural differential operator from Natural Operations in Differential Geometry by Kolar, Michor, and Slovak. 

Here's a somewhat abstract but pretty satisfying way to see that integration of compactly supported densities on a not-necessarily orientable and not-necessarily compact $n$-manifold $M$ is unique. This point of view is explained in Remark 3.3.10 in Kashiwara & Schapira's Sheaves on Manifolds. Let $t: M \to 1$ be the terminal map to a point, and recall that the category of sheaves of $\mathbb{R}$-vector spaces on a point is just the familiar category of vector spaces. Recall also that the pushforward with proper supports along the terminal map $t$ is the compactly supported global sections functor; i.e. $$t_!=\Gamma_c(M; -).$$ The counit $\epsilon: Rt_! t^! \Rightarrow 1$ of the Poincare-Verdier duality adjunction $Rt_! \dashv t^!$ is a generalization of integration. Since adjoints, like other universal objects, are unique up to unique isomorphism, it follows that integration is unique in this sense. To see how the counit here generalizes integration, apply it to the real numbers (or complex numbers) and take the $0$th cohomology to recover integration. In a bit more detail, notice that $$H^0 Rt_! t^! \mathbb{R}=H^0 Rt_! \mathrm{or}_M[n] =H^0 R \Gamma_c(M; \mathrm{or}_M[n]) = H^n_c(M; \mathrm{or}_M).$$ So the counit mentioned above induces the integration map in compactly supported sheaf cohomology: $$\int_M: H^n_c(M; \mathrm{or}_M) \to \mathbb{R}.$$ The densities (or $n$-forms if you pick an orientation for an orientable manifold) appear when you take the usual de Rham resolution of the orientation sheaf $\mathrm{or}_M$, thus using de Rham cohomology to compute sheaf cohomology. For $p: E \to M$ a topological submersion, we can use Poincare-Verdier duality, the relative orientation sheaf $\mathrm{or}_{E/M}$, and a somewhat similar approach to define fibre integration of "relative" densities.
