First off it seems to me you are proceeding in a manner more complicated than necessary. (Perhaps this is intentional because you wish to face a harder exercise.) Since it is given that $v(x)$ represents $\succsim$ you only have to show $$ \forall x,x' \in X: v(x') \geq v(x) \iff u(x') \geq u(x). $$ I think this would be a lot simpler than what you are currently doing. On to your question: The function $u(x)$ is very well defined, as $$ u(y,x_{L}) = x_{L} + \phi(y) = x_{L} - x_L(y) $$ and we know that $v(y,x_L(y)) = 0$ describes the indifference curves of $\succsim$. The conditions you describe would violate this assumption because from $$ (y,x_{L}) \precsim (y',x_{L}') $$ it follows that $$ v(y,x_{L}) \leq v(y',x_{L}'). $$ We can assume $v(y,x_{L}) = 0$, this is an affine transformation of any $v(y,x_{L})$. So $x_L(y) = x_{L}$. (I am not crazy about the notation, feel free to edit my post as long as it remains consistent with the question.) 

The answer is in the the first line and title of the articles. Not all debt is government debt. One calculation also includes household and corporate debt. 

A usual refinement concept used to deal with weakly dominated strategies is the trembling hand perfect equilibrium. (I do not know others but this one works quite well. The strategy in question is indeed weakly dominated by the following strategy 

The question is not subjective if you accept the assumption that similar products are likely to be substitutes, i.e. if you wanted chocolate ice cream but none was available you are more likely to get vanilla ice cream than pork chops. The trick is that the groups can be ordered from smaller to larger, e.g. all ice creams are frozen desserts but not all frozen desserts are ice creams. If the price of a whole product group increases it is more difficult to find a cheap substitute than if only one product's price had increased. In this case all other products in the product group would be available as substitutes at their original prices. Using this assumption you should be able to finish the assignment. 

Rearranging the steady state equation $$ \overline{p}^{\alpha}=\alpha y\overline{p}^{\alpha-1}- \alpha\overline{p}^{\alpha}-\frac{a+1}{\sigma} $$ we get $$ (1 + \alpha)\overline{p}^{\alpha}=\alpha y\overline{p}^{\alpha-1}- \frac{a+1}{\sigma}. $$ As $\alpha \in [0,1]$, the left hand side of the equation is increasing in $\overline{p}$ and the right hand side is decreasing. At least one of these is strictly monotonic because $\alpha$ cannot be $0$ and $1$ at the same time. Hence at most one solution is possible. 

The solution concept used in Ricardo's modell is the competitive equilibrium. Let the set of countries $N$ be defined as $N = \left\{E,P\right\}.$ (England, Portugal) Then the competitive equilibrium is a vector $$ \left(p,\left(q_{x,i},q_{y,i}\right)_{i\in N},\left(c_{x,i},c_{y,i}\right)_{i\in N}\right), $$ where $p$ is the equilibrium price ratio of the goods $x$ and $y$, so $p = \frac{p_x}{p_y}$, and $\left(q_{x,i},q_{y,i}\right)$ and $\left(c_{x,i},c_{y,i}\right)$ are the production and consumption vectors of country $i$. The equilibrium vector has the following properties: 

My recommendation is not to submit a research proposal that contains methodologies you do not understand. Even if someone gave you the "dumbed-down detail", the devil is in the small details. There is risk you may misinterpret the results or accidentally engage in p-hacking, both of which would be harmful. 

The first statement does not seem to be true. The UPF exists in the space of utilities whereas the other curves (production, indifference) exist in the product space. As a result, the slope of the UPF may change if a monoton transformation is applied to one of the utility functions whereas the other curves and their slope will definitely not change. 

You are treating the absolute value wrong. You seem to have done it right the first time around, do it like that again. (Make a little drawing, think about which side of 10 and 50 the indifferent $X_i$ will be on, etc.) Another thing: The demand function you derived for $Q_1$ only holds for certain ranges of $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$, because if the prices of firms 1 and 2 are very high but $P_3$ is low, a customer indiffirent between firms 1 and 2 would go to firm 3. 

The dollar value of a Big Mac at the official Venezuelan exchange rate is less than \$7.15. (If my deeming it non-essential is correct it would be around \$2.50.) 

Displaying players' decision points, available actions and payoffs. Is there any way I can do this in R or a similar high level programming language? To be precise: I do not want to plot geometric equations, I want to define a structure (players, points, connections, payoffs) and have the program plot it. I am currently browsing the 'igraph' package but I am having some difficulty labeling so I am wondering if there is a better way. 

There is significant debate about whether such x exists. For example Louis XIV had things in his estate that are not in mine (I do not have two palaces). But there are also things in my estate that were not in his. I have access to 21st century healthcare, dental care, the internet, I can flush after going to the toilet...whose lifestyle is 'worth' more? The comparison gets more difficult the farther you go back. So hunter gatherers, with tribal ownership, without any currency and frequently without any sort of industry are probably uncomparable to modern humans via any 'wealth' based standard. 

To continue your example: Resources (including labor) cost $x$, product sells for 4$x$. The fat cat business owner makes 3$x$. What does he do with it? If he spends it, for example plays golf or gets his hair done then the people providing those services get the money. Thus there need not be debt, the hairdresser can use these earnings to buy the product the fat cat's business was selling. The usual water analogy is of a circulatory system: water (money) flows from one vessel to the other. 

I attached three figures. Figure 1 shows the labor market without the tax. You can see the surplus that the firms and workers receive. They enjoy a surplus because some labor would be hired at even higher wages and some labor would be willing to work at lower wages. The sum of these surpluses gives the 'welfare' of the actors in the labor market. In figure 2 the government introduces a tax on labor. Whether this is collected from firms or workers does not matter as long as there is full information and all actors are rational. As you can see the surpluses are reduced. Even if you add together the surpluses and the tax collected by the government you do not get the welfare you had in the situation without tax. This is because the equilibrium amount of labor has decreased due to the tax. The welfare loss this creates is called the deadweight loss. This shows that these kind of taxes introduce some inefficiency. However that does not mean that all are worse off. If the government gives all the money to the secretary of Treasury he will be very happy. Similarly, if the government transfers all the tax to the workers (long live the proletariat) their total surplus may be bigger than in the situation without taxes. To see this, compare the area of the green polygons in figure 1 and figure 3. If the deadweight loss is too large this may not be possible. What you could say is that you cannot compensate both firms and workers at the same time, as welfare is lost. 

My understanding is that we do not answer homework problems here. (I might be wrong.) However you did lay out some ideas and I will give you feedback on those: 1) There is no guarantuee that the NE will remain the same if you extend the strategy space. You have to check again by looking for the arg max of the payoff function given the strategy profile you suspect to be a NE. 2) In a game theory context Pareto optimality means that there is no other outcome of the game where someone is better off and no one is worse off. Usually highly asymmetric payoffs are Pareto-optimal because someone is very happy, so you should check some asymmetric strategies. 3) The NE actually does not need enforcement. It is what players will play anyway. My guess is that your question was: How much do you need to tax cow placement to enforce the Pareto-optimal outcome as a NE of the taxed game? Hope these will help YOU finish the problem. 

I don't see why equilibrium $MPL(\ell)$ would be fixed. I think Robinson's income is measured by what he can get using his total time $t = l + \ell$. Assume that given the original $A$ and total time $t$ his optimal choice was $(c_1,l_1)$. If the technology improves to $A'>A$ he can reach $(c_1,l_1)$ (or $U(c_1,l_1)$ if you take the Hicksian approach) by only using total time $t' < t$. Let us denote the optimal consumption bundle given technology $A'$ and time $t'$ by $(c_2,l_2)$. This is the intermediate step separating the income and substitution effects. The difference between $l_2$ and $l_1$ would be the substition effect. The 'income' in the two situations is considered equal as $(c_1,l_1)$ (or $U(c_1,l_1)$ if you take the Hicksian approach) is barely feasible in both cases. Any difference in leisure consumption is due to the different transformation rate between leisure and consumption. Let us denote the optimal consumption bundle given technology $A'$ and time $t$ by $(c_3,l_3)$. The difference between $l_3$ and $l_2$ is the income effect. The technology is identical in both cases, so any difference in consumption is due to the difference in 'income'. Perhaps your instructors are trying to say something about the backward bending labor supply curve. It is difficult to tell from the available information. 

The answer to your first question is no. For example in Saudi Arabia only foreign residents are taxed. The state can afford to do this because it owns the oil fields and receives a lot revenue from them. In Russia the oil and gas companies gave 52% of the federal budget. Part of this is in the form of taxes, but it is mostly the profit of Gazprom, the state owned gas company. The Russian government also collects personal income taxes as well as other kinds, so taxes are also a source of their budget. 

How about multiplying the average UK household income with the number of households? Both of these should be available from government statistics. 

To gain an exact understanding of the key claim in the WP article we have to understand both the Lorenz Curve and the Kakwani index. The Lorenz Curve has a pretty good Wikipedia page, I recommend browsing it. The Kakwani index is chiefly used to calculate payments for health services. 

In Lemma 1 they say that the support $\left[\underline{p}_t, \bar{p}_t \right]$ is such that $ c < \underline{p}_t $. So even though the support is connected, it does not extend to $c$, hence the $p \to c$ problem never arises. 

You seem to be describing notion of Slutsky compensation where the consumer receives monetary compensation after the price change so that she can purchase the bundle she would have purchased without the price change. The existence of such a compensation however is not a necessity. If prices rose my salary would still not change (at least for a while), and I would still have a demand function with the new prices and my original salary as inputs.
