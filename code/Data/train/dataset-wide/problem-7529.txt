If you are willing to assume that: 1) $A$ has a dualizing complex $R$. 2) $A\otimes_k A$ is noetherian of finite Krull dimension. Then the answer is yes: One can show that under these conditions, $R\otimes_k R$ is a dualizing complex over $A\otimes_k A$. Now, a finitely generated module $M\otimes_k M$ has finite injective dimension if and only if its dual $RHom_{A\otimes_k A}(M\otimes_k M, R\otimes_k R) \cong RHom_A(M,R)\otimes_k RHom_A(M,R)$ has finite projective dimension, and this is easy to verify. 

Let $A \to B$ be a finitely generated homomorphism between two commutative noetherian rings. As far as I understand, in various generalizations of this situation, such a map is called smooth if $B$ is a perfect object in $D(B\otimes_A B)$. (See for example Definition 2.2 of $URL$ Is this true for commutative noetherian rings? That is, is a finite type map $A\to B$ is smooth if and only if $B$ has a finite projective dimension over $B\otimes_A B$? Note that one direction (that smoothness implies finite projective dimension) is true because of EGA IV Proposition 17.12.4 which says that the kernel of $B\otimes_A B\to B$ is locally generated by a regular sequence. But does the converse holds? Edit: the answer below shows that surjections, for example, are a counterexample. What if in addition we assume flatness of the map $A\to B$, so that $B\otimes^L_A B \cong B\otimes_A B$? 

I know that this was answered at the comments, but I want to emphasize that actually, the completion functor is not exact from either side, not from the left and not from the right. The only thing that is true (over noetherian or non-noetherian rings) is that completion preserves surjection: Let $k$ be a field, $A=k[[t]]$, $I=(t)$. In $URL$ example 3.20, there is an example of a short exact sequence of $A$-modules $0 \to P \to Q \to M \to 0$, such that after completion, the resulting sequence $0 \to \hat{P} \to \hat{Q} \to \hat{M} \to 0$ is not even exact at $\hat{Q}$. Thus, completion is no even exact at the middle! As for tensoring with the completion ring, this is of course a question of flatness. It is know clasically that if $A$ is noetherian then the completion map is flat. More generally, the completion map does not have to be flat. If $A$ is a ring which is not coherent, then taking $B=A[x]$ and $I=(x)$ will give you an example of a ring with non-flat completion. Note however that in this case, not only your ring is non-noetherian, but also its completion is non-noetherian. It is an open question to me if there is a ring with noetherian completion such that the completion map is not flat. 

Lindstrom's theorem states that any extension of FOL more expressible than FOL fails to have either compactness or Lowenheim-Skolem. When I first read Lindstrom's theorem my first reaction was: "Does it mean incompleteness of any more expressible extension of FOL? And why this obviously important question isn't discussed in standard logic texts?" Standard extensions (such as second order logic) in fact are incomplete. After some attempts of proving incompleteness I found reference to Vaught's paper in which he proves completeness of extension of FOL by adding quantifier Qx = "there are uncountably many x such that..." It would be very interesting (at least for me) to understand complete extensions in general. Such an extensions may be of great importance, for instance, for computer science, because FOL isn't enough expressive for its purposes. So, my questions are: 1) Do you know some other examples of complete FOL extensions? 2) Are there some results concerning characterization of complete FOL extensions? 2) Do you know any peoples, papers, books... studying general properties of FOL extensions? Thanks in advance. 

Hi! Let G(N) be the number of graphs with vertices {1, 2, ..., N} and GN(F) be the number of those of them which satisfy graph property F. There is a beautiful result by Glebskii and Fagin that limit of GN(F)/G(N) can be only 0 or 1 for any first order graph property F. The proof essentialy uses compactness and Vaught's test. So, any first order property is either infinitely likely or infinitely unlikely for large graphs. Moreover, there is an algorithm which, given any first order graph property F as input, decides which of this possibilities holds for F (infinitely likely properties can be axiomatized by complete recursive first order theory). Questions. What about second order properties? More specificaly, what possibilities can be for probability of second order graph properties? Can we construct for any x from [0, 1] SO property with limit probability exactly x? What is the limit probability for connectedness of graph? Thanks for any answers and comments. 

In the case of the "position" operator: $$ D(A) = (\{ f \in H, \int x^2 f(x)^2 dx < \infty \}) $$ $$ (Af)(x) = x f(x) $$ The spectrum is well known and only continuous: $\sigma(A) = \mathbb{R}$. It is obvious that the operator is already diagonal, and that matter is reflected by the fact that the "generalized eigenfunctions" are Dirac distributions: $$ (A \delta_\lambda)(x) = x \delta_\lambda(x) = \lambda \delta_\lambda(x)$$ $$ \forall f \in H, Af = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \lambda f(\lambda) \delta_\lambda(.) $$ In the case of $A = -\Delta$: $$ D(A) = (\{ f \in H, \int f''(x)^2 dx < \infty \}) $$ The spectrum is well known and only continuous: $\sigma(A) = \mathbb{R}^+$. The operator is diagonalized using the Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}$, and that matter is reflected by the fact that the "generalized eigenfunctions" are complex unitary characters $e^{i\sqrt{\lambda}x}$ and $e^{-i\sqrt{\lambda}x}$. The spectral theorem takes a simple shape thanks to the Fourier transform. Indeed: $$ \forall f \in H, \mathcal{F}(Af)(k) = k^2 \mathcal{F}(f)(k) $$ Then: $$ \forall f \in H, (Af)(x) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} k^2 e^{-i k x} \mathcal{F}(f)(k) dk = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}^+} \lambda ( e^{-i \sqrt{\lambda} x}\mathcal{F}(f)(\sqrt{\lambda}) - e^{i \sqrt{\lambda} x}\mathcal{F}(f)(-\sqrt{\lambda}) ) d\lambda$$ This last way of writing the operator 'diagonalization' shows that the spectral measure is a superposition of the two types of 'waves' (positively propagating $e^{i\sqrt{\lambda}x}$ and negatively propagating $e^{-i\sqrt{\lambda}x}$) with a weight given by the Fourier transform of f, whatever that really means. In those two cases, we see that those "generalized eigenfunctions" (Diracs and unitary complex characters) combine in a special way in order to produce the spectral measure. I read somewhere a sentence that left me puzzled: . I think i read that in "Quantum physics for mathematicians" by L. Takhtajan. Now i get the feeling that fully diagonalizing a self-adjoint operator can be a very hard task. Can you also provide me for other references than those i used to far? In the end, my question could be formulated as the following, even if i am not satisfied with it, as it is still too vague: Suppose that by some mean, i know all or some "generalized eigenfunctions". Then can i express the spectral measure in terms of those eigenfunctions? If so, how? Side questions: 

Assume $R$ is a noetherian ring (not necessarily local). As mentioned in the comments, there is a short exact sequence: $ 0 \to a^n/b^n \to R/b^n \to R/a^n \to 0$ Let $R \to I$ be an injective resolution. Then we get an exact sequence of complexes $0 \to Hom_R(R/a^n,I) \to Hom_R(R/b^n,I) \to Hom_R(a^n/b^n,I) \to 0$. Passing to the limit, and remembering that taking direct limits is an exact operation, we get an exact sequence $0 \to \varinjlim Hom_R(R/a^n,I) \to \varinjlim Hom_R(R/b^n,I) \to \varinjlim Hom_R(a^n/b^n,I) \to 0$. Now, the leftmost complex is quasi-isomorphic to $R\Gamma_a I = R\Gamma_a R = K^\infty(a)$. Similarly, the middle complex is quasi-isomorphic to $K^{\infty}(b)$. Thus, we get an exact sequence of complexes $0 \to K^\infty(a) \to K^\infty(b) \to \varinjlim Hom_R(a^n/b^n,I) \to 0$. Now, if $a$ is generated by $n$ elements, then $K^{\infty}(a)$ lives in degrees $0$ to $n$. Thus, I believe that the question of your $Ext$ being non-zero depends on the minimal number of generators of $a$ and $b$. 

The answer is no. Let $k$ be a field. Let $A=k[x]/x^2$, and let $B=k$. $A$ is Artinian, so it is Cohen Macaulay. $B$ is clearly Cohen Macaulay. But the only non-trivial ideal in $A$ is $(x)$ which is not generated by a regular sequence, because every element of it is a zero-divisor. 

It is well known that the function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ has no elementary anti-derivative. The proof I know goes as follows: Let $F = \mathbb{C}(X)$. Let $F \subseteq E$ be the Picard-Vessiot extension for a suitable homogeneous differential equation for which $f$ is a solution. Then one may calculate $G(E/F)$ and show it is connected and not abelian. On the other hand, a calculation shows that if $K$ is a differential field extension of $F$ generated by elementary functions then the connected component of $G(K/F)$ is abelian, so it is impossible for an anti-derivative of $f$ to be contained in such a field $K$. However, in classical Galois theory we can do much better, there, we know that a polynomial equation is solvable by radicals if and only if the corresponding Galois group is solvable. So to my question - is an analog of this is available in differential Galois theory? Is there a general method to determine by properties of $G(F/E)$ if $F$ is contained in a field of elementary functions? 

I don't understand what people usually mean when they say "aspects of some mathematical field related to computer science" (how they know what is really related to CS?), but if you really want to study or teach first order logic, then, in my opinion, there is old but still the best book for that -- Joseph Shoenfield's Mathematical logic. 

See David Marker's "Model theory. An introduction." Although argument is model theoretic, you can easily transform it into syntactic one. 

[Edition. In this answer I wrote about "philosophical logic" and "mathematical logic" in usual sense of these terms. But I also think that the difference between them is very conventional. For example, people studying knowledge formally by means of modal epistemic logics (as formal models) and those who studying provability logics to a large extent (if one forgets about actual motivations) are doing the same things -- they are investigating various modal logics.] "My question is about relations between logic as part of philosophy and mathematical logic from the second half of the 20th century when its seems that connections between these two areas have weakened." "I am quite curious also about the reasons for the much weaker connections between mathematical logic and formal models developed by philosophers at the later part of the 20th century." The main reason is that mathematical logic concerns with models of mathematical thought, but philosophical logic builds models for various parts of philosophy which are very different from mathematics (i. e. they may use modalities, analogy, induction and so on). To give one example of "formal models developed in philosophy that had become important in mathematical logic", Provability logic is such an example. To quote from Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy: "Provability logic is a modal logic that is used to investigate what arithmetical theories can express in a restricted language about their provability predicates." So, provability logics are modal logics which capture provability in formal systems of mathematical logic. Provability logic is regarded as an area of mathematical logic (which represented by Robert M. Solovay, George Boolos, Sergei Artemov, Lev Beklemishev, Giorgi Japaridze, Dick de Jongh and so on) and it uses models, ideas and techniques from modal logic which is (in any case, was) part of philosophical logic. "Another thing I am curious about is to what extent for the applications to computer science formal models described by philosophers turned out to be useful." Again, the original papers by Kripke was by no means concerned with computer science. Kripke discovered another way of interpreting the modalities and the context was philosophical one. But today the whole field of program verification in CS is based on modal logic. A lot of specific modal logics are developed in CS which model specific aspects (temporal logics, dynamic logics and so on). Crucial results about them such as expresiveness, decidability and completeness are proved using essentialy the same ideas as those from original papers in philosophical context. Finally, to speak "about works in philosophical logic that were motivated or influenced by developments in mathematical logic", I quote from what I said in the meta thread: "A new interesting field in philosophy is growing in this century often called Formal Philosophy (this term I believe has its origin from the title of Richard Montague's collected papers book). People of this field (among them R. Montague, H. Putnam, E. Zalta, D. Bonnay...) are trying to solve philosophical problems using formal logic. Particularly, and this is important, many of them try to formalize such kinds of reasoning as modality, induction, analogy, simplicity, naturality, generalization and so on as well as concrete philosophical theories (which are of course in the domain of philosophical logic) using formalisms and methods of mathematical logic.
