The stirling number of the second kind $S(n,k)$ counts the number of partitions of the set $[n]$ into $k$ non-empty parts. I found a definition for the numbers called the $r$-associated stirling numbers of the second kind in wikipedia. These count the number of partitions of $[n]$ into $k$ non-empty parts such that all of the parts have at least $r$ elements. They seem to be "not too hard to calculate" via the recursion: $S_r(n+1,k)=kS_r(n,k)+\binom{n}{r-1}S_r(n-r+1,k-1)$. I am interested in a very similar construction, for which I have been unable to find any references. I would like to count $F_r(n,k)$ defined as the number of partitions of $[n]$ into $k$ non-empty parts so that each of them has size $r$ or less. Most of all I am interested in $\sum\limits_{k=0}^nF_r(n,k)$, basically the number of partitions of $[n]$ into parts of size $r$ or less. Thank you very much in advance Regards. 

Good evening, I am currently taking a class which has combinatorial designs as the first topic, we are using Peter Cameron's book Designs, Graphs, Codes and their Links which I am finding extremely interesting. I am really interested in a rigorous study of combinatorial designs without their links now.Of course I plan to continue taking the class, but I would really like to read a textbook just on designs (I am especially interested in realizable designs (like the social golfer and Kirkman girl problem)). Thank you very much in advance. Regards. 

Does anyone know an answer to this question? Question: In an cyclotomic field which algebraic integers have integer absolute value? Revision 1: -1 I like to add this to the above question, Let's take w to be a primitive n-th root of unity, for which set of exponents A of {0,1,...n-1} we have the absolute value of the sum_{i \in A} w^i is an integer. this might not be any help to make it solvable but at least avoid some repetitions 

If I have k algebraic integers like a_1, ..., a_k such that the sum of their n-power are integer for n=1, ...m can we deduce that a_1, ..., a_k are integers? how large m should be? (how many power sum should be integers to deduce all a_i's are integers) 

If G is a group and A and B to non-empty subsets of G, then by AB we mean the set consist of all product ab where a is in A and b is in B.(Standard definition) Similarly we can define X^m where X is a non-empty subset and m is a positive integer. So X^m for positive integer m, means the set of all products of length m taken from X. If G is a group of size n, and X is a non-empty subset of G then prove that X^n is a subgroup of G. this is quite easy to prove for abelian groups, so I mostly like to see a short nice proof for the general case. 

Let $X,Y$ be a bipartite graph and $X',Y'$ be two subsets of the vertices. Is there a Hall type theorem for the existence of matchings saturating both subsets simmultaneously? Clearly necessary conditions are for a saturating matching to exist in $X'\cup Y$ and $X\cup Y '$ but I don't know if this is sufficient. 

I think the following works: Looking at the book enumeration of finite groups, We obtain that the number of groups of order $p^k$ is at least: $$\frac{p^{\frac{2m^3}{27}}}{p^{\frac{2}{3}m^2}}$$ We also obtain that the number of groups of order $n$ is: $$n^{\frac{2\mu^2}{27}}n^{\mathcal O(\mu^{3/2})}$$ where $\mu$ is the largest exponent for a prime power dividing $N$. So take a natural $N$, and suppose that $2^m$ is the largest power of $2$ not exceeding $N$, we obtain that the number of groups of order $2^m$ is at least: $$\frac{2^{\frac{2m^3}{27}}}{2^{\frac{2}{3}m^2}}=\frac{(2^m)^{\frac{2}{27}m^2}}{(2^m)^{\frac{2}{3}m}}\geq\frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^{\frac{2}{3}m}2^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}\geq \frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^m}$$ On the other hand, if $n$ is an odd integer less than $N$, clearly its $\mu$ is at most $m\log_3(2)+1$. For large values of $m$ we can just bound this by $\alpha m$, for some pre-selected $\alpha<1$. So the number of groups of odd order is : $$N(N^{\frac{2\alpha^2 m^2}{27}}N^{\mathcal O(m^{3/2})})$$. So the fraction between the number of groups of order $2^m$ and the number of groups of odd order less than $N$ for large $N$ is at least: $$\frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^mN(N^{\frac{2\alpha m^2}{27}}N^{\mathcal O(m^{3/2})})}=N^{\frac{2(1-\alpha^2)m^2}{27}-\mathcal O(m^{3/2})}$$ Which clearly goes to infinity. 

Now if you treat x, y, and z as constants and consider only the variables a, b, and c, then you will end up with 3*5*7 polynomial equations in the 3*5*7 monomials 

In other words, if you consider each monomial as a variable, then you can write these in matrix form as 

But the determinant is a polynomial function in the entries of your matrix, which means that the determinant of A is a polynomial in x, y, and z. --- end example --- I have tested this method with several examples and it seems to work, at least in the sense that the roots of the radical equation are roots of the resulting polynomial (it seems however that the resulting polynomial may have real roots that are not roots of the original radical equation). The only method I knew about in order to get rid of radical expressions in equations was to carefully manipulate the equation and then raise both sides of the equation to the same power. This is to say I have a very basic math background. So finally, my question is: what is the name of this technique and where can I read more about it, or at least what are the keywords I can use to search google. I have many other questions regarding this technique, but I believe I good book on the subject would answer them. Just for completion, some of the questions are: 

If Z is a sum of t distinct roots of unity and |Z| is a rational integer, can someone find a bound on |Z| in terms of k=deg(Q(Z):Q))? Clearly we need to have distinct roots of unity otherwise this won't work! Correction: Let assume that Z is not rational itself otherwise obviously it's wrong. Here I hope to extend the proof of Kronecker thm! I have "Z is a sum of t distinct roots of unity and |Z| is a rational integer" I conjecture that either Z is rational or a root of unity! 

Suppose $D={\rm diag}(d_i)$ is a diagonal matrix with all diagonal entries $d_i=\pm 1$. This implies $D^2=I$. Suppose $A$ is a non-singular Hermitian matrix. If we know that $A+A^{-1}+D$ has rational eigenvalues, what can we say about eigenvalues of $A$? 

Finally, I found an answer! A friend of mine, brought this to my attention. Apparently, there is a connection between this and eigenvalues of Cayley graphs. This problem is equivalent with finding bound on the number of nodes of a cubic Cayley graphs which all its eigenvalues are integers. A. J. Schwenk ("Exactly thirteen connected cubic graphs have integral spectra". Proceedings of the International Graph Theory Conference at Kalamazoo, (Y. Alavi and D. Lick, eds.) Springer-Verlag. May 1976.) has characterized all cubic graphs. He show that the number of nodes is maximum $30$. His result is not about Cayley graphs, but consequently it proves bound of $24$ with my numeric calculations. I read his paper, but was painfully difficult to call it a proof. I still prefer to find a a more abstract proof based on representation and group theory!
