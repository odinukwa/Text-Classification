These both have dilatation the largest real root of $$ 1 - 2x -2x^3 + x^4, $$ which is $\approx 2.2966$, but are not conjugate. You can check this by using flipper and the Python code: 

Generating: The following code was used to find this example. It lists all the different mapping classes with word length at most three. It filters out the pseudo-Anosov ones and sorts them by dilatation. We group these by dilatation and then look for things in a group that are not conjugate to the first one. 

Most of the papers that I have looked which discuss this approach at appear to use a fairly ad-hoc method. The only place where I could find choosing $N$ being addressed is Cohen (A course in computational algebraic number theory, Section 2.7.2) where he says that: 

Knots such as the 3_1 knot and the 4_1 knot are often referred to as the trefoil and figure-eight knots respectively. There are more obscure names for some of the later ones in the knot tables, for example the 6_1 knot is also know as the stevedore knot. These names are not listed on the online knot database at $URL$ are they listed anywhere else? 

Let $\Sigma = \lbrace a_1, \ldots, a_n, A_1, \ldots A_n \rbrace$ (where $A_i = a_i^{-1}$) and $\prec$ be a total ordering on $\Sigma$. Let $\Sigma^*$ be the set of all words (generated by the alphabet $\Sigma$) and $\prec^*$ be the total ordering on $\Sigma^*$ induced by $\prec$ (dictionary / lexicographical ordering). Let $G$ be a finitely presented group which acts on $\Sigma^*$. For $w \in \Sigma^*$, let $[w]$ denote the equivalence class of words under $G$ (i.e. $[w] = \text{Orb}_G(w)$). Let $\text{First}_G(w)$ be the first element of $[w]$ under the total ordering $\prec^*$ (i.e. $\text{First}_G(w)$ is the unique element of $[w]$ s.t. $\forall v \in [w] \backslash \lbrace \text{First}_G(w) \rbrace$, $\text{First}_G(w) \prec^* v$). The naive way to determine $\text{First}_G(w)$ is to first generate $[w]$ and then determine the 'first' element of this set, however in general $[w]$ may be an infinite set. In the case when $G = \langle \Sigma^* | \rangle$ and $g \in G$ acts on $\Sigma^*$ by $g :w \mapsto gwg^{-1}$, $[w]$ is the set of cyclic permutations of $w$ and $\text{First}_G(w)$ is the unique Lyndon word in $[w]$. In this particular case, duval's algorithm will determine $\text{First}_G(w)$ without having to generate all of $[w]$. 

An Artin group $G$ is determined by its Coxeter matrix $M$. This is a symmetric $n \times n$ matrix with entries from $\lbrace 2, 3, \ldots, \infty \rbrace$ that determine the relations between the generators of the group. If all of the entries are in $\lbrace 2, \infty \rbrace$ then we say that $G$ is a ``right-angled Artin group''. 

I've checked all the knots listed on KnotInfo (which covers prime knots up to 12 crossings) and found no such pair. It is also worth noting however that if we allow ourselves to work with oriented links then: if we reverse the orientation of one component $k$ of an oriented link diagram $D$ to obtain a new diagram $D'$ then $$ \langle D' \rangle = A^{12 \lambda} \langle D \rangle \quad \textrm{where $\lambda = \textrm{linknum}(k, D - k)$.} $$ Hence, for example, the normalised bracket polynomial can distinguish between the compatibly and incompatibly oriented Hopf links (L2a1{0} and L2a1{1}) but the bracket polynomial cannot. 

The mapping classes $f = T_a T_a T_b T_c^{-1}$ and $g = T_a T_a T_b^{-1} T_c^{-1}$ are not conjugate (they don't even have the same dilatation). However their mapping tori $M_f$ and $M_g$ are homeomorphic. You can check this by using the latest versions of flipper, SnapPy and the Python code: 

Note that if we allow $M$ to be a non-compact manifold / a manifold with boundary then the answer is yes. This follows as we can always find a finite simplicial complex $X$ whose fundamental group is $G$. By correctly adding $i$-cells (for $1 < i \leq n$) we obtain a simplical complex $X'$ with $\pi_1(X') \cong G$ and for $1 < i \leq n$, $\pi_i(M)$ trivial. By embedding $X'$ in a suitably high dimensional Euclidean space and taking an closed / open regular neighbourhood we obtain $M$, a non-compact manifold / manifold with boundary with the required properties. Assuming that the answer to the first question is yes, can we also get manifolds of almost any dimension that we like? 

Cha and Livingston's KnotInfo includes the ability to list the bridge index of knots with at most 11 crossings, and so covers all of Rolfsen's table. The 2-bridge knots are those with bridge index 2. Additionally, their table includes the other invariants that you mention (Alexander polynomial, hyperbolic volume) as well as many more. In the description of bridge index they say that ''There is no general method or algorithm for computing the bridge index of an arbitrary knot''. However, the case of knots with at most 11 crossings was done by Musick in ''Minimal Bridge Projections for 11-corssing prime knots''. In this paper he provides an explicit Dowker-Thistlethwaite Code for a diagram of minimal bridge index for each 11 crossing knots in Section 3. From which one could compute $p / q$ from directly. 

Fix $G$, a finitely generated presented group. It is known that for every $k > 3$ there is a closed $k$-manifold whose fundamental group is $G$. Similarly, there is a topological space with fundamental group $G$ and all higher homotopy groups trivial. However, even for simple examples such as when $G \cong \mathbf{Z}_2$, such a topological space is not a manifold. It seems like the problem with these spaces really lies in the infinite constructions process adding in cells of arbitrarily high dimension. So instead if we only require the first $n$ homotopy groups to be trivial can we still work with manifolds. That is, 

It's not too hard to see why this example works. Namely $f$ is actually conjugate to $g^{-1}$ so they must have the same dilatation. But (the stable lamination of $f$) is lacking the symmetry needed for $f$ to be conjugate to $f^{-1}$, so $f \not \equiv f^{-1} \equiv g$: 

He is computing the fundamental group of the complement of the knot. This is also known as the knot group and is a key invariant in knot theory. More specifically, he is computing the Wirtinger presentation of this group. 

There are approximation algorithms for the (metric) travelling salesman problem, that is, where the distances are symmetric and obey the triangle inequality. For example, Christofides algorithm finds a path that is within a factor of 3/2 of the optimal solution length. Other special cases have even better approximations, such as the Euclidean TSP (where the vertices are points in $\mathbb{R}^d$) or the $(1, 2)$--TSP (where the edges all have length 1 or 2). Although there is no constant factor approximation algorithm for TSP in general (without the metric assumption). More generally this is known as the class of APX-hard or APX-complete problems. You can find more about this on the Complexity Zoo. 

To add an explicit counter-example, consider the curves $a$, $b$ and $c$ on the twice punctured torus shown below. 

Recently, Richard Webb and myself gave a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the asymptotic translation length of a mapping class $$ \ell(h) = \lim_{n \to \infty} d(x, h^n(x)). $$ This appears as Algorithm 6 of the paper and relies on being able to compute geodesics in the curve complex. Assuming this, the key observation is that a midpoint $c'$ of a curve $c$ and its image under a large enough power of $h$ lies close to the tight axis of $h$. Hence $d(c', h^n(c')) \approx n \ell(h)$. Therefore, since $\ell(h)$ is a rational number with bounded denominator, if we take $n$ large enough then $$ \ell(h) = \frac{1}{n} d(c', h^n(c')). $$ If you fix a finite generating set $\langle X \rangle = \textrm{Mod}(S)$ then the running time of this algorithm is a polynomial function of the word length of the mapping class $|h|_X$ since this is the running time of our algorithm for computing a geodesic from $c$ to $h(c)$ (Algorithm 4). 

(In the density model) a random group is either $\mathbb{Z} / 2\mathbb{Z}$ or the trivial group. (I learnt this from Danny Calegari but I believe this is origionally due to Gromov.) More precisely, fix $k \geq 2$ and $D \geq 1/2$. For each $n$ let $X_n$ be the set of reduced words in $x_1^{\pm 1}, \ldots, x_k^{\pm 1}$. Now consider the group: $$ G_n = \langle x_1, \ldots, x_k | r_1, \ldots, r_l \rangle $$ where each $r_i$ is chosen randomly (independently) from $X_n$ and $l = |X_n|^{D} \approx (2k - 1)^{nD}$. Then $\mathbb{P}(G_n \cong \mathbb{Z / 2Z} \textrm{ or } \mathbb{1}) \to 1$ as $n \to \infty$. The proof of this is quite slick and relies on the "Random Pigeon Hole Principle": That because of the number of pair of relators are so large you are likely to get a number of almost equal relators, that differ at a single letter, which kills off a generator. 

No, it is not Haken. You can test this yourself by looking for incompressible normal surfaces with respect to a triangulation of the manifold, this functionality is included in Regina. Moreover, the Weeks manifold is a premade example so determining if it is Haken can be done directly from within the Recognition tab. This completes in a few seconds on my laptop. You can read more about the normal surface theory algorithms used by Regina to do this in the documentation or in the original paper by Jaco and Oertel.
