The time series for the debt-to-GDP ratio are available on the FRED wesbite: link to debt-to-GDP chart. I will let the reader download the data, rather than list the years here. As for why it falls, it requires a good macroeconomic model. The reason being is that we need to explain both the fiscal deficit and the rate of nominal GDP growth. Policymakers do not directly control the deficit. Faster growth means a greater tax take, less social spending. Meanwhile, capital gains taxes are determined by the hard-to-forecast changes in stock prices. Nominal GDP (the denominator) can grow as a result of faster inflation, or faster real growth. The precise determinants of this have bee the subject of economic debates for decades. I obviously cannot answer it here. One factor to keep in mind that the existing level of the ratio matters a lot. If nominal GDP growth is 5%: 

The spread on the \$100 loan would have to be increased to make up for the negative spread on the \$50 in reserves (versus the bond). The banking systems ability to lend would be largely crippled, and firms would be forced to switch to alternative sources of financing. If firms cannot get financing, they cannot invest or hire more people, and that makes capitalists and politicians unhappy. The main economic effect of required reserves is that it is a means of forcing banks to lend to the central bank at a low rate. Until the Fed was given the right to pay interest on reserves in 2008, banks received no interest, and so reserves were an interest-free loan to the government. Even if reserves pay interest, it is at an administered rate set by the central bank (which effectively becomes the short-term risk-free rate). Banks have no choice but to accept that rate of interest, whereas Treasury bill/bond rates are set in auction. (In practice, Treasury bill rates trade close to the policy rate.) This policy of forcing banks to lend to the government (via the central bank) is often called "financial repression." This matters more for countries with poorly developed bond markets, but the U.S. Treasury can lock in low rates for a very long time without much difficulty. 

Historically banks kept close to the minimum in their reserve accounts. Once the Fed started paying interest, they rapidly put a truly large amount of money in those accounts. If the fed were to stop paying interest, I think we could expect them to go back to keeping the minimum in those accounts. So what would they do with the money? Buy safe securities? Risky securities? Make more loans? I'd say all of the above. Most likely the bulk of the money would go into subtitutes: very safe securities like T bill and money market securities. Loans would go up by the least amount because the availability of high quality loan opportunities is already the limiting factor. The influx of cash into the markets (and the new loans) would drive up prices of all investable securities (investors who used to buy T bills will look to alternatives, etc.). It would also cause an expansion of the money supply that would likely lead to inflation. I actually worry about this quite a bit. It's unprecedented, though, so we don't know what would happen. I think we could anticipate the Fed or government trying to do something to offset the inflation, at least. 

We need to distinguish between private corporations, and public. Private corporations are largely free in what they do, public corporations listed on stock exchanges have to follow various procedures. For any corporation, there’s no guarantee that you make a profit, so what price you bought it at makes no difference. If a company wound up its affairs, it would make a final cash distribution to shareholders, and that would be it. The cash would either be a dividend or a return of capital, depending upon the equity levels of the company. The problem is that do this, the company would have to sell all assets simultaneously. That is normally difficult to do, and so it is much more usual for the entire firm to bought out (after selling some assets). Furthermore, having a listing on the stock exchange is itself valuable. It would be far more common for a company to pursue a “reverse takeover”: the listed company appears to take over a private firm, but the private firm actually buys out the existing shareholders. This way, the private firm saves the expenses of seeking a listing on the stock exchange. Just shutting the firm down would probably be viewed as a suboptimal course of action, and might expose the directors to lawsuits. What is more likely is that companies largely fail, and end up having to shut down most of their operations. After awhile, they will not meet listing requirements to remain on the stock exchange, and the shares are delisted. The shares still exist, but it is very hard to find buyers. If you want to find examples, you could just do a web search looking for the terms “delisted companies” and the name of a stock exchange that you are interested in. The following link is an example: TSX Venture Exchange listing changes 

Summary: The fear of future inflation causes treasury yields to rise today. Wider deficits also lead to higher yields because the supply of treasuries increases. This will lower the price of treasuries, which is the same as increasing yields. Now, why is the market buying dollars? The market is anticipating US consumers and government going into debt and driving up interest rates. In order to take advantage of these higher interest rates, one must have to have dollars to lend. But no, foreigners are not buying dollars because they are anticipating inflation...they are buying because they anticipate higher (real) interest rates. The inflation will come as a side effect of the anticipated spending spree and foreigners are expecting the inflation to be smaller than the rise in nominal interest rates. 

The price of a good is the equilibrium between the people buying and the people selling. A change in the money supply does not change how many goods there are to sell but it does change how many dollars the people buying them have. If people have more money, they will be willing to pay more, so the price goes up. 

If you have a single country, using the CPI to deflate values does not create a serious issue with the base year. Changing the base just changes the levels of the numbers, but they are are multiplied by the same amount. This means that rankings of prices are the same. If you convert to a single currency, which one you pick does not matter for ordering the prices. For example, it does not matter whether you choose to convert all prices to Canadian dollars or US dollars, if the price is more expensive in one country in one currency, it will also be more expensive in the other. This equivalence breaks down when you want to inflation adjust across countries. The choice of the currency for the inflation index affects the comparability. For example, imagine that the exchange rate between two countries in unchanged between two periods, yet the inflation rate is different. The scaling ratio between the two time periods depends on which country’s inflation index you choose. (I don’t think the choice of base year matters other than by applying a scaling factor.) (If exchange rates followed relative inflation exactly, the country for the inflation index would not matter.) There are different approaches you could try. I’ve never run into this kind of comparison before, so I have no idea what the accepted practice is. I would look at what you are trying to compare, and see what the best basis of comparison is. One approach is to not use a CPI index, and instead use a particular price to scale quantities, such as an average hourly wage. (This would imply that all prices are converted to the equivalent number of hours of wages that the price represents.) This converts prices to a meaningful unit, and not some arbitrary CPI indexation factor. 

The first has expected value $1$. The second has expected value $$ \frac 1 {1- e^{-\lambda}} \sum_{x=1}^\infty \cdots = \frac 1 {1-e^{-\lambda}} \left( (-e^{-\lambda}\cdot0) + \sum_{x=0}^\infty \cdots \right) = \frac 1 {1-e^{-\lambda}} \cdot ( \lambda ). $$ After that, use the fact that the expected value of the weighted average of two distributions is the weight average of their two expected values. 

Maybe I'm not understanding your question. Poisson distributions with expected values $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are given by $$ \Pr(X=x) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}\quad\text{ and }\quad \Pr(X=x) = \frac{\mu^x e^{-\mu}}{x!} \quad \text{ for } x=0,1,2,3,\ldots. $$ Suppose the second one holds for $x>0$. It follows that $$ \Pr(X=0) = 1 - \underbrace{\sum_{x=1}^\infty \frac{\mu^x e^{-\mu}}{x!}}_\text{starting at 1, not 0} = e^{-\mu}. $$ Since the sum of the probabilities must be $1$, the probability that $X=0$ can only be $1$ minus the sum of the other probabilities, and that is $\dfrac{e^{-\mu} \mu^0}{0!} = e^{-\mu}.$ Postscript: In comments I am asked how to find the mean of this distribution. Remember that $$ \sum_{x=0}^\infty \frac{\mu^x}{x!} = e^\mu, \tag 1 $$ and from that we get the sum of the probabilities, $$ \sum_{x=0}^\infty \frac{\mu^x e^{-\mu}}{x!} = 1 \tag 2 $$ We will use the sum $(2)$ in finding the mean. The mean is \begin{align} \operatorname{E}(X) & = \sum_{x=0}^\infty x\Pr(X=x) \\ & = \sum_{x=0}^\infty x\cdot\frac{\mu^x e^{-\mu}}{x!} \\ & = \sum_{x=1}^\infty x\cdot\frac{\mu^x e^{-\mu}}{x!} & & \text{(starting with $1$ rather than $0$} \\ & & & \phantom{(}\text{since the $0$ term vanishes because} \\ & & & \phantom{(}\text{of the multiplication by $x$)} \\ & =\sum_{x=1}^\infty \frac{\mu^x e^{-\mu}}{(x-1)!} & & \text{(since $x/(x!) = 1/(x-1)!$ if $x\ge1$)} \\[8pt] & = \mu \sum_{x=1}^\infty \frac{\mu^{x-1} e^{-\mu}}{(x-1)!} & & \text{(factors not depending on the index $x$)} \\ & & & \phantom{(} \text{can be pulled out)} \\ & = \mu \sum_{y=0}^\infty \frac{\mu^y e^{-\mu}}{y!} & & \text{where $y=x-1$} \\ & & & \text{so $y$ goes from $0$ to $\infty$ as $x$ goes from $1$ to $\infty$} \\ & = \mu \cdot 1 & & \text{by line $(2)$, stated above} \\ & = \mu. \end{align} So the mean is $\mu$. Postscript: Your new revision of the question isn't quite consistent with your statement that "the distribution is one Poisson distribution for observations $=0$ and another distribution for observations not equal to zero". You have $$ \Pr(X=x) = \begin{cases} e^{-\theta} & \text{if }x=0, \\ (1-e^{-\theta}) \dfrac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!(1-e^{-\lambda})} & \text{if } x\ge 1. \end{cases} $$ Thus you have a weighted average of 

I see two general questions here: How does a market order work? When you submit a market order, you ask your broker to buy or sell a security right now, at the best available price. You control the timing but not the execution price. This is as opposed to a limit order, in which you ask the broker to put out a for-sale (or want-to-buy) notice at a given price. Your trade will not execute unless someone else agrees to that price. You control the price with a limit order, but not the timing. If you demand too good a price, it may not execute at all. Do I need to control intraday and daily trades? How about the spread? If you submit a market order, it will execute right away. It will not stay open overnight or anything. What you do need to look at is how liquid the stock is. In other words, how much space is there between the bid (highest price people will buy it for) and ask (lowest price people are selling it for) and how many open (limit) orders there are in each. A more liquid stock (smaller bid-ask spread and higher volume) means you have to worry less about poor execution when submitting a limit order. If it is a big stock with lots of trades and sellers/buyers, then a market order is pretty safe. Otherwise you may want to submit a limit order and wait for the other side of the transaction to come to you. Worst case scenario is that you submit a market order to buy and no one is selling so you pay a ton (or you submit an order sell and no one is there to buy, so it goes for super cheap). 

We need to distinguish between a crisis and a normally functioning financial system. During a crisis, there is an unwillingness to lend against collateral at any price (interest rate). Financial firms are liquidity constrained, and they assume that the entities that want to borrow are similarly constrained. Being able to fund positions in securities at any price is a huge relief, since that means you are not forced to sell (at a distressed price). As an example, imagine that a financial firm needs to borrow at 12% interest to finance a position in corporate bonds. If that borrowing is done for a month at that rate, the total interest cost would be 1%. This is probably going to be much less costly than being forced to sell the position; a loss of 20% would not be unusual in such a situation. Furthermore, the crisis lending is done by the central bank to financial firms facing financing issues; it is not aimed at the broad public. During the Financial Crisis, lending programs were aimed at banks and security markets, not non-financial entities. The level of short-term rates does not really matter that much; once the markets return to normal, you will be able to fund your positions at a much better rate. Having to pay a high rate of overnight interest for a week on a long-term security is not a big deal. The argument for lender-of-last-resort operations at a high level of interest is that you do not want this facility to be a regular source of financing for the financial system. 

Treasury securities pay out a fixed amount at maturity. Investors fear inflation between now and when the securities mature because the inflation makes the payout worth less in real terms. Investors will therefore pay less for these securities today. Prices of the treasury securities therefore fall today. "Falling prices" is the same thing as "increasing yields." Heuristically, Yield = Payout/Price -1. The payout is fixed. 

Write out the correct profit function. Substitute everything in until the only remaining variables are the things you are able to control (in this case, the quantities). Take derivatives with respect to each choice variable and solve the resulting first order conditions (which sometimes may be a system of equations, but not here). Substitute your optimal quantities back in to get the resulting profit. In a more complex case you should also take the second derivative to ensure that you are getting the maximums, not the minimums. 

Think about what a loan is in terms of purchasing power. You give a bank your signature on a loan contract and they give you something that will allow you to buy real stuff (houses, cars, whatever). You enjoy this real stuff for some time. Then at the end you have to give the bank something that will allow them to buy real stuff, only more of it. I'm calling it "something" instead of "dollars" for a reason I will explain below. In the foreign exchange case, the US gives other countries pieces of paper, which are essentially IOUs. They give the US either real stuff, which is then enjoyed, or they give the US their currency, which is immediately spent on real stuff. The US doesn't hoard their currency. Time passes and at the end they give back the IOU's in exchange for some real stuff. Only instead of giving back more real stuff than was originally given, the US gives back less (because of inflation). I called dollars "something" in the loan example and "IOUs" in the macro example because dollars take on a different role in each case. In the loan, the dollars represent real purchases that are made immediately. In the macro example, the dollars take the place of the loan contract. They don't buy any real stuff until the end of the transaction. You can think of it another way by ignoring the dollars. Foreigners give the US electronics and clothes and stuff in exchange for nothing. After a while the US gives them back food and machines or whatever, only what the US gives back is worth less than the electronics and clothes it was given. That's a zero interest (or negative interest) loan. By the way, it's not just foreigners. Whoever holds currency has given up something valuable (time, materials, land, etc.) in exchange for paper. As long as that paper is under your mattress, you are not consuming and the paper is becoming worth less than it was. You've made a negative interest loan.
