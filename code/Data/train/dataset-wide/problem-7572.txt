Could you point where did I make mistake(s)? I think the second is wrong, but I can not tell why. Thanks in advance. 

To put it in another way. Let $M$ be a manifold and $D=\{x\in R| x^2=0\} $ be the infinitesimal line in synthetic geometry, then $Map(D, M)$ is the tangent bundle, where $Map$ denotes the internal hom. Applying twice we get $Map(D^2, M)$, which is the twiced tangent bundle. The second argument translate to 

Given a monoid $C$ acting (from the right) on a set $M$, there is a bar construction giving a simplicial set or equivalently a translation/action category, $$ N_\bullet (M\rtimes C)= \cdots M\times C^2 \Rrightarrow M\times C ⇉^s_t M, \quad \text{with } s(m,c)=mc, t(m,c)=m. $$ There is a natural morphism of simplicial sets $N_\bullet (M\rtimes C)\to N_\bullet (*\rtimes C)$. One may argue that the correct quotient of $M$ by the $C$ action is this bar construction (cf. Thomason’s homotopy colimit theorem). Now consider weak monoidal category $C$ coherent action on a category $M$. That is, there is an action functor $M\times C\to M$, unit and associative up to coherent invertible natural transformations. We imitate the bar construction $$ \cdots M\times C^2\Rrightarrow M\times C ⇉^s_t M. $$ But in this case simplicial identities hold up to invertible natural transformations. Jardine's supercoherence theorem implies that we obtain a pseudo-simplicial categories, that is a pseudo functor $\Delta^{op}\to Cats$. Applying then the Grothendieck construction, we obtain a category which is a pseudo colimit of this simplicial diagram. This may be regard as the (homotopy) quotient of $M$ by the $C$ action. There is another construction like the geometric nerve of a bicategory. Viewing $C$ as a one object, say $*$, bicategory. Imaging the object of $M$ as arrows $0\leftarrow *$, arrows of $M$ as 2-cells. Then the action functor works like composition in a bicategory. Now form a simplicial set with $X_0=M_0$, that is arrows $0\leftarrow *$. Let $X_1$ be the set of 2-commutative triangles with vertex $(0,*,*)$, that is the set of $(m, c, \alpha)$, where $m\in M, c\in C$ and $\alpha$ is an arrow in $M$ with target $mc$. Let $X_2$ be 2-commutaitve 3-simplex $(0,*,*,*)$, and so on. We obtain a simplicial set $X$. (It is clear that if $M$ is a set and $C$ is a monoid, $X$ is the bar construction.) My question: whether $X$ and the one given by Grothendieck construction have the same homotopy type? They both have a map to (the nverve of one obect bicategory) $C$, thus a commutative triangle up to homotopy? Possible relevant result, it is shown that the geometric nerve and pseudo-nerve of a bicategory has the same homotopy type. However this does not answer the question directly. 

Instead of giving a reference, I suggest either proving it the same way as Lucas' theorem, or noting that it's a quick corollary of Lucas' theorem, or both. It's a corollary because you can express a multinomial coefficient as a product of binomial coefficients in the standard way. Or to prove it the same way, you can divide a set $S$ of $n$ elements into rings of size $p^k$ for $k \le m$, and then look at the action of a product of cyclic groups $\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ on colored partitions of $S$ of type $a,b,\ldots,z$. Lucas' theorem counts the orbits of size 1, noting that the size of any larger orbit is divisible by $p$. A lot of people feel obliged to either give a reference or a detailed proof for everything in a paper. I personally don't mind an abbreviated argument for this type of fact, together with a disclaimer that it isn't claimed to be a new result. Sometimes I even prefer that. 

Certainly you can get fairly close with your ternary operation $T(x,y,z) = \langle x,y \rangle z$. You can impose conditions on $T$ so that it comes from a bilinear form that takes values in a commutative ring of extended scalars acting on the vector space $V$. This is not entirely a bad thing; you could instead start with an abelian group $A$ and let $T$ induce both the bilinear form and the ground ring. To stick close to your original question, let's suppose that $V$ is a vector space over a fixed field $k$, and that the elements of $k$ are written into the algebraic theory. Then still the scalars could extend further, but you can write axioms to make sure that that is all that happens. In detail, you can first suppose that $T(x,y,z)$ is trilinear and that $T(x,y,z) = T(y,x,z)$. Then $T$ can already be read as a bilinear form that takes values in operators acting on $V$. We can use the shorthand $U(z) = T(a,b,z)$, with $U$ an implicit function of $a$ and $b$, and see what conditions can be further imposed. You can impose the axiom: $$T(a,b,T(c,d,x)) = T(c,d,T(a,b,x)),$$ which says that the different values of $U$ all commute, and thus generate a commutative algebra $R$. You can also impose the relation: $$T(T(a,b,x),y,z) = T(a,b,T(x,y,z)),$$ in other words $T(U(x),y,z) = U(T(x,y,z))$. This relation says that $T$, as an operator-valued inner product, is $U$-linear. With these relations, every word $W$ in $T$ collapses like this, after permuting inputs: $$W(x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_{2n}) = \langle x_1, x_2 \rangle \cdots \langle x_{2n-1}, x_{2n} \rangle x_0,$$ where the product is interpreted over $R$ rather than over $k$. (The number of inputs must be even because $T$ is ternary.) This sort of collapse is the most that you can expect from any $(n,1)$-ary operation formed from a bilinear form. I think that that proves that with this approach, you can't do better than inner products with extension of scalars. For all I know, it is possible that you could hard-code Euclidean geometry in some more subtle way using inequalities and names of elements in $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{R}$ in addition to using multilinear algebra. I do not know how to do that, though. 

If we introduce local coordinates $(x^i)$ on $M$, then $(x^i, dx^i)$ can be local coordinates on $TM$, and $(x^i, dx^i, \delta x^i, d\delta x^i)$ can be local coordinates on $T(TM)$. But the rules for change of coordinates is a bit complicated for $T(TM)$, which involve the second derivatives of transition functions of $(x^i)$. So we can not hope $TTM\cong \oplus^3 TM$. From argument above we have three different maps $TM\to TTM$ given by $(x^i, dx^i)\mapsto (x^i, dx^i,0,0)$ or $(x^i, 0,\delta x^i,0)$ or $(x^i,0,0, d\delta x^i)$, thus we have a map $\oplus^3 TM\to TTM$ of vector bundle over $M$. This map is locally an isomorphism, as we saw $T(TR^d)=R^{4d}=\oplus^3 T R^d$, so this is also a globally isomorphism. 

I can show it by hand, the question is how to show this assertion more abstractly? (It seems related to decent theory?) Thanks a lot. 

For simplicity, let us consider only a functor out of a small category $\mathcal{C}$ to $Set$, $$ f:\mathcal{C}\to Set, $$ The Grothendieck construction produces a category (category of elements) $El(f)$ whose objects are $\sqcup_{c\in \mathcal{C}} f(c)$. Grothendieck construction provides a universal way to compute the colimits. My question: Is there a co-form Grothendieck construction (or Grothendieck nstruction for fun)? The co-form of Grothendieck construction should give us a way to compute the limits. By nonsense argument, this might be the (internal) Grothendieck construction for $f^{op}: \mathcal{C}^{op}\to Set^{op}$. But I hardly see what is this more concretely. First, the space of elements is dual to above form, perhaps $\Pi_{c\in \mathcal{C}} f(c)$. 

I got a proof, slightly modified after talking to a friend. Thanks @Tim and @Harry. We prove a stronger statement: any inner horn $\Lambda^n_i$ can be retracted to $\Delta^{n-1}\cup_{\{n-1\}} \Delta^1\{ n-1, n \}$, then by induction the statement follows. To this end, we claim that $\Lambda^n_i$ admits an inner horn retraction to $\Delta^{n-1} \cup_{ \Delta^{n-2}\{1,\cdots,n-1\} } \Delta^{n-1}\{1,\cdots n \} $, then the stronger statement follows also by induction. To prove the claim, noticing that $\Delta^{n-1} \cup_{ \Delta^{n-2}\{1,\cdots,n-1\} } \Delta^{n-1}\{1,\cdots n \}\hookrightarrow \Lambda^n_i$ is a trivial cofibration, therefore $\Lambda^n_i$ admits a retraction to $\Delta^{n-1} \cup_{ \Delta^{n-2}\{1,\cdots,n-1\} } \Delta^{n-1}\{1,\cdots n \} $. But each step is retracting a horn containing $ \{0 ,n \}$, thus an inner horn retraction. 

This supercoherence subsumes "all diagrams commute type" coherence for monoidal category, bicategory(?). Now it's natural to replace the target strict 2-category $\mathbf{Cat}$ by a general bicategory $\mathbf{C}$. Is the naive analogue still true? The naive approach is first looking at any strict 2-cateogry, then embedding a bicategory in a strict 2-category by the coherence theorem for bicategory. I do not know if this works actually. 

I read Alexander duality as saying "If you have any type of doughnut in a sphere, then the outside must have handles or islands that fill the doughnut's holes." The proof that Ryan outlines exactly matches this intuition. If $D \subseteq S^n$ is the doughnut, then you start with the exact sequence of a pair: $$\cdots \to H_{k+1}(S^n) \to H_{k+1}(S^n,D) \to H_k(D) \to H_k(S^n) \to \cdots,$$ and assume some middle value of $k$. Then you can read this diagram fairly directly as $$\cdots \to 0 \to \text{handles of $S^n\setminus D$} \to \text{holes of $D$} \to 0 \to \cdots.$$ Clearly $H_k(D)$ measures the holes of $D$, and the only question is why $H_{k+1}(S^n,D)$ can be interpreted as the handles/holes of $S^n \setminus D$. As Ryan says, if $D$ and $E = \overline{S^n \setminus D}$ are manifolds that meet at a common boundary, then $$H_{k+1}(S^n,D) \cong H_{k+1}(E,\partial E) \cong H^{n-k-1}(E),$$ where the first isomorphism is excision and the second one is Poincaré duality. You can also extend this from submanifolds of $S^n$ to general closed subsets by taking limits. On one side you have a decreasing sequence of compact sets, and the answer is Cech cohomology, by the old-fashioned definition of Cech cohomology as a direct limit of cohomology groups. On the other side, you have an increasing sequence of compact sets whose union is open, and the answer is homology because it just is — the homology functor commutes with this type of direct limit of spaces. 

Well, it would have been called that if not for the flip move reversing the cyclic ordering at a vertex. I didn't notice that when I wrote the above. With this flip move, I am not sure why the graph is fat in the first place, though. If you take thin graphs instead, then at least the corresponding Teichmuller space does have a good name, "Outer Space". Karen Vogtmann et al have written much about it. 

As Andy says, people didn't know until fairly late in the classification whether there were finitely or infinitely many sporadic finite simple groups. Actually "sporadic" has a fairly specific operational meaning; it means finite simple groups that are not prime cyclic, alternating, or Chevalley type. (The finite simple groups of Chevalley type are basically Lie groups over finite fields, with the twist that there are some extra ones in characterestic 2 and 3. The Tits group is usually counted with these even though it's not part of an infinite sequence. Arguably a prime cyclic group is also a Lie group over a finite field.) Another example is the theorem on highly transitive permutation groups. The classification implies that there are no 6-transitive permutation groups on $n$ points other than $A_n$ and $S_n$. I have heard that without the classification, there is no bound which is uniform in $n$. People certainly think that it is a good project to improve the classification of finite simple groups in general. In fact Gorenstein's announcement that the classification was complete was controversial, because there was clearly interesting mathematics left to be discovered even though there was sort-of enough at that time to believe the classification. But you have to study the classification to know what needs to be improved. If people do not have an a priori argument that there are only finitely many sporadic groups, then it would be great to have one, but I don't see how you can know in advance that you should look for that. Note that in the modern classifications of complex simple Lie algebras or compact simple Lie groups, you do not prove that there are only finitely many exceptional ones before proving the full classification using root systems and Dynkin diagrams. On the contrary, both in the classification and in the representation theory that comes after, people are the happiest when they can treat all of the root systems uniformly, i.e., when the exceptional Lie algebras are not treated as exceptions. The fact that sporadic groups are more exceptional than exceptional Lie algebras could be one reason that the current classification of finite simple groups seems unsatisfying.
