Here is an answer to 1. It is known that for any $A > 0$ that $\sum_{m \leq x} \mu(m) e(\alpha m) = O_A(x (\log{x})^{-A})$ uniformly in $\alpha$. For instance, consult Theorem 13.10 of Iwaniec and Kowalski's book, Analytic Number Theory. This uniform bound comes from combining the zero free region of Dirichlet L-functions with Vinogradov's method. This bound shows that $|\hat{\mu}(k)| \leq C_A (\log{n})^{-A}$. This gives 2) for $A$ fixed. Edit 1: It gives 3) also. Edit 2: I would guess the truth is $|\hat{\mu}(k)| \leq C(\varepsilon) n^{-1/2 + \varepsilon}$ so $s$ would have to be almost as large as $n$ to get anything not $o(1)$. 

Another reason it is relatively uncommon to study automorphic cusp forms for non-congruence subgroups is that their existence is difficult if not impossible to establish, from the work of Phillips and Sarnak and others. EDIT: In the above I was referring to functions on the upper half plane invariant under the group $\Gamma$ which are eigenfunctions of the hyperbolic Laplacian, i.e., Maass forms. I should have been more explicit! For the case of $\Gamma = SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ their existence was only shown by Selberg using the trace formula. The trace formula holds for non-congruence subgroups too but in general the spectral side has both a discrete part (corresponding to cusp forms) and a continuous part (corresponding to Eisenstein series). For $\Gamma_0(N)$ one can show directly that the continuous part contributes a lower order of magnitude than the whole spectral side, and therefore deduce that Maass forms exist in abundance. For non-congruence subgroups this argument breaks down and the work referred to above provides evidence that the discrete spectrum is very small. 

Sorry to give a reference to my own paper, but perhaps what you are looking for is contained in section 2 of this paper; see also Theorem 1.3. The basic idea is that the Selberg and Kuznetsov trace formulae both involve spectral sums but with different weights. To get Selberg weights from Kuznetsov one needs to multiply by $L(1, \text{sym}^2 u_j)$ where $u_j$ is a Hecke-Maass form associated to the spectral parameter $t_j$. Thus one obtains a sum of Kloosterman sums of the form $\sum_{c} \sum_{n} \frac{S(n^2, 1;c)}{ c n}$ with some weight function. An application of Poisson summation in $n$ leads to values of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions at $1$ which by the class number formula can be expressed in terms of class numbers. These are then connected to the geometric side of the Selberg trace formula using Sarnak's thesis. In the paper referenced above this is carried out in the reverse direction. In my personal experience, the Kuznetsov formula often gives stronger error terms with minimal extra work. The representation in terms of Kloosterman sums allows for algebraic geometry (the Weil bound) to enter the game as well as other ideas in the theory of exponential sums. The Kuznetsov formula is also very useful in the reverse direction for studying Kloosterman sums which occur naturally in many number-theoretic applications. One can examine the papers of Deshouillers-Iwaniec for many interesting examples. 

I sketch a method that should show $F_n$ is convex for $n$ sufficiently large. A Taylor expansion gives that $F_n(x) = x^{2n} (1-x)^2 + O(x^{4n-1})$, and so $$F_n''(x) = 2x^{2n-2}[2n^2(1-x)^2 + x^2 - n(1-x)(1+3x)] + O(x^{4n-3}).$$ This should show that $F_n''(x) > 0$ for $n$ large, provided $x < 1-\frac{C}{n}$ for some fixed $C>0$. On the other hand, according to Mathematica, $F_n''(1) = 4n^2 - \frac{16}{3} n + \frac{5}{4}$, which has its largest root at $\frac{8 + \sqrt{19}}{12} \approx 1.02991$. (By the way, there doesn't seem to be any reason that $n$ should be restricted to be an integer, and this is in line with some plots I made indicating $F_n(x)$ is convex for $n > 1.03$.) Moreover, Mathematica gives $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} n^{-2}F_n''(1-\frac{y}{n}) = \frac{16 e^{4y}}{(1+e^{4y})^2} > 0.$$ Putting these two pieces together should be able to show $F_n(x)$ is convex on $(0,1)$ for $n$ sufficiently large. Unfortunately, it might be very painful to work out all the error terms explicitly. 

Your sum is bounded by $$C\frac{\log (2+r)}{r} \frac{n \tau(n)}{\varphi(n)},$$ for some absolute constant $C$. Proof. Using that $c_q(n) = \sum_{d|(n,q)} d \mu(q/d)$, and reversing the order of summation, we get that your sum is bounded by $$\sum_{d|n} \frac{|\mu(d)| d}{\varphi^2(d)} \sum_{\ell > \frac{r}{d}} \frac{|\mu(\ell)|}{\varphi^2(\ell)}.$$ Next I claim that $$\sum_{\ell \geq N} \frac{1}{\varphi^2(\ell)} \ll \frac{\log (2+N)}{N}.$$ Taking this for granted, the bound on the sum becomes $$\ll \frac{\log(2+r)}{r} \sum_{d|n} \frac{|\mu(d)| d^2}{\varphi^2(d)} = \frac{\log(2+r)}{r} \prod_{p|n} (1 + \frac{p^2}{(p-1)^2}), $$ and $$\prod_{p|n} (1 + \frac{p^2}{(p-1)^2}) = \prod_{p|n} (2 + \frac{2}{p} + O(p^{-2})) \ll \frac{n \tau(n)}{\varphi(n)}.$$ Finally, to bound the sum over $\ell$, we use Rankin's trick (we may assume $N \geq 1$) giving $$\sum_{\ell \geq N} \frac{|\mu(\ell)|}{\varphi(\ell)^2} \leq \sum_{\ell \geq N} \frac{\ell^{1-\varepsilon}}{N^{1-\varepsilon}} \frac{|\mu(\ell)|}{\varphi(\ell)^2} \leq \sum_{\ell \geq 1} \frac{\ell^{1-\varepsilon}}{N^{1-\varepsilon}} \frac{|\mu(\ell)|}{\varphi(\ell)^2}. $$ Here $\varepsilon > 0$ will be chosen to be $\varepsilon = \frac{1}{\log (2+N)}$. Now this final sum can be expressed as an Euler product giving $$\sum_{\ell \geq 1} \frac{\ell^{1-\varepsilon}}{N^{1-\varepsilon}} \frac{|\mu(\ell)|}{\varphi(\ell)^2} = \frac{1}{N^{1-\varepsilon}} \prod_{p} (1 + \frac{p^{1-\varepsilon}}{(p-1)^2}) \ll \frac{\zeta(1+\varepsilon)}{N^{1-\varepsilon}} \ll \frac{\log (2+N)}{N},$$ which completes the proof. 

As others have mentioned, if $p$ is fixed then you're really looking at elliptic curves over a fixed finite field. From some points of view an interesting variant would be to look at elliptic curves say $E_{a,b}:y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ where $a$ and $b$ vary over integers in a box, say $|a| \leq A$ and $|b| \leq B$ and relatively small compared to $p$. The one might try to find asymptotic results that hold as $p$, $A$, $B$ get large together. If $A$ and $B$ aren't too big then this is giving more information about individual curves. For example, in bounding the average analytic rank of elliptic curves it is important to get a good bound on $$\frac{1}{AB} \sum_{p < P} \sum_{|a| \leq A} \sum_{|b| \leq B} a_P(E_{a,b})$$ with $A$ and $B$ as small as possible. For example, see A. Brumer, The average rank of elliptic curves. I, Invent. Math. 109(3), 445–472 (1992). In a different but related direction, there is a paper of David and Pappalardi, Average Frobenius distributions of elliptic curves (it's the fourth from the bottom) on this subject. They get a kind of Lang-Trotter on average, so they are varying both $p$ and the coefficients defining the elliptic curves. Stephan Baier later made some improvements on this problem here. 

The $\ll$ in this context means that there is some constant $C > 0$ such that $q \leq C (\log{x})^A$. If $q$ goes to infinity (with $x$) much faster than this then the main term itself can be bounded by the error term (in which case the result would be "trivial"). 

I will show that Gerry's answer is typical, in some sense. If $g(x)$ is analytic in a neighborhood of a point, say $x=0$, then its Taylor expansion is of the form $g(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n z^n$ where $c_n = g^{(n)}(0)/n!$. Thus if $g$ is real-valued for real $x$ then all the $c_n$ are real. Apply this to $g(x) = f'(x)$ with $f$ as in the question. Then by integrating term by term we have $f(x) = C + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^{n+1}/(n+1)$, where $C$ is constant. The only way $f$ is not real is if $C$ is a non-real complex number. This is actually the case in Gerry's example of $f(x) = \log(-x^2) = \log(|x|^2) + i \arg(-1)$ (however you want to define the argument of $-1$). The trick to generating further examples is then to find disguised ways to write such a function $f$. 

In the special case of an imaginary quadratic field of discriminant $-D$, one can use reduction theory to compute the class number in around $D^{1/2}$ steps. Computing the class number boils down to counting binary quadratic forms $ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ with $a \geq 1$, $b^2 - 4ac = -D$, and $|b| \leq a \leq c$. In particular, this means $4ac = b^2 + D \leq ac + D$, so $ac \leq D/3$, and so $a \leq \sqrt{D/3}$. For each $a$, given its prime factorization, it is easy to quickly check if $b^2 \equiv D \pmod{4a}$ is solvable, and find all $b$'s that solve this quadratic congruence. Then given $b$ and $a$, we find $c$ by $c = (b^2+D)/(4a)$. The problem of getting the prime factorization of $a$ is not a problem since we want to do this for each $a \leq \sqrt{D/3}$. It is easy to get the prime factorizations of all $a$'s at once by the sieve of Eratosthenes. I believe this method takes at most $D^{1/2} \log^C D$ steps for some small $C$. 

Within the body of the text I would refer to the paper as work by "28 authors" but in the bibliography I would list them all . 

Let's examine the case $N=12$, weight $3$, with central character $\chi_{-4}$. According to the LMFDB, there are two newforms $f$ in this space. I will take it as numerically-verified that for both of these forms, $f|W_3$ is proportional to $f$. Theorem 2.1 of Atkin-Li (Twists of newforms and pseudo-eigenvalues of W-operators. Invent. Math. 48 (1978), no. 3, 221–243) then states $f|W_3 = \lambda f,$ where $$\lambda = -\frac{|a_f(3)|}{a_f(3)}.$$ Here the minus sign comes from their convention that the Gauss sum of a trivial character is $-1$, under the conditions at hand. Here I multiplied by $|a_f(3)|$ because the pseudo-eigenvalue has absolute value $1$. Indeed, the earlier Proposition 1.1 from that paper shows $\lambda^2 = -1$, so the only question is the sign of $\lambda$. Now the above formula for $\lambda$ becomes $\lambda = - \frac{\overline{a_f(3)}}{|a_f(3)|} = \frac{a_f(3)}{|a_f(3)|}$, since $\lambda = \pm i$. Isn't this the numerical value that is claimed in the original question? added later: I consulted Theorem 3 of Li's 1975 Math. Annalen paper (Newforms and functional equations). I will continue the discussion of this example. Li defines a version of the Atkin-Lehner operator, denoted $V_3^M$ (I will drop the superscript in what follows). However, I think that her choice of $V_3$ is inconsistent with $W_3$. According to Li's definition, we may choose $V_3 = \begin{pmatrix} -3 & -1 \\ 12 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$. She requires the lower-right entry to be $3$. With $W_3$ given as in the original question, we have $$V_3 W_3^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} 7 & -2 \\ -24 & 7 \end{pmatrix}.$$ Since $\chi_{-4}(7) = -1$, we have $$f|V_3 = - f |W_3.$$ It should be mentioned that the definition of the Atkin-Lehner operator in the Atkin-Li paper has slightly different congruence conditions. In particular, I checked that the choice of $W_3$ in the original question is consistent with the definition of the Atkin-Lehner definition. Unless I made some mistakes, I believe the above discussion clears up the problem, at least in this level $12$ example. 

Define the usual Kloosterman sum by $$S(m,n;c) = \sum_{\substack{x \pmod{c} \\ (x,c) = 1}} e\Big(\frac{mx + n\overline{x}}{c}\Big),$$ where $x \overline{x} \equiv 1 \pmod{c}$, and $e(x) = e^{2 \pi i x}$. I'm interested in knowing if there is a faster way to calculate values of this rather than just adding up the $\varphi(c) \leq c$ values of the sum. By calculate here, I just mean to find a good numerical approximation; the definition already gives an exact expression for it as an element of $\mathbb{Z}[e^{2\pi i/c}]$ which probably can't be improved by much in general. I'm interested in $m$ and $n$ fixed, and how fast it can be computed in terms of $c$. The case $c=$prime is probably the most interesting. I'd also be interested to know if people have considered the speed of evaluation of the full list of values of $S(m,n;c)$ for $c \leq C$. For the case of a Gauss sum to modulus $q$, I have heard that it is "well-known" how to calculate it in around $\sqrt{q}$ steps as follows. The main point is to use the fact that the completed Dirichlet $L$-function has the approximate functional equation (See Theorem 5.3 of Iwaniec and Kowalski's book) $$L(1/2, \chi) = \sum_{n} \frac{\chi(n)}{\sqrt{n}} V(\frac{n}{X \sqrt{q}}) + \epsilon(\chi) \sum_{n} \frac{\overline{\chi}(n)}{\sqrt{n}} V(nX/\sqrt{q}).$$ Here $V$ is a special function that in practice can be calculated (e.g. in Mike Rubinstein's Lcalc package), $\epsilon(\chi) = i^{-a} \tau(\chi) q^{-1/2}$ where $a$ is $0$ or $1$ if $\chi$ is even or odd, $\tau(\chi)$ is the Gauss sum, and $X> 0$ is a parameter to choose. Write this in the form $L(1/2, \chi) = A(X) + \epsilon(\chi)B(X)$. Taking say $X=1$ and another value of $X$ close to $1$ will give different values for $A(X)$ and $B(X)$, and so one can solve for $\epsilon(\chi)$. The function $V(x)$ has rapid decay for $x \gg 1$, so it takes around $\sqrt{q}$ terms in the sum to evaluate $A(X)$ and $B(X)$, far fewer than the full $q$ terms needed to evaluate the Gauss sum by definition. 

The properties (1)-(5) do not characterize $E(z,s)$. The issue is that there's no enough control on it as a function of $s$. For an example, let $$F(z,s) = e^{s(1-s)} E(z,s).$$ Then $F(z,s)$ satisfies properties (1)-(5). 

There is a paper of Huxley from 1968 ($URL$ that answers this. If I am translating the notation correctly, Huxley shows that $$F_n(\delta, N) = (N^{1/2} + \delta^{-1/2})^{2n}$$ is allowable. More generally, if one restricts to $M_i \leq v_i < M_i + N_i$ and assumes that the $i$-th component of ${\bf a}_k - {\bf a}_{\ell}$ is spaced by at least $\delta_i$ (modulo $1$, $k \neq \ell$), then one can replace $F_n(\delta, N)$ by $$\prod_{i=1}^{n} (N_i^{1/2} + \delta_i^{-1/2})^2.$$ 

Your "added later" question can be answered by reading these two Wikipedia articles. The integers you are interested in are commonly called "smooth numbers." Actually you're counting the non-smooth integers but that is a trivial change. 

Your first question seems to follow fairly easily from the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem; actually it seems only to need Renyi's original result. By Moebius inversion, it should suffice to find an asymptotic formula of the form $\sum_{d|N} \mu(d) \psi(x;d,1) = cx + O(x/\log{x})$ for some $c > 0$ and $N < x \leq 3N/2$. If $d>z$ with $z$ some fixed small power of $x$ (say $z=x^{1/100}$) then the trivial bound $\psi(x;d,1) \ll x/d$ gives a satisfactory error term. Otherwise, by Bombieri-Vinogadov we have $$\sum_{d|N, d < z} |\psi(x;d,1) - x/\phi(d)| = O(x (\log{x})^{-100}).$$ Finally, compute $\sum_{d | N , d < z} \mu(d)/\phi(d)$. 

This appears to be a result of Dong. See Theorem 3.4. Rui-Tao Dong, Nodal sets of eigenfunctions on Riemann surfaces, J. Differential Geom. 36 (1992), no. 2, 493--506. 

(I'm adding this as an answer since my original post won't let me add any more info, and the formula is too big for a comment.) There is a variant on the formula as follows \begin{equation} \frac{\Gamma(a ) \Gamma(1-a-b)}{ \Gamma(1-b)} + \frac{\Gamma(b) \Gamma(1-a-b)}{ \Gamma(1-a)} - \frac{\Gamma(a) \Gamma(b)}{ \Gamma(a+b)} = \pi^{\frac12} \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{ 1-a-b}{2}\right) }{\Gamma\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)} \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1+a}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{2-a}{2}\right)} \frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1+b}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{2-b}{2}\right)}. \end{equation} By adding/subtracting it with the original formula one gets an identity with the sum of two terms on each side. I didn't find it helpful but perhaps it sparks an idea with someone. In the context of my original problem, the identity with + corresponds to a sum over even Dirichlet characters, while the identity in this answer corresponds to odd characters. The gamma factors on the right hand side are relevant for the functional equation of the Dirichlet L-functions which depends on the parity of the character.
