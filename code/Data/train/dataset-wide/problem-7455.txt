Given a graph $G$ we construct $\hat{G}$ such that $G$ has a $d$-factor if and only if $\hat{G}$ has a perfect matching. For each vertex $x$ of $G$ we take $d$ vertices $x_1, \dots, x_d$ in $\hat{G}$. For each edge $e = \{x,y\}$ of $G$ we take two vertices $e_x$ and $e_y$ in $\hat{G}$. We then create for edges: 

(1) SCG(k) is well defined because we obtain a well-quasi-order (wqo) when we order subcubic graphs by topological minors (a.k.a. homeomorphic embedding). For subcubic graphs topological minors are equivalent to minors. The Robertson-Seymour graph minor theorem says we get a wqo where we order all graphs by minors (in general minors and topological minors or not equivalent as they are for subcubic graphs, and in general topological minors do not give a wqo). So, we can ignore the subcubic condition (or replace it with higher valence) and play the same game, but we may need to replace "topological minor" with "minor" (topological minor does give a wqo in some cases). (2) TREE(k) looks at k-labeled trees and inf and label preserving embeddings. We cannot look at in preserving embedding when we have cycles; so, I don't see how to make a labeled version of SCG(k). Though that's not to say some other labeled version doesn't exist. 

In general there can be a rather large difference in these quantities. If you take $k = 1$ you are considering the clique partition vs. clique covering problem. This is studied in Clique partitions and clique coverings by Erdős, Faudree, and Ordman. In Example 1 they construct a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices such that (in your notation) $\theta_1(G)/\theta(G) > n^2 /64.$ In Proposition 1 it is shown that for a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices $\theta_1(G)/\theta(G) \leq n^2/12$ provided $n$ is large. Finding an optimal constant here appears to be an open problem. See Problem (66) in Chung's Open problems of Paul Erdős in graph theory. I am unaware of work on values of $k > 1,$ but perhaps some of the constructions in the linked paper can be applied to these cases.

The notion of semidirect product $\Gamma \rtimes G$ where $G$ is a group acting on a groupoid $\Gamma$ is set up in Chapter 11, Section 11.4, of my book "Topology and Groupoids". It is used there in connection with studying orbit groupoids, and their relevance to the fundamental groupoid of an orbit space by a group action. One nice point is that this semidirect product includes the case $\Gamma$ is a discrete groupoid, i.e. essentially a set, when you get what is commonly called the action groupoid. In this case the morphism $p: \Gamma \rtimes G \to G$ is known as a covering morphism of groupoids, and all covering morphisms of $G$ arise in this way. I feel the use of covering morphisms of groupoids makes for a nice exposition, base point free, of the theory of covering spaces. Such an idea was pointed out for the simplicial case in the 1967 book on simplicial theory by Gabriel and Zisman, was used in the first 1968 edition of my book, and is partially used in Peter May's 1999 book "A concise course in algebraic topology". Update: I should also add that the notion of action of a groupoid on a groupoid is given, following C. Ehresmann, in my paper [11] ``Groupoids as coefficients'', Proc. London Math Soc. (3) 25 (1972) 413-426. available here. The aim was cohomology with coefficients in a groupoid. One of the methods exploited is fibrations of groupoids. A notion of "double product" for groups which act on other "compatibly" is discussed in paper 22 of this list. Another relevant paper on groupoids and actions is this paper. 

A good reference for all of this is Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra the 2nd Edition by Stanley. First note that a Cohen-Macaulay complex must be pure and also that a shellable complex must be pure. On page 87 of Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra the 2nd Edition Stanley defines sequentially Cohen-Macaulay complexes as a nonpure generalization of Cohen-Macaulay to fit the extension of shellability to nonpure complexes by Bjorner and Wachs found in Shellable Nonpure Complexes and Posets I and II. 

The dimer model is a statistical mechanics model which uses perfect matchings. A nice introduction to the dimer model is Richard Kenyon's Lectures on Dimers. However, these lecture notes focus on the bipartite case. One very nice result is Kastelyn’s Formula which is Theorem 2 of Section 3 in the lecture notes. For the general (non-bipartite) version of Kastelyn’s Formula see Rich Schwartz's notes. I find these sources easier to follow since they are written by mathematicians, but since you are interested in applications you may also be interested in sources written by physicists. Keywords combinations like "dimer model non-bipartite" and "dimer model triangular lattice" will bring up some relevant (and recent) results. I am also seeing papers on the "quantum dimer model." I am not familiar with this, but it might fit the bill for more recent applications. One of the more famous examples of using non-bipartite dimers is this article by Fisher which applies dimers to the Ising model. It is from the 1960s, so is not new, but it is a different application. However, here is a more recent paper on arxiv revisiting Fisher's work. 

I confess to being confused by all this $(\infty,1)$ category business, and the way $\Pi X$ is used as another name for the singular simplicial set of $X$. This is related to Peter's question on computations. I thought one reason for moving from loops or paths to fundamental groups or fundamental groupoids, i.e. taking homotopy classes, was that one could do specific computations in groups, and also groupoids. So I began in the 1960s to look for higher dimensional versions of these groupoid methods, again with the aim, or hope, of higher dimensional nonabelian calculations. Of course we were well aware of all the laws on paths, or singular simplices, up to homotopies, e.g. Kan extension conditions, but it seemed difficult to get computational information directly at the path space or singular complex level. What was surprising, and took a long time to realise, was that we could do these higher dimensional strict groupoid methods, using certain homotopy classes, for certain structured spaces, particularly filtered spaces (11 years), and later $n$-cubes of spaces (Loday) (17 years). In the filtered space work, the insights of model theory have also proved very useful - I think they have not yet been used in the $n$-cube situation. Grothendieck was amazed when I told him in 1985 (6?) that $n$-fold groupoids model homotopy $n$-types (Loday's theorem). Since we can use this idea for specific nonabelian colimit calculations in homotopy theory with the aid of a Higher van Kampen type theorem, I am happy as an old man to rest with the use of strict multiple groupoids of various kinds suitable for the problem at hand. Of course in the proofs, the relations between the weak (spaces of maps) situation and the strict one is crucial. I see these ideas as another contribution to the tool kit of algebraic topology, and some younger people are using them. It seems a useful, but not obligatory, test of a theory to ask if it can in some cases produce some numbers not previously available. February 25, 2015 Here is a link to a talk in Galway, December, 2014, giving further background to this answer, particularly in relation to the history of algebraic topology. November 8, 2015: Here is a June, 2015, presentation on A philosophy of modelling and computing homotopy types, which gives the background to using, for specific computations, some algebraic models of homotopy types in the form of strict higher groupoids. It is the strictness which leads to precise colimit computations in homotopy theory, generalising those well understood for fundamental groups. One construction these ideas have led to is a nonabelian tensor product of groups, whose current bibliography has 138 items, mainly by group theorists. Jan 21, 2017 Parts of the above mentioned presentations have been expanded into this paper; it also discusses the increasing use of cubical sets with connections, which have been little used so far in theories such as quasi categories, but which in some areas have advantages over simplicial sets. 

No we cannot conclude that $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic, and even when $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic it does not follow that $\{a_1, \dots, a_p\} = \{b_1, \dots, b_p\}$. Notice that if $A = K_p$, then $A[K_{a_1}, \dots, K_{a_p}] = K_{a_1 + \cdots + a_p}$. So, if $A = K_2 = B$, then $K_2[K_2, K_2] = K_2[K_3, K_1]$. Also consider $A = K_2 \uplus K_2$ and $B = K_3 \uplus K_1$, then for example $A[K_1, K_2, K_2, K_2] = B[K_1, K_1, K_1, K_4]$. 

In ScrewBox: a Randomized Certifying Graph-Non-Isomorphism Algorithm by Kutz and Schweitzer it is stated that "It is generally accepted that the incidence graphs of finite projective planes confront graph isomorphism algorithms with great challenges." Also the PhD Thesis of Schweitzer discusses difficult graphs (including incidence graph of projective planes) in section 2.8. I do not know any repository of adjacencies of these graph, but Moorhouse has data online for known projective planes of order 27 online. Also the paper of Kutz and Schweitzer as well as the thesis of Schweitzer both cite data that Royle has on projective planes on order 16 but that link seems to broken for me right now.

The most relevant parts of the book are Proposition 5.13, Proposition 5.19, and Remark 5.21. Showing the existence of a perfect matching is not expressible in $MSO_1$ can be with the same arguement on complete bipartite graphs $K_{n,m}$ outlined in Tony Huynh's answer. Also, it seems to me the example of a spanning tree with maximum degree 3 in Remark 5.21 can be modified to show that the existence of a spanning tree with maximum degree $k$ for some given $k$ in not expressible in $MSO_1$ (put more "leaves" on the graph in Figure 5.3).
