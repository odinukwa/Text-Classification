everyone, I want to ask is there any result in the literature similar to the following: Let $ X=\mathbb{P}^1\backslash \{0,1,\infty\}$, then $X$ is defined over $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $X_{\mathbb{Q}}$ denote the its generic fiber, and for any prime number $p$, $X_{\mathbb{Q}_p}:= X_{\mathbb{Q}}\times Spec(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ be the base change to $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Consider the global section of log differntial form $\Omega_{X_{\mathbb{Q}}}(log(0,1,\infty))$. It has a basis $\{\frac{dz}{z},\frac{dz}{z-1}\}$ , where $z$ is the standard affine coordinate. The result is : For any global section of log 1-form $\omega=a\frac{dz}{z} + b\frac{dz}{z-1}$, with $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$, one can associate a system of representation of algebraic fundamental group. More explicitly, for any prime number $p$, such that $p\nmid a$, or $p\nmid b$, then one has a nontrivial rank two $\mathbb{Z}_p$-representation of $\pi_1^{alg}(X_{\mathbb{Q}_p})$, where $\pi_1^{alg}$ denote the algebraic fundamental group, that is $$ \rho_{\omega,p}: \pi_1^{alg}(X_{\mathbb{Q}_p})\to GL_2(\mathbb{Z}_p). $$ It has the following property: (i): the restriction of $\rho_{\omega,p}$ to the geometry $\pi_1$ is an nontrivial extension of two trivial representation, so when restricted to geometry $\pi_1$, it will never be trivial. (ii): If one has a $\mathbb{Q}_p$-point of $X_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$, then the induced Galois represention of $Gal(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p/\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is an extension of trivial representation and Tate twist $\mathbb{Z}_p(1)$. I really want to know wether there is a trivial way to realize the above association. Thank you! 

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$. For an ample divisor H, we can define the slop of vector bundle with respect to $H$, then we can define stablilty of vector bundle with respect to $H$. However it might be possible that an $H$-stable vector bundle is no longer stable with respect to another ample divisor $H'$. On the other hand the famous theory of Uhlenbeck-Yau about irreducible representation and stable bundle implies that if a vector bundle has trivial Chern classes, then its stablility does not depend on the ample divisor. I wonder is there a direct proof of this fact without using Uhlenbeck-Yau thoery? A natural question to ask : does the statement hold in charateristic p case ( one may need some condition like algebraic closed field, the variety has $W_2$-lifting, etc.)? 

$\newcommand{\C}{\mathbf{C}} \newcommand{\D}{\mathbf{D}}$ Let $\C$ be a category with pullbacks. Taking any choice of pullbacks gives us re-indexing functors $f^* \colon \C /Y \to \C/X$, and these will be functorial in $f$ up to natural isomorphism, in that $g^* \cdot f^* \cong (f \cdot g)^*$. However, these will usually not be strictly functorial in $f$; that is, $g^* \cdot f^*$ and $(f \cdot g)^*$ will not be literally equal. Strict functoriality also requires that $1_X^* = 1_{\C/X}$; while this typically does hold on the nose, it’s still not automatic. My main question: Is there always some choice of pullbacks that make re-indexing strictly functorial? I believe the answer should be “no”, but I don’t know any counterexample. Even in the case of $\mathbf{Set}$, it’s not obvious whether there’s a choice that works. An equivalent phrasing of the question is: can the codomain fibration $\mathrm{cod} \colon \C^\rightarrow \to \C$ be equipped with a splitting? It can always be replaced by an equivalent split fibration over $\C$; but splitting the codomain fibration itself seems hard. 

Here is a basic technique in logic which seems well-known in folklore, but which I haven’t managed to find written down anywhere. $\newcommand{\T}{\mathbf{T}}$ Fact. Let $\Sigma$ be a signature (in the sense of predicate logic; i.e. sets of “function symbols” and “predicate symbols”, equipped with natural-number arities). Then there is a purely relational signature $\bar{\Sigma}$ and a theory $\T_\Sigma$ over $\bar{\Sigma}$, together with a translation from $L_\Sigma$ to $L_{\bar{\Sigma}}$ which is conservative modulo $\T_\Sigma$, i.e. $\varphi \vdash \psi$ over $\Sigma$ if and only if $\bar{\varphi} \vdash_{\T_\Sigma} \bar{\psi}$ over $\bar{\Sigma}$. The idea is to replace each $n$-ary function of $\Sigma$ by an $(n+1)$-ary predicate in $\bar{\Sigma}$, and axioms in $\T_\Sigma$ stating that this predicate is functional. Does anyone know a good citable source for some version of this technique? (This is closely related to taking extensions by definitions, which is well-treated in the literature. It is straightforward to deduce this from the standard conservativity results for extensions by definitions, but it’s not quite a one-liner.) 

Let $X_1,X_2$ be two smooth proper schemes over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, such that their reduction modulo $p$ are isomorphic as $\mathbb{F}_p$-schemes. Then is it true that the geometry etale fundamental groups $\pi_1^{alg}(X_1\otimes \bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p)$ and $\pi_1^{alg}(X_2\otimes \bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p)$ are isomorphic? 

Let $X$ be a compact Riemann surface, Hitchin-Simpson correspondence over $X$ says that irreducible representations of $\pi_1(X)$ one-to-one correspondend to stable Higgs bundles with vanishing Chern clssess over $X$. Now suppose we fix a representation $\rho$ of $\pi_1(X)$, then it corressponds to a stable Higgs bundle $(E,\theta)$ over $X$. Fix the underlying differential surface of $X$, but change the complex structure and obtain a new Riemann surface $X'$. Still by the Hitchin-Simpson correspondence over $X'$, the irredubible representation $\rho$ corresponds to a new Higgs bundle $(E',\theta')$ on $X'$. My Question is how describe the change $(E,\theta)\to (E',\theta')$ by the change $X\to X'$. For example we may just assume $E= L\oplus L^{-1}$, and $\theta: L\cong L^{-1}\otimes \Omega_{X}$, where $L^2= \Omega_X$. Then what is $(E',\theta')$? 

Let $\rho : G\to \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb Z_p)$ be a crystalline representation of $G=\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p/\mathbb{Q}_p)$. For any non zero element $a\in \mathbb{Z}_p^n$ , it spans a rank one $\mathbb{Z}_p$-submodule $L_a$. Now consider the subgroup $H$ of $G$, $H=\{g\in G| g(L_a)\subset L_a\}$. Does $H$ have finite index in $G$, i.e .$[G:H]< \infty$? 

F.Kato has a statement said that a log smooth curve $f:(X, M,\alpha)\to (k,N,\beta)$ where $k$ is an algebraic closed field and $N$ is some fine log structure on $k$, is equvalent to pointed node curve in a paper "Log sooth deformation and moduli of log smooth curves". I am quite confused with the log structure $N$ on k, when one associate a log smooth curve to a pointed node curve. Let's consider the following example, $X$ has only one double point $x$, and only one marked point $s$, and $x\neq s$. Let $A=k[t_1, t_2]/(t_1t_2)$, $U=Spec (A)$ be an etale neighborhood of $x$ , with $x= (0,0)$, we see that the log structure over $U$ is defined by the following $\alpha:M_U:=k^*\oplus N^2 \to A $ by $\alpha(k_1,n_1,n_2)= k_1t_1^{n_1}t_2^{n_2}$, and the log structure $N:=k^*\oplus \mathbb{N}$ and the map $\beta:N\to k $ defined by $\beta(k_1,0)=k_1$, and $\beta(k_1,n)=0$ for $n>0$. The map $f$ on the monoid is defined by the following $f^0:N\to M_U$, $f^0(k_1,n)=(k_1,n,n)$. On the other hand Let $B=k[T]$ , $V=Spec(B)$, be an etale neighborhood of $s$, with $s=(0)$. Then the log structure on V is $M_V:=k^*\oplus \mathbb{N}$ with $\alpha(k_1,n)=k_1T^n$. Now F. Kato claimed one extend $M_U$, $M_V$ to $X$, and define $M:=M_U\oplus_{\mathcal{O}^{\times}_{X}} M_V$, then $(X, M, \alpha)$ is log smooth over $(k, N, \beta)$. My question is how to define the map $f^0 : N\to M$ on the monoid? Over $U$, it is already given above. But what about over V, it seem that it is impossible to define such a map, for one need to satisfy the following relation: $ \alpha\circ f^0= i\circ \beta$, where $i: k\to k[T]$ is the natural map. And one fine that $\alpha\circ f^0(k_1, n)=i(0)=0 $ for $n>0$, however $0\notin Imge( \alpha)$, so it is impossible to define $f^0$. 

I've had difficulty finding sources which treat the classification of holomorphic disc bundles over (compact and noncompact) Riemann surfaces. Note that by "bundle", I mean a holomorphic fiber bundle, which means it is locally holomorphically trivial. I'm really just looking for information about holomorphic disc bundles, but if you want a specific question: What is the classification of holomorphic disc bundles over a Riemann surface? 

There's a paper of H. L. Royden "Holomorphic fiber bundles with hyperbolic fiber", Proc. AMS, Volume 43, Number 2, April 1974 which proves "Theorem: The holomorphic fiber bundles with hyperbolic fiber M and base B are in natural one-to-one correspondence with the homomor- phisms of the fundamental group of B into the group of biholomorphic automorphisms of M onto itself. " In other words, it appears that holomorphic disc bundles are naturally flat. Note: the first projection $p_1: \mathbb{B}^2\to \mathbb{D}$ of the real 4-ball to the disc is not a holomorphic bundle of discs, because it is not locally trivial. To see why, suppose we have an isomorphism $f:p_1^{-1}(D)\to D\times \mathbb{D}$ of bundles over a sufficently small disc $D$ of radius $r<1$ around zero. Write $f(x,y) = (x, f_2(x,y))$. Now choose $y_0\in p_1^{-1}(0)$ with $\sqrt{1-r^2} <|y_0|< 1$, so that it is sent via the second projection $p_2:\mathbb{B}^2\to\mathbb{D}$ outside the disc of radius $\sqrt{1-r^2}$. By assumption, $p_1$ has a section $s$ over $D$ passing through $y_0$ -- this is just a level set of $f_2$. Composing, we obtain $ h=p_2\circ s : D\to \mathbb{D}$. I claim $h$ fails the maximum modulus principle for holomorphic functions. Why? Any circle of sufficiently large radius in $D$ must be sent by $h$ inside a disc of radius strictly less than $|y_0|$ around $0$. Meanwhile, the center of the disc $D$ is sent to $p_2(y_0)$, which has norm equal to $|y_0|$. This goes against the maximum principle or the Gauss mean value theorem, if you like. 

On the local toposes themselves: $\newcommand{\Topos}{\mathbf{Topos}_\mathit{slice}}$one other in-some-sense-trivial example, if I'm not mistaken, is the category $\Topos$, with objects all (small, fsvo small) elementary toposes, and with maps just the geometric morphisms that are (up to equivalence) induced by slicing, modulo natural isomorphism. (If we wanted to cover our tracks a little, we could say “the geometric morphisms whose inverse image functors are logical”; the equivalence of this is shown in Mac Lane and Moerdijk in their chapter on logical morphisms, iirc.) But this is the universal example: any other local topos $\newcommand{\E}{\mathcal{E}}$has a unique-up-to-equivalence “local equivalence” $\E \to \Topos$, sending $A$ to $\E/A$, and any local equivalence into $\Topos$ must come from a local topos.[1] But local equivalences into a fixed category $\newcommand{\C}{\mathcal{C}} \C$, in turn, correspond (up to equivalence-over-$\C$) to functors $\C^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{Sets}$. ($F : \mathcal{D} \to \C$ corresponds to the functor taking $C \in \C$ to the set of isomorphism classes of objects of $\mathcal{D}$ over $C$.) Of course, there's a size consideration: whatever size of $\mathbf{Sets}$ we use constrains the essential size of the fibers. In terms of local toposes seen as categories in their own right, one point of interest is that you can interpret pretty much all the logic in them that you can in toposes (i.e. higher-order type theory; and geometric logic if you go Grothendieck-y)… except that of course you have to abandon the “empty context”, since you don't have a terminal object. (Everything else in the interpretation of logic is purely local.) In a local topos, there is no “global validity”: all truth is relative :-) [1] The uniqueness issues here are a little subtle: if I'm not mistaken we need to either assume (large) choice, or use anafunctors instead of functors, or restrict the size of $\E$ enough that each slice will itself literally be an object of $\Topos$. 

If $M$ is a smooth complex manifold and $N$ is a smooth complex surface, we may ask when a holomorphic map $f:M\rightarrow N$ lifts to a map $f:M\rightarrow [N:p]$, where $[N:p]$ denotes the blowup of $N$ in a point $p\in N$. The answer, which provides a universal property for $[N:p]$, is that the map lifts whenever the pullback of the ideal sheaf of $p$, i.e. $f^{-1}I_p\otimes_{f^{-1}O_N}O_M$, is locally free of rank 1 on $M$. In other words, the functions $x,y$ cutting out $p$ pull back to $M$ to define a divisor. Question: Let $M$ be a smooth real manifold and $N$ a smooth complex surface. When does a smooth map $f:M\rightarrow N$ lift to the complex blowup $[N:p]$? I believe it is true that the map lifts whenever $f^{-1}I_p\otimes_{f^{-1}O_N} C^\infty_M$ is locally free of rank 1 over the sheaf of $C^\infty$ complex-valued functions, in other words it generates a complex line bundle. I would especially like to know if this result appears in the literature. 

Consider $J^{g-1}$, the variety of degree $g-1$ line bundles on a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$. Recall that $J^{g-1}$ is a torsor for the Jacobian, thus has dimension $g$. We can produce elements in $J^{g-1}$ by choosing $g-1$ points $p_1,\ldots,p_{g-1}$ and constructing the associated line bundle to the divisor $p_1+\cdots+p_{g-1}$. In this way, we obtain a $g-1$-dimensional family of elements of $J^{g-1}$, forming the so-called $\Theta$ divisor. Elements of the $\Theta$ divisor may be distinguished from other points in $J^{g-1}$ by the fact that they represent line bundles admitting sections, i.e. $h^0(L)\neq 0$. For degree $g-1$ line bundles, the Riemann-Roch theorem gives $h^0(L)=h^1(L)$, so over $J^{g-1}$ we see that $h^0(L),h^1(L)$ are generically zero and jump along the $\Theta$ divisor. One might imagine that there are vector bundles $V,W$ over $J^{g-1}$ of the same rank, with fibres over $L\in J^{g-1}$ given by Dolbeault $0$- and $1$-forms with coefficients in $L$ respectively, together with a bundle map $\overline{\partial}:V\rightarrow W$ which is generically an isomorphism but drops rank along $\Theta$; then $\det \overline{\partial}$ would be a section of a line bundle $\det V^*\otimes\det W$ over $J^{g-1}$ which cuts out $\Theta$. This line bundle turns out to be a well-defined object called the determinant line bundle and it was introduced by Quillen. Quillen's construction of the line bundle proceeds by replacing the family of (2-term) Dolbeault complexes parametrized by $J^{g-1}$ by a quasi-isomorphic family of finite-dimensional (2-term) complexes and taking the determinant line bundle of this. The finite-dimensional replacement for the Dolbeault complex is given by the Dolbeault operator acting on forms lying in the first few eigenspaces of the Laplacian, roughly speaking. Then as we move along $J^{g-1}$, some of the eigenvalues may hit zero and we have a jump of $h^0(L)$. For a good list of references for the above, see determinant line bundle (nlab). My question: What is a simple, modern construction of the determinant line bundle on $J^{g-1}$, perhaps one which uses the tools of algebraic geometry? It may well be tautological from some point of view, in which case I would probably be unsatisfied. Also, if you wish to rhapsodize on determinant line bundles, please feel free. My motivation: Many of the classic papers by Beauville, Narasimhan, Ramanan etc. on moduli of vector bundles expend a lot of effort working with determinant line bundles and extracting information from them in quite ad-hoc and clever ways. I'd like to understand these better. 

(CW since this is just expanding on George Lowther’s comment to the question, which could really have been an answer in the first place; if George L wants to convert his answer to a comment himself, I can delete this one.) For any prime $p$, the Prüfer $p$-group is as desired. There are several constructions of this; a good one for present purposes is $$\mathbb{Z}[1/p]\ /\ \mathbb{Z}$$ i.e. rationals with denominator a power of $p$, modulo the integers. To see that this works, note that it is the union of the linearly ordered chain of finitely generated (indeed, cyclic) subgroups $H_i := \{ [a / p^i]\ |\ 0 \leq a < p^i \}$, over $i \in \mathbb{N}$. Now any element of $H_{i+1}$ not in $H_{i}$ must be of the form $[a/p^{i+1}]$ with $a$ coprime to $p$, and hence generates the whole of $H_{i+1}$. So any subgroup is either equal to some $H_i$, or else contains them all and is the whole group. On the other hand, the entire group is clearly not finitely generated since any finite set of elements is contained in some $H_i$. 

A student recently asked me about the status of a 2001 arXiv post, Beware of the Gödel-Wette paradox!, by Alexander Yessenin-Volpin (aka Esenin-Volpin and several other transliterations) and Catherine Christer Hennix. It claims to give a counter-example to Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem, which of course sets off the crackpot alarm. However, at least Yesenin-Volpin has done enough other serious and thought-provoking work (albeit more philosophy-of-maths than straight-up mathematics) that I am uncomfortable dismissing the paper without some consideration. I presume it either has an error, or works in a non-standard meta-mathematical setting, or in some other way does something weaker than it seems to claim; but it would be nice to substantiate this suspicion and find out which of these is the case. Has anyone read this paper carefully, and discussed/debunked it?
