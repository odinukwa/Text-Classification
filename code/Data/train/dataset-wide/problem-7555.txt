I may be showing my ignorance of category theory, but don't think this is true. Work on $l^2$. Let $\mathcal{A}_n$ consist of the operators $A$ satisfying $\langle Ae_i, e_j\rangle = 0$ if $\max(i,j) > n$ (so $\mathcal{A}_n$ is isomorphic to the $n\times n$ matrices). The direct limit of the $\mathcal{A}_n$ is the compact operators on $l^2$. Let $P$ be a rank one projection that is not contained in any of the $\mathcal{A}_n$, let $\mathcal{B} = \mathbb{C}\cdot P$ be the C*-algebra it generates, and let $\mathcal{B}_n = \mathcal{B}$ for all $n$. Also let $\mathcal{C}_n = B(l^2)$ for all $n$. All the morphisms are inclusion maps. Each pullback $\mathcal{A}_n\times_{\mathcal{C}_n} \mathcal{B}_n$ is zero, so the direct limit of the pullbacks is zero, but the pullback of the direct limits is (isomorphic to) $\mathcal{B}$. 

Hermann Weyl's delightful proof that for irrational $\alpha$ the sequence of values $k\alpha$ mod $1$, $k \in {\bf N}$, is uniformly distributed in $[0,1]$ deserves a mention. It's so simple I can summarize it here. First we check that for any nonzero $n \in {\bf Z}$ we have $$\frac{1 + e^{2\pi i n\alpha} + \cdots + e^{2\pi in(k-1)\alpha}}{k} \to 0$$ as $k \to \infty$. This is just a simple computation since the numerator is a geometric series. For $n = 0$ the displayed fraction reduces to $\frac{k}{k} = 1$. Since $\int_0^1 e^{2\pi i nx} dx = 1$ or $0$ depending on whether $n = 0$ or $n \neq 0$, it follows that $$\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} e^{2\pi i nj\alpha} \to \int_0^1 e^{2\pi inx} dx$$ for all $n \in {\bf Z}$. Setting $x_j = j\alpha$ mod $1$ and taking linear combinations then yields $$\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=0}^{k=1} f(x_j) \to \int_0^1 f(x) dx$$ for any trigonometric polynomial $f$, and by straightforward approximation arguments we get the same conclusion, first for any continuous function $f$ on $[0,1]$ and then for $f = \chi_{[a,b]}$. But with this $f$ the left side becomes the fraction of values $j\alpha$ mod $1$ for $0 \leq j \leq k-1$ which lie in $[a,b]$ and the right side becomes $b-a$, so this is just the statement of uniform distribution. 

I don't think this is a research question, but here you go. Treat the problem separately for each value of $y$. So we want a function $f(x)$ such that $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 1$, it increases to infinity as $x \to \infty$, and $\int_0^\infty e^{-yf(x)}\, dx = 1$. The function $f(x) = x^a$ satisfies all the conditions but the last, for any positive value of $a$. If you take $a \to 0$ then the integral goes to $\int_0^\infty e^{-y}\, dx = \infty$. So it's possible to get a value that's too big. On the other hand, if we let $f(x)$ go from $1$ to $\infty$ arbitrarily fast on the interval $[1,\infty)$ then the integral over that region can be made as small as we want. Whereas the smallest the integral can be over the interval $[0,1]$ is with something like $f(x) = x^a$ for $a$ small, so the integral is approximately $\int_0^1 e^{-y}\, dx = e^{-y}$ on that region. This is less than 1 for any $y > 0$, so by making $f$ grow sufficiently fast for $x > 1$ you can also get the total integral to be less than 1. Since you can get a value that's too large and a value that's too small, somewhere in between you can get exactly the right value. It should be obvious that if there is one way to do it there will be infinitely many ways to do it. I don't think there's going to be any nice formula though. 

The answer is positive if $X$ is second countable and locally compact, and $X/\sim$ is first countable (in addition to being compact Hausdorff). Proof: we claim that any point in $X/\sim$ has a neighborhood which is contained in the image of a compact subset of $X$. Given this, the rest is easy: use compactness of $X/\sim$ to find a covering of it by finitely many such neighborhoods and take the union of the compact sets whose images contain them. (This is Agol's technique.) To prove the claim, suppose it fails and let $x \in X/\sim$ be a falsifying point. Fix a countable base $(U_n)$ of $X$ (second countability) and wlog assume each $U_n$ is precompact (local compactness). By first countability of $X/\sim$, we can now find a sequence $(x_n)$ in $X/\sim$ that converges to $x$ and such that $x_n$ is not in the image of $U_1 \cup \cdots \cup U_n$. Since $x$ is contained in the image of some $U_n$, eventually $x_n \neq x$, so wlog we can assume $x_n \neq x$ for all $n$. Now let $C$ be the set of points in $X/\sim$ whose image is one of the $x_n$. This set cannot be closed, for then its complement would be open and $(x_n)$ could not converge to $x$. Therefore it must not contain some boundary point $\bar{x}$, and this point must map onto $x$. Finally, by local compactness of $X$ some $U_n$ must contain $\bar{x}$, which contradicts the choice of the sequence $(x_n)$. We conclude that the claim must hold. 

Hold on. The only restriction on $S$ is that $g$ and $g^{-1}$ are never both in $S$? It seems like all you're asking is whether the full group C*-algebra norm of an element of ${\bf C}[G]$ is ever strictly less than its $l^1$ norm, for elements satisfying the condition that the coefficients of $g$ and $g^{-1}$ never both nonzero. Surely that already fails for $G = {\bf Z}$ and $S = {\bf N}$? It's just saying that the natural map from $l^1({\bf N})$ into the disk algebra isn't an isometry. Edit: counterexamples verifying the minimality condition on $S$ are in the comments. 

Christian Remling pointed out that a counterexample to the original form of the question is given by $F: [0,1] \to L(H, \mathbb{R}^1)$, $F(t) = t\langle \cdot, e_1\rangle$, $v(0) = e_1$. Any continuous extension to a path $v(t)$, $t \in [0,1]$, will have $\langle v(t), e_1\rangle \neq 0$ for sufficiently small $t$, and therefore $F(t)(v(t)) \neq 0$ for small nonzero $t$. The question then was modified to require that $\|F(t)\|$ be bounded away from zero. In that case the answer switches to yes for $m = 0$ since then the rank of $F(t)$ must be constantly 1. However, it is no for $m > 0$ by a simple modification of Christian's example. Namely, for $t \in [0,1]$ define $F(t): H \to \mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ by $F(t)(w) = (t\langle w, e_1\rangle, \langle w, e_2\rangle, \ldots, \langle w, e_{m+1}\rangle)$ and set $v(0) = e_1$. Clearly the norm is bounded away from zero but any continuous extension to a path $v(t)$ will have $\langle v(t), e_1\rangle \neq 0$ for sufficiently small $t$, and therefore the first coordinate of $F(t)(v(t))$ will be nonzero for small nonzero $t$. 

Probably the most standard metric is Banach-Mazur distance, and there is indeed a theorem due to Amir which says that if the Banach-Mazur distance between $C(K)$ and $C(L)$ is less than $2$ then $K$ and $L$ are homeomorphic. There's also something called the Kadets distance which is basically a linearized Gromov-Hausdorff distance. I don't know what the Kadets distance says about commutative C*-algebras. 

Edit: sorry, there was a sign error. It should just be: $$f(x) = g(x) = \begin{cases} x^{-3/4}&x > 0\cr 0&x \leq 0. \end{cases}$$ Then $\lim_{x \to 0^+}f*g(x) = \infty$ and $\lim_{x \to 0^-} f*g(x) = 0$. 

First, here is a baby version of the question, that I already know the answer to. Consider complex Hermitian $4\times 4$ matrices of the form $$\left[\begin{matrix}a I_2&A\cr A^*&b I_2\end{matrix}\right]$$ where $A \in M_2(\mathbb{C})$ and $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ are arbitrary. Can any four real numbers $\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \lambda_3\leq \lambda_4$ be the eigenvalues of such a matrix, or is there some restriction? Answer: there is a restriction, we must have $\lambda_1 + \lambda_4 = \lambda_2 + \lambda_3$. The real question is: what are the possible eigenvalues of Hermitian $8\times 8$ matrices of the form $$\left[\begin{array}{c|c}aI_4&A\cr \hline A^*&\begin{matrix}bI_2& B\cr B^*&cI_2\end{matrix}\end{array}\right]$$ with $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}$, $A \in M_4(\mathbb{C})$, and $B \in M_2(\mathbb{C})$? Can any eight real numbers be the eigenvalues of such a matrix? (I suspect not. If they could, that would tell you that any Hermitian $8\times 8$ matrix is unitarily equivalent to one of this form.) 

Superselection sectors. A characteristic feature of quantum mechanical states is that they can be superposed. Schrodinger's cat can be alive, dead, or in some combination of the two states. But there may also be general principles which prevent certain states from being combined in this way. In elementary quantum mechanics, particle number is an unchangable quantity: an isolated system couldn't be partly in a state with one particle and partly in a state with two particles. We could tell how many particles there are in the system without measuring it, by counting how many particles are outside and subtracting this from the total number of particles in the universe. Similarly for charge. (Emphasize: I'm talking about elementary QM now.) Quantities like this produce "superselection sectors", orthogonal subspaces of $H$ which cannot be superposed. This means that certain observables are forbidden. In elementary quantum mechanics you could not have an observable with the property that the result of a measurement could be a state with an indeterminate number of particles. The mathematical condition is that every physical observable has to commute with the observable $N$ which measures the number of particles in the system. The relevant C*-algebra would not be all of $B(H)$, but only the set of operators which commute with some special family of observables (particle number, total charge, etc.) I put this example first because it applies even to the nonrelativistic, finite particle case that the OP cares about, at least if one wants to model a variable number of particles, say. Thermodynamic states. In quantum statistical mechanics, the physical description of a system can involve macroscopic parameters like temperature which correspond to inequivalent states on the observable C*-algebra. This means that the GNS representations corresponding to one of these states does not include the other state as a unit vector or even a trace class operator (density matrix). The Hilbert space formalism simply models different temperatures with different Hilbert spaces. In some sense this formalism still works, but it does not capture the idea that the same physical system can have different temperatures. The C*-algebra formalism does capture this aspect, because it is the same C*-algebra (a CAR or CCR algebra), being represented in different ways on different Hilbert spaces. Free fields in curved spacetime. We do not have a good mathematical theory of quantum mechanics plus general relativity, but we do have a good understanding of noninteracting quantum fields against a curved spacetime background. Phenomena like Hawking radiation can be understood rigorously in such a way, for instance. What happens here is that a single physical state may be perceived in radically different ways by different observers. In Minkowski spacetime, for instance, a ground state with no particles according to an inertial observer will be seen by a uniformly accelerating observer as a "thermal bath" of infinitely many particles --- a thermodynamic state of the type discussed in point 2. In this case there is a preferred reference frame, the inertial frame, but in general relativity there is no preferred frame. But, wonderfully, that there is a single C*-algebra (again CAR or CCR) that captures the observables for all observers and all states. The elementary Hilbert space formalism is really inadequate in this case.
