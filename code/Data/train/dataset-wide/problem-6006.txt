I generally take characters on shows to be a different instance of the same person, that is, the name doesn't matter, but in the context of the show the actor is that same actor but in the context of the parallel universe developed for the show. Let's use object orientated because that is freakishly easy notation for this problem. (Consensus Reality).(Wil Wheaton) portrays (The Big Bang Theory).(Wil Wheaton). So if someone asked me what character Wil Wheaton plays in the The Big Bang Theory, I would say "He plays Wil Wheaton" which is the verbal representation of the statement above in OO notation because context is reasonably clear from the discussion. For example, my name is Calvin. Moreover, the protagonist of my perception of reality is Calvin. So I have two Calvins. (Consensus Reality).Calvin and (Calvin's Perception).Calvin. In Consensus Reality, Calvin is portrayed by the same Calvin as in Calvin's Perception, so I would say that the credits of Consensus Reality could list Calvin as played by himself. However, there are certain differences. For example, (Calvin's Perception).Calvin was not born, but just slowly emerged into consciousness over time (due to the nature of memory). However, this difference can be reconciled by viewing these different Calvins as different instances of the same Calvin across multiple abstractions of reality. Or at least, that makes sense to me. 

I doubt it, respect is powerful, costs you nothing at least in a physical sense, and contributes to a global sense of well-being. If you are concerned you are not being respected, I don't think having less respect in general is the solution to that. 

I'll admit before attempting an answer here I had a bit of difficulty parsing this question, so let me know if I'm off-base. 

Governments optimize in their finite capacities (note I do not say resources, as governments may attempt to make provision for additional resources) according to some social utility curve. Generally this curve has safety on one axis and rights on the other. With absolute rights, you have no safety (right to murder, right to torture, etc). With absolutely no rights, you can provide complete safety. To me, the only legitimate criticism of a government operating under the charter of its people is that it is failing to reach any one of the infinite instances of Pareto efficiency, that is, it could provide greater rights with no safety trade-off or vice versa. Arguably, you could say it is selecting the wrong Pareto efficiency, but I would argue that this is a failure of representation and not of enforcement. In the case of Pareto inefficiency, the government should be held accountable for some mixed set of the crimes that it could've prevented or rights it could've afforded up to Pareto efficiency and then no others. It can also be held accountable for any sub-optimal conditions deriving from its own inefficiencies. 

Kindness is mandatory. The value of life is a function of its genetic similarity to myself. Rules are relative. 

As an individual that also places value on non-human life, the restriction to human beings seems relatively arbitrary. Moreover, the usage of brotherhood comes off as a bit chauvinistic. All equal in dignity, we're just also going to ignore the existence of women and non-binary transgender identifying individuals in the next sentence. Starting with these two targets, I worked to modify the statement. My personal adaptation would shift from usage of human beings to life. Fortunately, for extension purposes, life isn't defined exceptionally well right now, but definitely includes humans. Unfortunately, that opens up what should be a relatively straightforward statement to a certain degree of discussion. Oh well. That's why there's a whole stack exchange to discuss this issue. Likewise, I append consideration to dignity and rights. This has the purpose, in human systems, of also mandating treatment in excess of the minimum required, and in non-human systems, of acting towards other life in accordance with its specific conditions and needs. That is to say, when I take consideration of other humans, I give of my time and resources to others. When I take consideration of other life, I choose vegan dietary options such as do not harm others and respect eco-systems even at non-zero financial cost. Moreover, I can conceive of both Homo sapiens that may or may not be captured by the term "human beings" that lack reason or conscience and, for those reasons, should not be held to the same standards as other human beings. Likewise, with the extension beyond human rights, restricting reason and conscience to humans in particular becomes meaningless. For that reason, I developed a special class characterized exclusively by capacity for reason and conscience, and charged it with the implementation of my statement (as no other life would be capable of reading, understanding, and acting on it). I'm left with something that isn't really a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but, in my opinion, largely subsumes the Declaration, and also address broader and more difficulty issues with its provision for just treatment of non-human life. ================================================================================== As it stands today, I highly doubt the declaration would be applied to any non-human life, even that with reason and conscience. Historically, xenophobia always supersedes tolerance, especially in first contact. Without specific and intentional provision for rights of non-human life, I would expect no rights to be afforded. However, human is an open concept. As the Declaration refrained from usage of scientific terminology, currently we are working with (thanks Google!) the following definition: 

Hive-mind alert. Well ants do seem to demonstrate some form of hive-mind structure, so I'd say if they are conscious it would be unlikely to be the same sort of consciousness we're used to. Perhaps it should be called by another name, but it certainly (in my opinion) shouldn't be held to absolutely not be conscious, especially at colony level. 

Cost. Governments often struggle with funding and efficiency. Sterilizing 300 million people isn't cheap in the first place, but ensuring the 100% compliance required is even more difficult. And note, as more and more rights are afforded, cost of prevention increases. At a certain point, costs of enforcement grow greater than GDP and enforcement becomes impossible even in a 100% efficiency system. Conviction. Governments under the democratic paradigm are beholden to their people, many of whom value living out from under severe oppression associated with maximal enforcement. For example, many nations afford freedom of religion, which can make enforcement more difficult. However, I know I personally would attempt to emigrate from or overthrow the government of any nation I lived in that did not provide freedom of religion. These fear of overthrow or exodus limit the operations of government. Corruption. Governments, in general, must develop some form of enforcement agency. However, these agencies also need to be enforced, and tend not to want to enforce themselves. Of course, you can create an agency to enforce the enforcers... In general, this places practical limitations on enforcement. Enforcers need some level of power to enforce at all, then this power makes them more difficult to enforce. Providing less power requires more enforcers, etc. 

5.__Your choice to complain or not complain is irrelevant up to equal consideration, namely for that of the time of your judge and jailors. 6.__That question without a specific example is beyond the scope of this answer. As for "idiotic people," if someone is not endowed with reason and conscience they are not required to act in accordance with the precepts I outlined but therefore receive reduced protections under equal consideration, namely, they may have actions further restricted to prevent harm to themselves and others as is appropriate and reasonable. ================================================================================== I will now attempt to formulate a declaration in accordance with the examples for the question. 

I guess I'm struggling to see the difference in these acceptances. I believe a rational agent will always act in its own enlighten self-interest, which intrinsically accounts for any considerations that would be considered moral, as morality (to me) is simply a set of loose guidelines to facilitate the understand of actions from unenlightened to enlightened self-interest. So I believe a rational agent will always behave morally and a moral agent will always behave rationally. Likewise, any legitimate authority gains its legitimacy from its ability to facilitate a higher degree of possible enlightened self-interest within the confines of a group. If any members of the group suffer, then the group is not Pareto-optimal and therefore not legitimate. An authority would, for example, prevent tragedy of the commons but not force some members of a society into slavery to maximize global output (unless of course those members themselves still benefit due to the scale of the global gains). So I believe a legitimate authority will always incent moral and rational action. In case of following a rule that is not moral/rational, the agent is behaving arbitrarily and actions may be considered effectively random. Following a rule from a illegitimate authority, to me, is no different than behaving randomly. 

This is a pretty broad question. I'm just going to do a brief overview for that reason. Say you're at Diagon Alley and your tummy is making the rumbles that only Bertie Bott's Every Flavored Beans can satisfy. Since you're a wizard (in this example) you can throw on your invisibility cloak and take some without paying, or you can plunk down some hard earned cashmoney. Well, chances are however you make your cashmoney, you'd rather do less of that, and eat more beans, so all things considered, you'd certainly prefer not to pay. However, you may choose to pay anyway. What was that? Choose? Oh, so there is a choice. Granted, every choice is informed by past action. There's no denying that. However, whenever evaluating input to determine output, we must always make a choice. And this choices affect what additional inputs we receive and so on. Well, at some point, we hadn't really received much input yet. Then the worst thing happened and we were born, and we immediately gained agency and were able to affect our surroundings, even if only in the slightest from the beginning. So to me, our responsibility for our actions is seated with not just an individual actions, but the path through life we have chosen for ourselves and who we have decided, either intentional or unintentionally, to be. So in that extent, we are fully responsible for our actions, as we have more control over them than anyone and even, to some extent, chose our culture and environment. Certainly, other people can influence us, and change our mental state, but in the end everything is our own internal choice. ================================================================================== Wait a minute. Turing Hypothesis. Everything computable in nature is computable by a Turing Machine, which means you're computable by a Turing Machine, and Turing Machines are deterministic. That means all your choices could reasonably be determined at any time given sufficient information about the present state and computing power (in practice, the uncertainty principle prevents this but can have a divine agent build the machine for purposes of philosophy). So while you are making choices, they're really determined by all the bits and bytes or tapes and symbols or dendrites and axons and you're just along for the ride. ================================================================================== Well, you get to decide whether determinism and free will are compatible or not as there doesn't seem to be any great degree of consensus on that issue. I hold that all individuals are completely responsible for their actions because they are the only agents that pass the final decision on their own actions so all responsibility rests with them. To me, it doesn't matter whether this decision is deterministic or not. Good luck.
