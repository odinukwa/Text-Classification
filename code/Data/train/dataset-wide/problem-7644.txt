I have been trying to learn about congruence groups. Here is an example: \begin{eqnarray*} \Gamma\big(1+2i\big) &=& \text{SL}_2\big(\mathbb{Z}[i]\big)(1+2i) \\ \\ &=& \left\{ \left( \begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c & d \end{array} \right) : ad-bc = 1 \text{ and } \left( \begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c & d \end{array} \right) \equiv \left( \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) \pmod{1+2i} \right\} \\ \\ &\subseteq & \text{SL}_2\big(\mathbb{Z}[i]\big) \end{eqnarray*} While the proof is uses the theory of algebraic groups, we can prove that is finitely generated. This particular case is look elementary, these are $2 \times 2$ invertible matrices, $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a Eucliean domain, and we can solve $ad-bc = 1$ by finding two primes (e.g. $6+i $ or $ 2+3i$) and looking for their greatest common divisor. Since this group is finitely generated, how can I find a generating set? What are the generators? Even computer code would be helpful. 

The only projective curves I can think of are Riemann surfaces, which are often smooth and connected. The field $k$ could be $\mathbb{C}$ but possibly $\mathbb{Q}$ or a number field. My idea of a "bundle" is something with local trivialization and around each loop you assign an element of $G$; gluing copies of $U_i \times G$ with transition maps. Over a number field, perhaps we lose the analytic topology. The embedding theorem maybe says we can encode the gluing information using $n \times n$ matrices (a representation) and functorality says a map between schemes should "lift" to a map between bundles. So these moduli stacks should be spaces of $n \times n$ matrices with various restrictions. They may themselves form a variety of some kind (certainly a scheme). As you can see I am totally clueless. 

In a sense, calculus is all about the study of critical points of functions on flat space $\mathbb{R}^N$ (e.g. here). Let's try a different venue, the unit tangent bundle of the sphere. $$ T^1(S^2) = \big\{ (x,\vec{v}): x \in S^2,\, \vec{v} \in T_x(S^2),\, \big|\big|\,\vec{v}\,\big|\big|=1 \big\} $$ And there are other example of circle bundles over the sphere, such as tensor products of this bundle with itself. I was able to obtain on Math.SE a rather general result: cohomology of circle bundles can be found via the Gysin exact sequence. Can obtain this result via Morse theory? 

Uniformly random dimer tilings of aztec diamond region will have an "artic" circle appear in the middle. 

The surreal numbers in Combinatorial Game Theory only work for certain classes of games (e.g. they must satisfy normal play convention). This rules out even reasonable games with fairly well-understood scoring (such as Go). In that case, we approximate Go with a normal-play convention game where the last player to move wins and take the score of that (Mathematical Go: Chilling Gets the Last Point). Dots and Boxes have been analyzed using Nimbers. Can we analyze games of Connect-4? Is it possible to quantify the degrees of advantage for one side or another using surreal numbers? Here, whoever moves first loses so this game is a "number", if I recall, as the first move is not desirable for either side. What could be the value of this position? The reasoning could go: 

The expression on the right looks like a Mobius function for the divisors of $pq$. So I started trying other combinations to see if I got meaningful symbols. Using three variables: $$ \frac{G_p G_q G_r G_{pqr}}{G_{pq}G_{qr}G_{pr}} \equiv 1$$ Computer experiments showed this ratio always to be $1$. In order to fine more interesting behavior I found: $$ \frac{G_p G_q G_r }{G_{pqr}} \equiv \pm 1$$ And there is no reason to stop there since Mobius functions can be defined for any lattice using incidence algebra. In particular, the poset of numbers and their divisors. Is there a name for these generalized symbols, or are these trivial extensions of the original Legendre symbol? Finally, what is the rule determining the sign in the second example? 

My friend asks if traceless GUE ensemble $H - \frac{1}{N} \mathrm{tr}(H)$ can be analyzed. The charts suggest we should still get a semicircle in the large $N$ limit. For finite $N$, the oscillations (relative to semicircle) are very large. Maybe has something to do with the related harmonic oscillator eigenstates. The trace is the average eigenvalue & The eigenvalues are being "recentered". We could imagine 4 perfectly centered fermions - they will repel each other. Joint distribution is: \[ e^{-\lambda_1^2 -\lambda_2^2 - \lambda_3^2 - \lambda_4^2} \prod_{1 \leq i,j \leq 4} |\lambda_i - \lambda_j|^2 \] On average, the fermions will sit where the humps are. Their locations should be more pronounced now that their "center of mass" is fixed. 

Clarification, I'm using "Heisenberg group" to mean the group of upper-triangular matrices with real entries above the diagonal. I guess I'm trying to ask if groups like $$ \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & \mathbb{R} & \mathbb{R} & \mathbb{R} \\\\ 0 & 1 & \mathbb{R} & \mathbb{R} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \mathbb{R} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) \mod \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 & \mathbb{R} & \mathbb{Z} & \mathbb{Z} \\\\ 0 & 1 & \mathbb{Z} & \mathbb{Z} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \mathbb{Z} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) $$ are nilmanifolds. [there's no typo] And if all of them look like that? It seems one way to build a nilpotent lie group abstractly is to take a lie group and quotient out $G^{(n)} = [G^{n-1},G]$. 

Loosely related, there is a construction of the reals due to A'Campo of real numbers as "slopes" or "almost homomorphisms". 

In other words, every element is a reflection or the identity implies, $G = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$. Let's try to write down an approximate version of this exercise using little-o notation. 

The proofs of these results are very complicated. Is there a group action involed? Is there an interpretation via group theory of this inequality? Looks like there could be a hyperbola involved and that behaves well under fractional linear transformations like $x \mapsto x + 1$ or $x \mapsto - \frac{1}{x}$ in $\mathbb{F}_q^\ast$. 

The proof of the Wigner Semicircle Law comes from studying the GUE Kernel \[ K_N(\mu, \nu)=e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\mu^2+\nu^2)} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\frac{H_j(\lambda)H_j(\mu)}{2^j j!} \] The eigenvalue density comes from setting $\mu = \nu$. The Wigner semicircle identity is a Hermite polynomial identity \[ \rho(\lambda)=e^{-\mu^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\frac{H_j(\lambda)^2}{2^j j!} \approx \left\{\begin{array}{cc} \frac{\sqrt{2N}}{\pi} \sqrt{1 - \lambda^2/2N} & \text{if }|\lambda|< 2\sqrt{N} \\\\ 0 & \text{if }|\lambda| > 2 \sqrt{N} \end{array} \right. \] The asymptotics come from calculus identities like Christoffel-Darboux formula. 

In one variable try $\fbox{$ p(x) = \frac{1}{q+1}x^{q+1} - \frac{1}{2} x^2$}$ Then $p'(x) = x^q - x \equiv 0$, the derivative is identically zero. This function is not constant $p(0)=0$ and $p(1) = 1 - \frac{1}{2} \neq 0$. 

Have you read The Probabilistic Method by Joel Spencer and Noga Alon? Although originally developed by Erdos, here's an example of the probabilistic method taken from combinatoricist Po-Shen Loh: $A_1, \dots, A_s \subseteq \{ 1, 2, \dots, M \}$ such that $A_i \not \subset A_j$ and let $a_i = |A_i|$. Show that $$ \sum_{i=1}^s \frac{1}{\binom{M}{a_i}} \leq 1$$ The hint is to consider a random permutation $\sigma = (\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_M)$. Loh defines the event $E_i$ when $\{ \sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_{a_i}\} = A_i$. Then he observes the events $E_i$ are mutually exclusive and that $\mathbb{P}(E_i)$ is relevant to our problem... There are probably a lot of olympiad combinatorics problems that can be solved this way. Err... you were asking for number theory, but you will find both in Spencer and Alon's book. 

In A minus sign that used to annoy me but now I know why it is there, Peter Tingley shows how to build knot invariants from the representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2) $ quantum group by comparing it to a certain algebra of ribbons. This is to say the representation theory of this quantum group is "tangled" in some way. It is known that symmetric functions (characters of the symmetric group $S_n$) form a Hopf algebra. Is there a corresponding topological structure? I'm just wondering if there's a diagrammatic way to look at representations of Sn. In general, does Hopf algebra structure of a algebra, imply there exists a diagrammatic way of looking at its representation theory?
