Starting from the old price line, where the optimal consumption bundle is point $A$, we increase the price of $y$ to get the new price line. The Slutsky compensation says that we have to give the consumer enough extra income so that he can afford to old bundle ($A$) at the new price. Thus, we shift the new budget constraint out to the dashed line. The reason this "overcompensates" is that, taking the dashed line as the budget constraint, the consumer could afford bundle $B$, which gives him higher utility than he started with. 

From inspection of the utility function we know that the consumer is better off with more $x_1$ and less $x_2$, so utility increases in the direction indicated. Now we can pick an endowment vector (e.g,. $(2,4)$) and a relative price (e.g. $-p_1/p_2=-1$) and plot the price line: 

All of these factors seem to be important considerations in the UK market (which is, I guess, the example that motivated your question). Since we are talking about state-sponsored house building, here is a graph that shows how much of the slack private-sector housebuilders in the UK took-up when the state withdrew from house building in the 1980s: 

One possibility would be to use Wolfram Alpha. If I type the search phrase then the search engine returns the following: 

Those are a few of the most common ways in which a monopolist might be preferable to competition. I am sure there are others that don't come to mind right now. The main message is that you have to look at the specific market context to evaluate whether there might be any problems associated with intense competition. Most often the answer will be that there are not, and the usual assumption is therefore that monopolists are undesirable unless we have good reason to think otherwise. 

(Separating equilibrium) Type $H$ invests; type $L$ does not invest. If employers observe investment then they update their beliefs to $\Pr(H)=1$ and offer a wage of $\pi_H$. If they observe no investment then they update to $\Pr(H)=0$ and offer wage $\pi_L$. We can check that this is an equilibrium: type H's payoff is $\pi_H-c_H$. If he deviates to no education then his payoff is $\pi_L$, which is lower. Type $L$'s payoff is $\pi_L$. If he deviates to getting education then his payoff is $\pi_H-c_L<\pi_L$, which is lower. Thus neither type wants to deviate. The wage offers are (trivially) best responses given the beliefs because the labour market is competitive. Lastly, note that the beliefs are consistent with Bayes' rule and the equilibrium play of the game. (Pooling equilibrium) Neither type invests. The employer updates beliefs to $\Pr(H)=0$ if education is observed and offers wage $\pi_L$. The employer sticks with the prior belief of $\Pr(H)=1/2$ and offers wage $(\pi_H/2)+(\pi_L)/2$ if education is not observed. Let's check that this is also an equilibrium. Since education is costly but adversely affects the employer's beliefs in equilibrium, it is optimal for neither type to get education. Given beleifs and the competitiveness of the labour market, the putative wage offers are optimal. The belief $\Pr(H)=1/2$ is consistent with Bayes' rule if no education is observed (because this observation contains no new information about the worker's type). Lastly, Bayes' rule does not pin down beliefs in the event of (out of equilibrium) investment in education so, according to the definition of a PBE, we are free to specify whatever beliefs we like. 

At the point marked with a blue disc: the slope of the red line is $f'(x)$. The slope of the black line is $f(x)/x$. We can see geometrically that $f(x)/x>f'(x)$, or (after rearranging) that $f'(x)x<f(x)$. Thus, at the point indicated by the blue disc we know that $AP'(x)<0$. But at this point we can also see in the figure that $f''(x)>0,$ implying that the marginal product is increasing. Since we have a counter-example, we conclude that a decreasing marginal product is not a necessary condition for a decreasing average product. 

If one believes that such price growth is the consequence of a distortion in the market then it has important knock-on consequences for other aspects of economic efficiency: it encourages speculation and high levels of indebtedness, distorts investment decisions, and induces internationally mobile workers to leave the UK. As regional price disparities are magnified by rapid price growth, internal migration is also potentially distorted. If we care about equality then this kind of price growth also implies a growing wealth gap between property owners and non-owners. 

Suppose you produce a quantity $q$ where $p>MC$. This means that if you were to increase your quantity to $q+dq$ then your revenue would increase by $p\cdot dq$ and your costs would increase by $MC\cdot dq$. Since $$p>MC\implies p\cdot dq>MC\cdot dq$$ the result is an increase in your profit, so quantity $q$ can't have been optimal. Likewise, suppose you produce a quantity $q$ where $p<MC$. This means that if you were to decrease your quantity to $q-dq$ then your revenue would fall by $p\cdot dq$ and your costs would fall by $MC\cdot dq$. Since $$p<MC\implies p\cdot dq<MC\cdot dq$$ the result is an increase in your profit, so quantity $q$ can't have been optimal. 

There is a vast literature in both economics and marketing on advertising. Some highlights relevant to your specific question: 

Two remarks: Firstly, there is some research on subjective wellbeing, where a common theme is that people's happiness seems to depend more on a relative comparison of their material wellbeing to that of those around them than it does on their absolute level of material wellbeing. If two people share salary information then it will generally be true that one of the two will be subjected to the disappointment of learning that his/her salary is below that of the other. Since, in many societies, making others feel uncomfortable is in itself embarrassing, neither party is likely to be happy with this exchange of information. A more strategic reason: I would like my employer to think that I have a reputation for keeping my salary secret. Why? Suppose my employer expects that I will tell people about my significant pay increases. If my colleagues learn that I get a pay rise they can rationally infer that the company is able to pay its employees more. They might respond to this new knowledge by also demanding a pay increases. If the firm anticipates that giving me a pay rise means that it has to give everyone else a pay rise too then it will be more reluctant to increase my pay. Thus, I would prefer not to tell anyone about my pay rise. 

In footnote 3 of their paper "Patent Breadth, Patent Life, and the Pace of Technological Progress", O'Donoghue Scotchmer and Thisse take a discount rate of $r$ and write 

Three questions, but I think they are fairly closely related (in the sense that the answer to 1. might well also answer 2. and 3.) so I am asking them all together here. 

This tells us, for example, that there is a rouly 55% chance of a randomly selected individual being willing to pledge at least \$10. If we take 100 people then, on average, 55 of them will pledge. Thus, we can think of the vertical axis as being an indirect way of measuring pledge quantities, corresponding with the pledge level (or price) on the horizontal axis. If we swap the two axes, we therefore get something that looks very much like a textbook demand curve: 

To be a little bit more concrete about how economists know the measure is flawed, let's look at how economic theory helps us to set objectives and guides us in measuring our performance in a simple example. Economics as a body of knowledge suggests variables of interest to a policymaker. Suppose, for the sake of illustration, we are concerned only with maximising peoples' material well-being. We know that we can get a measure of material welfare by computing the area bounded by the general equilibrium demand curve and supply function. So, in an ideal world, we would just measure this total surplus and pursue policies that increase it. For a variety of reasons, this quantity is difficult to measureâ€”especially at the aggregate level over time. The 'next best' alternative is to use the economic model to tell us what variables influence this surplus, and then try to measure those variables instead. Obvious examples of such variables are income (which expands demand possibilities) and technology (which expands production possibilities). Broadly speaking, if income is going up and technology is improving then the surplus (which is what we are actually interested in) should also be increasing. It is important to keep an eye on both variables because the theory tells us that surplus can rise as income falls if, for example, technology is improving fast enough (just think about the extreme case where technology is so good that we can produce everything costlessly; then price and income would be zero, but surplus from consumption would nevertheless be very high). With this framework in mind, it is very natural to look at GDP and say: "This is a measure of income, which is a part of the picture. But it is missing another component (technology) that we know, from theory, is also important." 

The traditional graduate micro theory education develops the neoclassic a model of consumer choice along the two parallel lines: 

A relevant literature seems to be that on optimal stopping problems. There is a fairly technical Wikipedia article here and here's a book chapter. In economics, such models have been used to think about how sellers learn about selling opportunities, investment in R&D, and optimal labor search strategies. 

The treatment in Glicksberg's paper, though, does not seem very accessible. A good starting reference is more likely to be section 1.3 of Fudenberg & Tirole's book "Game Theory". 

Note that in the case where the market has distinct seller and buyer roles (e.g. an auction), 1. and 2. jointly require that any unsold goods have a price of zero. The term Walrasian auction is something rather unrelated. The standard classical model of supply and demand in a perfectly competitive market (i.e. the first thing you see in Econ 101) predicts price and quantity are set when supply is equal to demand. But how do we get there? Leon Walras proposed a thought experiment in which a hypothetical auctioneer called out prices and people made offers until the market converged on the prefect competition equilibrium. This hypothetical process is known as a Walrasian auction or, sometimes, Walrasian tÃ¢tonnement. 

As @FooBar notes in a comment, a pattern of decreasing income inequality is consistent with economic theories of convergence. 

I think good preparation could be to watch some analysis video lectures. Examples this I think are quite good include Su's lectures Feinstein's lectures These lectures have the advantage that you get to (repeatedly) watch someone doing proofs and therefore learn about the kind of axiomatic reasoning that goes into putting together the kind of results you see in your graduate econ books. 

Best price clauses and, to a lesser extent, price-matching guarantees have been the subject of intense regulatory activity in recent years. Here's a fact that is surprising to many, despite there being a significant consensus in the economics profession: 

Effect of relaxing assumptions This is obviously quite a stylised result owing to the stark assumptions of the model. But it makes a good foundation for thinking about some more realistic settings. For example: 

For each player in the game, compute their best response (i.e. profit-maximising strategy) to each possible combination of strategies by the other players. Then look for all situations in which every player is playing a best response; that is a Nash equilibrium. Guess a set of strategies that you think might be an equilibrium. Then verify that is is indeed an equilibrium by checking that no player could do better by changing their strategy. 

The reason I think this is relevant to your question is that we could reframe it as: "if we burnt the shirts [broke the windows] instead of giving them away for free, wouldn't that create work for a tailor and therefore make society richer?" I think the answer is no because, freed from the need to buy a shirt, people have more income to spend on food, educating their child, taking care of their health, etc. All of these things create jobs in the local economy to replace the lost jobs in the clothing industry. It is true that the tailors lose out at the expense of the farmer, teacher, or nurse. But over long time horizons people will adjust to this by training to do the jobs that pay. 

Ignoring producer surplus understates the benefits of a practice and will lead to the prohibition of some practices that increase total welfare. Firms are owned by people (i.e. consumers) so that the distinction between consumer surplus and producer surplus is, in some sense, a false dichotomy. We should give firms enough profit to (a) cover the fixed costs of operating in an industry and (b) ensure that they have an incentive to innovate and be successful. If we insist on maximising consumer surplus by driving price to marginal cost then neither (a) nor (b) will be satisfied. 

So, two perspectives on what is going on here: concealment of private information and exploitation of naive bidders. Both of these have one thing in common: they imply that Sniping leads to lower prices, not higher. So why does eBay persist in the use of such a mechanism? Only they know. But here is what I suspect: eBay is a two-sided market. It must attract both sellers and buyers. Usually, optimal pricing in a two-sided market involves subsidizing one side of the market to get them onto the platform before milking the other side. But buyers already pay $0 to eBay; what if a bigger subsidy is needed? One way to implicitly subsidize buyers and attract them to the platform is to choose a mechanism that results in a lower selling price. In the end, if the result is indeed to attract more bidders, this might not even be that bad for eBay. Bulow and Klemperer have shown that adding bidders to an auction is almost always more profitable for the seller than redesigning the auction but keeping the number of bidders the same. 

In other words, Romer is bemoaning the use of math to confuse and distract the reader, rather than to clarify and enlighten (as should be the case). I am not sure if this meets your needs, because it's more a problem with economists than with their method. Here is the paper: "Mathiness in the Theory of Economic Growth". The infamous accompanying blog post is here. 

The consequence for food producting is shown in the following figure, which shows an index of food production per-capita (source): 

Ordinarily, because people can substitute between renting or owning a house, the price of a house should broadly reflect its rental value (e.g. if it were much cheaper to rent than to buy then people would stop buying and start renting until prices 'equalised'). However, if a bubble is being driven by speculation on future house price increases then it is likely that house prices will become decoupled from the long-run rental value of a house. You can see what this looked like during the last housing bubble in the below figure. It can clearly be seen that house prices (the blue line) were not well-reflected by the owner-equivalent rent included in CPI. 

For micro, I would recommend McCloskey's Applied Theory of Price, available to download from the author's website here: $URL$ Read the opening section titled "how to use this book" to see why I think it matches well with your needs. Another intermediateâ€“advanced undergraduate level micro book in a similar vein to McCloskey is "Microeconomic Theory: Basic Principles and Extensions" by Walter Nicholson and Christopher Snyder. For an enthusiastic undergraduate looking to read more mathematical economics, I would recommend "Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics" by Alpha Chiang. Some commenters are correct that graduate-level economics can take you into some fairly serious topics in analysis and other areas of pure mathematics. But for now I think you would be better served trying to get a solid handle on the core tool set used be economists. In my view, Chiang is a great place to learn those toolsâ€”being a bit more advanced than typical undergraduate material, but not completely abstracted. 

We know that the two offer very similar foundations for a model of consumer choice, but that they are not quite equivalent. For one, any demand system generated by a rational preference relation will always have a symmetric substitution matrix, whereas the substitution matrix for a demand system based on WARP may be asymmetric. In that sense, the WARP framework is less restrictive. The usual goto discussion of this can be found in Chapters 1-3 of Mas-Colell et al.'s "Microeconomic Theory".
