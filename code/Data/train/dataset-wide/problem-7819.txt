This is the a first order question about real numbers, so it is decidable by Tarski's theorem. The analogous result for four dimensional vectors was only obtained in 2003; if you can get the answer for $5$ dimensions, it should be publishable in a good journal. I think this about as interesting a question as one can find which is definitely settleable in ZFC, yet still open. Most questions mathematicians care about are not of this form (and, in my opinion, are much more interesting). 

I am sure that the theorem you want is true, but I am missing one technical reference. Claimed Theorem: Let $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ be entire functions on $\mathbb{C}^2$. Then either $\{ f=0 \}$ and $\{ g=0 \}$ have a one dimensional overlap, or $\{ f=g=0 \}$ is discrete. "Proof": If $\{ f=g=0 \}$ is not discrete, then it has an accumulation point $z$. Suppose $\{ f=0 \}$ is smooth at $z$. Then, by the implicit function theorem, we can locally parameterize $\{ f=0 \}$ as $\{ (a(t), b(t)): t \in D \}$ where $D$ is a small disc and $a$ and $b$ are alanlytic functions on $D$, with $(a(0), b(0))=z$. Then the function $g(a(t), b(t))$ has infinitely many zeroes with an accumulation point at $t=0$, so it must be identically zero. Thus, $g$ vanishes on an open set in $\{f=0 \}$.` QED Now, the gap in the above is that $z$ might not be a smooth point. What I am quite certain is true, but I don't know a reference for, is that we have resolution of singularities for analytic germs the same way we do for polynomials. So, for any nonzero analytic function $f(x,y)$ and any point $z$, there is a neighborhood of $z$ where we can factor $f$ as $f_1 f_2 \cdots f_r$, each an analytic function, and such that $\{ f_i=0 \}$, near $z$, can be paratemerized $\{ (a_i(t), b_i(t)): t \in D \}$. One can probably prove this by brute force, but I'm sure one of our readers knows a reference. 

Yes. Let $\mathbb{R}^{alg}$ be the field of real algebraic numbers. This is a real closed field which means that, for any statement of first order logic, using the symbols $0$, $1$, $+$, $\times$, $=$, $<$, that statement is true in $\mathbb{R}^{alg}$ if and only if it is true in $\mathbb{R}$. The statement "The volume of $\mathrm{Hull}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is $V$" is a first order statement in the coordinates of the $x_i$ and $V$. Proof sketch There are finitely many simplicial complexes on the abstract vertex set $1$, $2$, ..., $n$. For each of these simplicial complexes, the statement that this simplicial complex is a triangulation of $\mathrm{Hull}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is finitely many polynomial inequalities and, if the simplicial complex is such a triangulation, then the volume of $\mathrm{Hull}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is a polynomial in the coordinates of the $x$'s. So we can encode $\mathrm{Vol}(\mathrm{Hull}(x_1, \ldots, x_n)) = V$ as 

Counter-example to (a). Consider the cone spanned by $(0,0,1)$, $(1,0,1)$, $(0,1,1)$ and $(1,1,1)$. This has generating function $$\frac{1-xyz^2}{(1-z)(1-xz)(1-yz)(1-xyz)}.$$ Let $\zeta$ be $(2,0,-1)$. If I have not made any errors, then the unique representation of this rational generating function using exponents in the half plane $\{ (i,j,k) : 2i \geq k \}$ is $$- \frac{x}{(1-x)(1-xz)(1-xyz)} + \frac{y^{-1} z^{-2}}{(1-x)(1-z^{-1})(1-y^{-1}z^{-1})}.$$ I believe that the corresponding two simplicial cones don't overlap, so the function $\phi^{\zeta}$ is $-1$ on the first cone and $1$ on the second. 

Now, let $V$ be the projective variety, for which we want to prove the result. By the key lemma, there is some polynomial $f_0$, of degree $r_0$, which does not vanish on $V$. Every irreducible component of $V \cap \{ f_0 =0 \}$ is of dimension $\leq d-1$. Apply the lemma again to these irreducible components to find a polynomial $f_1$, of degree $r_1$, so that every component of $V \cap \{ f_0 = f_1 = 0 \}$ has dimension $\leq d-2$. Continuing in this manner, we construct polynomials $f_0$, $f_1$, ..., $f_d$ such that $V \cap \{ f_0 = f_1 = \cdots = f_d = 0 \}$ is empty. Set $R=\prod r_i$. Our map $V \to \mathbb{P}^d_k$ will be given by $$(f_0^{R/r_0} : f_1^{R/r_1} : \cdots : f_d^{R/r_d})$$. By our construction, this map has no base points, and is thus well defined. 

I claim that, for given $(G, H_1, H_2, H_3)$, assuming that there is some $G$-extension of $k$, the answer to this question only depends on the characteristic of $k$. Proof: As a $G$-representation, $L$ is the permutation representation on $X:=G/(H_1 \cap H_2 \cap H_3)$. The question, then, is whether we can find $L$-valued functions, $f_i$ on $X$, such that $f_i$ is constant on $H_i$ orbits (but not for any larger subgroup) and $f_1+f_2+f_3=0$. This is a collection of linear equalities and inequalities in $3 |X|$ variables, with integer coefficients. So whether or not they have a solution depends only on the characteristic of $k$ (we are using that $k$ is infinite). To see that the characteristic can matter, take $G=S_3$, $H_1$ and $H_2$ two different subgroups of order $2$ and $H_3$ the subgroup of order $3$. You should get a solution in characteristic $3$, and not otherwise. Of course, answering the original question just means answering this question for all $(G, H_1, H_2, H_3)$ with $|G/H_i| = d_i$. (One can immediately make two reductions. First, a necessary condition is that $H_1 \cap H_2 = H_1 \cap H_3= H_2 \cap H_3$. Second, one can immediately reduce to the case that $H_1 \cap H_2$ contains no nontrivial normal subgroup. The latter means that $|G| \leq (d_1 d_2)!$, so the problem is finite.) I see no reason to believe that you will get a nicer answer by forgetting the groups and only remembering the degrees, but of course I haven't thought very hard about the problem. 

The intuitive argument is the following: Let $D$ be a local chart on your smooth surface, with coordinates $(z,w)$, and with $(0,0)$ the point being blown up. Let $\pi: D' \to D$ be the blow up, with $E$ the curve $\pi^{-1}{\large (}(0,0){\large )}$. Consider the intersection of $X_t := \pi^{-1} \left( \{ x = t \} \right)$ and $Y_u := \pi^{-1} {\large (}\{ y = u\} {\large )}$. When $t$ and $u$ are not zero, these are smooth curves, meeting transversely at $(t,u)$, so they intersect with multiplicity $1$. When $t$ becomes $0$, $X_0$ splits up into two pieces $X' \cup E$. For $u$ nonzero, $Y_u$ misses $E$ and meets $X'$ transversely, so the intersection is still $1$. Similarly, $Y_0 = E \cup Y'$. Now, let $t=u=0$. We want to compute $$\langle X_0, Y_0 \rangle = \langle X'+E,\ Y'+E \rangle = \langle X', Y' \rangle + \langle X', E \rangle + \langle E, Y' \rangle + \langle E, E \rangle.$$ By continuity, the left hand side should be $1$. $X_0$ and $Y_0$ miss each other, and $E$ meets $X_0$ and $Y_0$ transversely. We get $$1 = 0 + 1 + 1 + \langle E, E \rangle$$ so $$ \langle E,E \rangle = -1.$$ 

Here's another proof: Let $L/F$ be a cyclic extension of degree $4$, in characteristic $\neq 2$. Let $K$ be the intermediate extension of degree $2$. Then I claim there is an element $u$ of $K$ with $N_{K/F}(u)=-1$. Proof of Claim: Let $\sigma$ be a generator for $\mathrm{Gal}(L/F)$. Let $L=K(\sqrt{b})$; choose a particular square root of $b$, in $L$, to denote by $\sqrt{b}$. Let $\sigma(\sqrt{b}) = u \sqrt{b}$. Note that $- \sqrt{b} = \sigma^2 (\sqrt{b}) = u \sigma(u) \sqrt{b}$, so $u \sigma(u) = -1$. Applying $\sigma$ to this last relation, we also have $\sigma(u) \sigma^2(u) = -1$ so $u = \sigma^2(u)$ and $u$ is in $K$. Then $u \sigma(u) = N_{K/F}(u) = -1$. QED Why is this relevant? It shows that we can't have a real place of $F$ become complex in $K$ as, otherwise, all norms from $K$ to $F$ would be positive. In particular, let $L/\mathbb{Q}$ has Galois group the quaternion $8$ group. Let $K$ be the biquadratic subfield of $L$, with $F_1$, $F_2$ and $F_3$ the quadratic subfields of $K$. At least one of the $F_i$ must be real. If $K$ is not totally real, then the tower $L/K/F_i$ violates the claim. 

Now, recall the following criterion for a word to be reduced: Let $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_N$, be any sequence of elements of $S$. 

I think the clearest write up is in Danilov and Koshevoy. Let me try to get you off on the right foot by explaining what it is we are proving. RSK (for these purposes) is a bijection between $n \times n$ nonnegative integer matrices and pairs of SSYT of the same shape, filled with entries from $1$ to $n$. By the bijection between SSYT and Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, this is the same as pairs of GT-patterns of size $n$ with the same bottom row. Remember that a GT-pattern is a triangular array of numbers so, if we glue these two GT-patterns together along their common entries, we get a square. Thus, we have encoded both sides of the RSK correspondence as $n \times n$ arrays of integers obeying certain inequalities. On one side, the inequality is that the entries are nonnegative, on the other side we have the GT inequalities. Then the key facts are the following: 

The regular $n$-simplex has $n+1$ vertices. Other than that typo, you are right. The lattice $A_n$ can be embedded into $\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$, where $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ has the standard norm, and $A_n$ is the rank $n$ sublattice where the coordinates sum to zero. Now, inside $\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$, the $n+1$ basis vectors are clearly the vertices of a regular simplex. Translating $e_{n+1}$ to the origin gives another regular simplex with vertices at $0$, $e_1-e_{n+1}$, $e_2-e_{n+1}$, ..., $e_n-e_{n+1}$. The lattice this simplex generates is $A_n$. Your question is simply asking about this construction without mentioning the ambient $n+1$ space. 

For $x$ sufficiently large, the sum in question is decreasing. First, note that this sum is equal to $$\sum_{k \geq 1} \frac{(\log x)^{k-1}}{x k! \zeta(k+1)}.$$ (See here for a very similar series; we are using the highly nontrivial identity $\sum \mu(i)/i=0$ to get rid of the "$k=0$" term.) Substituting $x=e^u$, we want to know whether or not $$e^{-u} \sum_{k \geq 1} \frac{u^{k-1}}{k! \zeta(k+1)}$$ is increasing or decreasing in $u$. One can justify taking term by term derivatives, so we want to know whether $$e^{-u} \left( \sum_{k \geq 2} \frac{(k-1) u^{k-2}}{k! \zeta(k+1)} - \sum_{k \geq 1} \frac{u^{k-1}}{k! \zeta(k+1)} \right)$$ is positive or negative. Rearranging terms, we are interested in the sign of $$e^{-u} \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \frac{u^{\ell}}{\ell!} \left( \frac{ 1}{(\ell+2) \zeta(\ell+3)} - \frac{1}{(\ell+1) \zeta(\ell+2)} \right).$$ The quantity in parenthesis is $-1/(\ell+1)(\ell+2) + O(2^{- \ell})$. So we are interested in the sign of $$e^{-u} \left( - \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \frac{u^{\ell}}{(\ell+2)!} + \sum O(\frac{ u^{\ell} 2^{- \ell}}{\ell !}) \right) =$$ $$e^{-u} \left( - \frac{e^u -1-u}{u^2} + O(e^{u/2}) \right)=$$ $$-1/u^2 + O(e^{-u/2}).$$ This is negative for $u$ sufficiently large. 

Let me be more explicit about the last statement. Richter-Gebert shows that, given a collection $L$ of subsets of $[n]$, it is NP-hard to determine whether there is a polytope with vertices labeled by $[n]$ whose edges, $2$-faces and $3$-faces are the given sets. (Here $[n] = \{ 1,2, \ldots, n \}$.) Suppose we had an algorithm to decide whether a graph could be the edge graph of a polytope. Take our collection $L$ and look at the two-element sets within it. These form a graph with vertex set $[n]$. Run the algorithm on it. If the output is NO, then the answer to Richter-Gebert's problem is also no. If the answer is YES, then we have the problem that our algorithm might have found a polytope whose $2$-faces and $3$-faces differ from those prescribed by $L$. If our graph is $4$-regular, this problem doesn't come up by Kalai's result. But, not having read Richter-Gebert myself, I don't know whether the problem is still NP-hard when we restrict to $4$-regular graphs. However, even if Richter-Gebert's result doesn't apply directly, I find it difficult to imagine that there could be an efficient algorithm to solve the graph realization problem, since there isn't one to solve the face lattice problem.
