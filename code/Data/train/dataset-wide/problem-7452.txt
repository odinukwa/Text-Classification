The subcategory of spaces equivalent to finite CW-complexes is the smallest one containing a point and closed under finite homotopy colimits. (In fact, this is the universal homotopy theory generated under finite hocolims by a single object). Someone more patient than I could might fill in the details to make the following sentence both (i) sensical and (ii) correct: If $G$ is finite, the subcategory of $G$-spaces equivalent to a finite $G$-CW-complex is the smallest containing a point and closed under finite 'enriched' (weighted is probably the right word) homotopy colimits. (Here I'm enriched in $G$-spaces instead of spaces like above). The category of schemes is probably too ugly of a place to try and make a similar statement, but perhaps one of the many colimit-populated enlargements would allow you to make the statement that some reasonable enlargement of the category of schemes of finite type over $k$ is generated by a point under some allowed collection of colimits. (By the way, in the first two examples, honest compact objects are obtained by idempotent completion, i.e. adding retracts.) 

Suppose $D \subset \Bbb C$ with smooth boundary. Let $f \in C^{1,1}(D)$. Let $\varphi$ be the supremum of all members in the set $$\lbrace g \in C^{\infty}(\overline{D})| g \ is \ subharmonic \ and \ g \leq f\rbrace$$ It is known that $\varphi$ is subharmonic in $D$ and harmonic on $E =\lbrace \varphi < f\rbrace$, the complement of the contact set. It is also known that $\varphi$ is C^{1,1}. Suppose now that $\lbrace f_t \rbrace$, $t \in(0,1)$ is a smooth family of smooth obstacles. Will the variation of the family $\lbrace \varphi_t \rbrace$ be at least $C^1$? If this is too much to ask, then let $\tilde E \subset (0,1)\times D$, be the open? domain for which each $t-$slice $E_t$ is the set where $\varphi_t$ will be harmonic. Will the variation of $\lbrace \varphi_t\rbrace$ be $C^1$ on $\tilde E$? Any reference or chunk of information will be appreciated. I don't know almost anything about obstacle problems (but you know this by now :D). There seems to be no obvious reference out there. Can someone recommend something to a grad student who is faimiliar with the Gilbarg and Trudinger stuff but not much more? 

Here $H^*G$ refers to the integral cohomology of $G$ as a space. (Interestingly, the converse of this statement does not hold. For example $Sp(n)$ does not have $2$-torsion, though the coefficients of the highest weight are (1,2). This counterexample is given by Borel). You can check out his proof here if you're interested, but basically it seems like what he does is this: he computes the cohomology of each of the simple, simply connected Lie groups with coefficients that have the relevant primes inverted and proves the result by observation. Since the statement of the theorem itself has little to do with the actual classification of simple Lie groups, and morally should only rely on the fact that we can recover a simple, simply-connected Lie algebra from its root system, it seems natural to ask: 

Clearly, if one is given a $C^1$ sub-bundle $V$ of the tangent space of a smooth manifold $M$, wheather $V$ comes from a $C^2$ foliation of the manifold is decided by the conditions of the Frobenius theorem. Of course one can define a $C^1$ foliation of a $C^0$ sub-bundle $V$ as well. However the conditions of the Frobenius theorem are not applicable anymore since $V$ is not differentiable hence there is no good? notion of Lie product. Does anyone know of an analog of the Frobenius theorem for $C^0$ sub-bundles, or any result in this direction? 

An easy spectral sequence argument tells us that the natural map induces an isomorphism for every generalized cohomology theory... so that deals with everything modulo fundamental groups. In general maybe you have to ask for the degeneracies to be cofibrations, then this might follow from a model structure argument (the geometric realization would be a hocolim.) (The spectral sequence mentioned above is in, for example, Segal's paper "Classifying Spaces and Spectral Sequences.") 

Now I can tell you how to choose $m$ to get the $K(1)$-local sphere: it has to be a topological generator of the $p$-adic units. (Those following along at home just saw why my prime was odd.) If we think about Bott periodicity and stare at the formula a bit, it becomes clear that the $\lambda$th suspension, for $\lambda \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, should be obtained by taking the fiber of the map which, on homotopy groups, does $x \mapsto (m^nx - \lambda x)$. [Okay, it takes a little fussing to see this is the right thing to do- it helps to interpret $\lambda$ as a unit which is 1 mod $p$]. This fiber behaves like the $\lambda$th suspension of the $K(1)$-local sphere, and with it we may probe $K(1)$-local spaces and spectra $p$-adically. When $p=2$ there's a little more stuff you can probe with, but you get $2$-adic things as well. The general story All the stuff above is spelled out in Hopkins-Mahowald-Sadofsky's paper here. That's where they launched the program of computing Picard groups. As I said before, the Picard group of a symmetric monoidal category is the set of (isomorphism classes of) $\otimes$-invertible objects. These are good for indexing things like homotopy groups in all sorts of settings. Example. The Picard group of the category of spectra (home to cohomology theories and to stable homotopy groups) is just $\mathbb{Z}$ and you get ordinary homotopy groups. Same for $p$-local spectra. 

I recently came across a Dirichlet problem for a vector valued functions. In broad terms the problem is as follows. Suppose $\Omega \subset \Bbb R^n$ is a smooth bounded domain, $P:C^\infty(X)^n \to C^\infty(X)^n$ is a second order vector valued differential operator with elliptic symbol (in my case the second order part is just the Laplacian on each component) and $f \in C^\infty(\bar \Omega)^n$. Under what conditions does the boundary value problem $P(u)=f$ $u|_{\partial \Omega}=0$ have a unique solution for $u \in C^\infty(X)$? Clearly, to provide a weak solution one can still apply the Fredholm alternative to see that uniqueness guarantees existence. So then the obvious question arises: what guarantees uniqueness? In the scalar case, when the zero order term is negative this is automatic by a weak version of the maximum principle. But I don't know what is the analogous condition in the vector valued case. It would be nice to have a reference for these type of "PDE systems". 

Okay so I think the answer is that, yes, you can define such a functor. The main reasons are as follows: 

As far as I can tell, the idea to use filtered categories instead of just ordinal-indexed diagrams is due to Grothendieck. In fact, let me use this opportunity to advertise my favorite text on abstract category theory: ExposÃ© I of SGA 4. It rocks. Anyway: Proposition 8.1.6 (loc. cit.), which Grothendieck attributes to Deligne, says that every filtered category receives a cofinal map from an ordered set. Grothendieck remarks that, while this result says that the two points of view on filtered objects (general or ordered) are essentially equivalent, filtered objects arise more naturally. A nice example is Grothendieck's Theorem 8.3.3 on ind-representability. Aside from some set-theoretic issues, this basically boils down to the statement that exactness of a presheaf of sets $F$ on a category $C$ is equivalent to the category $C_{/F}$ being filtered. 

I recently learned from a knowledgeable person that for a Morse function $f: M \to R$ with a critical point $x_0$, one can perturb $f$ in such a fashion that the new function has the same critical points and the Hessian at $x_0$ can be arbitrarily arranged if the index is unchanged. I have managed to prove this result, but it would be nice to know a textbook where this result can be found, since I need to refer to it. I think people who know more Morse theory than I do can help out. 

I've been looking at various general strategies for proving that some category is triangulated, and Lurie manages to prove that a huge class of interesting examples of categories that we know about are triangulated in his book Higher Algebra (formerly DAG I-IV and VI).(EDIT: here's a link to the book) The trouble is that I am very new to this language, and so what he calls $\infty$-categorical notions that are basic and easily motivated' I see as foreign and unfamiliar. The part I'm really interested in is the proof of the octahedral axiom on page 24 of Higher Algebra. He builds a diagram using a proposition from Higher Topos Theory that seems completely out of context (to me!). The proposition says: ``Suppose we are given a diagram of $\infty$-categories $\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}' \leftarrow \mathcal{D}:p$, where $p$ is a categorical fibration. Let $\mathcal{C}^0$ be a full subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$. Let $\mathcal{K} \subset Map_{\mathcal{D}'}(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$ be the full subcategory spanned by those functors $F: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ which are $p$-left Kan extensions of $F\vert\mathcal{C}^0$. Let $\mathcal{K}'\subset \text{Map}_{\mathcal{D}'}(\mathcal{C}^0, \mathcal{D})$ be the full subcategory spanned by those functors $F_0: \mathcal{C}^0 \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ with the property that, for each object $C \in \mathcal{C}$, the induced diagram $\mathcal{C}^0_{/C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ has a $p$-colimit. Then the restriction functor $\mathcal{K} \rightarrow \mathcal{K}'$ is a trivial fibration of simplicial sets.'' And Lurie says that, in order to prove (TR4), we use this ``repeatedly to construct a map from the nerve of the appropriate partially ordered set into $\mathcal{C}$.'' (See Lurie's book available for download on his webpage.) Now, obviously this must be some sort of standard use of the proposition, but I would very much like to understand this one proof without reading all of Higher Topos Theory, so we have my question: 

I recently came across with $C^2$ Morse functions in my work and as I was reviewing some of the stuff I learned about Morse theory, I noticed that all the proofs of the Morse lemma I could come across with work only for $C^3$ Morse functions. A Google search was inconclusive about the existence of a Morse lemma for Morse functions $f: M \to \Bbb R$ with lesser regularity then $C^3$, where $M$ is a smooth finite dimensional manifold. A reference is perhaps the best possible answer, but any chunk of information will be appreciated.
