Everything I am writing below is carried out explicitly in Chapter III of Silverman's book on elliptic curves. In the earlier chapters, he defines the Picard group. For any curve over any field, algebraic geometers are interested in an associated group called the Picard group. It is a certain quotient of the free abelian group on points of the curve. It consists of formal sums of points on the curve modulo those formal sums that come from looking at the zeroes and poles of rational functions. It is a very important tool in the study of algebraic curves. The very special thing about elliptic curves, as opposed to other curves, is that they turn out to be in natural set-theoretic bijection with their own Picard groups (or actually, the subgroup $Pic^0(E)$). The bijection is as follows: let O be the point at infinity. Then send a point P on the elliptic curve to the formal sum of points [P] - [O]. (It is not obvious that this is a bijection, but the work to prove it is all "pure geometric reasoning" with no computations.) So there is automatically a group law on the points of E. Then it requires no messy formulas to show that under this group law, the sum of three collinear points is O. So for free, you also get that this group law is the same as the one you defined in the question and that the one you defined is associative! 

I don't know how to make a statement analogous to (1) or (2) for the fpqc (or fppf, or ...) topology. I don't even really have a feeling for the difference between these topologies. Is there an analogue of (1) or (2) or anything else "purely geometric" to hang my hat on? 

For a bit more info on question 3: if you are interested in the elliptic curve only as a complex Lie group, then when you identify it with C/L for C the complex plane and L a lattice, the Lie algebra is canonically C and the exponential map is the reduction mod L. 

The answer to question 2 as stated is no. Let $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p},\sqrt{-b})$, with $p$ 1 mod 4. By Frohlich and Taylor, p. 196, the fundamental unit group is generated by a unit from the real quadratic subfield. It then suffices to show that we can pick b so that K contains no roots of unity other than $\pm 1$. But the only possibility is that K contains a 3rd, 4th, or 5th root of unity, and so we just pick $b$ to avoid ramification at 2, 3, or 5. 

For simplicity, I'll just talk about varieties that are sitting in projective space or affine space. In algebraic geometry, you study varieties over a base field k. For our purposes, "over" just means that the variety is cut out by polynomials (affine) or homogeneous polynomials (projective) whose coefficients are in k. Suppose that k is the complex numbers, C. Then affine spaces and projective spaces come with the complex topology, in addition to the Zariski topology that you'd normally give one. Then one can naturally give the points of a variety over C a topology inherited from the subspace topology. A little extra work (with the inverse function theorem and other analytic arguments) shows you that, if the variety is nonsingular, you have a nonsingular complex manifold. This shouldn't be too surprising. Morally, "algebraic varieties" are cut out of affine and projective spaces by polynomials, "manifolds" are cut out of other manifolds by smooth functions, and polynomials over C are smooth, and that's all that's going on. In general, the converse is false: there are many complex manifolds that don't come from nonsingular algebraic varieties in this manner. But in dimension 1, a miracle happens, and the converse is true: all compact dimension 1 complex manifolds are analytically isomorphic to the complex points of a nonsingular projective dimension-1 variety, endowed with the complex topology instead of the Zariski topology. "Riemann surfaces" are just another name for compact dimension 1 (dimension 2 over R) complex manifolds, and "curves" are just another name for projective dimension 1 varieties over any field, hence the theorem you described. As for why Riemann surfaces are algebraic, Narasimhan's book explicitly constructs the polynomial that cuts out a Riemann surface, if you are curious. 

The genus g of a curve in P^2 is g = 1/2(d-1)(d-2) where d is the degree of the homogeneous polynomial that cuts it out. So you can't have a Riemann surface of genus, say, 4, sitting inside P^2. (This is in Hartshorne Chapter I.7, although you have to be willing to believe that complex Riemann surfaces "are" non-singular projective curves over C and "arithmetic genus" is "number of holes.") If you move to P^3, such gadgets do exist (you have holomorphic maps Universal Cover ---> Riemann Surface ---> P^3). But they're not going to be meromorphic functions anymore, since P^2 is special in that "meromorphic function" = "map to P^2." 

I don't think this is true. Any quadratic field can be defined by taking a root of x^2 = d. Your recipe, if I understand it right, would say to look at the polynomial x^2 - t over F_2(t). This polynomial is inseparable, so your hypothesis would imply that 2 ramifies in ANY quadratic extension of Q, which is false. As to the more conceptual question, I don't know of any results that explicitly define some canonical extension of a function field corresponding to any extension of Q. In other words, I don't think there's any way to talk about ramification of number fields in terms of inseparability of characteristic p extensions of function fields. If one sticks to function fields themselves and asks what ramification has to do with separability, the answer is that they are certainly not the same thing. 

If X is a smooth projective variety over the complexes, the etale topology "recovers" the traditional topology. More precisely, the category of sheaves on the etale site and the category of sheaves on the complex-analytic site are equivalent. (EDIT: I have led my friend astray! See below.) With just three words scare-quoted: The etale topology is (by "definition") the coarsest "topology" that makes the inverse function theorem "true." 

I recently tried to explain the fppf site to a differential geometer. I started with the etale site, where I had two motivating claims: 

No- even the process of iteratively taking the Hilbert class field, the Hilbert class field of the Hilbert class field, etc, need not terminate. See $URL$ 

My understanding is that they're named "Euler systems" because that "Frobenius acting on T" in the definition (line 4, p. 22 of Rubin's book) is an "Euler factor" as in Euler's product decomposition of the Riemann zeta function. The two easiest examples of Euler systems are the so-called cyclotomic units (not the roots of unity, but slightly more complicated, but still classical, beasts built out of them) and the elliptic units (built out of torsion points on CM elliptic curves). Not coincidentally, these are related to the only two types of global fields that we know how to explicitly construct abelian extensions of. Then there is Kato's more complicated Euler system of Heegner points [EDIT - This phrase was wrong- please see post below!], and Kolyvagin's Euler system of Stickelberger elements. All these are described in Rubin's book, but if you haven't seen them before, it might help to have more references. If group cohomology is still new to you, the cyclotomic units are the best Euler systems to start with, since you don't need Galois cohomology to define them. (Norm-coherent units map to corestriction-coherent cohomology classes under the Kummer map, which is why these global units form an Euler system in the sense of Rubin's book). Rubin's appendix in Lang's republished books Cyclotomic Fields I and II is easier reading for this. Rubin's Inventiones paper on the main conjecture for CM elliptic curves also contains a nice introduction to the technique. The application of Euler systems to number theory is the following: Euler systems allow us to bound Selmer groups of p-adic Galois representations. These generalize the Selmer group attached to an abelian variety, the ideal class group, and other objects of arithmetic interest. Bounding them is good because it allows us to prove Iwasawa Main Conjectures, which link the behavior of Selmer groups to p-adic L-functions and encompass basically every classical arithmetic tool for computing p-parts of special values of L-functions. Washington's book on cyclotomic fields explains this in the cyclotomic example, and the spirit and flavor of the general theory is the same. Coates and Sujatha's book Cyclotomic Fields and Zeta Values is also an excellent introduction to the Euler system technique in the cyclotomic setting. 

Here's an answer for line bundles. A flat connection on the trivial bundle is the same as a closed one-form $\eta$. The corresponding local system is the sheaf of logarithmic antiderivatives of $\eta$. What is the representation attached to a closed one-form? A loop $\gamma$ acts on a vector $v$ via multiplication by $\exp(\int_\gamma \eta)$. So a $\pi_1$ character gives rise to the trivial line bundle (with possibly non-trivial flat connection) iff there is a closed one-form $\eta$ on $X$ such that the character is given by integrating as above, and two arbitrary $\pi_1$ characters give rise to isomorphic line bundles (with possibly different flat connection) iff their quotient gives rise to the trivial line bundle. 

Let $G$ be a finite group. We define $r(G)$ to be the smallest number of relations possible in a presentation of $G$ with the minimal number of generators. If $G$ is a $p$-group, we can also consider "pro-$p$ presentations" of $G$ (using the free objects in the category of pro-$p$ groups); we write $r_p(G)$ for the smallest number of relations possible in a pro-$p$ presentation with the minimal number of generators. Does $r(G) = r_p(G)$? 

There is the etale Abel-Jacobi map as defined by Nekovar. (See page 28 of the paper below) $URL$ I have no idea - I don't know if it's conjectured, known, or known to be false - if this map provides a compatibility between the conjectures. 

Tate's famous "Endomorphisms of Abelian Varieties over Finite Fields," which proves the Tate conjecture in the finite field case, uses the full force of the theorem of bicommutation in a reduction lemma. As KConrad mentions in the comments, the result you've cited is the special case of this theorem where one works with the subalgebra generated by one element. 

By the inflation-restriction exact sequence this will be true when $H^1(L, G)^{\text{Gal}\left(L/F\right)}$ is trivial. The superscript "Gal(L/F)" there means to take invariants under an action you define by hand on $H^1(L, G)$. [EDIT: An old version of this post said "precisely when," which is not correct. Thanks!] This may not be helpful, since it sounds like your point is that you want to avoid working with direct limits. But I'd do that just by requiring that cochains be continuous. 

Iwasawa theory has its origins in the following counterintuitive insight of Iwasawa: instead of trying to describe the structure of any particular Galois module, it is often easier to describe every Galois module in an infinite tower of fields at once. The specific example that Iwasawa studied was the $p$-Sylow subgroup of the class group of $K_n = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{p^n})$. It's naturally a $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module as well as a $G_n$ = Gal$(K_n/K_1)$-module, but the group ring $\mathbb{Z}_p[G_n]$ isn't very nice; it's not a domain, for instance. If we instead look at the inverse limits of the $p$ parts of the class groups of all the fields $K_n$ at once, as modules over $\mathbb{Z}_p[G_n]$, we get a module over the inverse limit $\varprojlim\mathbb{Z}_p[G_n]$. This ring is much easier to understand; it's a complete 2-dimensional regular local ring that is (non-canonically) isomorphic to a power series ring, and there is a strong structure theorem for modules over this ring. Using this structure theorem, Iwasawa proved many theorems about the class numbers of cyclotomic fields. For a simple example: $p$ divides the class number of one of the fields $K_n$ if and only if it divides the class number of all of the fields $K_n$. There's an even bigger payoff to the theory: a profound connection with special values of $L$-functions. In the function field case, Weil had interpreted the Hasse-Weil $L$-function as computing the characteristic polynomial of Frobenius acting on the Jacobian of a curve. Iwasawa's idea was that the analogue for number fields should be the "characteristic ideal" of the ring $\varprojlim\mathbb{Z}_p[G_n]$ acting on ideal class groups. It turns out this characteristic ideal has a generator that is essentially the same as a $p$-adic $L$-function closely related to the ordinary Dirichlet $L$-functions. This was Iwasawa's "main conjecture" and is now a theorem. It implies the Herbrand-Ribet theorem and essentially every classical result relating cyclotomic fields and zeta values. There have been many generalizations since but it's safe to call an area "Iwasawa theory" if it studies some Galois representation ranging over an infinite tower of fields and connects it to $p$-adic $L$-functions. The most fruitful Galois modules from the point of view of $L$-functions seem to be Bloch and Kato's generalized Selmer groups; the ideal class group can be interpreted as a Selmer group, and so can the classical Selmer group of an abelian variety. There's a lot of current research in this area. To start reading, I recommend Washington's book on cyclotomic fields. Chapter 13 is fun and is a good use of some of the main techniques of Iwasawa theory. You don't need anything but the basic background in chapters 1-4 to read sections 1-4 of Chapter 13, which contain the types of theorem I was referring to in the first two paragraphs of this answer. The explicit computations in the first ten chapters also give the link to $p$-adic L-functions. If you know some algebraic number theory, you should be fine to read this book. I also strongly recommend Greenberg's PCMI notes on the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves, which you can find here: $URL$ If you're comfortable with class field theory, and have read the first few sections of Chapter 13 in Washington, then Coates and Sujatha's recent book, Cyclotomic Fields and Zeta Values, is a pleasure to read.
