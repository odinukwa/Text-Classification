This isn't quite a question from metaphysics (i.e., beyond scientific enquiry) but it is close to it and so therefore very difficult to answer - especially in "exact" terms. First of all, we can begin with a discussion of what you mean by "the Universe". Of course, by dictionary definition "the Universe" is everything, but it may be that we exist as a "bubble" inside a bigger Universe - the bigger Universe shares some common physical laws with ours but many physical constants (and hence behaviours) could be different and so that which we think of as "the Universe" might just be one little fragment. For instance, in the "eternal inflation" cosmology - which is highjly regarded scientifically, our "universe" is in a different quantum phase from an infinite surrounding universe - and there are an infinitre number of similar "universes" to ours. Alternatively, we could be in a sole Universe, which began with the Big Bang some 14 or so billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. But it might be that the Big Bang was the result of some interaction between some other physical aspects of a "higher" universe and so on... Designing experiments to test these theories is tough, though not quite impossible. But as of today the answer to your question is either "opinions vary" or "we do not know". 

When the Sun is on the meridian and is due South (local noon in Northern Hemisphere) your hour hand will point to (or close to 12) - assuming your local noon and civil noon are similar! (Daylight saving means 1pm fills this role). The Sun crosses the sky in 24 hours, the hour hand travels round the watch in 12 hours. Hence the watch hour hand is twice as fast, so when the hour hand has reached 2pm, the Sun has only gone half as far (ie "to 1pm"), so if you point the hour hand towards the Sun in this case, the meridian is an hour further behind rather than 2 hours. By the time we get to 4pm the Sun will have travelled "two watch hours" away from the meridian and so on. 

You are at the centre of the Big Bang. It happened here and here and here. In fact everywhere in the universe was the centre of the Big Bang. Think of it this way - if there was somewhere that exists now that wasn't at the centre of the Big Bang then that point existed outside space (a nonsense) or the Big Bang was not the beginning of space (and so not the Big Bang). Perhaps the strongest evidence in support of the theory is the cosmic microwave background which comes from all directions precisely because the Big Bang took place everywhere in the Universe. 

Yes, in the sense that there are some places that it would not be great to be - for instance if we were near the galactic centre we would risk being gobbled up by the super-massive black hole that is likely to exist there and so on. But spatially most of the galaxy is much like where we are, so it is not as though we are in a particularly special place. 

But this surely also implies that we can see beyond the CMB if we see anything which has a red shift indicating an expansion speed very close to $c$. This suggests axiom 2 is incorrect - so what should it be instead? 

If our universe is a 4-manifold (i.e. with every point in space-time already existing) does this imply that there is zero net energy (as net energy would do work and so change the universe)? If so, how do we account for the fact that our current experience of the universe is very far from net zero energy? Are there stores of negative energy out there? (Or, more likely, have I misunderstood this question?!) 

It's not possible to see photons from "beyond" the cosmic microwave background (CMB), because (assuming our cosmology is generally correct) the CMB is the result of recombination of electrons with protons in the early universe. Photons from before that era were absorbed in the plasma. Essentially then, the earliest matter we can see (in photonic terms) is this glowing hot hydrogen, but massively red-shifted so it looks like hydrogen at 3K. We see the CMB in every direction. 

Current models of the configurations of the planets conclude that Neptune once migrated outwards. AFAIK this refurbishment came about by Jupiter and Saturn gradually getting into and leaving a gravitational resonance. Did Neptune (and possibly a fifth giant planet) redirect itself in a sudden encounter event, like comet 67P Churyumov–Gerasimenko did in 1959, halving the perihelion of its orbit since then? Or did it happen gradually over maybe millions of years? Is planetary migration in general sudden or gradual? Is it a matter of a single encounter event, or an adaptation to a changing gravity landscape? 

So some asteroids not only oscillate between L4 and L5, between being trojans or greeks, but even go via L3, on the opposite side of the Sun? Are their orbits circular as Neptune's (in this case) or highly eccentrical? How could an object in the same orbit as Neptune have another orbital period than Neptune? Or how else can it migrate between L3, L4 and L5? And are "trojan" objects expected to gather in L3 too? EDIT: I'd like to add these illustrations because I think they illustrate well how a regularly orbiting object seems to "stay" longer at L3, L4, L5. (I'm not sure whether "jumping trojans" have some significant other characteristics, though). 

Besides radio, SETI is also searching for signs of artificial technology in data from infrared (space) telescopes. The idea is that civilizations make good use of energy, and solar energy is the most abundant and easy to access. Fusion power for free. Fissile elements are mostly inaccessibly hidden deep inside planets. If a civilization absorbs a substantial part of a star's light for its industry, the natural star light would be replaced by redshifted waste heat radiation from that industry. Something we should be able to detect with today's technology. Jason T Wright seems to be the one man driving force behind this kind of actual search today, within the SETI and wider science community. Here are some links to a talk, slides, a paper and a blog by Jason. Lots of galaxies have been studied, so at least it isn't common that civilizations extract most of the energy from entire galaxies. The universe might be too young for that. Personally, I fear that our focus on life and intelligence as we know it, expressed in the in my opinion naive Kardashev scale may miss that there might exist completely different kinds of phenomena out there. Life on Earth is all just one single instance. We have no diversity, no statistics, but we do know that the combinatorics of chemistry is mindboggling. But we can only do what we can do, and it would be a bit strange if there's nothing like us out there, considering how extremely ancient and successful DNA-life is on Earth, which doesn't seem to have unique circumstances. A problem might be that biology seems to use all tricks, except radio. 

The supermassive black hole in the Milky Way is covered by dust as seen from here. Is it common that SMBH's are covered in dust in their galactic disks? Would that dust absorb and disperse a jet from an active galactic nucleus, so that the atmospheres of Earth like planets would be protected? AGN jets build bubbles perpendicular to the galactic plane, but the jet could be oriented in any direction, right? The bubbles are shaped by general stellar winds from the disk, redirecting the jet streamed material towards the galactic poles, if I get that rigt. 

Among the asteroids 4 Vesta is the largest non-spherical object in the Solar system. But far out there in the Kuiper Belt is 136108 Haumea, and maybe yet undiscovered objects, that are very elongated. Haumea is 1,960 × 1,518 × 996 km. That's larger than the 960 km diameter Ceres and hardly spherical with 2:1 proportions. Its fast rotation and composition of malleable volatiles makes this possible. Maybe Haumea is "hydrostatically relaxed" without being spherical? Haumea images below from Wikipedia. 

Johannes Kepler proposed this order of matching planets with Platonics (I suppose because this order gives the best fit): Mercury <-- planet octahedron <-- Platonic solid Venus icosahedron Earth dodecahedron Mars tetrahedron Jupiter cube Saturn 

If a Kepler telescope were built to focus on one point source star at a time, would it provide more information, or did Kepler capture virtually every photon from any given star anyway? In order to study known transit events more closely one star at a time, to possibly detect moons or atmosphere or rings by resolving the transit light curve's shape better, is a larger aperture necessary or would a smaller field of view help? What field of view would be optimal for observing a single point source? 

The solar wind ram(dynamic) pressure is typically only ~1 nPa or $10^{-9} \ J \ m^{-3}$. This is highly variable and can change in milliseconds (e.g., interplanetary shocks), but that would still only be $10^{-6} \ W \ m^{-3}$. If we make a hand-wavy argument that this drops to zero in ~3 $R_{E}$ (i.e., upper bound on thickness of magnetosheath), then the power per unit area can be up to ~20 W $m^{-2}$. However, I would not read too much into that number as the actual power dissipated per unit area is different for numerous reasons. References 

Generally, waves with $f < f_{pe}$ experience damping as they propagate through a plasma. This is because the wave fields oscillate slow enough to interact with the particles, thus adding an effective inertia term to the system. ELF and VLF waves generally damp through cyclotron and Landau resonances. Note, however, that both of these resonances are also the processes responsible for wave growth in the presence of sufficient free energy (e.g., free energy from beams is often related to a Landau-like or Cerenkov-like emission). 

The properties of the terrestrial magnetosphere vary so widely, you would need to narrow down this question. For instance, the charge states are completely different (e.g., we observe $O^{1+}$ but not $O^{7+}$) but the number densities range from ~$10^{-2}-10^{3} \ cm^{-3}$. 

There is no net internal magnetic field to perturb, so how could one induce currents? The effect arises on Earth because some transient event (e.g., coronal mass ejection or CME) hits Earth's magnetosphere and causes a sudden $\tfrac{dB}{dt}$ which, from Faraday's law, results in induced electric fields. These induced electric fields then drive currents in things like power grids (typically long-distance wires running east-west at high latitudes), oil pipelines, etc. The only changing magnetic field would be that of the solar wind and the small, localized magnetic anomalies on the surface of Mars. However, these fields are incredibly small so the $\tfrac{dB}{dt}$ would be even smaller. 

Velocity The solar wind speed has a large range of variation, between ~250–820 km/s [e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Gopalswamy, 2006; Jian et al., 2011, 2014; Kasper et al., 2012; Maksimovic et al., 1998; Marsch, 1983; McComas et al., 2013; Schwenn, 1983; Stverak et al., 2008, 2009] near the ecliptic plane. These values are not including interplanetary shocks, which can have speeds exceeding 2000 km/s. The speed is generally higher at higher latitudes out of the ecliptic plane, tending to be over 650 km/s [e.g., McComas et al., 2008; 2013]. Number Density The number density also has a large range of values, from ~2–90 $cm^{-3}$ [e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Gopalswamy, 2006; Jian et al., 2011, 2014; Kasper et al., 2012; Maksimovic et al., 1998; Marsch, 1983; McComas et al., 2013; Schwenn, 1983; Stverak et al., 2008, 2009]. Again, these do not include interplanetary shocks or coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Charge State The alpha particle to proton number density ratio varies between ~1-5%, depending on solar cycle and solar wind speed [e.g., Kasper et al., 2012; Schwadron et al., 2014]. We have also measured the ratio of $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ and $C^{6+}/C^{5+}$, finding ~1-30% and ~20-200%, respectively [e.g., Schwadron et al., 2014]. 

We don't have any measurements near 1 AU that are at high latitudes. Some spacecraft have done out of ecliptic polar orbits with high apogees, but the heliocentric latitudes were still within ~$10^{\circ}$ of the ecliptic plane. The notes above discuss our only real measurements out of the ecliptic by the Ulysses spacecraft. 

In space plasmas, ELF is used to describe waves in the frequency band ~3 Hz to ~3 kHz. Very low frequency (VLF) is used to describe waves in the frequency band ~3 kHz to ~30 kHz. Generally the cutoff frequency of the Earth's ionosphere prevents waves at such low frequencies from freely passing through it. In plasmas, this tends to be any wave at or below the local electron plasma frequency, which can be approximated as $f_{pe} \approx 8.9787 \ \sqrt{n_{e} \left[ cm^{-3} \right]}$ kHz (where the $\left[ cm^{-3} \right]$ implies that the electron number density, $n_{e}$, should be in units of $cm^{-3}$). The densities in the ionosphere are ~$10^{3} - 10^{6} \ cm^{-3}$, which corresponds to $f_{pe}$ ~ 280 kHz to ~9 MHz. Early studies found a relationship between lightning and a VLF emissions called whistlers. It is now known that high energy electron beams, associated with the lightning, escape into the magnetosphere. These beams radiate the whistlers through a plasma instability (i.e., free energy due to a fast beam streaming through an otherwise homogeneous plasma). So the free energy sources can escape the lower atmosphere, but the electromagnetic emissions at such low frequencies cannot.
