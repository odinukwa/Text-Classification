Appendix A hardcore version of the theorem above would be uniform in the lower degree parts of $f$. Theorem? Let $f$, $g$, $P$ and $\mathscr{B}$ be as above. Suppose the polynomial $P^{-d} f(P x)$ has coefficients bounded by some fixed constant $C$. If the singular locus of $g$ has codimension $>(d-1)2^d$ in $\mathbb{C}^k$, then the number of integer solutions to $f(x)=0$ in $P\mathscr{B}$ is $$ C_{n,f,\mathscr{B}}P^{k-d}+O_{g,C}(P^{k-d-\delta}) $$ If for each $p$ there is a solution over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ with $|\nabla f(x)|_p \geq c(p)$, and there is a real solution $x\in P\mathscr{B}$ with $|\nabla f(P x)| \geq c(\infty)P^d$, then $C_{n,f,\mathscr{B}}\gg_{g,C,c} 1$. (Edit: corrected the condition at $\infty$.) The condition on $P^{-d} f(P \bar{x})=0$ just means that if $x\in P\mathscr{D}$ then $f(x)$ is not much larger than the leading part $g(x)$, so that the lower degree parts do not dominate too badly. The alleged proof is the same as the theorem above, but you push on through sections 5 and 6 of Birch's paper with $f$ remaining inhomogeneous. I have not checked this. Modern technology might give a neater proof. I should also mention that everything here would work for systems of several forms, with appropriate changes in the condition on the codimension of the singular locus. 

It sounds like you have a percolation problem. In percolation theory one has a lattice, typically in the plane or in 3-space, and each vertex is "porous" independently with probability $p$. The question is to describe the connected components of the set of porous vertices. It is common to restrict to a finite box, as in your example. One expects a similar behaviour to the Erdős–Rényi graph model, and there are many cases in which it is proved (although there may be less emphasis on the size of the small components). Edit: As Ben Barber points out in his answer, the techniques used are quite different to the Erdős–Rényi case, and one needs a much larger value of $p$ in order to expect a giant component. For some impressive-sounding real-world motivation one might imagine oil percolating through rock; it can only pass through porous areas, and the question is whether it eventually occupies a positive proportion of the rock (in which case one can drill into it and make some money). For many researchers the actual motivation is probably more to do with theoretical understanding of phase transitions. These problems are well studied, for example there are some introductory lecture notes here. On a casual inspection I cannot actually find an example where diagonal connections (cells connected only at their corners) are permitted, as in your question. Frustratingly I actually remember playing with a simulation of exactly your example in a physics lesson back in my schooldays. Maybe I can track it down. 

To Deane Yang, concerning the smoothness of geodesics. These issues have been studied by Hartman and his coauthors more than 40 years ago. Together with Calabi he claimed to prove that in a $C^{\alpha}$ continuous metric all geodesics are uniformly $C^{1,\alpha}$. (I do not have mathscinet access now, but I think the paper was called "On the smoothness of isometries", or something like that). The paper is not quite correct, the computations prove that geodesics are only $C^{1,\alpha /2}$ (this was observed at some point by Reshetnyak). The optimal regularity appears in my paper with Asli Yaman "On Hoelder continuous Riemannian and Finsler metrics" (I apologize for citing my own work). The starting point of all these computations is a metric characterization of $C^{1,\alpha}$ curves in metric terms (in terms of the distance of the midpoint of a pair of points on the curve and the image of the corresponding midpoint of the interval of the definition). It is contained in the work of Hartman, but is probably much older. To Sergei Ivanov: The questions of extendibility of geodesics have also been studied by Hartman. I again do not remember the correct reference, but can check it on Monday. I think he constructs example of even $C^{1,\alpha}$ Riemannian metrics, for any $\alpha <1$, that do not have extendible geodesics. (For $\alpha =1$, the metric has curvature bounded from both sides). Now the main point. I am very sorry and have to apologize for my previous short posting. I slightly misunderstood your question. But I hope that my answer was still correct. Is the following more detailed explanation correct? 

We assume that $t'>>t$ and want to prove that $d(\xi (t), \eta (t') )= d(\eta (t'), p) - cos (\alpha ) t + o(t)$. Here $o(t) /t \to 0$ and $\alpha$ is the "usual Euclidean " angle between $\xi$ and $\eta$. 

Morally, any first attack on Waring's problem (e.g. Chapter 2 of Vaughan) works here, but to be rigorous one might modify the argument on the major arcs. If you want to quote an explicit result I suggest Birch; Theorem 1 in Section 7 needs only cosmetic changes to yield the following result: Theorem (Birch) Let $f(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dotsc,x_k]$ have degree $d$, let $g(x)$ be the leading part. Suppose the singular locus of $g$ has codimension $>(d-1)2^d$ in $\mathbb{C}^k$. Let $\nu\in \mathbb{N}$ and let $\mathscr{B}\subset [-1,1]^k$ be a box of side at most $1$. For some $\delta>0$, the number of integer points $x\in P\mathscr{B}$ with $f(x)=\nu$ is $$ C_{n,f,\mathscr{B}}P^{k-d}+O_{f}(P^{k-d-\delta}) $$ If for each prime $p$ there is $x$ with $f({x})\equiv\nu$ and $\nabla f(x)\not\equiv 0$ mod $p$, and there is a solution $\bar{x}\in \mathscr{B}$ to $g(\bar{x})=1$ with distance $\geq r$ from the real singular locus of $g(\bar{x})=1$, then $C_{n,f,\mathscr{B}}\gg_{f,r} 1$. Take $\mathscr{B}=\frac{1}{2}\big[(\frac{1}{2s})^{1/d},(\frac{2}{s})^{1/d}\big]^k$ and $P= 2\nu^{1/d}$. If $\nu\gg_f 1$, $k>(d-1)2^d$ and $\sum P_i(x_i)\equiv\nu$ has nonsingular solutions mod $p$ then we deduce that $\sum P_i(x_i)=\nu$ has many solutions in your range. Why does this follow from Birch's work? That paper is about some degree $d$ forms $f_1,\dotsc,f_R$. But actually, after the introduction, we can take the $f_i$ to be general degree $d$ polynomials if we replace $f_i$ by its leading part in the following places: the definition of $f^{(i)}_{j_0,\dotsc,j_{d-1}}$ at the start of Section 2; the definition $V(\mu)$ and $V^*$ in formulae (2) and (3) of Section 3; the definition of $I(\mathscr{C};\gamma)$ in formula (9) of Section 5; and throughout Section 6. In Section 7, Theorem 1 we need to replace $f_i$ by its leading part in the definition of $V^*$ and in the expression $\Phi[f(\bar{x})]$. The theorem above is exactly this in the case $R=1$ of a single polynomial. The argument really does not change. A little thought to see that Lemma 5.1 is still true, that's it. 

Suppose a Lie group $G$ acts properly on a manifold $M$. Let $\pi: M\rightarrow M/G$ be the projection. One can construct a bounded, smooth "cut-off" function $$c:M\rightarrow [0,\infty),$$ with two properties: 

My question concerns a statement on page 12 of the following paper of Baum, Connes, and Higson: $URL$ about the definition of the $G$-index map from the $G$-equivariant $K$-homology group $K_0^G(X)$ to $K_0(C_r^*(G))$, where $X$ is a proper $G$-compact $G$-manifold. Suppose $(H_+,H_-,F)$ is a $G$-equivariant abstract elliptic operator on $X$ (defined on the previous page of the same paper), so that $H_+$ and $H_-$ are Hilbert spaces equipped with unitary $G$-representations and $G$-covariant representations $\pi_{\pm}$ of $C_0(X)$, and $F$ is a certain bounded $G$-equivariant Hilbert space operator $H_+\rightarrow H_-$ satisfying a list of conditions (page 11). One can complete of the subspace $\pi_{\pm}(C_c(X))H_\pm\subseteq H_\pm$ into a $C_r^*(G)$-module $\mathcal{H}$, as well as complete the operator $F$ into an adjointable operator $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathcal{H}$. It is then stated that "thanks to the axioms for an abstract elliptic operator (and the fact that $X$ is $G$-compact)", $\mathcal{F}$ is in fact a Fredholm operator. I'm looking for some clarification and confirmation on two questions (the first is more of a sanity check): 

Suppose $D$ is a Dirac operator acting on sections of a bundle $E$ over a manifold $M$, and define the Sobolev spaces $H^i(E)$ via the inner products $$\langle e_1,e_2\rangle_{H^i}:=\sum_{k=0}^i\langle D^k e_1,D^k e_2\rangle_{H^0},$$ where $e_1,e_2\in C_c^\infty(E)$. Then the closure $\overline{D}$ of $D$ is a bounded operator $H^1(E)\rightarrow H^0(E)$. When $E$ is a vector bundle, $H^i(E)$ are Hilbert spaces, hence $\overline{D}$ is guaranteed to have an adjoint $\overline{D}^*:H^0(E)\rightarrow H^1(E)$. More generally, when $E$ is a bundle of Hilbert $A$-modules over some $C^*$-algebra $A$, it is still said in the literature (see for instance part 1 of Bunke's 1995 paper on Callias-type operators) that $\overline{D}^*$ also exists, even though one knows that in general, bounded operators need not be adjointable. It seems to me that if $s\in H^1(E)$ and $t\in H^0(E)$, we have $$\langle\overline{D}s,t\rangle_{H^0} = \langle s,\overline{D}(\overline{D}^2+1)^{-1}t\rangle_{H^1},$$ and so it looks like $\overline{D}(\overline{D}^2+1)^{-1}:H^0(E)\rightarrow H^1(E)$ would be the adjoint, except that the existence of $(\overline{D}^2+1)^{-1}$ means that $D$ is essentially self-adjoint, which is true many cases but in general needs to be proved (and which is something that people often state after declaring $\overline{D}$ to be bounded adjointable). Question -1: Is the above expression for $\overline{D}^*$ correct when $D$ is essentially self-adjoint? Question 0: How does one show, without knowing $D$ is essentially self-adjoint, that $\overline{D}$ is adjointable? (Is there an argument using pseudo-differential calculus, for instance?) 

Just a side remark. Your question is very closely related to the question about the correctness of the first formula of variation. I have thought about that question and proved that the formula holds true in Riemannian manifolds with Hoelder continuous metrics in "Differentiation in metric spaces". I just hope that the above proof is correct. Other wise the corresponding statement in my paper is wrong as well. 

The statement about the uniform "smoothness" of geodesics, show that it suffices to prove the claim in the case, when $\eta$ and $\xi$ are geodesics (since the "usual" angles between $\eta$ and any geodesic between $\eta (t')$ and $p$ goes to $0$). Going on the geodesic $\eta$ first to the point $\eta (rt)$, with large, but fixed $r$, and then to $\xi (t)$, one obtains the right upper bound for $d (\eta (t'),p)$. In a "general" metric space it would be now difficult to obtain the right lower bound of $d(\eta (t'),p)$. One could do it, if one knew that the geodesic $\eta$ was extendible beyond $p$. Then one could use a traingle inequality and the distance from $\xi (t)$ and $\eta (-rt)$. I hope I understood your question correctly and this was what you had in mind. Here one can use another trick to obtain a lower bound. Observe namely, that from the "smoothness" of geodesics the "usual" angle between $\xi$ and any geodesic from $\eta (t') $ to $\xi (t)$ is very close to $\alpha$ (goes to $\alpha$ , with $t' \to 0$). Now we just look at the triangle $\xi (t),p, \eta (t')$ from $\xi (t)$ and not from $p$. The inequality obtained in point 3. above gives us the right upper bound of $d(\eta (t'),p)$. 

Part 1 of question: I've seen it implicitly written that the index of $D$ is unchanged by this modification. Why is this true (perhaps from a functional calculus perspective)? Part 2 of question: Is it possible to see that the index of $D$ is unchanged using the integral expression $$f(D)\psi = \frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^\infty D(D^2+1+\lambda^2)^{-1}\psi\,\,d\lambda?$$ For instance, if $D$ is invertible as an operator $H^1\rightarrow L^2$ (where $H^1$ is the first Sobolev space), with inverse $D^{-1}:L^2\rightarrow H^1$, can we write down an inverse for $f(D):L^2\rightarrow L^2$ using an integral expression that involves $D^{-1}$? 

It seems that the idea of the Higson compactification first arose in the context of non-compact manifolds in a 1992 preprint of Higson called "The relative $K$-homology of Baum and Douglas". It seems that this paper was either published under a different name or was not published; it's not on MathSciNet. Does anyone know where I could find a copy of it? Many thanks. Added question: in particular, I'm wondering if Roe's more abstract definition of the Higson compactification in terms of bounded continuous functions of vanishing variation at infinity is equivalent to Higson's original definition in terms of bounded smooth functions with vanishing derivative. More precisely, consider a non-compact Riemannian manifold $M$ as a metric space in the usual way. For any bounded continuous function $f$ on $M$, define the variation of $f$ at scale $r$ to be the function $V_r(f):M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}$ given by $$V_r(f)(x)=\sup\{|f(x)-f(y)|:y\in B_r(x)\}.$$ Then I'd like to know whether the set $$\{f\in C_b(M):\text{ for all }r>0, V_r(f)(x)\rightarrow 0\text{ as } x\rightarrow\infty\}$$ is the same as the set $$\overline{\{f\in C_b^\infty(M):|df(x)|\rightarrow 0\text{ as }x\rightarrow\infty\}}$$ where the closure is taken in $C_b(M)$ with the sup norm. I think it is clear that the second set without the closure lies inside the first set, but other than this I'm not sure.
