I think Probability and Measure by Patrick Billingsley is what you're looking for. It contains all of the topics you're asking about (except maybe spectral theory), and I feel it does a good job introducing the world of probability to the reader without assuming you already understand it, which Durrett's book tends to do. 

It's not a movie, but the creator of the show Futurama is a computer scientist and one of the writers is a mathematician. It has quite a bit of mathematics in it, and a new combinatorics result was even proven to resolve the plot of the episode "The Prisoner of Benda"! $URL$ Here is a website devoted to the mathematics of Futurama: $URL$ In case you can't tell, I like Futurama. 

Suppose I have a discrete-time Markov Chain (in an infinite dimensional state space $\Omega$) with Markov operator $P$, a linear operator on the space of bounded measurable functions on $\Omega$. (Or possibly some Banach space of functions, like Lipschitz functions) And suppose an invariant measure $\mu$ exists on $\Omega$, i.e., a measure such that for any bounded measurable function $g$ on $\Omega$, we have $$ \int_\Omega Pg \; \mathrm d \mu = \int_\Omega g \; \mathrm d \mu. $$ My general question is the following: 

Assume we have a smooth algebraic curve $C$ over complex numbers. Consider then all possible embeddings of $C$ into a smooth algebraic surface $X$. Here are two questions: 1) How many are there different such embeddings for fixed $C$ and $X$? (in moduli-theoretic sense) (I understand that this must heavily depend on $X$: type, algebraic structure etc. as well as on $C$). 2) Is there a way to characterize the divisor classes on $C$ corresponding to normal bundles of $C$ for various such embeddings? Here $X$ is still fixed. A generalized version of this question for $C$ fixed and $X$ varying in the moduli space of the type to which $X$ belongs is partially answered by Sasha below, where he chose $X$ to vary in the class of geometrically ruled surfaces. 

It seems that once you let your ball $B$ be large enough to contain $M$ with some its neighborhood $M\times[0,1]$, the question is about keeping the bottom copy $M\times \{0\}$ (boundary of $D$) fixed and deforming the top copy $M\times\{ 1\}$ to the sphere $S$. You can look at a compact surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$: choose an open disk on it and organize a flow outside of this disk so that it shrinks the complement of the disk to a point. This could be impossible to do if you want to deform staying always in $M\times [0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ but if you don't require this, it seems that it's easy. 

There is a popular game in current cellphones called Pixelated (in BlackBerry) or Flood-It (in iPhone) that has a very interesting analysis (its generalization is equivalent to the Shortest superstring problem): $URL$ $URL$ 

I was very surprised when I first saw that the product of all primes $p$ such that $p-1|2n,$ is the denominator of Bernoulli number $B_{2n}$. 

Given the $n\times m$ rectangle, I want to compute the minimum number of integer-sided squares needed to tile it (possibly of different sizes). Is there an efficient way to calculate this? 

Bulls and cows and its modern variant Mastermind, for which Don Knuth demonstrated that the codebreaker can win in at most five moves. Playing this game with pencil and paper (in a way where both players are codemakers and codebreakers) can be very fun. 

One way to generate random matrices while constraining it, is to generate its LU decomposition first. That way you can restrict it to be symmetric ($L=U^T$) and gives you the control over its spectrum. In [S.M. Rump. A Class of Arbitrarily Ill-conditioned Floating-Point Matrices. SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. (SIMAX), 12(4):645-653, 1991] there is a related method for generating very ill-conditioned matrices. 

Is there a well-understood correspondence between subgroups G of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ (not necessarily of finite index) and graded algebras of modular forms invariant under G? Given an algebra of modular forms (on the upper half-plane) known to be an algebra of forms M(G) invariant under some modular subgroup G can one reconstruct the subgroup G? (Possibly, the group G should arise as a deck transformation group for the covering Proj M(G) -> Proj M($SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))=(?)\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$)) arising from the natural embedding M($SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$)) -> M(G) .) (By the way, what is a good reference for general properties of Proj M(G)?) If this is not enough can we reconstruct the (modular) subgroup from the knowledge of its invariant algebras of p-adic modular forms? What can we say about the situation in case of discrete subgroups of $PSL_2(\mathbb{R})$? Do you know any papers considering the situation of fuchsian groups (structure of algebra of modular forms etc.)? Do you know any papers considering algebras of classical and p-adic modular forms for the case of subgroups G of infinite index in $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$? 

On a projective smooth variety $X$ over complex numbers (or rather compact Kahler) we have a specific set of sheaves, namely sheaves of holomorphic forms ${\mathcal \Omega}^p$ of various degrees. The cohomology $H^q(X, \Omega^p)$ of these sheaves "fit" together via Hodge decomposition into cohomology groups of our variety (manifold), which are of purely topological origin. Assume we have a sheaf $\mathcal F$ on $X$ (say, coherent, although I don't really know how relevant this is). Can we "fit" together groups $H^q(\Omega^p\otimes \mathcal F)$ "analogously" to Hodge decomposition (where we set $\mathcal F=O_X$) to get a purely topologically defined object (maybe originating now not from $X$ but from another variety)? If sheaves $\Omega^p$ do not work for arbitrary such $\mathcal F$, can we find their respective analogs $\mathcal \Omega^p_{F}$ to fit the corresponding groups together as it is suggested above?
