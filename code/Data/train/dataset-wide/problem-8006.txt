I am a novice, but just to start you off, I would ask myself what happens to the number of intersections when you deform slightly such a pencil? It seems if there are any tangential intersections or intersections through a singularity, that the number should go up. Thus if we start from a pencil with a maximal number of intersections, it seems that these are all transversal, and hence the number should remain constant under small deformation. Since all such pencils form a single "family", the generic one should have the maximal number of intersections. I would also try to gain insight from an example, such as the grassmann of lines in P^3. In general there is a standard (Plucker) embedding of the grassmann into projective space, and a hypersurface of degree one in the grassmannian should be one that is cut by a hyperplane in that embedding. Maybe you can use your ufd arguments to argue that every hypersurface is cut by some projective hypersurface for that embedding. It would seem to follow at least that every such pencil does meet every hypersurface. But I would start thinking about lines in P^3 and note that there it seems the only obvious hypersurface defined by a Schubert condition, is the lines that meet a given line. Then it seems this set has indeed degree one by your definition, since fixing a general point and general plane through that point, exactly one line in the given plane and through the given point, also meets the given line. Generalizing from this example should give a Schubert cycle - hypersurface in a general grassmannian which does meet your pencil in exactly one point. This suggests that your pencil is the right curve to measure degree. After seeing that every hypersurfce must meet your pencils, I would see if I can show that some such pencil is not contained in a given hypersurface. In the example case, take any line not representing a point in the given hypersurface and just choose a point on it and a plane containing it, to define a pencil not lying wholly in the hypersurface. Thus if every pencil meets a given hypersurface, and some pencil meets it a finite number of times, and the family of all pencils is irreducible, then it seems a generic pencil meets it the maximal number of times. 

In the case of manifolds with corners it is the content of Lemma 6.4 p52 of P. Michor's book "Manifolds of differentiable mappings". Edit1: In the case of manifolds without boundary, you can look at "Differential topology" M. W. Hirsch chapter 3. 

Maybe by looking first at homology $3$-spheres and in particular to Brieskorn manifolds $M(p,q,r)$: the link of the singular point $(0,0,0)$ of the hypersurface $$z^p_1+z_2^q+z^r_3=0$$ with integers $p,q,r\geq 2$. Milnor studied these manifolds in his beautiful paper "On the 3-dimensional Brieskorn manifolds M(p,q,r)". in: Knots, groups, and 3-manifolds (Papers dedicated to the memory of R. H. Fox), pp. 175–225. Ann. of Math. Studies, No. 84, Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, N. J., 1975. 

1) A $n$-dimensional homology manifold is a topological space $X$ such that for any $x\in X$, the homology groups $$H_p(X,X-x,\mathbb{Z})$$ are trivial unless $p=n$ where $$H_n(X,X-x,\mathbb{Z})\cong \mathbb{Z}$$ 2) A $n$-dimensional pseudomanifold is a topological space together with a triangulation such that 

Regarding your question on De Rham cohomology there are several approches to realize a De Rham complex that computes singular cohomology. A. In Algebraic geometry. You should look at R. Hartshorne "Algebraic De Rham cohomology" manuscripta math. 7, 125-140 (1972). It is a research announcement and survey on the cohomology of algebraic De Rham forms on algebraic varieties, details are published in the Publications of IHES (1975). In particular for a scheme $Y$ of finite type over a characteristic zero field $k$, he defines its algebraic De Rham cohomology. 1) You embed $Y$ as a closed subscheme of a smooth scheme $X$. 2) You consider $\Omega^*$ the complex of sheaves of regular differential forms on $X$ over $k$. 3) You take $\hat{X}$ the formal completion of $X$ along $Y$: $$\hat{Y}=\bigcup_n Y(n)$$ where $Y(n)$ is the infinitesimal neighbourhood of order $n$ of $Y$ in $X$ and consider $\hat{\Omega}^*$ the completion of $\Omega^*$. 4) You define $H^*_{DR}(Y)$ as the hypercohomology of the complex $\hat{\Omega}^*$ on the formal scheme $\hat{X}$. Then (theorem 1.6 of this paper) when $Y$ is a scheme of finite type over $k=\mathbb{C}$ we have a natural isomorphism $$H^i_{DR}(Y)\cong H^i(Y^{an},\mathbb{C})$$ where $Y^{an}$ is the corresponding complex analytic space and $H^i(-,\mathbb{C})$ is the singular cohomology. ............................... B. As stratified spaces You can use the fact that a complex algebraic variety is stratified, for example it is a stratifold in the sense of M. Kreck, then you have a notion of De Rham complex that computes singular cohomology with real coefficients: 

I am amazed by this idea, since to me the fundamental principle of problem solving is to make the problem easier, and i always assumed this meant making it more special. It is true that proving a theorem is easier by ignoring irrelevant facets, but these are only known after solving the problem. I find it is more productive in discovering which facets are relevant to do various examples, gradually trying to generalize the argument. Even Deligne proved the Weil conjectures first for K3 surfaces. 

As has been said, the main point is to give up the idea of communicating your actual research topic. Even job seekers giving colloquium talks should usually not attempt this. The best such talks instead teach the audience, even mathematicians, the simplest underlying ideas of their subject, and only mention the direction of their own work in the last few minutes or so. When discussing infinity with laypersons, I have often used "Hilbert's hotel", in which the infinitely many rooms are all full when another guest arrives. Everyone moves up one room and the new guest goes in room 1, thus showing that infinity plus 1 equals infinity, (as a cardinal). The audience easily figures out how to add 2 new guests or a thousand. Next ask them how to deal with an infinite sequence of new guests, which if course may be all placed in the odd numbered rooms, as the current guests each move from room n to room 2n. When teaching topology I asked how to tell if an invisible butterfly net actually enclosed the butterfly, by looking at the winding behavior of the visible border of the net. when discussing higher dimensions, it is easy to get people to eventually visualize a 4 dimensional sphere as a family of three dimensional spherical slices, by starting with lower dimensional cases. Noting that one can escape a circle in the plane by jumping over it in three dimensions, point out that if one goes back in time, before the building one is in was built, one can escape a three dimensional room without breaking down the walls or opening the doors. You will enjoy thinking about your favorite fundamental idea underlying your area. edit: To convey the idea that knowing "how many" differs from knowing when two sets are "equipotent", I used the example of the cyclops in Ulysses, who knew when all his sheep were back in the cave, by matching them up one to one with a pile of rocks. Nonetheless he did not know "how many" sheep he had. I.e. "what number?" differs from "same number". 

Andres Angel has written some papers on this subject, what I know is a preprint entitled "Orbifold cobordism" where he computes some orbifold cobordism rings in terms of bordism groups of classifying spaces of groups. Papers available here: $URL$ 

Let me use the normalized LS i.e.: $Cat_{LS}(S^n)=1$. By definition $Cat_{LS}(X)=0$ is equivalent to $X$ contractible. And $Cat_{LS}(X)=1$ corresponds to the case in which $X$ is a co-Hspace. This follows from the characterization of LS-category in terms of factorization of the iterated diagonal: let $X$ be a connected CW-complex then $Cat_{LS}(X)\leq n$ if and only if the iterated diagonal map $X\rightarrow X^{n+1}$ factors through the fat wedge $T^{n+1}(X)$. I think you will find a proof of this result in many places ("Lusternik-Schnirelmann Category" by Cornea, Lupton, Oprea and Tanré). You can also have a look at James'paper: "Category,in the sense of Lusternik-Schnirelmann" Topology. Vol. 17. pp.331-343 1978. LS-category of Lie groups is difficult to compute for example: $Cat_{LS}(SU(n))=n-1$ (Singhof). We also know that $Cat_{LS}(Sp(3))=5$ (Fernández-Suárez; Gómez-Tato; Strom; Tanré "The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $\rm Sp(3)$" Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 132 (2004), no. 2, 587–595). To my knowledge we do not know the category of $Sp(n)$ when $n>3$, but we know some bounds: Macías-Virgós; Pereira-Sáez; "An upper bound for the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of the symplectic group." Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 155 (2013), no. 2, 271–276. The LS category of the Lie group ${\rm Spin} (n)$ is known for $3\leq n \leq 9$. Edit: Let me say more about LS-category of H-spaces, take the $n$-torus $T^n$ then $Cat_{LS}(T^n)=n$, a lower bound is given by the cup-length which is $n$ and an upper bound by the dimension which is also $n$. Also using cup-length you can prove that $Cat_{LS}(K(\mathbb{Z},2))$ is not finite, but on the other hand we know that $K(\mathbb{Q},1)=2$!! If LS-cat determines co-Hspaces, I am not aware of any nice statements about LS-cat of $H$-spaces (you can certainly say something about the rational LS-category of simply-connected H-spaces). 

Reading these excellent answers made me realize I did not understand the ZMT in an intuitive way, and helped me very much get at least more intuition for it than I had. I want to try to summarize what I have learned from thinking about the other answers here, in a way that is not too technical and hopefully intuitive. I do not consider the proofs, but only the intuition contained in the statements. The first step is necessarily a little technical since it involves the definition of normality. 1) If X is a normal affine variety, i.e. if its affine ring has no non trivial module - finite extension within its quotient field, then it follows from this definition, that X accepts no non trivial finite birational morphism. Thus X is normal if and only if every finite birational morphism Y→X is an isomorphism. 2) ZMT then implies that every such normal variety is unibranch. I.e. if X has more than one branch at any point, then X must accept a non trivial finite birational map Y→X. The geometric intuition here is that it should be possible, by a finite morphism, to separate the branches of any variety that is not unibranch. This may have been suggested to Zariski by examples such as the projection cited by Francesco. Thus ZMT establishes that the only way for a variety to possess more than one branch is for it to be the target of a map similar to a “projection”. (Mumford's nice topological and power series statements are just alternate ways to say "unibranch".) 3) As Sandor pointed out, then the connectedness theorem follows naturally for a normal variety X, since if Y→X were finite, birational, and some fiber f^(-1)(p) were disconnected, then X should have at least two branches at p, hence X should not be normal. 4) The next natural piece of intuition is Grothendieck’s theorem that all quasi-finite morphisms can be completed to finite ones, as Matt and Akhil observe. Thus the only way to get a quasi - finite morphism is to restrict a finite morphism to an open set, a very intuitive geometric statement. In particular, since there are by definition no non - trivial finite birational morphisms to X, there cannot be any non trivial quasi- finite birational ones either; i.e. every such morphism Y→X is an open immersion. 5) As a consequence, a birational morphism Y→X which is not trivial, i.e. not an open immersion, cannot be quasi – finite, hence must have a positive dimensional fiber f^(-1)(p). So for me at least, these various statements have all become geometrically natural, thanks to contemplating the other answers, admittedly in a naïve way. 

As written by Dan Petersen this was proved by A. Dold. In fact the computation of the homology of the symmetric products of a topological space turns out to be difficult over the integers and over a finite field. Such computations were done by J. Milgram in for $SP^n$ in the case $n=1,2,\infty$: "The homology of symmetric products." Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 138 1969 251–265. J. Milgram's computations rely on results of N. Steenrod wich can be found in "Séminaire H. Cartan 1954/1955" based on the theory of constructions. Then J. Milgram uses the fact that when $X$ is a connected CW-complex of finite type $H(X)\cong H(Y)$ where $Y$ is a wedge product of Moore spaces. This result is the key point that A. Dold uses in the paper cited above and you will notice that this result is false when we consider the cohomology algebra. 

M. Weiss has a very good survey on his homepage: $URL$ called "Immersion theory for homotopy theorists". I also like very much M. Adachi's book "Embeddings and immersions". I think both are very good starters if you have a topological background. J. Francis has also some notes on his homepage: $URL$ on a course about the h-principle that can be helpful. Also Eliashberg and Mischachev's book "introduction to the h-principle" is definitively a very good book. 

If you want to see that every tangent line to an r dimensional projective variety is the tangent space to a curve through a smooth point p, just take r-1 functions in the local ring whose differentials cut out precisely the tangent line. Then the basic implicit function theorem type results on pages 7-9 of Mumford's "yellow book", Complex projective varieties, show that these functions define a curve through p with the given tangent line as tangent space. So the tangent space at a smooth point p, is the union of the tangent spaces of all curves through p and smooth at p. So you get almost your point of view but replacing viewing the tangent vectors as velocity vectors to parametrized curves, by viewing the tangent lines as tangent spaces to implicitly given curves. 

have you read bob friedman's thesis,from harvard? in the appendix i recall he considered singular curves or singular surfaces and deduced generic torelli from a specialization argument. or maybe consult the article by friedman-smith on generic prym torelli in inventiones some 20 plus years ago using this technique. 

Fred Cohen and Sam Gitler have written a paper "Loop spaces of configuration spaces, braid like groups and knots" available on Fred Cohen's homepage. They study deep and interesting relationships between the loop space homology of configuration spaces and knot theory. For example they show how to recover universal Yang-Baxter lie algebras from the study of this loop space homology. In section 7 of this paper they study the closure of braids, and in the two next sections are devoted to the study of embedding spaces and Vassiliev's theory. Maybe I do not answer your question but I want to focus on the fact that there are some very deep relationships between homology of configuration spaces (in fact the homology of the based loop space of configuration spaces) and knot theory. Taking care of the first homology group of configuration spaces is not enough. 

The canonical map $BPL\rightarrow BTOP$ is a rational homotopy equivalence by works of Thom, Novikov, Kirby-Siebenmann and others. In fact the homotopy fiber $TOP/PL$ is a $K(\mathbb{Z}/2,3)$. A nice reference is the survey "Piecewise Linear Structures on Topological Manifolds" by Rudyak. The canonical map $BO\rightarrow BPL$ is also a rational homotopy equivalence, this follows from smoothing theory. And the $i$-th homotopy groups of $PL/O$ are equal to zero when $i\leq 5$ isomorphic to $\Theta_i$ when $i\geq 6$. Where $\Theta_i$ is the group of exotic spheres: the equivalence classes of smoothing on $S^i$ under orientation-preserving diffeomorphism. As $\Theta_i$ are finite abelian groups you get your answer. 

read walker's algebraic curves, the first few chapters, for a nice discussion of this. there you will find I believe something like e.g. that a curve of degree d with more than (1/2)(d-1)(d-2) singular points is reducible, in the sense that its equation is a product of two equations, and a curve with more than (1/2)d(d-1) singular points is non reduced, in the sense that its equation is not square free. the reason for these facts is visible topologically if you know that a complex curve of degree d is topologically a specialization of a surface of genus g = (1/2)(d-1(d-2), and the maximum finite number of singularities occurs for a union of d lines. these results are proved by the strong bezout theorem. e.g. if a cubic curve has two singularities, then the line through them meets the curve with multiplicity 2x2 = 4, hence lies inside the curve. hence this is a stackexchange level question. 

In 1971, Bott gave a some talks in Mexico at the IPN, in a conference on differential topology sponsored by UNAM, on his work on obstructions to integrability of foliations. These talks were published in LNM volume 279. He also described a general construction of a simplicial complex BC associating a simplex to each commutative diagram of a certain shape in a category C. While he attributed this general construction perhaps to Grothendieck, as I recall he said it went back to work of Segal. According to a paper of Madsen and Weiss mentioned in the nice link provided by David Roberts, this construction has some relation to the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, perhaps the first example of associating a topological space to a category. Namely, if G is the group of isotopy classes of automorphisms of a surface of suitably high genus, then BG has the same rational cohomology as the moduli space of stable Riemann surfaces.
