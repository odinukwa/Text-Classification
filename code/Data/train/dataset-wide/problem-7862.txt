The paper by Rourke and Sanderson writes that "it is a standard exercise to show that $g$ induces an isomorphism of homology and of fundamental groups" and then "applies" Whitehead's theorem; unfortunately that is not Whitehead's theorem on homotopy equivalences. A detailed proof due M. Zisman of the map from the "thick" to the usual realisation being a homotopy equivalence is given on p. 573 of "Nonabelian algebraic topology" (EMS Tract vol 15, August 2011), pdf available from my web page $URL$ . 

The more useful version of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem deals with the fundamental groupoid $\pi_1(X,A)$ on a set $A$ of base points. The important point here is that groupoids have structure in dimensions $0$ and $1$, and so can handle gluings of (weak) homotopy $1$-types. There is a connectivity condition. In the next dimension, there are crossed modules over groupoids, which have structure in dimensions $0,1,2$, and they form a category $XMod$. They also model weak homotopy $2$-types, and the 2-dimensional SvKT, proved by Higgins and me, says that the functor $\Pi_2$ from triples to $XMOd$ preserves certain pushouts. Again there is a connectivity condition. The book, which I will call NAT, referred to in the question, deals in general with a functor $\Pi$ from filtered spaces to crossed complexes, and says that it preserves certain colimits, including pushouts; there is a connectivity condition involved. In homotopy theory, identifications in low dimensions influence homotopy invariants in high dimensions. A simple example is to form $X=S^n \vee [0,1]$, a sphere with a whisker, which has the same homotopy type as $S^n $. However identifying $0$ and $1$ gives $S^n\vee S^1$, which has a different $\pi_n$. This example is handled by the functor $\Pi$ on filtered spaces mentioned above: see p.259 of NAT. Some background to these results is given in this presentation. By contrast, the MV sequence in homology requires no connectivity conditions, but yields only an exact sequence, which determines a term such as $H_n(A \cup B)$ only up to extension, and involves only abelian groups, not modules. 

@Paul: Paul asks for the motivation: here is my story. I gave an MSc course on homotopy theory at Liverpool in 1960-61, and was struck then by the nice properties of the category of simplicial sets as against that of topological spaces, thus suggesting the convenience of simplicial sets. My thesis topic then was the algebraic topology of function spaces, and in the process of solving the particular problem I used exponential laws for spaces, simplicial sets, based simplicial stets, chain complexes, simplicial abelian groups, and maybe others. At the end of this work it struck me that the exponential law depended on the product as well as the hom, and I wrote this up as a small introduction. I also knew that the weak (i.e. k-ified) product has been studied by Whitehead and by Danny Cohen, so it seemed reasonable to try this for the exponewntial law. To my surprise, it all worked well and became the first chapter of my thesis, on the category of Hausdorff k-spaces, which was submitted, and the thesis was reproduced in the old purple Banda and well circulated, e.g. to Princeton. Writing up this general topology part as papers it all became more expansive and was published as my first two papers, in 1963 and 1964. In writing up the Introduction of the first paper, I speculated: "It may be that the category of Hausdorff k-spaces is adequate and convenient for all purposes of topology." The major properties for conveninece were listed in the second paper, mainly being cartesian closed. I should say that a referee of the initial version had drawn my attention to the important point about cartesian closed, i.e. the usual properties of the product. Also, later workers eliminated the Hausdorff assumption. For more discussion, see the the ncatlab on convenient categories of topological spaces. There is also a nice paper of Lawvere discussing the various equivalences between $$(X^Y)^I, (X^I)^Y, X^{Y \times I}$$ in terms of motion and phase spaces, which I will try to find a reference to. Finally, Spanier's suggestion of quasi-topological spaces is even more convenient, since it is locally cartesian closed, but was rejected mainly because the quasitopologies on the 2-point set formed a class. Maybe Peter Johnstone's "Topological topos" would be adequate and convenient for topology! 

I think the right context for this question is that of monoidal closed categories with a unit interval object, and probably the first place to explore this is the ncat lab. I mention that we set up a number of monoidal closed categories in our book R. Brown, P.J. Higgins, R. Sivera, Nonabelian algebraic topology: filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids, EMS Tracts in Mathematics Vol. 15, 703 pages. (August 2011). $URL$ pdf available there. for example: crossed complexes, chain complexes with a groupoid of operators, and explore the relations between them. As explained in the above answer and comments, the cubical approach has some advantages when dealing with homotopies and higher homotopies, basically because of the formula $I^m \otimes I^n \cong I^{m+n}$. Added as edit: the other point about the cubical formulation is that there is a notion of cubical set with compositions (and also extra structure such as connections) but we do not have a similar notion simplicially, or not so easily. Globular notions have compositions, though multiple compositions are awkward, and tensor products are not so easy. 

Without answering your question in particular, you might like to look at the paper R. Brown, ``Fibrations of groupoids'', J. Algebra 15 (1970) 103-132. which uses semidirect products to turn derivations (or crossed morphisms, as the term is used there) into sections and also uses exact sequences of a fibration of groupoids to deal with exact sequences: see Theorem 5.7 of that paper. 

Whitehead's subtle theorem (1941-1949), proved using transversality and knot theory, that the crossed module $ \delta: \pi_2(X \cup _\lambda e^2 _\lambda,X,x) \to \pi_1(X,x) $ is free on the $2$-cells was an example of a universal property in $2$-dimensional homotopy theory; If our conjectured $2$-dimensional van Kampen was true in some form, then it should imply Whitehead's theorem. Whitehead's theorem involves relative homotopy groups. We should therefore try to define a homotopy double groupoid in a relative situation. Given we had little time remaining in Philip's stay at Bangor, we should try the simplest idea, and that seemed to be to consider homotopy classes of maps of a square $I^2$ into $Y$ which mapped the edges into the subspace $X$ and the vertices to the base point. Note that this a symmetric definition, and requires no choice of which edges to be mapped to the base point, as in the usual (and so unaesthetic?) definition of relative homotopy groups. This was a sensible definition; the work that had already been done by then with Chris Spencer on double groupoids with connections, commutative cubes, and the precise relation of these double groupoids with crossed modules, allowed a proof of the van Kampen theorem and, and given work by Philip on induced crossed modules, a deduction of Whitehead's theorem, and indeed a generalisation to a theorem on $\delta:\pi_2(X\cup CA,X,x)\to \pi_1(X,x)$, with Whitehead's theorem being the case $A$ is a wedge of circles. 

My facourite example is that the integers $\mathbb Z$ may be obtained from a pushout diagram $$ \begin{matrix} \{0,1\} & \to & \{ 0\} \\ \downarrow && \downarrow \\ \mathcal I & \to & \mathbb Z \end{matrix}$$ in the category of groupoids where $\mathcal I$ is the groupoid with two objects $0,1$ and non identity arrows $\iota:0 \to 1, \iota^{-1}:1 \to 0$ This pushout also nicely models the way the circle $S^1$ is obtained from the unit interval $[0,1]$ by identifying $0$ and $1$. Thus we see one value of the notion of colimit, of which pushout is a special case, namely to compare concepts in different categories. Also, we know most things internally about the groupoid $\mathcal I$, whereas the integers are infinite. 

Relevant to this question are the remarks of Grothendieck on "speculation": $URL$ I agree with him on the general negative view of speculation. I have tried out some speculative ideas, and you can get some funny looks from superior persons, who can be easily inclined to use the word "nonsense" or "ridiculous"! I have had this with regard to my higher dimensional ideas. Or even over the years with regard to the use of groupoids at all. On the other hand, by giving a speculative talk in 1975 I got a very helpful idea from a later discussion. On the other hand, I have found talking about these ideas has helped to make them real, and suggest they should be pursued, even how they should be pursued. If someone says "That can't work because ..." then that is useful information. So is "If your idea was any good, it should do .....". That could focus the mind; what would it need to do that? This turned out to be a key! I would advise writing for yourself as speculatively as you can, taking ideas as far or beyond as you can, trying to catch ideas before they vanish. Then they should be looked at in the cold light of day, looking carefully for obstructions to them working. If these obstructions exist, that would be interesting. If they can be gradually be overcome, that is even more interesting! In either way, you may be doing something different. I expect we all want to find something new rather than solving already formulated problems. How to go about that, and how much effort to put into it, especially for career purposes, is worth discussion, especially in terms of balance of effort and probabilities of success, given one has to produce papers. There are also dangers about talking of new ideas on a famous problem: I have been told of one well known example of this (elementary proof of the Prime Number Theorem). Unfortunately, there is as far as I know no systematic discussion of such ethical issues, and of attention to due scholarship. Hope that helps. 

Actually there are two useful topologies on the join $X * Y$ using initial topologies, or final topologies. The former is useful for maps into the join, and the latter for maps out of the join. With initial topology, the join is associative. With final topologies, the standard problem is that the product of identification maps is not an identification map, unless one works in a convenient category of spaces. These questions are discussed in Section 5.7 of Topology and Groupoids, where associativity with the initial topology is proved. (This was in the 1968, 1988 editions!) Of course the two topologies agree on compact Hausdorff spaces, but I have not managed to write down a proof that the two topologies are equivalent in the category of compactly generated spaces. Am I missing something easy? Later: just to add some details. One thinks of the join as lines joining points of $X$ to points of $Y$ in some Euclidean space (see Tom's answer). So one writes these elements as formal combinations $rx+sy$ where $x \in X, y \in Y$ and $0 \leqslant r,s$ and $ r+s =1$. Of course $0x+1y$ means just $y$ and $1x + 0y$ means just $x$. The initial topology is with respect to the functions $$rx+sy \mapsto r, rx+sy \mapsto s, rx+sy \mapsto x, rx+sy \mapsto y$$ which are well defined on subsets of $X*Y$. With this notation, associativity becomes easy, since a point of $X*Y*Z$ is of the form $rx+sy +tz$, with the obvious conventions and conditions; continuity of the associativity map rolls out with these initial topologies. 

This suggests the advantage of a proper strategic analysis, even if delayed! Note that one of the advantages of strict structures is that the calculation of colimits of them is reasonably clear; in particular, the calculation of colimits of crossed modules is an interesting extension of the calculation of colimits of groups. In algebraic topology, one use of homotopical invariants is to show that objects are not equivalent, and this needs precise answers. It was then not hard to see the putative extension to filtered spaces; the work was in fact quite hard technically and conceptually, but was completed in 1977, with two CRAS notes published in that year, and the full papers in 1981. Actually the interest of Whitehead's theorem seems not so much appreciated. It allows one, for the usual representation of the Klein bottle as an identification of a square $\sigma$, to write the more precise $$\delta \sigma = a+b-a +b $$ instead of the usual $\partial \sigma = 2b$. See this presentation. In 1982 Loday published a paper giving a definition of a fundamental cat$^n$-group of a pointed $n$-cube of spaces, and showed that such structures modelled all weak, pointed homotopy $n$-types. In a visit of mine to Strasbourg towards the end of 1981, I talked about my work with Philip Higgins, and together Loday and I conjectured a van Kampen type theorem for his cat$^n$-groups. This was proved by 1984 and published in 1987. It allows some quite new calculations of homotopical invariants, e.g. the homotopy $3$-type of $SK(G,1)$, the suspension of an Eileneberg-Mac Lane space. These theorems have strong limitations, as is only to be expected, but they do allow new determinations and open out new prospects. So one possible moral is that the concentration on bare topological spaces, without any further structure, is a more restricted endeavour. This fits with Section 5 of Grothendieck's "Esquisse d'un programme", where he argues that the needs of geometry require more than just a topology, and he argues for kinds of stratifications. One way of looking at this is to say that the specification of a space requires some kind of data, and that data will have some kind of structure; so, conjecturally, one should look for invariants of spaces with that kind of structure. It would be interesting to compare these higher homotopy groupoid structures, and the weak structures in common current parlance, with the vision of the algebraic topologists of the early 20th century for higher dimensional versions of the nonabelian fundamental group. Since the finding in 1932 that Cech's definition of higher homotopy groups, which he submitted to the ICM at Zurich, led to abelian groups, this has seemed to be a mirage.
