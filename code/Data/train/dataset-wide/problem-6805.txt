As far as I can tell, the only difference between these two ways of describing classes of words is that 'syntactic categories' actually relies on evidence of use for determining categories, while 'parts of speech' labels can just be applied without any appeal to evidence. There is also the term 'word classes' which appears to be similar, but also used without specification. Are they simply used by different sub-disciplines of linguistics? Or are there more specific differences? 

So by the seventh colour term they basically concede that there is no way to predict order of inclusion in a language. Given that their constraints have been even further relaxed since this analysis I would not find it surprising if there were a language where a separate lexical item for 'light blue' were found before others in rule 7 above. 

This is an example I always find is helpful for first year. Ignore the vowels just for now, and just focus on the 'p' sounds. If I were doing a phonetic transcription of English notice how all the 'p' sounds are different and they've got slightly different diacritics to show this: [pʰin] 'pin' - notice it's aspirated! [spin] 'spin' - notice it's not aspriated! [stop̚] 'stop' - notice that you didn't actually open your mouth at the end. I use those square brackets to show it's phonetic - it's the sounds as they really and objectively are. But that's not how English speakers really think of them - they don't think of these sounds being different, they all just think of them as 'p.' to show this we just write them all as /p/ and use angle brackets to show that people think of them all as the one sound - /pin/, /spin/ and /stop/. 

Newspeak, a "deliberately impoverished" language designed to prevent people from communicating and thinking about subversive ideas. While that example is fictional, Orwell also discussed politicized use of vagueness and other obscurantist rhetorical techniques. While that is still communicating ideas, (some of) the ideas are being communicated through choices in the use of language, rather than through the literal meaning of the words. An example is consciously choosing to use/avoid certain words to make a political statement or a statement about group affinity: 

Not sure if this is the same text you're thinking of, but "The North Wind and the Sun" ("Βορέας καὶ Ἥλιος"), one of Aesop's fables, is commonly translated into various languages and used as an example text in phonetics. The International Phonetic Association has a tradition of using it as an example text to illustrate its phonological descriptions of languages and dialects (see the Handbook for many translations and transcriptions). But it doesn't contain the phrases you mention. Audio readings of the IPA's translations of the fable are available. Wikisource has a Polytonic Greek version, two versions in English, one in Spanish, and one in Japanese. The Wikipedia article says it's also used "as a parallel text in comparative linguistics as it provides more natural language than the Lord's Prayer". 

When you ask '[i]s the 12th Basic Color Term (BCT) always light blue' I assume you're referring to work from Berlin and Kay's 1969 book "Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution" (U Cal Press). This book and subsequent work argued that languages acquire colours in a systematic order, so a language with only 2 terms would have a light/dark or warm/cold distinction, and then the next addition would be red, followed by green or yellow, then the other, then blue, etc. Although Berlin and Kay's work was a real innovation, it has not stood up to scrutiny over the years. Not only have Berlin and Kay relaxed their finding, but they've been challenged by others. Some of the better reads on this topic are: 

I know WALS (World Atlas of Linguistic Typolology) www.wals.info has a chapter on the "Order of Adverbial Subordinator and Clause" $URL$ You could use this as a starting point because you know that all 660 languages in this survey cover a good area and genetic spread - and WALS almost always point you to a reference grammar. Might take some of the grunt-work out of your task! 

How much of a functional load must a phone carry to be considered its own phoneme? For example, my idiolect of English has a marginally distinctive glottal stop. However, it exists distinctively in only two words I can think of, both interjections: 

Is it true that languages often don't distinguish (phonemically) between velarization and pharyngealization? If so, why? Are they acoustically similar? 

The Russian text is a song about cutting reeds. It seems to have nothing to do with the Yoruba words or the Portuguese lyrics. 

Another such transformation is Ancient Greek βῆτα [bɛ́ɛ̀.ta] 'the letter beta' -> Modern Greek Βήτα [ˈvi.ta], where the /b/ was lenited to /β/, which was replaced with the cross-linguistically-more-common labiodental phone. 

Both of these look like regular sound changes between Proto-Germanic and Old Norse. However, I have found no eponyms for these sound changes, if that was what you were asking. Loss of word-final /nan/ Wikipedia gives this as an example of an innovation in North Germanic: 

This is a common process called lenition. Consider a language that has a phoneme /b/ as its only voiced bilabial phoneme. Speakers will then often pronounce /b/ without complete closure of the airway, giving a fricative [β] or approximant [β̞] realization. A very similar phenomenon occurs in Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan, where intervocalic /b/ is realized as [β̞]. For example, Spanish bobo /ˈbo.bo/ will be pronounced [ˈbo.β̞o]. Japanese similarly often realizes /b/ as /β/. In this case, the (voiced bilabial) stop turns into an approximant. Kyrgyz lacks a /w/ phoneme, so there is no need to distinguish /b/ from /w/. Since the bilabial approximant [β̞] sounds similar to the bilabial-velar approximant [w], it is not surprising that [w] is another possible realization. Such shifting between various labial sounds and [w] is very common cross-linguistically; examples include: 

ioling.org has the problems from the IOL comp - but individual countries that have the competition will also put their problem sets online. Here is the link for Australia's Linguistics Olympiad problems: $URL$ Over all they're slightly less daunting than the IOL level ones, so you may want to start there! 

@jlawler in the comments of your question is right - but I'll try and expand a bit because I think it's a lovely example of how we often under-estimate the complexity of the languages we speak. A dictionary is a useful tool for what it's good at, giving people a basic idea of what a word means and its basic function. To integrate the data from a dictionary into a parsing machine requires the addition of a while lot more information. Firstly, a dictionary gives the parts of speech (which is a good start) but nowhere in a dictionary will you find sentence-building information like "subjects go before verbs in basic declarative sentences," or any of the hundreds of other syntactic rules that allow speakers to produce plausible utterances. So that's your syntactic limitation. Secondly, there's a lexico-semantic limitation. Think about a word like sand. We know form the dictionary that it's a noun, but we need more. We need to know it's a mass noun, not a count noun so putting a number with it is not good unless there's something to turn it into a count noun (eg. buckets of sand). Also, dictionaries don't include Proper Nouns so they're not going to be good at recognising large chunks of text ("Lauren mentioned Chomsky on Stack Exchange" - for example), not to mention the incredible creativity English-speakers show in creating neologisms ("I Chomsky'd that post"). Thirdly, there's a phonological limitation. To give a dull but illustrative example, when do you use a\an? You'll have to build a rule for that on top of your dictionary, but you'll need to include inter-dialect and inter-speaker variation (in fact, the same goes for all of the above). Dictionaries are great at what they do, and sometimes can be absorbed into computational processes in interesting ways, but it's just a small component of what you'll need to create a sentence checker! 

The Wikipedia article "Aramaic of Jesus" contains many instances of transliterated Aramaic, using a system I have not seen before. Some of the notations are well-established, like ŝ for /ʃ/ and macrons for long vowels, but there are many I haven't seen before. I tried looking up more information on Aramaic transcription systems. Wikipedia has no article on Aramaic transcription, and the articles on Aramaic, Romanization of Hebrew, and various Hebrew letters don't seem to have any relevant information. Particularly T-cedilla: 

There are two terms used for pairs of words (in the same or different languages) that look similar but are actually unrelated: false friend and false cognate. Are these terms synonymous? If not, what's the difference? 

It depends on the language, and how you choose to analyze it. In the phonetic sense, an affricate is a consonant cluster consisting of a stop that is released directly into a fricative, with no intervening release burst before the start of the fricative. Affricates may or may not be phonemic; that depends on whether the affricate behaves phonologically/phonotactically as an indivisible unit. An example is the cluster [tˢs]. In Japanese, it patterns as a phonemic unit; in fact, it alternates with (compare [matsu] waits with [mata] waited), and is often considered an allophone of, the single phoneme /t/. In contrast, in English, [tˢs] is a sequence of 2 phonemes rather than a phoneme, because it patterns like the sequence /t/ + /s/ (in words like cats /kæts/ the /t/ and /s/ belong to different morphemes, so /ts/ is clearly not a unitary phoneme). Another case is [tɕ] in Russian. This is clearly a phonemic affricate: because Russian doesn't even have a phoneme /ɕ/, it's not even possible to analyze it as a sequence. Whether to consider a (phonetic) affricate as two separate consonants in the onset depends on whether you are considering it as a non-phonemic sequence. Phonotactic considerations can also guide you here. Example: /tʃ/ in Spanish. There are 2 arguments that this should be considered a single consonant in the onset: 

I'm sure you've found enough information on Wikipedia and other places that make it clear that Albanian isn't closely related to any other living language, but for those who haven't the most concise summary I've found is at Krysstal's Language Families ( $URL$ "The Illyric Branch [of Indo European]. Only Albanian (called Shqip by its speakers) belongs to this branch. It has been written in the Latin script since 1909; this replaced a number of writing systems including Greek and Arabic scripts." "There are two dialects that have been diverging for 1000 years. They are mostly mutually intelligible. Geg is spoken in the north of Albania and Kosovo (Kosova). Tosk is spoken in southern Albania and north west Greece." "The ancient Illyric and Mesapian languages, spoken in parts of Italy, are considered by some to be an extinct member of this branch." So we have to go back to this Illyric branch, which it is argued is part of the Paleo-Balkan group. The only other surviving member of this group is Modern Greek ($URL$ Given how completely dissimilar Modern Greek and Albanian are this answer appears rather unsatisfying - until you realise how amazing it is that Albanian managed to survive this long when any closely related languages died out so long ago! 

Yes. Korean [kor] There are roughly 2,000,000 Koreans living in China. Ethnologue lists 1,920,000 Korean speakers in China as of the 2000 census. (Not sure whether that counts North Korean refugees.) Korean is an isolate (assuming you don't accept it as Altaic). Wikipedia says, "With over 78 million speakers, Korean has more speakers than all other language isolates combined." So Korean wins. Chinese Sign Language [csl] Wikipedia lists it as an isolate. There are probably other local sign language isolates, presumably undocumented or poorly documented. ISO 639-3 considers it two languages, the other being hks. List See also Wikipedia's partial list. 

Japanese is similar, except it also allows a glottal stop utterance-finally, especially in emphatic utterances: 

Applying this rule to *finþanan gives *finþa. Assimilation of /nþ/ to /nn/ This is also a regular sound change in Old Norse. According to Marisa Lohr, one of its characteristic innovations is: 

It looks mostly regular. The (classical) Latin benedictiōnem /benediktioːnẽ/. In Western Romance, changes that would apply: 

This seems to be an under-studied phenomenon despite its widespread occurrence. Do you have any references comparing how this works in different languages? 

Using epidemiology as way towards understanding language use and spread is a good start! See "Linguistic Epidemiology" (Amazon link) by Nick Enfield - he's an excellent field linguist using features of epidemiology to look at contact situations. There are many other ways sociology can help you in field linguistic, at all levels. Any grammatical description worthy of attention these days will include a fairly detailed description of the social context in which the language is spoken. That includes social dynamics, power structures and other features. From there, it really depends what you're looking at. These days field linguists can do a whole lot more than just study the grammar of a language. We're also interested in how migration affects language use, or the power relation between the local language and the national language (or even in some cases, the local dialect and the more common one). You may want to look at the rise of the use of small minority languages on the internet, in which case social networking theory might be useful. You might find there are less direct benefits, for example some areas of sociology put better emphasis on quantitative methods than most linguistics majors do, which might give you a better grounding in statistics, which might help with corpus analysis or phonetic analysis. Even if the study of sociology doesn't directly relate to any future linguistic study you do, the grounding in critical thinking, research methodology and the ability to think from the perspective of cultures other than your own are all going to help make you a better linguist! 

The song appears in 2 versions, one in Portuguese, and the other in the unknown language. The Portuguese lyrics are (omitting repeated lines): 

Combining these sound changes, we get something like /benejtsjon/. (The sound /ts/ was often written c or ç.) The same applies for /malediktioːnẽ/ > /malejts(j)on/. I'm not sure why the /j/ after /ts/ is lost here; it might be idiosyncratic. 

B-underline (the Wikipedia page used an actual underline; I added an underline diacritic since Markdown doesn't allow underline): 

Many languages lack phonemic glottal stops, but regularly insert them. For example: English invariably inserts glottal stops before utterance-initial vowels, and often before word-initial vowels when enunciating: 

While Lapropriu gives evidence for a sort of vowel harmony, diphthongizing "stem-changing" verbs are not an example of vowel harmony. This is not restricted to -ir-conjugation verbs; other common ones are sentar (me siento 'I sit'; nos sentamos 'we sit') and perder (pierdo 'I lose'; perdemos 'we lose'). And there's nothing special about verbs; the same phenomenon occurs with stress alternation in nouns and adjectives. Example: /be.ne.ˈθwe.la/ Venezuela, /be.ne.θo.ˈla.no/ venezolano. (Aside: This process is no longer productive; more recent forms do not alternate: Puerto Rico /pwer.to.ˈrˑi.ko/ corresponds to puertorriqueño /pwer.to.rˑi.ˈke.ɲo/, not */porto/-.) Generally, the alternating diphthongizations are derived from Latin short /e/ and /o/. In Spanish, these vowels regularly become /je/ and /we/ in stressed syllables, and /e/ and /o/ in unstressed syllables. This accounts for the alternation between most such verb forms, which differ in stress. It occurs regardless of the other vowels in the word, so it is not vowel harmony. (Non-alternating /e/ and /o/ come from Latin /eː/ or /i/, resp. /oː/ or /u/.) Demonstration: /e/ in contar diphthongizes in stressed syllables, when followed by a syllable starting with any of the possible vowels for the -ar conjugation: * /e/: present subjunctive 3sg -> cuente * /a/: present indicative 2sg (tú) -> cuentas * /o/: present indicative 1sg -> cuento but never diphthongizes in unstressed syllables: * /e/: past perfective indicative 1sg -> conté * /a/: present indicative 2sg (vos) -> contás * /o/: past perfective indicative 3sg -> contó More information: historical sound changes; conjugations. You could argue that the raising mutations in ir-conjugation verbs are like vowel harmony, since they only occur in that conjugation, and depend somewhat on the vowel in the following syllable. But there doesn't seem to be any tendency to regularly place the same vowels in multiple classes, which would be needed for it to be vowel harmony.
