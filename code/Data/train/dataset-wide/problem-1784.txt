NML Cygni and VY Canis Majoris Zhang et al. (2012) considered several values for $T_{\text{eff}}$ (effective temperature) and $L$ (luminosity) and found that NML Cygni matches up with the evolutionary track of a star of mass $\sim25M_\odot$, near the HR-diagram location of a similar star, VY Canis Majoris (denoted as VY CMa). Using these data points, the model estimates that NML Cygni is approximately 8 million years old and in the post-main sequence phase of its life. However, NML Cygni is thought to be related to the Cygnus OB2 association, which has an age of 2-3 million years. This is strange because all the stars in the association should be nearly the same age (see Knodlseder (2008)). That age may be questionable, however, as evidence for older stars nearby has been presented (see Wright et al. (2010)). The exact location of VY Canis Majoris on the evolutionary tracks is not certain. Massey et al. (2006) created models that placed it on a lower-mass track to help it avoid the "forbidden zone" beyond the Hayashi limit. VV Cephei Based on standard parameters, stellar wind measurements and Geneva grids, Bennett (2010) suggested that the red supergiant component of VV Cephei could be near the end of its life, assuming a mass of $\sim20$-$25M_\odot$.

This is a case of using a sort of natural units (similar to geometerized units), which are often convenient in relativity (special and general). Take, for instance, the Minkowski metric of special relativity. In dimensional units, it is $$\mathrm{d}s^2=-c^2\mathrm{d}t^2+\mathrm{d}x^2+\mathrm{d}y^2+\mathrm{d}z^2$$ Setting $c=1$ makes it a bit more convenient, and gives time and space the same units - which is more intuitive, if you think of time as another dimension. You also brought up $E=mc^2$. This is a special case of the energy-momentum relation: $$E^2=p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4$$ Setting $c=1$, we have the much more convenient form $$E=p^2+m_0^2$$ This comes up again and again. Add to this the mass-energy equivalence that is also important in relativity (especially the right-hand side of the Einstein field equations), and it simply makes sense to treat energy and mass as the same thing. In fact, it becomes perhaps even more useful than in special relativity, because we also often set $G=1$ - and that comes up a lot in general relativity. Now, the units of density under this system are $\text{Length}^{-2}$, and the density above is clearly not in those units. I'm guessing that this just isn't a case of setting $G=1$ - and that makes sense, because in cosmology and astronomy, many types of densities are measured in g/cm3: dark matter, interstellar gas and dust, and sometimes dark energy. Keeping it in $\text{Mass}\cdot\text{Length}^{-3}$ makes it easy to compare these, working in a system that is more commonly used. In a nutshell, then: Cosmologists sometimes like $c=1$ (and sometimes $G=1$) because it makes a lot of equations a lot easier to write out. Here, it becomes really easy to compare mass densities and energy densities. 

The danger from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is the potential to reduce atmospheric ozone drastically, allowing harmful ultraviolet radiation to pass through the atmosphere and make life on Earth much more difficult. However, you have to be fairly close for this to happen. Gehrels et al. (2003) calculated that a typical GRB from a supernova would have to occur less than 8 parsecs from Earth to cause serious damage to the ozone layer - or, as they put it, to cause levels to drop low enough that they would 

I want to say that's a Mollweide projection. I know that they're pretty common in astronomy; many images of the CMB use them. I was actually working with one recently. Given latitude $\varphi$ and longitude $\lambda$, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of an object are $$x=R\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\pi}(\lambda-\lambda_0)\cos\theta,\quad y=R\sqrt{2}\sin\theta$$ for projecting from a sphere of radius $R$. $\theta$ is the solution to $$2\theta+\sin2\theta=\pi\sin\varphi$$ Similar images can be found here (labeled as Mollweide projections), which are of the same shape and proportions: 

"ugriz" is short for U-band, G-band, R-band, I-band, and Z-band, detailed on the Wikipedia article on photometric systems: $$\begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline \text{Band}&\text{Effective Wavelength Midpoint }(\lambda_{\text{eff}})\\ \hline \text{U} & \text{365 nm}\\ \hline \text{G} & \sim\text{475 nm}\\ \hline \text{R} & \text{658 nm}\\ \hline \text{I} & \text{806 nm}\\ \hline \text{Z} & \text{900 nm}\\ \hline \end{array}$$ This $ugriz$ system is slightly different from the $u'g'r'i'z'$ system; conversions can be found here. The starting point is the same (note that $u(\text{2.5m})=u'$), but there are slight vertical and horizontal shifts. The differences between $ugriz$ and $u'g'r'i'z'$ are much smaller than the differences between $u'g'r'i'z'$ and the $UBV(RI)_C$ system, which was replaced by them both. This older system of filters had large overlaps and did not cover as broad a range. See Fig. 1 from this thesis for a comparison: 

The creator seems to be referring to flare stars. Flares may be magnetic in origin, like various manifestations of the Sun's magnetic field. These flares can be quit luminous across the electromagnetic spectrum, including in the x-ray wavelengths. Some red dwarfs are flare stars, though flare activity may be largely restricted to a small part of a red dwarf's lifetime. However, during this period, life on a planet orbiting close to a red dwarf could be in serious danger. The reference to convection may be that red dwarfs are generally fully convective, unlike other stars. Magnetic fields in stars are generated via the dynamo effect; in red dwarfs, full convectivity can play a huge role in generating strong magnetic fields, and thus stellar flares. 

The one thing that the two share? We know very little about them. Dark energy does not solve as many problems in the Big Bang theory as you may think. In fact, it causes more problems than it solves. You can come up with many different universes that begin with a Big Bang but don't have an accelerated expansion (not counting inflation, though you don't have to have that in a universe under some circumstances). They don't somehow suffer from any problems that universes with dark energy don't have. In fact, they're better because you don't have to somehow explain dark energy. Courtesy of Rob Jeffries, here's one tidbit about the one fairly important role of dark energy in the Big Bang: Our universe is close to flat (see the many papers by the WMAP team), and quite a lot of measurements have confirmed that we're not living on some wacky-shaped universe. The issue is that the measurements indicate that the universe isn't quite flat. Again, see the WMAP data. You can attribute part of the percentage offset from flatness to experimental error, or you can attribute it to the idea that perhaps the universe isn't so flat after all. Dark energy provides an explanation for this inherent not-quite-flat-ness that characterizes our universe. In those other toy universes (without dark matter), you need to explain this near-flatness some other way. Not in our universe, it seems. Dark matter and dark energy aren't just theories. Well, sort of. Coming from someone like me (who is firmly on the "theorist" side of the scientific spectrum), that's quite a whopper. But from a certain point of view, it's completely accurate. Dark matter is actually a theory. It's an explanation for some screwed-up galactic rotation curves, where some stars near the outer edges of a galaxy move much faster than they should. 

Short answer: 1) Yes and no; 2) Yes, there is a supercritical fluid, of hydrogen. Long answer: It's fairly hot deep down in Jupiter; estimates range from 10,000 K to 24,000 K. You would think that anything in the core would be liquefied, and you could be right. Many models predict that Jupiter's core is rocky, but others predict that it is liquid. Still others say that it is "liquefying" - i.e. parts are liquid and parts are solid. We don't know for sure which are right. In the early solar system, Jupiter would indeed have to have had a large core of rock (and potentially ice). It would have accreted gases, and eventually the planet we know today would have formed, with thick cloud layers complete with hydrogen, ammonia, and lots of other elements. But after Jupiter accumulated its mantle, there would have been a lot of pressure on the original core. It seems like much of the matter inside it would have been liquefied and carried away ("redistributed") into other parts of the planet. Still, some might have remained. Surrounding the core, there is a layer of liquid hydrogen. Yep, liquid hydrogen, just as you said in your question. Temperatures and pressures are so high that hydrogen has passed its critical temperature (33 K) and become a supercritical fluid. So, in summary, we don't know for sure the state of Jupiter's core is, but parts or all of it may be liquefied, and we also think that there is indeed a layer of hydrogen as a supercritical fluid surrounding the core. The same may also be said for other gas giants, although, still, we don't know for sure. I hope this helps.
