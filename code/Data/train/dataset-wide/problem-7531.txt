There are two natural finiteness conditions that you might impose on $Y$. The stronger one says that the Morava $E$-theory of $Y$ is finite in each degree, or equivalently that $Y$ is a retract of $L_{K(n)}Y_0$ for some finite spectrum $Y_0$ with $E(n-1)_*Y_0=0$. If this holds, then $[Y,L_{K(n)}X_\infty]$ is the colimit of the terms $[Y,X_k]$, the key point being that $DY\wedge X_\infty$ is already $K(n)$-local (even though $X_\infty$ itself is not). If $Y$ does not have the above smallness property then it will rarely be true that $[Y,L_{K(n)}X_\infty]$ is the colimit of $[Y,X_k]$. For the canonical counterexample, let $\{M_k\}$ be a tower of generalised Moore spectra of the usual kind, so $$ BP_*(M_k)=BP_*/(v_0^{a_0},\dotsc,v_{n-1}^{a_{n-1}}) $$ with the exponents $a_i$ tending to infinity as $k$ increases. Put $Y=L_{K(n)}S^0$ and $X_k=F(M_k,L_{K(n)}S^0)$. In this case it is known that $X_\infty=L_{K(n)}S^0$ so $[Y,X_\infty]$ contains $\mathbb{Z}_p$, but each group $[Y,X_k]$ is finite so the colimit is torsion. 

Let $\Phi_n$ be the $n$'th cyclotomic polynomial, and put \begin{align*} a_n &= \Phi_n(1) \\ b_n &= \gcd\left(\left(\begin{array}{c} n \\ 1\end{array}\right),\dotsc,\left(\begin{array}{c} n \\ n-1\end{array}\right)\right) \\ c_n &= \begin{cases} p & \text{ if } n = p^k \text{ for some prime } p \text{ and } k>0 \\ 1 & \text{ otherwise. } \end{cases} \end{align*} It is well-known that $a_n=b_n=c_n$. Indeed, there are a bunch of ways to prove that $a_n=c_n$, and a bunch of ways to prove that $b_n=c_n$. I ask: is there a more direct proof that $a_n=b_n$? A good answer might give a tidier approach to some fundamental results in formal group theory. Ideally I'd like a proof that expresses $a_n$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of binomial coefficients as in $b_n$. 

Let $R$ be the ring that you think is equal to $M^G$. You need to check that $R$ is fixed by $G$ and that $M$ is a free module of rank equal to $|G|$ over $R$. Then Galois theory tells you that the field of fractions $QR$ is $(QM)^G$. Moreover, as $R$ is a polynomial ring it is a unique factorisation domain and so is integrally closed in $QR$, and from that you can deduce that $R=M^G$. If you search for "Dickson invariants" you will find more details (usually written for $GL_n(\mathbb{F}_p)$, but the special linear cases is similar). 

The answer is just $\det(\Lambda^i(A))=\det(A)^m$, where $m=\left(\begin{matrix}n-1\\\\ i-1\end{matrix}\right)$. Indeed, by continuity it is enough to prove this when $A$ is diagonalisable, and by conjugation-invariance it suffices to prove it when $A$ is diagonal, and in that case it is straightforward. Alternatively, you can show that $SL_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the commutator subgroup of $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ and thus that any polynomial homomorphism $GL_n(\mathbb{C})\to\mathbb{C}^\times$ is a power of the determinant. To find the relevant power, just take $A$ to be a multiple of the identity. 

This is really a comment, but a bit too long. The coefficient of $y$ in $F(x,y)$ is $1/l'(x)$. If $n=1$ then $l'(x)=\sum_ix^{p^i-1}$ and $1/l'(x)$ is not polynomial mod $p$, so the answer is negative. However, to my surprise, it seems like the answer might be positive for $n>1$. (Note that $l'(x)=1\pmod{p}$ in that case.) For example, when $n=p=2$ one can calculate that the coefficient of $y^8$ in $\overline{F}(x,y)$ is $x^{14}+x^{20}+x^{26}+x^{56}\pmod{x^{1024}}$. As there are no terms $x^i$ with $56<i<1024$, one might reasonably guess that there are no terms $x^i$ with $i>56$, in which case the coefficient of $y^8$ would be polynomial. However, I do not know how to prove this. 

The first statement is not true as stated. Firstly, if $E$ and $F$ have Künneth theorems then so does $E\times F$. (Here $E\times F$ is the same as $E\vee F$, but calling it $E\times F$ makes the ring structure more visible.) Secondly, suppose that $E$ has a Künneth theorem and $A_*$ is an algebra over $E_*$ that is flat as an $E_*$-module. Then the functor $X\mapsto A_*\otimes_{E_*}E_*(X)$ is a multiplicative homology theory that also has a Künneth theorem. By applying these constructions to the $K(n)$'s (including $K(0)=H\mathbb{Q}$ and $K(\infty)=H\mathbb{F}_p$) we obtain many examples. It would not surprise me if this gives all examples, but I do not think that this has been written down. One might need to worry about infinite products. There is a related statement that is certainly true. Let $F$ be a ring spectrum such that $F_*$ is a graded field (ie every nonzero homogeneous element is invertible, and $F_*\neq 0$). This implies that every graded $F_*$-module is free, and thus that $F$ has a Künneth theorem. It also implies that $F\wedge X$ is always a wedge of (possibly suspended) copies of $F$. This includes the possibility that $F\wedge X$ could be zero, of course. This means that $F\wedge K(n)$ is a wedge of suspensions of $F$ and also a wedge of suspensions of $K(n)$. It follows from the Nilpotence Theorem that there exists a prime $p$ and a number $n\in [0,\infty]$ with $F\wedge K(n)\neq 0$. One can deduce from this that $F$ itself is a wedge of suspensions of $K(n)$. This still does not force $F$ to be isomorphic to $K(n)$, however; it could be $K(n)$ tensored with a finite field, or with a root of $v_n$ adjoined. UPDATE: for the second question, I do not believe that the natural map $$ \pi_*(L_EX)\otimes_{\pi_*(L_ES)}\pi_*(L_EY) \to \pi_*L_E(X\wedge Y) $$ is a natural isomorphism unless $E$ is zero (in which case $L_E=0$) or $E=E\mathbb{Q}\neq 0$ (in which case $L_E$ is rationalization). However, I cannot see a proof of this at the moment. 

Put $u_\alpha=[\mathbb{C}]-[L_\alpha]$. It is a standard fact, known as the projective bundle theorem, that $$K(\mathbb{P}(E))=K(X)[t]/\prod_{\alpha}(t-u_\alpha)$$ One can express $Fl(E)$ as the top of a tower in which each level is the projective bundle associated to a vector bundle over the level below. Using this one can obtain $$ K(Fl(E)) = K(X)[t_1,\dotsc,t_d]/(r_1,\dotsc,r_d), $$ where $r_i$ is the difference between the $i$'th elementary function in the variables $t_j$, and the $i$'th elementary function in the variables $u_\alpha$. Next, there is a natural cofibration sequence $S(E)\xrightarrow{}X\xrightarrow{}X^E$, where $X^E$ is the Thom space. In combination with the Thom isomorphism, this gives a long exact sequence $$ K^*(X) \xrightarrow{f} K^*(X) \xrightarrow{} K^*(S(E)) \xrightarrow{d} K^{*+1}(X). $$ Here $f$ is just multiplication by the $K$-theory Euler class, which is $\prod_\alpha u_\alpha$. 

First let $P$ be the space of nonzero quadruples $(X,Y,Z,W)$ of Hermitian matrices, and let $Q$ be the set of sextuples $(X,Y,Z,W,A,B)$ where $(X,Y,Z,W)\in P$ and $(A,B)\neq(0,0)$ and the three matrices mentioned are multiples of the identity. There is a projection map $\pi\colon Q\to P$, and we want to know whether this is surjective. Let $P_1$ be the subspace of $P$ where $\|X\|^2+\|Y\|^2+\|Z\|^2+\|W\|^2=1$, and let $Q_1$ be the subspace of $Q$ where $(X,Y,Z,W)\in P_1$ and $AA^*+BB^*=I$. Because our equations are appropriately homogeneous, it is equivalent to ask whether the projection $\pi\colon Q_1\to P_1$ is surjective. Note that $P_1$ and $Q_1$ are compact, so $\pi(Q_1)$ is closed in $P_1$. Thus, if there are any points not in $\pi(Q_1)$, then they form a nonempty open set, and we can hope to find a counterexample by random search. For fixed $(X,Y,Z,W)\in P$ it works out that we are trying to solve 12 equations in 16 variables, so it is reasonable to hope for a solution. I generated 1000 random examples and in each case set four of the 16 variables arbitrarily and solved numerically for the remaining 12, with success in every case. This convinces me that the answer is probably positive. Maple code is as follows: 

Suppose I have a homogeneous cubic polynomial $f(w,x,y,z)$ and I let $X$ be the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^4$ where $f(w,x,y,z)=0$ and $w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2=1$. Suppose that this is a smooth surface, and I give it the metric inherited from $\mathbb{R}^4$. Does anyone know a nice formula for the curvature of $X$ in terms of $w,x,y,z$ and the coefficients of $f$? Doubtless this could be worked out by going through the whole business of local coordinates and Christoffel symbols but I imagine that that would be quite lengthy and the final answer is probably not too complicated. 

In an arbitrary category, you can define subobjects of $X$ to be equivalence classes of pairs $(A,f)$, where $f:A\to X$ is a monomorphism, and $(A,f)$ is equivalent to $(B,g)$ if there is an isomorphism $p:A\to B$ with $gp=f$. You can then say that an object in an additive is simple if it has only the two obvious subobjects (and they are different). In a triangulated category, any monomorphism $f:A\to X$ is split, because there is a distinguished triangle $W\xrightarrow{m}A\xrightarrow{f}X\xrightarrow{n}\Sigma W$, and $fm=0$ so $m=0$. This means that the simple objects are precisely those that are indecomposable under direct sums. 

Every first countable space is compactly generated (because the topology is determined by the convergent sequences, which are the same thing as continuous maps from the compact space $\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$). Thus, if the topology on $V$ is determined by countable family of seminorms (or equivalently, it is a Fréchet space) then it is compactly generated. Someone once told me that it is possible to develop the theory of LCTVS and duality as an application of the theory of CGWH spaces, and that this is very clean and efficient. However, I have never seen an account like this; if anyone can point me to one, I'd be very interested. 

Under "alternatively", the following paper contains a lot of simplicial de Rham stuff that may or may not be useful to you: $URL$ However, for your limited purposes there are probably simpler references. 

Using spectral sequences is a bit heavy here. Given a map $s\colon\Delta_p\to Y$, there are precisely two different lifts to $X$, and we can add them to get a singular chain in $C_p(X)$. This construction extends linearly to give a chain map $\tau\colon C_*(Y)\to C_*(X)$ (called the transfer), with $\pi_*\circ\tau=2$ and $\tau\circ\pi_*=1+\theta_*$. This induces a map $\pi_!\colon H^*(X)\to H^*(Y)$ with $\pi^*\pi_!=1+\theta^*$ and $\pi_!\pi^*=2$ and $\theta^*\pi^*=\pi^*$. Using this we get $2\ker(\pi^*)=0$ and $2H^*(X)^{\theta}\leq\text{img}(\pi^*)\leq H^*(X)^{\theta}$. Thus, if we invert $2$ then $\pi^*$ gives an isomorphism from $H^*(Y)$ to $H^*(X)^{\theta}$. The example $S^3\to\mathbb{R}P^3$ shows that this does not work without inverting $2$, even if $X$ and $Y$ are oriented. 

Let $K$ be a field (probably of positive characteristic) and consider the ring $R=K[\![x_1,\dotsc,x_n]\!]$. Suppose we have an ideal $I=(f_1,\dotsc,f_n)$ (with the same $n$ as before). Suppose we also have elements $a_{ij}$ and $k>0$ with $\sum_ja_{ij}f_j=x_i^k$ for all $i$, which proves that $R/I$ has finite dimension over $K$. Standard results from commutative algebra now tell me that the sequence $f_1,\dotsc,f_n$ is regular (and more precisely, that the associated Koszul complex is exact except in degree zero) and that the socle of $R/I$ has dimension one. The standard proofs tend to use prime ideals, injective envelopes and so on, so they are not very constructive. Is there a more direct and equational approach to this? There is some relevant theory involving Jacobians but it seems not to work well in positive characteristic so I would prefer to avoid it. 

Given a complex oriented cohomology theory $E$, one can define a formal scheme of Weil pairings on the associated formal group, as explained in the paper "Weil pairings and Morava $K$-theory" by Matthew Ando and me. If we let $R_E$ denote the ring of functions on this scheme, then there is a natural map $R_E\to E^*K(\mathbb{Z},3)$. This is an isomorphism if $E$ is Morava $K$-theory or Morava $E$-theory. I think that it is also an isomorphism for $E=MU$ or $E=kU$ but not for $E=H$. However, there is a natural short exact sequence $$ kU^*K(\mathbb{Z},3)/v \to H^*K(\mathbb{Z},3) \to \text{ann}(v,kU^*K(\mathbb{Z},3)) $$ (where $v$ is the standard generator of $\pi_2kU=kU^{-2}(\text{point})$). I think that this is probably an effective way to understand $H^*K(\mathbb{Z},3)$. Some other things that are going on in the background here: 

There is a nice answer to a slightly modified question, which may or may not be useful for you. You want to write elements $k\in\mathbb{Z}/p^n$ in base $p$, ie as $k=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ip^i$ with $a_i\in D=\{0,1,\dotsc,p-1\}$. However, in many ways it is more natural to use the set of Teichmuller representatives: $$ T = \{x\in \mathbb{Z}/p^n:x^p=x\} $$ There is a bijection $\phi:D\to T$ given by $\phi(x)=x^{p^n}\pmod{p^n}$ and $\phi^{-1}(y)=y\pmod{p}$. Any element $k\in\mathbb{Z}/p^n$ can be written uniquely as $k=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ip^i$ with $a_i\in T$. This gives $k^{p^n}=a_0$, so the polynomial $f(x)=x-x^{p^n}$ removes the first Teichmuller digit. The key to proving all this is the following standard lemma: if $x=y\pmod{p^r}$, then $x^p=y^p\pmod{p^{r+1}}$. Reverting to the original question, the polynomial $f(x)=-x^3+3x^2-2x$ has the required property for $(p,n)=(3,2)$, and the degree here is minimal. I obtained this by a rather messy calculation which I will not reproduce here. UPDATE: I now have Maple code that calculates the minimal degree for all $p$ and $n$ (but is not very fast except for the smallest cases). In all cases that I have checked, the minimal degree is $(n-1)(p-1)+1$, which I find a rather surprising answer; I would have guessed something much bigger. Specifically, the above formula is correct for $p\leq 7$ and $2\leq n\leq 5$, and also for $p=3$ and $n\leq 8$. When $(p,n)=(3,8)$ we can take $$ f(x) = -1524\,{x}^{15}+153\,{x}^{14}-252\,{x}^{13}+2562\,{x}^{12}+351\,{x}^{ 11}-108\,{x}^{10}+1592\,{x}^{9}+2250\,{x}^{8}-1260\,{x}^{7}-3279\,{x}^ {6}+1701\,{x}^{2}-2186\,x $$ or in machine-friendly notation
