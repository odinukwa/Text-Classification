Let $K$ be a connected compact connected Lie group and let $G$ be the complexification of $K$. Then $G/K$ is an affine space. For any finitely presented $\Gamma$, $\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma, K)\subset \mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,G)$ and less obviously we have an inclusion of character varieties: $$\mathfrak{X}_{\Gamma}(K):=\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,K)/K\hookrightarrow \mathfrak{X}_{\Gamma}(G):=\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,G)/\!\!/G.$$ The polar decomposition writes $G=K\times \mathfrak{p}$ as a space (not a group). We therefore have a projection map: $G\to K$. This induces a projection mapping $\mathrm{Hom}(F_r,G)\to \mathrm{Hom}(F_r,K)$ for a rank $r$ free group $F_r$. The polar decomposition is $K$-equivariant, and thus this projection mapping descends to a mapping $\mathrm{Hom}(F_r,G)/K\to \mathrm{Hom}(F_r,K)/K$ and thus by inclusion (and restriction) to a projection $\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,G)/K\to \mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,K)/K$ for any surjection $F_r\to \Gamma$. Since $\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,G)/K$ projects to $\mathfrak{X}_{\Gamma}(G)$, we have a commutative diagram: $$\begin{array}{ccc} \mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,G)/K&\twoheadrightarrow& \mathfrak{X}_{\Gamma}(K)\\ \downarrow& &\downarrow\\ \mathfrak{X}_{\Gamma}(G)& =&\mathfrak{X}_{\Gamma}(G) \end{array} $$ Perhaps analyzing the fibers of the top and left surjections, and how they relate in $\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,G)/K$ would be helpful? 

I am not sure if this should count as an answer, but derivations make an appearance in the following books on PI Algebras: 

As per Daniel Loughran's comment, I found this very nice exposition by Terence Tao which seems to answer the question in detail. 

The actual questions you asked have already been answered, and so I am hesitant to chime in with anything. Anyway, here is an different response to your opening line: 

D. Mumford and P.E. Newstead, Periods of a moduli space of bundles on curves, Amer. J. Math. 90 (1968), 1200–1208 M.S. Narasimhan and S. Ramanan, Deformations of the moduli space of vector bundles over an algebraic curve, Ann. Math. (2) 101 (1975), 391–417 

It appears, from the computation you provide, you want to say a point is singular if all the partial derivatives vanish at that point. What about $V(x^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}$? The variety is the point $0$ and the derivative of $x^2$ vanishes at $0$? So there is no "smooth point". Comment: you claim to have a proof for all hyper-surfaces (which has already been shown to have flaws). However all real varieties $V(f_1,...,f_n)=V(f_1^2+\cdots +f_n^2)$ are hyper-surfaces. So if you do construct a valid proof for what you need for hyper-surfaces, you will have proved the result you want in general. Lastly, even over $\mathbb{C}$ there are examples of varieties some, like myself, would say are entirely singular. For example, the GIT quotient of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ acting on itself by conjugation is $\mathbb{C}$ and so smooth. But the generic stabilizer of the action is positive dimensional. I would say (I am sure there would be disagreement here) the entire variety is singular with its singular locus smooth. 

Let's assume $G$ acts effectively. Since $G$ is finite all orbits are closed. Take an affine open set $U\subset X$ that contains $x$, and assume $x$ is a smooth point. Then using the Luna Slice Theorem on $U$ you can deduce that $T_{\pi(x)}(U//G)$ is isomorphic to $T_0(T_x(U)//Stab_G(x))$ since the tangent space to the orbit of $x$ is trivial. However, $T_{\pi(x)}(U//G)=T_{\pi(x)}(X//G)$ and $T_0(T_x(U)//Stab_G(x))=T_0(T_x(X)//Stab_G(x))$. So $$T_{\pi(x)}(X//G)=T_0(T_x(X)//Stab_G(x))$$ at smooth points $x$. Independent of this, if the action is free (which it generically is), then $\pi$ is étale and so the tangent spaces are all isomorphic. When $x$ is singular and the action is not free, there are examples where $\pi(x)$ remains singular and examples where it becomes smooth. A simple example of the latter is $x^2-y^2=0$ with $\{\pm 1\}$ acting by $(x,y)\mapsto (x,-y)$, which has a smooth quotient. On the other hand, if your finite group is acting linearly then I just recalled a result in (Chapter 5, Section 5): N. Bourbaki, Groupes et Algbbres de Lie, chaps. 4-6, Act. Sci. Ind. 1337, Hermann, Paris, 1968 that implies that if $x$ is a closed point then $\pi(x)$ is smooth if and only if the stabilizer action on the local slice (from Luna's Slice Theorem applied to an affine open containing $x$) is generated by pseudoreflections. See here for a great exposition of Luna' Slice Theorem by Drézet. I learned about the above fact about pseudoreflections in Richardson's paper in Vol. 57, No. 1 Duke Mathematical Journal (1988) Conjugacy classes of $n$-tuples in Lie Algebras and Algebraic Groups starting around page 14. 

The paper you refer to by Gérard Laumon appears to be: Comparaison de caractéristiques d'Euler-Poincaré en cohomologie l-adique, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Sér. I Math. 292 (1981), no. 3, 209–212. According to the MathSciNet Review of this paper (reference MR0610321) by William E. Lang: 

The divergence of $p_v(\mathrm{exp}\ t\sqrt{-1}\xi)$ as $t\to \infty$ implies the image of $p_v$ is complete (since we have a minimum and the image is path-connected). If the orbit was not closed, then there is a 1-parameter subgroup $\lambda:\mathbb{C}^*\to G$ such that $\lim_{z\to 0} \lambda(z)v:=w\notin Gv$ (as in the above summary). Since $p_v$ has a min, $Kv=\{x\in Gv\ |\ ||x||=||v||\}$. Thus, if there exists $g_0v$ so $||g_0v||=||w||$, since $w$ is a limit point and $Kv$ is closed (since $K$ is compact), we have $w=g_0kv$ for some $k\in K$, a contradiction. Hence $||w||^2$ is not in the image of $p_v$. But step 2. showed that to be impossible since the image of $p_v$ is complete. 

Every free group is not Kähler (fundamental group of compact Kähler manifold). In particular, a free group of rank 1 is not Kähler. This follows since the rank of the abelianization of a Kähler group is even, even rank free groups contain finite index subgroups of odd rank (see here for example), and finite index subgroups correspond to covers of Kähler manifolds which are also Kähler. This and other interesting examples can be found in Fundamental Groups of Compact Kähler Manifold by Amorós, Burger, Corlette, Kotschick, and Toledo.

First, I think there is a typo in your question. Maybe you mean $\sum_{1\le i\le j\le 3}(a_{ij}-a_{ji})^2 =4\sin^2\phi$? Anyway, I think it is easier to work out these identities in $\mathsf{SU}(2)$, the double cover of $\mathsf{SO}(3)$. Up to conjugation, $A=\mathrm{diag}(e^{i\phi},e^{-i\phi})$ in $\mathsf{SU}(2)$. When projecting to $\mathsf{SO}(3)$, one has to add 1 to the trace since the covering map sends $A$ into $\mathsf{SO}(2)\times 1$. So $(1-\mathrm{tr}A)^2=(1-(1+e^{-i\phi}+e^{i\phi}))^2=4\cos^2\phi.$ Since the transpose of $A$ corresponds in $\mathsf{SU}(2)$ to the inverse $A^{-1}=\mathrm{diag}(e^{-i\phi},e^{i\phi})$ which simultaneously diagonalizes with $A$, the other part is $-\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}(A-A^{-1})^2 =-\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}(\mathrm{diag}(e^{i\phi},e^{-i\phi})-\mathrm{diag}(e^{-i\phi},e^{i\phi}))^2$ $=-\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}\mathrm{diag}(2i\sin\phi,-2i\sin\phi)^2=-\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}\mathrm{diag}(-4\sin^2\phi,-4\sin^2\phi)=4\sin^2\phi.$ Note that we did not have to add 1 to the trace as in the first paragraph since we introduced a 1 in each of $A$ and $A^{-1}$ and subtracted them; resulting in the 1's canceling. Thus, the Pythagorean theorem gives the result $(1-\mathrm{tr}A)^2-\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}(A-A^{T})^2=4\cos^2\phi+4\sin^2\phi=4.$ Lastly, $\sum_{1\le i\le j\le 3}(a_{ij}-a_{ji})^2=-\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tr}(A-A^{T})^2$ for any 3x3 matrix. This follows from an easy computation observing that $A-A^T$ is anti-symmetric. EDIT: Just in case it was not clear. The direct answer to your question is "no". The sum is artificial in the problem since it holds for any 3x3 matrix; it has nothing to do with orthogonal matrices. 

The Auslander Conjecture states: Every crystallographic subgroup $\Gamma$ of $\mathrm{Aff}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is virtually solvable, i.e. contains a solvable subgroup of ﬁnite index. He published an incorrect proof in 1964 of this statement. In 1983 Fried and Goldman proved Auslander’s conjecture for $n = 3$. Abels, Margulis and Soifer proved the conjecture for $n\leq 6$ in 2012. Although it is not my area of expertise, I believe it is considered to be an important open conjecture and has led to active research. 

For every hyperbolic structure on a closed $n$-manifold there is a discrete faithful representation (hence irreducible) from $\pi_1(M)\to \mathrm{Isom}(M)$, unique up to conjugacy. When $M$ is a surface, $\mathrm{Isom}(M)$ is $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $\pi_1(M)$ has a presentation with $2g$ generators and 1 non-trivial relation in those generators. One can use this to conclude that: $\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_1(M),\mathrm{Isom}(M))/\mathrm{Isom}(M)$ has dimension $3(2g-1)-3=6g-6$; and locally so at any irreducible representation. So there are non-trivial infinitesimal deformations in that case. However, the infinitesimal deformations can be "integrated", since the obstructions are in second cohomology which vanishes since $n=2$. Hence there is no rigidity (local and hence not global). For $n>2$, there are no such deformations; which follows from Weil's Remarks on the cohomology of groups (see here) also using information about a presentation of $\pi_1(M)$. One concludes that there are no infinitesimal deformations and thus no local deformations. Mostow's Rigidity says there is global rigidity (for $n>2$); admittedly a stronger statement than local rigidity (although infinitesimal rigidity is stronger than local rigidity). But the difference between $n=2$ and $n>2$ is seen locally as well and mostly is a consequence of nature of $\pi_1(M)$ in those cases. So one can say: 

Your first question appears answered in the comments. With regard to your second question, Maxime Bergeron has a well-written, well-referenced exposition of the characterization of complex reductive affine algebraic groups as complexifications of compact Lie groups here. 

The central multiplicative action of $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^r$ on the cohomology ring $H^∗(\mathfrak{X}_r(SU(2)))$ is trivial, where $\mathfrak{X}_r(SU(2))$ is the character variety $SU(2)^r/SU(2)$. This ultimately allows for the computation of the Poincaré polynomial of the real moduli spaces $\mathfrak{X}_r(SL(3,\mathbb{R}))$. 

Maybe this should be a comment, but it sounds like you might want to look into the activities of the IMU's Commision for Developing Countries. In particular, see their Volunteer Lecturer Program. 

Given that Hartog's Extension Theorem seems to give an affirmative answer when $X\setminus U$ is compact, I suspect that answer is no since $X\setminus U$ is not necessarily compact in this setting. Natural generalizations: More generally, one can remove the assumption that $X$ and $Y$ are diffeomorphic to affine space and simply ask that they are diffeomorphic. Also, one can weaken the hypothesis that $X$, $Y$ are complex affine varieties and assume instead they are Stein manifolds. Motivation: Given that exotic affine spaces need not be biholomorphic (see this MO question, its answer, and the main reference), an affirmative answer here would imply that there exist exotic affine spaces that are not birational. This would potentially answer this MO question if one can show that equality in the Grothendieck ring would imply birationallity in this context (as suggested in the comments). Remark: Regardless of the motivation, this question, and its generalizations, seem to me might be of independent interest, so I decided to post it separately. However, as I am not an analyst, I worry that I am asking a question with a trivial counter-example. Apologies if that is the case. 

I recommend reading the very nice exposition here (which is where I learned this fact): Schwarz, Gerald W. The topology of algebraic quotients. Topological methods in algebraic transformation groups (New Brunswick, NJ, 1988), 135–151, Progr. Math., 80, Birkhäuser Boston, Boston, MA, 1989. In particular, see the proof starting at the bottom of Page 141. 

Failed Counter Example: Any open orbit maps to a point, so generally the GIT quotient is not an open map (see comments for the mistake). Failed Proof of Openness: We work over $\mathbb{C}$. Take an open set $U\subset X$ then $U\cap X^{ps}$ is open in $X^{ps}$ (with respect to the relative topology) where $X^{ps}$ is the set of polystable points (points with closed orbits). Therefore $U\cap X^{ps}$ maps to an open set in $X^{ps}/G$ since $p:X^{ps}\to X^{ps}/G$ is an open map (this follows from the definition of the quotient topology and the fact that $G$ acts by homeomorphisms). But that set is equal to the image of $U$ under the GIT projection (this step is the mistake). Hence it is open in $X//G$ since $X//G\cong X^{ps}/G$ (see for example Theorem 2.1 here). Weak Correction: Whenever $p(U\cap X^{ps})\supset\pi(U)$ for all open $U,$ then $\pi$ is an open map in the strong topology. This follows from the above failed proof, since it fills the gap with an assumption. Remark: On the other hand, if one wants to understand the space $X//G$ in the strong topology one can replace $\pi:X\to X//G$ by $p:X^{ps}\to X^{ps}/G$. The latter is open while we now know the former might not be, but as a space in the strong topology $X//G$ remains homeomorphic to $X^{ps}/G.$ More still, as per Proposition 3.4 here, the usual quotient $X/G$ is homotopic to $X//G$.
