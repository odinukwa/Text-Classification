Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group defined over some algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$ and also over some subfield $k\subset \mathbb{K}$. There is thus a natural group structure on the set of $k$-points of $G$. It seems impossible to me that this group is cyclic and infinite. Is this true? EDIT: user48841 explained that this happens with elliptic curves. I am in fact interested in linear algebraic groups. 

Note that the blow-up of the union of irreducible is not the same as the consecutive blow-ups of the components (except if they are disjoint, as Allen Knutson explained). For example the blow-up of two lines intersecting in the projective space is singular (check in coordinates) and the two ways of blowing-up the lines one after the other give two smooth threefolds. 

It is a result of Nagata but it is easy to explain (at least to se the difference between $r\le 8$ and $r\ge 9$): The Picard group of the blow-up is generated by $L$, the pull-back of a general line, and $E_1,...,E_r$ the exceptional curves. Any curve disctinct from the $E_i$'s is linearly equivalent to $C=dL-\sum a_i E_i$ for some integers $d,a_1,\dots,a_r$ with $d>0$, which is the degree of the image of the curve in $\mathbb{P}^2$. The integer $a_i=E_i\cdot C$ is the multiplicity of this curve at $a_i$ and is then non-negative. If $C$ is a $(-1)$-curve, we have $C^2=-1$ and $C\cdot C+C\cdot K_S=-2$ (adjunction formula) so $\sum a_i=3d-1$ $\sum (a_i)^2=d^2+1$ By Cauchy-Schwartz we have $(\sum a_i)^2\le r\sum (a_i^2)$, which yields $9d^2-6d+1\le rd^2+r$. For $r\le 8$, we find thus only finitely many possiblities for $d$ ($d\le 6$), hence only finitely many $(-1)$-curves and for $r\ge 9$ we get infinitely many solutions. It remains to see that the set of infinitely many numeric solutions gives infinitely many curves in the case $r\ge 9$. By a dimension count, we find that $|C|$ is not empty for each numeric solution. The fact that the points are in general position "should" imply that $|C|$ counts in fact an irreducible element. (This last part is the only one where something has to be checked; it seems natural but is not so easy, see the Nagata and Harbourne-Hirschowitz conjecture). 

As rita said $\mathbb{P}(1,\dots,1,k)$ is naturally isomorphic to the cone in $\mathbb{P}^{N+1}$ over the $k$-th embedding (Take the map which sends $(x_1:\dots:x_n:y)$ onto $((x_1)^k:(x_1)^{k-1}x_2:...:(x_n)^k:y)$ where the $N+1$ first coordinates are the monomials of degree $k$ in $x_1,\dots,x_n$), so there is a natural morphism from the group $G=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{P}(1,\dots,1,k))$ to $\mathrm{PGL}(n,\mathbb{K})$. However, the kernel is not the one which was described in the above answer. We can in fact give $G$ more explicitly (because there are a priori many extensions given two groups): We choose $k>1$ (otherwise the description is different and obvious). We identify $\mathbb{K}^{N+1}$ with the set of homogeneous polynomials of degree $k$ in $n$ variables. The group $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{K})$ naturally acts on $\mathbb{K}^{N+1}$. Let $H$ be the semi-direct product $\mathbb{K}^{N+1}\rtimes \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{K})$. There is a natural surjective map $H\to G$, that we describe now: The action of $\mathbb{K}^{N+1}$ on $\mathbb{P}(1,\dots,1,k)$ is given by $(x_1:\dots:x_n:y)\mapsto (x_1:\dots:x_n:y+P(x_1,\dots,x_n))$ where $P\in\mathbb{K}^{N+1}$ is the corresponding polynomial. The action of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{K})$ on $\mathbb{P}(1,\dots,1,k)$ is given by the action on $x_1,\dots,x_n$. It yields thus a morphism $H\to G$ whose kernel is the subgroup $L$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{K})$ consisting of diagonal matrices of the form $\{\lambda I| \lambda^k=1\}$. The group $G=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{P}(1,\dots,1,k))$ is thus equal to the quotient of $\mathbb{K}^{N+1}\rtimes \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{K})$ by the subgroup $L$. The surjective morphism $G\to \mathrm{PGL}(n,\mathbb{K})$ corresponds to the projection on $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{K})/L$ followed by the quotient by the image of all diagonal matrices (we have first killed only finitely many and then kill all others). The kernel of this map is thus equal to $\mathbb{K}^{N+1}\rtimes\mathbb{K}^{*}/L$. 

This is false in the other cases. Let $\alpha=2\pi/n$ and observe that the interior of the polygon with $n$ given by $(cos(i\alpha),sin(i\alpha))_{i=0,\dots,n}$ is given by $n$ affine inequalities (of degree $1$ but with constants), but not less. Hence, the cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ generated by $(cos(i\alpha),sin(i\alpha),1)_{i=0,\dots,n}$ is not given by less than $n$ linear inequalities, and is thus not the intersection of less than $n$ halfspaces (just consider the intersection of your halfspaces with the plane where the third coordinate is $1$). The same argument works for the cone in $\mathbb{R}^4$ generated by $(cos(i\alpha),sin(i\alpha),1,0)_{i=0,\dots,n}$ and $(0,0,0,1)$ and $(0,0,0,-1)$ (intersect with the plane where the third coordinate is $1$ and the last is $0$). 

The group $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{Z})$ acts on $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$ by right multiplication (the same kind of things can be done with left action). I denote by $H\subset \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{Z})$ the isotropy group of $(1,\dots,1)$, which corresponds to the group of matrices such that each column has an odd number of odd values. Then $H$ has index $2^n-1$ is maximal and if $n\ge 3$, it is generated by permutations, diagonal matrices and two simple upper triangular matrices with two ones or one two outside of the diagonal. I came to this group with questions of algebraic geometry and my questions are the following: Is this group studied somewhere in the literature? Is this useful to something else? Are the (easy) results about generators stated above written somewehere? 

The quotient of the affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$ by the symmetric group $Sym_n$ is again an affine space of the same dimension, and invariants are given by elementary symmetric polynomials. What about a $n$-cycle? More precisely, what are the generators of the invariants of the action of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ on $\mathbb{A}^n$ given by $(x_1,\dots,x_n)\mapsto (x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n,x_1)$ ? It is probably classical, but I was not able to find it. 

Let $L/K$ be a Galois extension (I am interested in $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}$ so I do not assume it to be finite). Let $V\subset L^n$ be a $L$-subvector space, of dimension $d$, such that $g(V)=V$ for each $g\in \mathrm{Gal}(L/K)$. Do you have a reference for the fact that the dimension of the $K$-vector space $V\cap K^n$ is equal to $d$? It seems to me that it corresponds to a Galois descent and I've looked into books for this notion but I did not find something with this precise statement. 

Given some algebraic closed curve in the affine space $\mathbb{A}^3_\mathbb{C}$, is there a way to decide whether its ideal (polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[X,Y,Z]$ vanishing on the curve) is generated by two elements? I am mostly interested in the case where the curve is smooth and irreducible. 

Another way to do it is to compute explicitly the curve above the point at infinity, just by looking at the equation. The argument works over any field, we can of course assume that this one is algebraically closed. The curve $y^d=\prod_{i=1}^n (x-t_i)^{m_i}$ is affine, and covers the affine line which coordinate is $x$. If you want to see what happens at infinity, you just change coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^1$, which corresponds to take affine coordinate $X=1/x$. Assume that each $t_i$ is not equal to zero (otherwise, make an affine change of coordinates at begin). We then have $\prod_{i=1}^n (x-t_i)^{m_i}=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^n (1/t_i-1/x)^{m_i}}{\prod_{i=1}^n (xt_i)^{m_i}}$. (a) If $\sum m_i$ is a multiple of $d$, you write $\sum m_i=ad$ and make a change of variables $Y=yx^a$ and get $(\prod_{i=1}^n t_i^{m_i} )Y^d=\prod_{i=1}^n (1/t_i-X)^{m_i}$ In this case, the curve is not ramified at infinity, which is $X=0$. (b) If $\sum m_i$ is not a multiple of $d$, you write $\sum m_i=ad-k$ where $1\le k< d$ and make a change of variables $Y=yx^a$ and get $(\prod_{i=1}^n t_i^{m_i} )Y^d=X^k\prod_{i=1}^n (1/t_i-X)^{m_i}$ In this case, the curve is ramified at infinity. 

In this article: $URL$ you can find some descriptions of the generators of the Cremona group over the reals, and get some other results. See also the references inside. 

First, a $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^2$ is by definition rational, because it is locally trivial. What you want is probably a fibration over $\mathbb{P}^2$ with general fibre rational (but not the generic fibre), and which is not rational. For this, consider conic bundles over $\mathbb{P}^2$. The discriminant is the curve of $\mathbb{P}^2$ where the conic becomes singular. If the discriminant has a large degree, then the 3fold tha you get is birationnaly rigid and the conic bundle structure is in fact unique. This is a theorem of Sarkisov, which gave rise to a so called Sarkisov program, very useful for these questions. You have the same kind of result for del Pezzo fibration over the line, the general fibre is rational and the target too but the 3fold us not. Have a look at page 283 of the book "birationnally rigid varieties" by A. Pukhlikov. On google books, the page is available . It gives good idea of the story. 

Let $X$ be a smooth projective surface (in the category of varieties, or schemes), and let $C\subset X$ be a curve (a priori not irreducible, but the irreducible case in itself is already interesting). There are classical notions that say when it is possible to have a morphism $X\to Y$, where $Y$ is a variety (or a scheme) which contracts $C$ (onto points) and which restricts to an isomorphism on $X\backslash C$. The matrix of intersection numbers of the components of $C$ need in particular to be negatively defined. 1) If we admit $Y$ to be an algebraic space, are the conditions weaker? (I think that the matrix has again to be negatively defined, reading Artin, "Algebraic spaces" Theorem 4.5, but are there other conditions that are weaker?) 2) If we admit $Y$ to be an algebraic stack, is the matrix again negatively defined or are there counterexamples? 

The surface, as a surface defined over $\mathbb{k}$, is a del Pezzo surface if and only if it is a del Pezzo surface, viewed as a surface defined over $\overline{\mathbb{k}}$. So your surface is a del Pezzo surface of degree $5$ if and only if your birational morphism contracts exactly four $(-1)$-curves, and if the image of the four points are such that no $3$ are collinear. Note that if the four curves are all defined over $\mathbb{k}$, then the surface is unique, up to isomorphism, since the points can be chosen to be $[1:0:0]$, $[0:1:0]$, $[0:0:1]$, $[1:1:1]$. However, there are different del Pezzo surfaces of degree $5$, not isomorphic over $\mathbb{k}$ (but only one isomorphism class over $\overline{\mathbb{k}}$), since you can blow-up points not defined over $\overline{\mathbb{k}}$, and the Picard group over $\mathbb{k}$ can be smaller than $5$.
