I've got a model of endogenous growth due to spillovers. $\textbf{Model:}$ $$K_t=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^nk_t$$ In this model, $k_t$ is chosen by agents, and $K_t=\bar{k}_t$ (the average of all $k_t$). Now, agents want to dynamically maximize utility (under certain constraints) and they have CRRA (constant relative risk aversion) utility, so the maximization looks like: $$\sum_{t=0}^\infty\beta^t\bigg(\frac{c_t^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}\bigg)$$ $$s.t.\;Y_t=k_t^\alpha(E_tL)^{1-\alpha}$$ $$c_t+i_t=Y_t$$ $$k_{t+1}=(1-\delta)k_t+i_t$$ $$c_t,i_t\geq0$$ $E_tL$ is effective labor and the rest of the variables are typical (I can give their definitions if requested). One last addition to the model is that there are two equilibrium constraints: $$E_t=\frac{K_t}{L}$$ $$k_t=K_t$$ $\textbf{Solution:}$ Using an Euler equation approach, two terms in the objective: $$...\frac{\beta^t[k_t^\alpha K_t^{1-\alpha}+(1-\delta)k_t-k_{t+1}]^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}+\frac{\beta^{t+1}[k_{t+1}^\alpha K_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}+(1-\delta)k_{t+1}-k_{t+2}]^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}...$$ FOC: w.r.t $k_{t+1}$ and substituting in consumption: $$\beta^tc_t^{-\gamma}=\beta^{t+1}c_{t+1}^{-\gamma}[\alpha k_{t+1}^{\alpha-1}K_{t+1}^{1-\alpha}+1-\delta]$$ Substituting in the equilibrium constraints: $$c_t^{-\gamma}=\beta c_{t+1}^{-\gamma}[\alpha+1-\delta]$$ $$\implies \frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t}=[\beta(\alpha+1-\delta)]^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}$$ This implies that consumption grows at a constant rate which depends on preference parameters. The next thing I want to prove that we have a balanced growth path. By this I mean that all variables grow at the same constant rate. $$\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}=\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t}?$$ I have started to answer the question, but I have gotten stuck. Here is what I have so far: $$k_{t+1}=k_t^\alpha K_t^{1-\alpha}+(1-\delta)k_t-c_t$$ In equilibrium $K_t=k_t$: $$k_{t+1}=k_t+(1-\delta)k_t-c_t$$ $$\implies \frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}=1+(1-\delta)-\frac{c_t}{k_t}$$ If we have a constant rate of capital growth, suppose: $$\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}<\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t}$$ If this is true: $$\underset{t\rightarrow \infty}{lim}\;\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}=\underset{t\rightarrow \infty}{lim}\;1+(1-\delta)-\frac{c_t}{k_t}=-\infty$$ This means that the growth rate will continue decreasing. Now there are two ways this can happen. The first way is if $\underset{t\rightarrow \infty}{lim}\;k_t=-\infty$, which would clearly show that it couldn't be the case because capital cannot be negative. The second way which this could happen is if $\underset{t\rightarrow \infty}{lim}\;k_t=D$ where $D$ is some positive horizontal asymptote. If it did approach some asymptote, there is no reason why it could not be the case that consumption grows at a faster rate than capital. This is where I am stuck. How can I show that it cannot converge to some asymptote, and that $\underset{t\rightarrow \infty}{lim}\;k_t=-\infty$? Also, if there is an easier way to show that this model exhibits balanced growth paths, what is it? Any help would be greatly appreciated! 

The first thing we must ask is about which part of advertising are we speaking? Are we talking about advertising on television and other entertainment mediums or are we talking about advertisement via the packaging of the good itself? One impact either way would be an increase in competition amongst monopolistically competitive firms. These firms are often selling products which accomplish the same ends, however they differentiate their goods in order to give them a competitive edge. The main way which they convey this differentiation to consumers is through advertising. Therefore, if they cannot advertise this differentiation, consumer information may be limited and they may not see a difference between the firm's product and other products in the market. This will lead to parity among products and will move the market closer to a purely competitive market. Now, sometimes the only differentiation may be the advertising itself (in the form of packaging). For goods such as water bottles (barring whether the water is enhanced somehow) this is the case. There has been much research done to ascertain the best way to package your products in order to draw the consumer to the product. If this was limited, then markets such as these would move towards a purely competitive market. 

Intuitively, I would say no. The main power that a monopoly has is that the firm can change prices at will, whereas a competitive firm has no power over price. The competitive market demand curve slopes downward simply because of the law of demand. The typical procedure is to take the price determined by the aggregated demand curve as given and set the individual firm's demand curve equal to that. This seems peculiar (to assume to know the market demand before you know the firm's demand), but given the assumptions of perfect competition (particularly perfect knowledge), this does make some sense. If every firm has perfect knowledge of demand for their good, then they inherently know the market demand curve. The reason why this is important is because that is how you derive the price taking behavior of competitive firms. Now that we have determined why price taking behavior exists, we can discuss whether competitive markets (as a whole) can behave like monopolies. The answer to this is that it would be nearly impossible for an aggregate competitive market to behave like a cartel (monopoly). The reason for this is because of the perfectly elastic nature of their demand. Suppose, somehow every firm agreed to increase their price to the exact same amount at the exact same time. Suppose further one firm had the ability to produce enough of the good to meet demand at a certain price. This firm (or any firms like it) would have a huge incentive to lower their price because by lowering their price (even by an infinitesimally small amount), they would instantly capture all of the demand for the good. If just one firm decides to cheat, then the whole market would end up right back at where they started at the original market price. For this reason, it is nearly impossible for an aggregated perfectly competitive market to act like a cartel. 

Here is another way we could solve this problem with some simple calculus. We first start by maximizing the utility function subject to the budget constraint and the time constraint. $$\underset{L,C}{max}\;\underset{s.t.\;C=100+w(40-L)}{L^{1/2}C^{1/2}}\qquad (1)$$ $$\underset{L}{max}\;L^{1/2}[100+w(40-L)]^{1/2}\qquad (2)$$ $\textbf{FOC:}$ $$\bigg(\frac{100+w(40-L)}{L}\bigg) ^{1/2}=w\bigg(\frac{L}{100+w(40-L)}\bigg) ^{1/2}\qquad (3) $$ With some math $$L=\frac{50+20w}{w}\qquad (4)$$ Let $N$ be the number of hours worked. If you plug 5 and 8 in for $w$, you get 10 and 13.75 for $N$ respectively. Now we have two points $(5,10),(8,13.75)$. Solving for slope we get $\frac{13.75-10}{8-5}=1.25$. Now we must consider the intercept. Because $w=0$ is not defined, we must use the other intercept (where labor hours equal zero). $$40-L=0\implies 40-\bigg(\frac{50+20w}{w}\bigg)=0\qquad (4)$$ With some math, we get $w=2.5$ $$\implies\qquad N=1.25(w-2.5)\qquad (5)$$ If we did not want to impose the restriction of linearity on the relationship between labor hours and real wage, we would simply use equation (4): $$N=40-\bigg(\frac{50+20w}{w}\bigg)\qquad (6)$$ I know your question specified a linear relationship between labor hours and real wages, however this method of solving this question does not impose this restriction, which is nice because, as we can see, the relationship between labor hours and real wage is not actually linear. 

My professor told me that each term of the Black-Scholes formula satisfy the Black-Scholes PDE. I have been trying to work this out for the last week and have been unsuccessful. I correctly showed the first term satisfied it, but I have had difficulty with the second term. My work is below: We need to show that: $$Q=-ke^{-r(T-t)}N\bigg(\frac{log\big(\frac{S}{k}\big)+(r-\delta+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}-\sigma\sqrt{T-t}\bigg)$$ (where $N(w)$ is a standard normal distribution evaluated at $w$) satisfies the following: $$(r-\delta)Q_sS+Q_t+\frac{1}{2}Q_{ss}\sigma^2S^2-rQ=0$$ Where $Q_s,\;Q_{ss}\;and\,Q_t$ are the derivative of Q w.r.t S, the second derivative of Q w.r.t S, and the derivative of Q w.r.t t respectively. Let $d_2=\frac{log\big(\frac{S}{k}\big)+(r-\delta+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}-\sigma\sqrt{T-t}$ $$Q_s=\frac{-ke^{-r(T-t)}N'(d_2)}{s\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}$$ $$Q_{ss}=\frac{-ke^{-r(T-t)}N''(d_2)\big(\frac{1}{s\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}\big)-\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}{S^2\sigma^2(T-t)}$$ $$Q_t=-kre^{-r(T-t)}N(d_2)+N'(d2)\bigg(\frac{log\big(\frac{S}{k}\big)}{2\sigma(T-t)^{\frac{3}{2}}}-\frac{r-\delta+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2+\sigma}{2\sqrt{T-t}}\bigg)$$ When I plug these derivatives into the Black-Scholes PDE, I cannot get the equality to hold. Can anyone please help? 

Rearranging your demand and supply equations gives us: $$P=Q_s\quad and\quad P=12-Q_D$$ Adding the tax on the supply side gives us: $$P=Q_s+4$$ Solving for equilibrium, we get $P=8$ and $Q=4$ However, we did not necessarily need to solve for this equilibrium because the Supply curve shifted left, and the new intercept is at $P=4$. This implies that no plastic will be produced domestically because the world price will be lower at any positive level of production. To solve for total surplus, we need only solve for consumer surplus because no production will occur domestically. We need to solve for $Q_D$ when $P=4$. $$4=12-Q_D\implies Q_D=8$$ $$\implies TS=CS=\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\bigg)*8*8=32$$ Is this the same as when there is no trade and no tax? $$P=Q_s\qquad P=12-Q_D$$ Equilibrium yields $P=Q=6$ $$TS=CS+PS-DWL$$ $$TS=CS=\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\bigg)*6*6$$ To calculate $DWL$, we split the cost into private cost and social cost. When we do this $$PC=Q\qquad SC=Q+4$$ The values we need to calculate the $DWL$ triangle end up being $Q=4$, $P_{PC}=4$ and $P_{SC}=8$ $$DWL=\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\bigg)*4*4=8$$ $$\implies TS=18+18-8=32$$ Your intuition was correct that the total surplus is the same in both cases. 

Let us quickly define a competitive market. A competitive market satisfies the following: 1) All firms sell an identical product 2) All firms and buyers are price takers (have no control over price) 3) Buyers and firms have complete information about the market 4) The market is characterized by free entry (no barriers to entry) If this is the market structure, we can have the existence of pareto optimality, so I am assuming this is the competitive market to which you are referring in your question. What happens when we try to relax assumption 4? We can show this using your example of startup capital: Suppose we have a competitive market and the amount of startup capital needed to enter this market is $A$. When deciding to enter this market the firm would subtract $A$ from the long term profit possibility $\Pi$ (because it would be another cost). By definition $A\geq 0$. Because the situation where $A=0$ is trivial (because that means there is no startup capital needed), we know that $A>0$. Suppose at a point in time there is opportunity for profit in this market. As long as $\Pi\geq 0$ firms will decide to enter the market, but if $\Pi <0$, a firm would decide not to enter the market. However, note that firms who are already in the market are earning positive profit. This is a contradiction because if positive profits persist, we do not have a competitive market. As you noted in your question, a competitive market is a necessary condition for the existence of pareto optimality. If the nonexistence of barriers to entry is a necessary condition for a competitive market, nonexistence of barriers to entry is also a necessary condition for pareto optimality.
