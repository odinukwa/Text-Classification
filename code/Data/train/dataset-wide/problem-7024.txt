Let's say that I buy an app from the Play store. The seller quotes in Dollars, and I pay in Rupees (INR) --how does this transaction happen? Is my â‚¹ converted into $? Does this transaction also influence the forex markets (of course, negligibly --I'm only asking for understanding's sake). If I have to purchase a physical good while in the US, I'd have to convert my domestic currency into dollars and that'd push the dollar prices up since there is demand for more dollars. Does the same happen when I'm at a different country and purchase a good in dollars? 

I'm a student and I want to determine the demand for a product (and consequently determine what will happen if the price of the product increases). I don't have access to any businesses that can provide the data for me (price and demand at that price? How do I estimate the demand curve or function by surveying people? What I currently have in mind is to ask people what amount of the product they'll demand at a given price and extrapolate this data for a city or a region. Additionally, what'd be a good sample size for such a survey? 

Suppose we want to find the contributions of the variables to the given function: $$f(x,y)= {x\over{y}}$$ To find the growth rates of the given variables first take the logarithm of the function $f(x,y)$: $$ln(f(x,y))=ln\left({x\over{y}}\right)=ln(x)-ln(y)$$ And then take the partial derivative of the variable you would like to analyze: $${\partial ln\left({x\over{y}}\right)\over{\partial x}}={\dot{x}\over{x}}$$ $${\partial ln \left({x \over{y}} \right)\over{\partial y}}=-{\dot{y}\over{y}}$$ Where $\dot{x}$ and $\dot{y}$ are the derivatives of $x$ and $y$ respectively Thus in your case if you would like to find the contributions to growth to leverage you can simply do the same thing as above. i.e. $$\mathfrak{L}={{l+b}\over{l+b+e}}$$ Where: $\mathfrak{L}=$ leverage $l=$ loans $b=$ bonds $e=$ equity Thus $$ln \left( \mathfrak{L} \right)= ln(l+b) -ln(l+b+e)$$ you can thus find the contributions to growth by the variables involved by taking the partial derivative of the variable you wish to examine. Hope this is helpful!! 

This being said there is one thing that comes to mind when wanting to model house pricing based on this reality: Game Theory. My Question: Is there any (famous or otherwise) papers which discuss the nature of Game Theory in the housing market? (Papers with computer simulations of the housing market are additionally helpful!) 

I found a better diagram illustrating this (the diagram includes two cases: one with the BP flatter than the LM and one steeper; the points and movements marked with an asterik (*) are the ones concerned with the case of BP being steeper than the LM). (Image Courtesy of Polinomics: $URL$ 

I'm stuck at figuring out the effect of a fiscal expansion in the case of floating exchange rate with the BP curve steeper than the LM curve. My textbook has not mentioned it but I'd like to how it'd turn out. Here's my guess: 

We consider highways to be an example of an impure private good because while it is non-excludable, it is a rival good. That is, another person's consumption (usage) of the highway affects my usage of it. In that same sense, wouldn't a fire station also be rival, at least in theory? For example, if a fire stations has five trucks for a locality, and 6 fires break out at separate places, why can't we consider this service as a rival service? 

Recall the steady state level of unemployment is: $$u^*={q\over{q+f}}$$ where: $q=$ job separation rate $\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space f=$ job finding rate Thus, to try to lower the natural rate of unemployment would man to try to reduce the job separation rate $q$ and increase the job finding rate $f$. Examples of methods for increasing the job finding rate are: Government employment agencies: disseminate info about job openings to better match workers and jobs. Public Job training programs: help workers displaced from declining industries get skills needed for jobs in growing industries. An example which can be used to reduce job separation rate is: Labor unions: Unions exercise monopoly power to secure higher wages, better working conditions etc. for their members.This in turn can help reduce the job separation rate by providing conditions which would be more suitable for for members employed to want to still hold onto their present jobs. Hope this is helpful!! 

My question : The way the case seems to be presented is that the architect is forced to choose 40 percent in light of the alternative where there is no profits to be gained. What about the architect's opportunity cost? Isn't there what to be gained from the architect when refusing this split of profits in a 40-60 split as far as opportunity cost in concerned? 

I'm currently learning the Mundell Fleming model, and so from my textbook and other sources I've figured out the effect of increase in money supply and government expenditure increase for the following conditions: 

Four-fifths of Algeria is just desert --which leaves no room for agriculture. The Algerian economy is mostly powered just by the oil industry, which contribute about ~70% of government revenues. Oil and oil related products constitute more than 80% of Algeria's exports. For example, Turkey has twice the population of Algeria but it has more than 7.5 times the cattle Algeria has. (14.2 in Turkey vs 1.6 in Algeria). So the short answer is that Algeria isn't just suited for Agriculture. 

I know that the Chilean central bank intervened in 2001 twice. Has it ever intervened since then? Is the Chilean Peso a completely free float currency? 

If not, what type of trade financing do Chilean exporters or importers get? Is it all from private banks and insurers? 

I wanted to verify the relationship between inflation and unemployment empirically, so I took data from the World Bank and used excel to correlate them. I got a very, very bad correlation between unemployment and inflation (from 1991 to 2016). Am I doing something wrong here? I took these two sets of indicators: (1) Unemployment, total (modeled ILO estimate) and (2) Inflation, consumer prices. Here are the links: $URL$ and $URL$ I downloaded the data from here and I studied the data for the United States of America. Is the low correlation because of the fact that the market needs time to react to unemployment rates? If so how did Phillips study it in the first place? 

That being said if there is never such an instance, does there exist a general proof refuting such an instance? 

My Question Are there any real world examples (from the past and/or present) of policy recommendations by economists which are potential Pareto improvements? If so, how? 

The Consumer price index of a country is defined as: $$CPI_{t}^{t_0}={{P_{1t} Q_{1t_0}+P_{2t}Q_{2t_0}+P_{3t}Q_{3t_0}}\over{P_{1t_0}}Q_{1t_0}+P_{2t_0}Q_{2t_0}+P_{3t_0}Q_{3t_0}} \times 100$$ where $P$ is price, $Q$ is quantity, $t$ is reference to current year and $t_0$ is reference to the base year. So using this formula we get: $${{10\times8 +4 \times 15+18 \times 6}\over{9 \times 8+3 \times 15 +12 \times 6}} \times 100 \approx 131.2 $$ Now finding the inflation rate we can see (CPI of the base year is always going to be $100$) $${{131.2-100}\over{100}} \times 100 \% \approx 31\%$$ Hope this is helpful! 

Recall, that the directional derivative of a function is defined as the the rate at which the function $f(x,y,z)$ at a given point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ changes in direction of the vector $v$, where $||v||$ is the norm of $v$1. What comes to mind Applications of the directional derivative can be used in determining the rate of switching inputs in production functions, which can be very helpful in determining/forecasting switching costs for a given bundle of inputs. Though it does not tell you where the optimum points are it does tell you the rate of change (i.e. the switching costs) of moving to a different bundle. Hope this is helpful 1 $URL$ 

Can this one-off cases be extended? For instance, if I employ someone to destroy 50 buildings and rebuild them, does that contribute an increase in GDP? 

Yes, the diagram represented in the question is correct. Assuming imperfect capital mobility (with the BP curve steeper than the LM curve), an increase in G will: 

Recently in a test I was asked to describe the modified IS-LM framework. I assumed I was being asked the IS-LM-BP model, since it modifies the traditional IS LM model by adding a BP curve. I looked up on a couple of references (Macroeconomics by Dornbusch, and Macroeconomics by Olivier Blanchard) but they have no reference to it. Looking the term up on a search engine only throws results about papers that suggest a modification to the IS LM model. What exactly is a modified IS-LM framework? 

Let's say we have a soft-drinks store. Say the store sells Pepsi and Coke. If the retailer drinks a bottle of coke from his own store, does that get counted into the GDP of a nation? Or is it only counted if someone else apart from the store owner consumes it by paying for it? How does this work?
