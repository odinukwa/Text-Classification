I am interested in a multiplayer game where one player gains utility, not just by winning, but by seeing one other player (chosen in advance) lose (or come in last place if the game has an ordered finish). Obviously, the best case scenario for this player would be to win and his 'prey' to come in last, and the worst case scenario is where he comes in last and his 'prey' wins. I wanted to look at two scenarios. The first scenario is where the 'prey' does not know that they are being targeted, and the second scenario is where they do know. I have looked for a paper with a similar style game, but have been unsuccessful. Does anyone know if a game like this has been analyzed? Your help would be greatly appreciated. Note that this is different from a Zero-Sum game in a Predation Model Also, if there has been no work done on this, do you think this would be an interesting game to analyze, and would it have any real world applications? 

Two goods are strategic complements if: $$\frac{\partial \pi_1}{\partial q_2}>0\;\text{and}\;\frac{\partial \pi_2}{\partial q_1}>0$$ The image below is a picture of best response functions and isoprofit curves for strategic complements 

$\textbf{Full disclaimer:}$ I am studying for my candidacy exams and this question is from one of the exams last year. 

$\textbf{My work:}$ Combining the constraints we get: $$c_t=A_tk_t^\alpha+(1-\delta)k_t-k_{t+1}$$ Taking two terms from the objective function we get: $$...+\beta^t\bigg(\frac{\big(A_tk_t^\alpha+(1-\delta k_t-k_{t+1}\big)^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}\bigg)+\beta^{t+1}\bigg(\frac{\big(A_{t+1}k_{t+1}^\alpha+(1-\delta k_{t+1}-k_{t+2}\big)^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}\bigg)+...$$ Differentiating w.r.t $k_{t+1}$ and substituting consumption back in we get: $$c_t^{-\gamma}=\beta\bigg[\alpha \bigg(\frac{A_{t+1}k_{t+1}^\alpha}{k_{t+1}}\bigg)+(1-\delta)\bigg]c_{t+1}^{-\gamma}$$ $$\implies \frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t}=\bigg[\beta\bigg(\alpha\bigg(\frac{y_{t+1}}{k_{t+1}}\bigg)+(1-\delta)\bigg)\bigg]^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}\qquad(1)$$ I also derived: $$\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}=(1-\delta)+\frac{c_t}{k_t}-\frac{y_t}{k_t}\qquad(2)$$ $$\frac{y_{t+1}}{y_t}=e^\mu\bigg(\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}\bigg)^\alpha\qquad(3)$$ My train of thought is the following: $\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}=\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t}$ because if $\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}>\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t}$ we would not satisfy the transversality condition because we would have capital in the "last" period which means we cannot be maximizing consumption. If $\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}<\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t}$, we would eventually not be able to maintain constant consumption. Using that and the fact that the ratio of output to capital will be constant over time, equating equations (1) and (2) yields the following messy results: $$\bigg(\frac{y_t}{k_t}\bigg)^\gamma+\alpha\beta\bigg(\frac{y_t}{k_t}\bigg)=\bigg((1-\delta)+\frac{c_t}{k_t}\bigg)^\gamma+\beta(1-\delta)$$ As far as I can tell, this equation isn't solvable. Does this mean I cannot say that the growth rate of consumption is equal to the growth rate of capital or have I made a mistake somewhere along the way? Also, how would one solve for the growth rates if not this way?? 

I am studying for my qualifiers, and I ran into this question from a previous year's exam. $\textbf{Question:}$ Consider a two-consumer two-good pure exchange economy. Both preferences are locally non-satiated and convex. Prove or disprove the following statement: if $(x_1,x_2)$ and $(\hat{x}_1,\hat{x}_2)$ are two different pareto optimal allocations, then the convex combination, $(\alpha x_1+(1-\alpha)\hat{x}_1,\alpha x_2+(1-\alpha)\hat{x}_2$ MUST also be pareto optimal for any $\alpha\in(0,1)$. I believe the statement is true, and here is the work for my proof below. $\textbf{My Proof:}$ By pareto optimality of $x_i$ and $\hat{x}_i$: $$\not\exists\; x_i^\star\; s.t.\; u_i(x_i^\star)\geq u_i(x_i)\;\forall i\; \text{and}\; u_i(x_i^\star)> u_i(x_i)\;\text{for at least one }i \;\text{or}\;u_i(x_i^\star)\geq u_i(\hat{x}_i)\;\forall i\; \text{and}\; u_i(x_i^\star)> u_i(\hat{x}_i)\;\text{for at least one }i$$ $$\implies\;u_i(\alpha x_i)\geq u_i(\alpha x_i^\star)\;\forall i\;\text{and}\;u_i((1-\alpha)\hat{x}_i)\geq u_i((1-\alpha)x_i^\star)\;\forall i$$ $$\implies\not\exists\;x_i^\star\;s.t.\;u_i(\alpha x_i^\star+(1-\alpha)x_i^\star)\geq u_i(\alpha x_i+(1-\alpha)\hat{x}_i)\;\forall i$$ $$\text{and}\;u_i(\alpha x_i^\star+(1-\alpha)x_i^\star)> u_i(\alpha x_i+(1-\alpha)\hat{x}_i)\;\text{for at least one}\;i$$ $$\implies (\alpha x_i+(1-\alpha)\hat{x}_i)\;\text{is pareto optimal}$$ $$\blacksquare$$ This proof seemed almost too easy, so I'm wondering if it is correct/rigorous. 

I believe that you are somewhat right (in the short run). S=I is a national accounting identity in the closed classical model, but is it valid in real life? The general consensus is no. You are right in thinking that a firm could simply use profits to invest (for a real life example look at Starbucks). However, if there was no savings, long run growth will be slow (if there is any at all). There are a couple reasons for this: 1) Monetary Expansion: When money is put into a bank (saved) it creates loans for businesses, and the money expands (by the money multiplier). A dollar saved can create loans for multiple firms, which increases investment by more than a dollar, whereas a dollar consumed only funds investment (maybe) for one firm. For this reason, a dollar saved tends to have more of an impact on investment than a dollar consumed. 2) No lending: If someone goes through their life consuming every dollar earned, then when they cannot work anymore, they will be in trouble. If they do not save, they must then borrow. This creates a huge problem, because from whom will they borrow? NOBODY SAVES. If there is some sort of government safety net like social security, then the government must pay these people. But since nobody saves (aka nobody buys government bonds), the government must always have a balanced budget, so government spending must decrease (since transfer payments are not included in government spending) in order to pay out social security. This leads to slowed (or even negative) growth. Therefore, if the government wants to maintain spending and growth, they cannot offer these social safety nets. Since the consumer cannot borrow from the government, and they cannot borrow in the private market, they can't consume. These are two reasons why savings is pivotal for growth. I hope this answer clears things up for you. 

I understand why the BR curves are upward sloping, but I am struggling to understand why the isoprofit curves are shaped the way they are. Can anyone give me the intuition behind the shape of these isoprofit curves? 

I read that if we have quasilinear utility for all consumers, then any pareto optimal allocation maximizes the sum of utility levels of all consumers. That is: $\textbf{What we know:}$ $$1)\quad u^i(m^i,x^i)=m^i+\phi^i(x^i)\; \quad \forall i=1,...,I$$ $$2)\quad\phi^i(\;)\;\text{is continous and strictly increasing (but not necessarily differentiable)}$$ $$3)\quad \text{An allocation,}\,x\, \text{satisfies}\;\neg\,\exists\,\hat{x}\; s.t. \;\hat{m}^i+\phi^i(\hat{x}^i)\geq m^i+\phi(x^i)\;\forall i$$ $$\text{and} \quad \hat{m}^i+\phi^i(\hat{x}^i)> m^i+\phi(x^i)\,\text{for some}\,i$$ $\textbf{What to show:}$ $$x\;\text{solves}\;max\sum_{i=1}^Im^i+\phi^i(x^i)$$ Can anyone provide a proof of this? Any help would be greatly appreciated! $\textbf{Edit:}\,$I don't know if this is the right path, but by the strict increasing property of $\phi(\,)$, preferences satisfy local non-satiation, which implies they satisfy the first welfare theorem. Now, If I could figure out whether all pareto optimal allocations are competitive equilibria with quasilinear utility, I may be on to something! 

I am curious as to how a firm which produces a giffen good would maximize profits? Having an upward sloping demand curve seems to imply that we cannot guarantee that there exists a quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost, and even if there is, would that point be the profit maximizing point? My thoughts are the following: There are two cases to look at: (1) If the marginal revenue curve never crosses the marginal cost curve (i.e. they have the same slope and a different intercept). This yields two sub-cases: $\qquad$(i) The marginal revenue curve lies above the marginal cost curve: This case would clearly $\qquad$lead to infinite production because the firm is always increasing profits. $\qquad$(ii) The marginal revenue curve lies below the marginal cost curve: This case would lead to $\qquad$ the firm choosing not to produce because they will always make a negative profit. (2) If the marginal revenue curve crosses the marginal cost curve. This also yields two sub-cases: $\qquad$(i) The marginal cost curve starts below the marginal revenue curve: This case seems to be$\qquad$ just like our classic case where we would see production up until the point where marginal $\qquad$ revenue is equal to marginal cost. $\qquad$(ii) The marginal cost curve starts above the marginal revenue curve: This case is the one $\qquad$that I find most interesting. Would this case lead to infinite production? After marginal $\qquad$revenue crosses marginal cost, marginal revenue also grows at a faster rate than marginal $\qquad$cost, so my intuition tells me the firm could earn infinite profits. 

For simplicity, I'll offer the simplest of endogenous models. Suppose we have the following scalar model: $y=\beta x+u$ where $E[ux]\neq 0,\;E[uz]=0\; \text{and}\;E[u^2|z]=\sigma^2$ Clearly we can use the following instrument to identify $\beta$: $$E[(y-\beta x)z]=0$$ However, suppose we have another moment condition using another variable, $w$: $$E[zw]=0$$ This moment condition doesn't contain any information about $\beta$, so under what conditions would we gain efficiency by using this additional moment condition? 

If you are a retailer, and the price you pay for one of your retail goods goes up, how do you price the inventory you already had (which you paid a lower price for)? Here is an example of a TFD (True, False, Debatable) type question for this idea: Suppose you run a hardware store, and the price you pay for sidewalk de-icer increases. You raise the price on the remaining stock of sidewalk de-icer in your store, for which you paid a lower price. I think the answer to this question is false. Increasing your price on the inventory you already had violates the PMP, so any other price would lower profits. 

I have an interest in financial economics, and I plan to take the graduate sequence, however I did not take an undergraduate course in that field. I would really appreciate it if someone could recommend a textbook for financial economics. I would prefer the book involved calculus, so I can get the fundamentals of problems (such as asset pricing) I may see in the future. Two books which have been recommended to me are: "The Economics of Financial Markets" by Roy E. Bailey and "Principles of Financial Economics" by LeRoy and Werner. Are either of these worth reading? 

We are writing a paper about the 'economic man.' By this, we mean that the choices he makes epitomize a rational economic thinker. However, we also acknowledge the fact that there are other, non-economic reasons that people make decisions such as religion. What (if any) literature addresses the idea that even with other considerations, a person will still act rationally in the economic sense. Preferably we would like to have a theoretical model that encases these other choice considerations. Also, we would love to hear whether there are any case studies on this idea. 

I will give a general answer (for the specification of utility maximization), and I will give a more specific example of Cobb-Douglas utility: $$U(x_i,y_i)=x_i^{\alpha_i}y_i^{1-\alpha_i}$$ $\textbf{Objective function:}$ In the utility maximization problem, the objective function is going to be the utility function. This is the function which you are trying to maximize. Therefore the objective function for agent $i$ in our example is: $$U(x_i,y_i)=x_i^{\alpha_i}y_i^{1-\alpha_i}$$ $\textbf{Constraint function:}$ The constraint function is the function that limits the agent's ability to consume. If these functions were not in place, any agent with a strictly increasing utility function would choose to consume infinite goods. The two most common types of constraints are resource constraints and budget constraints. Resource constraints are just a maximum amount of a resource available (which makes sense because we know that resources are finite). A budget constraint is basically a constraint that says that you cannot consume more goods than you can buy. Examples of the two are below: Resource constraint: $$\sum_{i=1}^nx_i=A,\quad \sum_{i=1}^ny_i=B$$ where $A,B<\infty$ Budget constraint: $$P_xx_i+P_yy_i= Z_i$$ where $Z_i$ is income of agent $i$ and $Z_i<\infty$ $\textbf{Choice variables:}$ These are the variables that each agent chooses to maximize utility. In our example the choice variables for agent $i$ are $x_i$ and $y_i$. $\textbf{Parameters:}$ Parameters are also called state variables. These are the variables which the agent has no control over. In our example the parameters are $\alpha_i,B,A,Z_i, P_y,P_x$. $\textbf{Policy function:}$ The policy function is also called the decision rule. This is what you get from solving the maximization problem. In the context of utility maximization problem, the policy function is the Marshallian demand (how much you want of each good). The policy function gives you your choice variables as functions of your state variables/parameters. 

$\textbf{Model:}$ $$\underset{\{c_t,k_t\}}{max}\;\sum_{t=0}^\infty\beta^t\frac{c_t^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}$$ $$s.t.\;c_t=Rk_{t-1}-k_t$$ $$c_t,k_t\geq0$$ At time $t$, $c_t$ is consumption and $k_{t-1}$ is the capital used in production. $0<\beta<1,\;\gamma>0,\;\gamma\neq1$ $\textbf{(a)}$ Compute a balanced growth path in which consumption and capital grow at constant rates. Solving this using the Euler equation, we get $$\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t}=\big(\beta R\big)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}$$ We know that capital must grow at the same rate as consumption in a balanced growth path, so $$\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t}=\big(\beta R\big)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}$$ This means that: $$c_t=\bigg(\frac{R}{(\beta R)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}}-1\bigg)k_t$$ $\textbf{(b)}$ What restrictions are necessary for both capital and consumption to grow at a positive rate on the balanced growth path? For this question, it seems like all we need is $R>1$ Now, my question is the following: How long will it take for consumption and capital to reach the balanced growth path? In general, how would one calculate time to balanced growth path? Or is it more based on economic intuition? $\textbf{Edit:}$ According to another student, the professor said this will never reach a balanced growth path. However, the professor never stated why. Can someone give me a reasoning as to why this would never reach a balanced growth path?
