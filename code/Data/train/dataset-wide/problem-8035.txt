Everything you describe happened to me and to my colleagues as authors. On your question "is it reasonable to demand" my answer is "no". I've never heard of the case when the author could change the decision by arguing with a redactor. Just send the paper to another journal. That's the only thing you can do. 

There is a book by Erik Fornaess and Nessim Sibony, MR1363948, survey papers of the same authors, MR1810536, MR1748606, MR1285389 and on various specific questions I also recommend papers of Misha Lyubich with various co-authors, and Eric Bedford and John Smillie, especially "Polynomial diffeomorphisms" in 8 parts. 

These classes of functions can be characterized in terms of the rate of growth of Taylor coefficients: MR0218567 Šeremeta, M. N.

Carlo Beenakker's answer is right. When t>0, you cannot close the contour in the lower half-plane, because the exp in the numerator is large in the lower half-plane. You must close the contour in the upper half-plane. Then your integral is 0, for $t>0$. When $t<0$ your series computed with residues converges. 

This question is addressed in the recent preprint arXiv:13112529, in section 7. This is a survey of computing Belyi maps from the designs, but section 7 addresses the inverse problem. 

Notice that $e^x$ does not have an inverse on the whole real line. Extension of iterates is possible if $f$ has a fixed point $x_0$. Suppose for example, that this fixed point is repelling that is $f(x_0)=x_0$ and $\lambda=f'(x_0)>1.$ I assume that $f$ is analytic, strictly increasing on $R$ and maps $R$ onto itself. The Poincare equation $$F(\lambda y)=f(F(y))$$ has a unique analytic solution subject to initial conditions $F(0)=x_0$ and $F'(0)=1$. This is a theorem of Poincare. You first find a convergent power series near $0$ which satisfies it, and then extend $F$ to the whole real line by the functional equation, using that $\lambda>1$. This solution is also strictly monotone, and you can define $$f^{\circ t}(x)=F(\lambda^t F^{-1}(x)).$$ Similar construction will work with $0<\lambda<1$ if you know that $f$ is surjective (just apply the construction to $f^{-1}$). If $f$ is not surjective, then $F$ is not surjective, the fractional iterates can still be defined but their domain will not be $R$. 

Let $F(z)=1+z$ and $\phi(z)=zf(z)$. Then $\phi$ is an analytic function mapping the unit disk into itself, and $\phi(0)=0$, and your inequality becomes the subordination inequality $$\int_0^{2\pi}|F\circ\phi(e^{i\theta})|^\delta d\theta\leq\int_0^{2\pi}|F(e^{i\theta})|^\delta d\theta,$$ see, for example, J. E. Littlewood, Lectures on the Theory of Functions. Oxford University Press, 1944, Theorem 210 on p. 164. Here is a short proof of the subordination inequality. Let $u$ be subharmonic in the disk, $v$ the least harmonic majorant (=harmonic function matching $u$ on the unit circle), and let $\phi$ be analytic, mapping the unit disk into itself, $\phi(0)=0$. Denote by $I$ the average over the unit circle. Then: $$I(u\circ \phi)\leq I(v\circ\phi)=v\circ\phi(0)=v(0)=I(v)=I(u),$$ where we used the average property of harmonic functions twice: once for $v$ and another for $v\circ\phi$. In our application $u=|F|^\delta$. 

This is a classical theorem: hyperbolic Riemann surfaces of finite hyperbolic area are compact surfaces with finitely many punctures. Tsuji (Theorem XI.12) credits this to Siegel (1945). The proof is a simple computation of the area of the fundamental polygon of the uniformizing Fuchsian group. Tsuji, Potential theory in modern function theory, Maruzen Ltd, Tokyo 1959. (There is an AMS reprint). 

This is called the Darmois-Skitovich theorem. Of course, one needs to add the condition that $a_jb_j\neq 0$. The reference is MR0346969 Kagan, A. M.; Linnik, Yu. V.; Rao, C.

In Russian literature the sampling theorem is attributed to Kotelnikov. There is a recent English translation of his paper: Kotelʹnikov, V. A. On the transmission capacity of the "ether'' and wire in electrocommunications. Translated from the Russian by V. E. Katsnelson. Appl. Numer. Harmon. Anal., Modern sampling theory, 27–45, Birkhäuser Boston, Boston, MA, 2001. In England, this theorem is sometimes credited to J. M. Whittaker: it is in his book Interpolatory function theory (1935), but actually his father E. T. Whittaker published it in 1915. The theorem in a rudimentary form can be found in Cauchy, and even Lagrange.. EDIT. Here is a paper with the history which seems complete: $URL$ 

You can have any epsilon and any $\Lambda$: there is no estimate you ask. Say in dimension $1$, take a polynomial $p(x)$ whose zeros are $n\epsilon,\; |n|<1/\epsilon$. They are within epsilon of any point of the unit ball. Now multiply it on any entire function $g$ of exponential type $\delta$, which decreases on the real line faster than this polynomial. Then $pg$ has Fourier spectrum bounded by $\delta$, and its zero set is $\epsilon$ dense in the unit ball. To get this in several variables just multiply several such functions depending on one variable each. EDIT. In the comment to this answer, you ask about compact manifold, for example a torus. Then you can estimate your epsilon from below in terms of the upper bound of the spectrum $\Lambda$. Namely $\epsilon>c/\sqrt{\Lambda}$. Here is a proof suggested by Misha Sodin: Let $p$ be the point where your function $u$ has maximum modulus. WLOG $u(p)=1$. Then Bernstein inequality says that $\nabla u\leq c\sqrt{\Lambda}$. It follows that $u(x)>0$ in a ball of radius at least $c/\sqrt{\Lambda}$. Bernstein's inequality in the original form applies to trig polynomials in dimension $1$, and has $c=1$. By applying it to each variable separately we obtain a several-variable version for the torus. But in fact it is true in much more general setting, for balls, spheres, and any compact manifold, I believe. 

For 1, it is sufficient to check the definition of surface: that every point has a neigborhood homeomorphic to the disc. For interior points of the polygon, and for points on the sides, this is evident, and for the corners this is easy. For 2, just recall classification of all possible compact surfaces up to homeomorphism. There is one integer invariant, the Euler characteristic, and the 2-valued invariant, orientability. The Euler characteristic is easily computed from your word: if you have 2n edges of your polygon, they will give $n$ edges after gluing, and suppose that you obtain $v$ vertices after gluing. Then the Euler characteristic is $1-n+v$ which is between $2-n$ and $2$. And orientability has two values. So you have at most $2n$ topologically different surfaces from strings of length $2n$. And you see that for given length there are much more classes of words than $2n$. 

This is true when the support of $f$ is contained in the unit disc. If the support is contained in a disc $|z|<R$, then $(f,f)$ is bounded from below by a constant that depends on $R$. This minor nuisance makes the logarithmic potential somewhat different from the Newtonian potential, however most statements of potential theory are similar for these two cases, or can be easily modified.
