Is there a theorem (or theorems) that can be thought of a real analogue of Weil conjectures? One can replace the finite field by real numbers and Frobenius by complex conjugation; counting points can perhaps be replaced by Euler characteristic or a more refined invariant of the set of real points. Of course, Lefschetz fixed point formula can be applied here, but is there something more specific one can say? 

The previous answer may be all you need, but, say, in question one one can also proceed by induction in q, to make the step of induction embed your complex into an acyclic complex of injective objects. 

Is there an analogue of Kac-Weisfeiler conjecture (a theorem of Premet) on the power of p dividing dimension of an irreducible representation for Lie algebras of Cartan type? Benkart and Feldvoss mention this as an open problem (Problem 10) in their 2015 survey, but they don't seem to state a precise conjecture. 

A commutative analogue of the conjecture that the only projective D-affine varieties are homogeneous spaces is a generalization of Harthshorne conjecture. The latter (famously proved by Mori) characterizes projective spaces as the only smooth projective varieties with ample tangent bundles. It is expected that the only smooth projective varieties whose tangent bundle is big and nef are homogeneous spaces of reductive groups, this conjecture is apparently due to Demailly and Campana-Peternell. 

The group $SL(2,F)$ where $F$ is a local nonArchemidian field is hyperbolic. Various generalizations of the notion of hyperbolicity have been studied in the literature (I've seen terms like "hierarchically hyperbolic", "relatively hyperbolic" etc.). Which of those classes do groups of the form $G(F)$ where $G$ is semi-simple of higher rank fall into? 

It's a toric variety, for which intersection cohomology is computed algorithmically, see e.g. De Catldo's lectures. 

Let $X$ be a complete smooth curve over $\mathbb C$ and $A=Jac[2]$ be the group of 2-torsion elements in the Jacobian of $X$. Is their a relation between: 1) The $A$-torsor of $\theta$-characteristics and its decomposition into odd and even parts. 2) The projective action of $A$ on sections of ${\mathcal O}_{Jac}(2\Theta)$, where $\Theta$ is the $\Theta$-divisor, lifting to a Heisenberg group action. 

Have you tried nLab again? I'm not sure continuous functors are what you're looking for, incidentally. It seems more likely that a 'Scott-continuous functor' should be one that preserves filtered colimits. Replacing the preorders (and metric spaces) of domain theory with (enriched) categories is not a new idea. Have a look at Categories for fixpoint semantics (1978) by Daniel Lehmann, and Solving recursive domain equations with enriched categories (1994) by Kim Ritter Wagner. 

Not quite an answer, but I hope it helps: Your second definition looks (somewhat) like the usual definition of the V-valued hom of V-functors $[Sp,X] (a,b) = \int_{A \in Sp} X(aA, bA)$. If that's right then $$ V(\gamma, [Sp,X] (a,b)) \cong \int_A V(\gamma,X(aA,bA)) \cong \int_A(\gamma \otimes aA,bA) = [Sp,X] (\gamma \otimes a,b) $$ and the first definition follows by applying $V(I,-)$. One way to prove the converse would be to show that $\operatorname{Nat}(?\otimes a, b) \cong \operatorname{Dinat}(?, X(a-,b-))$ in [V,Set], which is probably true, but my dinaturality-fu isn't what it should be, so that's as far as I can go. 

Freyd and Scedrov, in their book Categories, Allegories, use for this 'directed equality' a peculiar symbol that they call a Venturi tube and that looks a bit like $\mathrel{>=}$, so that $x \mathrel{>=} y$ means if $x$ is defined then so is $y$ and $x=y$. You can find some discussion at the nLab page on Kleene equality (the symmetric version of this) and in this nForum thread. 

This may not be the sort of thing you're looking for (and it only answers your first question), but... A category C is always both reflective and coreflective in the category $C^{\mathbf{2}}$ of arrows of C. You have the codomain and domain functors $c,d \colon C^{\mathbf{2}} \to C$ and the identity-morphism functor $i \colon C \to C^{\mathbf{2}}$, and adjunctions $c \dashv i \dashv d$, where the counit of the first and unit of the second are identities. For example, if $f \colon a \to b$ in $C$, then $\eta_f = (f,1_B) \colon f \to 1_B$, and so on. This holds in any bicategory with enough comma objects, except with the word 'identities' replaced with 'isomorphisms'. It follows from quite general properties of the simplex 2-category, or from the fact that you can factor any adjunction (here the identity $1 \dashv 1$) into a reflection and a coreflection. 

There are various definitions of boundary of a hyperbolic group. Which of those generalize to semi-hyperbolic groups (in the sense of Alonso and Bridson)? The example I have in mind is a semisimple group over a nonArchemedian local field.The answer I'd like to get is something like a nonHausdorff space which is a union of partial flag manifolds $G/P$ (which can be described as the quotient of the complement to $G$ in the De Concini-Procesi compactification by the right action of $G$). 

Let $G$ be a complex simple simply connected algebraic group and $Gr_G$ be the corresponding affine Grassmannian (it is well known that $Gr_G$ is homotopy equivalent to the base loop space $\Omega K$ of the maximal compact subgroup $K\subset G$). Let $H=H^*(Gr,k)=H^*(\Omega K,k)$ be the cohomology ring where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p>0$. The computation of $H$ by Yun and Zhu in their paper "Integral homology of loop groups..." shows that the commutative $k$-algebra $H$ has a divided power structure, at least when $p$ is not too small. Can this be seen from first principles? In particular, is it related to Cartan's divided power structure on homology of a commutative simplicial $k$-algebra? 

Is every vector bundle on an algebraic torus $T=({\mathbb A}^1\setminus \{0\})^n$ over an algebraically closed field trivial? I am primarily interested in the case of a characteristic zero base field. 

Let $X$ be a smooth closed subvariety in a complex projective space and $Z\subset X$ be a generic hyperplane section. Lefschetz hyperplane section Theorem says that the restriction map $H^i(X)\to H^i(Z)$ is an isomorphism for $i<dim(Z)$ and injective for $i=dim(Z)$. I am interested in examples when it's also an isomorphism $i=dim(Z)$. This is equivalent to saying that Fourier-Deligne transform of the intersection cohomology sheaf of the cone over $X$ has less than full support in the dual space (then this support has to be the cone over the projectively dual variety $X^*$). This is so when $X$ is an even dimensional quadric; are there other examples? 

The classical example is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ sets of reals. We say that $X\subset \mathbb R$ is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ if the complement of the projection of a Borel set in ${\mathbb R}^n$. Any such set of cardinality greater than $\aleph_1$ has cardinality continuum. 

The theory of the natural numbers with addition and $x\mapsto 2^x$ is decidable. One reference is the Cherlin-Point paper "On extensions of Presburger arithmetic". It can be found on Francoise Point's webpage: $URL$ 

The classical argument Andres mentions can be taken one step further to show that if every uncountable $\Pi_1^1$ set contains a perfect subset then $\aleph_1$ is inaccessible in $L$. This follows from the same fact for $\Sigma^1_2$-sets since, by the uniformization theorem, every $\Sigma^1_2$-set is the injective projection of a $\Pi^1_1$-set. 

This doesn't exactly answer your question but... If $A$ is any upper bound for the arithmetic degrees then $0^{(\omega)}$ is recursive in $A^{\prime\prime}$. Enderton and Putnam proved that there upper bounds with $A^{\prime\prime}=0^{(\omega)} $ Dave 

Another spin on this question, that gets around the fact that there are only countably many second order sentences, is to look at categoricity in $L^2_{\kappa,\omega}$ where we allow conjunctions of size less that $\kappa$ and second order quantifiers. Hyttinen, Kangas and Vaananen (see $URL$ show that, for suitable cardinals $\kappa$, all models of a complete first order theory $T$ of size $\kappa$ are characterized by and $L^2_{\kappa,\omega}$-sentence if and only if $T$ is ``classifiable" in the sense of Shelah's Main-Gap i.e., $T$ is stable, NDOP, shallow, and NOTOP. 

We will always have ${\rm ZF}^M\supseteq {\rm ZF}$. The problem comes if $M$ contains nonstandard sentences--which is equivalent to the question of whether $M$ contains nonstandard natural numbers since we can identify formulas with their Godel codes. If there are no nonstandard integers, then they type of externl induction you are doing works fine, but if there aren't it might break down at a nonstandard stage. 

I'm presuming that you want to treat V-Cat as a 2-category rather than as a V-category. There might be a slick change-of-base argument that applies here, but I can't think of one. I think the answer is 'whenever V has finite limits'. Be warned that I haven't checked any of this fully, so it's just a sketch of what I would try. A 2-category has comma objects if it has pullbacks and cotensors with the arrow category $\mathbf{2}$. Pullbacks in V-Cat should be straightforward. You can define $A^{\mathbf{2}}$ to have objects maps $f \colon I \to A(a,b)$ and say that the hom object $A^{\mathbf{2}}(f,g)$ is the pullback of $A(f,b') \colon A(b,b') \to A(a,b')$ along $A(a,g) \colon A(a,a') \to A(a,b')$. (Check that this does actually give a V-category, because I haven't.) You have to show that $V\mathrm{-Cat}(X,A^{\mathbf{2}}) \cong \mathrm{Cat}(\mathbf{2},V\mathrm{-Cat}(X,A))$. A functor $F \colon X \to A^{\mathbf{2}}$ sends an object x to $Fx \colon I \to A(Gx,G'x)$ in A and comes with maps $X(x,y) \to A^{\mathbf{2}}(Fx,Fy)$. The latter hom object is a pullback, so you get a commuting square of the sort satisfied by a V-natural transformation (and you can use the projections to define the functors G and G'). Then you have the ingredients of a transformation $\alpha \colon G \to G'$, i.e. an object of $\mathrm{Cat}(\mathbf{2},V\mathrm{-Cat}(X,A))$. Hope this helps. 

One nice result is Street's theorem 14 in The formal theory of monads, generalized in Elementary cosmoi, which says that $C^T$ is isomorphic to the full subcategory of $[(C_T)^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathrm{Set}]$ containing those presheaves that become representable when precomposed with the inclusion $C \to C_T$. That is, $C^T$ is the pullback of $[F^{\mathrm{op}},\mathrm{Set}]$ along the Yoneda embedding. So at least informally you can think of T-algebras as being represented by certain formal colimits of free algebras. I think it's standard, too, that every algebra has a canonical presentation -- its (2-truncated) bar resolution -- as the coequalizer of maps between free objects. Can't think of a good reference at the moment, but Mac Lane has a section on the bar construction, and there's some good stuff on nlab. Maybe try Kelly & Power, Adjunctions whose counits are coequalizers, and presentations of finitary enriched monads, JPAA 89 (1993). I don't know if there's a relationship between these two ideas, but I'd be very interested to find out! (Can't do it myself, I'm supposed to be on holiday.) 

I think the answer is no, but let me first give a precise version of the question (which I think Daniel's argument doesn't quite address). Fix some reasonable listing $P_0,P_1,\dots$ of recursively enumerable sets of polynomials. [See below for a ``reasonable" coding.] I claim that there is no algorithm to determine if $V(P_e)=\emptyset$. Let $K$ be the diagonal halting set. Namely, $K=$ {$e$: the $ e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $e$}. For each $e$ let $P_e=\{p_0,p_1,\dots\}$ be the recursively enumerable sequence of polynomials where $p_i=0$ if the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine has not halted by stage $i$ and $p_i=1$ if has. Then $V(P_e)=\emptyset \Leftrightarrow e\in K$. Since $K$ is undecidable there is no algorithm to decide if $V(P_e)$ is empty. One way to code sequences of polynomials would be to let $q_0,q_1,\dots$ list all polynomials, and let $P_e$ be {$q_i:$ the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $i$}. To get to Ian's setting we could view $P_e$ as the sequence $p_0,p_1,\dots$ where $p_{(i,j)\}$ is 0 unless the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input i at stage $j$ in which case it is $q_i$ and $(i,j)$ is some computable pairing function. 

Wilkie's proof of o-minimality of exponentiation tells you (without needing to assume Schanuel's Conjecture) that for each $k$ there is a bound $M_k$ such that any exponential polynomial $\sum_{i=1}^k c_ie^{\alpha_i x}$ has at most $M_k$ real zeros [assuming that the $c_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are real.] Perhaps Khovanskii's work gives an explicit bound on the $M_k$. 

This was intended to be a comment to SJR's post, but was too long. Here is a proof that any formula that is preserved downwards in models of $T$ is equivalent in $T$ to a universal formula, from which we deduce that formulas preserved upwards are equivalent to existential formulas. Let $T$ be an $\cal L$-theory. Suppose $\phi(\bar v)$ is preserved downwards in models of $T$. Let $\Gamma(\bar v)=\{\psi(\bar v): \psi$ is universal and $T\models \phi(\bar v)\rightarrow \psi(\bar v)\}$. We claim that $T+\Gamma(\bar v)\models \psi(\bar v)$. If that happens then there are $\psi_1,\dots,\psi_n\in\Gamma(\bar v)$ such that $T\models \phi(\bar v)\leftrightarrow (\psi_1(\bar v)\land\dots\land\psi_n(\bar v)$. Suppose not. Then there is ${\cal M}\models T$ and $\bar a\in \cal M$ such that ${\cal M}\models \psi(\bar a)$ for $\psi\in\Gamma$ and ${\cal M}\models \neg\phi(\bar a)$. Let $T_1= T+ \phi(\bar a) + $ atomic diagram of $\cal M$. If $T_1$ is satisfiable there is ${\cal N}\models T$ with ${\cal M}\subset {\cal N}$ and ${\cal N}\models \phi(\bar a)$, contradicting the fact that $\phi$ is preserved downward. Thus $T_1$ must be unsatisfiable. Thus there is a quantifier free formula $\theta(\bar v,\bar w)$ and $\bar b\in \cal M$ such that $$T\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)\rightarrow \neg\phi(\bar a).$$ Since the parameters $\bar a$ and $\bar b$ don't occur in $T$, $$T\models \forall \bar v\ (\phi(\bar v)\rightarrow\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w))$$ But then $\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w)\in \Gamma$ contradicting the fact that ${\cal M}\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)$.
