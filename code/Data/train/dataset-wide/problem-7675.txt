Let $K$ be a field of char. zero, $\mathfrak{g}$ a f.dim. Lie algebra over $K$. Let $\mathfrak{r}$ be its solvable radical, $\mathfrak{s}=\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{r}$ (which is semisimple) and $V=\mathfrak{r}/[\mathfrak{r},\mathfrak{r}]$ (which is naturally an $\mathfrak{s}$-module). Then $\mathfrak{g}$ is perfect iff $V^\mathfrak{s}=\{0\}$, by a simple verification using the existence of a Levi factor. (In particular, no assumption is needed on the action of $\mathfrak{s}$ on $[\mathfrak{r},\mathfrak{r}]$, and irreducibility is not the relevant condition.) 

The new question amounts to classifying, up to isomorphism, 3-dimensional subalgebras of the real Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(2,1)$. If I'm correct, the answer is: 

There are various constraints. One of those is: the $\mathbf{Q}$-rank is either 0 or infinite. (Thus $F^*$ cannot be isomorphic to $\mathbf{Z}\times \mathbf{Q}/\mathbf{Z}$, among others). Indeed, if $F$ has characteristic zero, then the primes form an infinite $\mathbf{Z}$-free family. If $F$ has characteristic $\ell>0$ and $F^*$ is not torsion, then there exists a transcendental element $x$, and then the $(x^p-1)$, where $p$ ranges over primes $\neq\ell$, form a $\mathbf{Z}$-free family. Indeed otherwise we could find a positive integer $k$, a non-negative integer $n$, and primes $p_1,\dots,p_k,q_1,\dots,q_n$, all distinct and distinct from $\ell$, and positive integers $t_1,\dots,t_k,m_1,\dots,m_n$, such that $\prod_i (x^{p_i}-1)^{t_i}=\prod_j (x^{q_j}-1)^{m_j}$. Since $x$ is transcendental, this equality still holds in the polynomial ring $\mathbf{F}_p[x]$. Evaluation at a primitive $p_1$-root of unity (in a suitable extension of $\mathbf{F}_\ell$) then yields a contradiction. 

Proposition: no finite index subgroup of $B_n$, for any $n\ge 4$, is isomorphic to a lattice in any virtually connected Lie group. Assume that some finite index subgroup $H$ of $B_n$, $n\ge 4$, is a lattice in a virtually connected Lie group $G$. Modding out if necessary, we can assume that the compact radical (=largest compact normal subgroup) of $G$ is trivial. Let $M$ be the largest amenable closed normal subgroup in $G$ (it can be obtained by first taking the largest solvable closed normal [not necessarily connected] subgroup $R$ and defining $M$ as the inverse image of the compact radical of $G/R$). Then classical arguments (see Raghunathan's book) show that $M\cap H$ is a lattice in $G$. Since the amenable radical of $H$ is cyclic, it follows that $M\cap H$ is cyclic. So $M$ is a Lie group, with trivial compact radical, with a cyclic lattice; hence $M$ is either trivial or isomorphic to either $\mathbf{Z}$ the infinite (discrete) dihedral group, or $\mathbf{R}$, or the group of isometries of $\mathbf{R}$. Define $H'=H/(M\cap H)$ and $S=G/M$. Then $H'$ is a lattice in $S$. Since $S$ has a trivial amenable radical, it is semisimple with no compact factors and trivial center. Actually $M\cap H$ is necessarily infinite, since a lattice in a semisimple group with trivial center cannot have a nontrivial cyclic normal subgroup. There exists a unique decomposition $S=S_1\times\dots\times S_k$ with each $S_i$ semisimple, such that for every $i$, $H'\cap S_i$ is an irreducible lattice in $S_i$. For every $i$ such that $S_i$ has real rank $\ge 2$, the Kazhdan-Margulis theorem implies that $H'\cap S_i$ has no finite index subgroup with a surjective homomorphism onto $\mathbf{Z}$. On the other hand, $H'$ is virtually residually (torsion-free nilpotent), which implies that it has a finite index subgroup all of whose infinite subgroups have a surjective homomorphism onto $\mathbf{Z}$. We deduce that for every $i$, $S_i$ has real rank 1. It is known that the quotient $B_n/Z$ of $B_n$ by its center and its finite index subgroups satisfy: for any two normal subgroups centralizing each other, at least one of the two is trivial. This follows, for instance, from the existence of a faithful linear representation of $B_n/Z$ such that the Zariski closure of the image is simple with trivial center. We deduce that $k=1$ (because otherwise $H'\cap S_1$ and $H'\cap S_2$ centralize each other and are non-abelian). We deduce that $S$ is a simple group of real rank 1. (It follows that the unit component of $G$ is isomorphic to either $\mathbf{R}\times S$ or, in case $S$ has an infinite fundamental group, to the universal covering of $S$.) Now let me get a contradiction by proving the following result (using only a properness assumption with no finite covolume requirement): Proposition: if $\Gamma$ is the group obtained by modding out any finite index subgroup $\Lambda$ of $B_4$ by its center, then $\Gamma$ has no proper homomorphism $f$ into any $S$ where $S$ is any connected simple Lie group of real rank 1. Fix $n$ such that $t^n\in\Lambda$ for all $t\in B_4$. Let $x_1\dots,x_3$ be the canonical generators of $B_4$, so that $x_1^n,\dots,x_3^n$ belong to $\Lambda$. Define $w=(x_1x_2x_1)^{2n}$; it is a nontrivial central element of $B_2=\langle x_1,x_2\rangle$. Then $\langle x_1^n,w\rangle$ is free abelian of rank 2, and so is its image in $\Gamma$. If $f(x_1^n)$ is loxodromic, then its axis is preserved by $f(w)$ and we obtain a proper action of $\mathbf{Z}^2$ on this axis, a contradiction, so $f(x_1^n)$ is a horocyclic isometry (I mean "parabolic" but the latter is in conflict with the meaning of "parabolic" for algebraic subgroups of $S$); the same argument shows that $f(w)$ is horocyclic as well, with the same fixed point at infinity. A symmetric argument shows that $f(x_3^n)$ is horocyclic as well, with a priori another fixed point at infinity, but since it commutes with $f(x_1^n)$ this has to be the same fixed point. On the other hand, it is easy to show that $\langle (x_1x_2x_1)^2,x_3^2\rangle$ generate a free group of rank 2, and hence the subgroup of $\Gamma$ generated by $w$ and $x_3^n$ is also free of rank 2. But the horocyclic subgroups of $S$ are nilpotent and we obtain a contradiction. 

Here I answer your additional question about finitely presented groups. The answer is then no. Affirmation. Only finitely many finitely presentable groups may have the same given Cayley graph. This works as follows. Let $X_1$ be the Cayley graph of some f.p. group. By finite presentability, there exists $n_0$ such that gluing $k$-gons each time you have a $k$-cycle in $X_1$ with $k\le n_0$, the resulting polygonal complex $X$ is simply connected. Now consider the locally compact group $G=\mathrm{Aut}(X_1)=\mathrm{Aut}(X)$. A finitely generated group with Cayley graph $X_1$ is the same as a group with a simply transitive action on $X_1$, hence letting $K$ be the stabilizer in $G$ of some vertex $x_0$, it is the same as a subgroup of $G$ whose intersection with each coset $gK$ is a singleton; let $\mathcal{W}$ be the set of subgroups of $G$ with this property. Using the action on $X$, a standard argument shows the following: let $S_G$ be the set of elements of $G$ mapping $x_0$ to a neighbor of $x_0$; then for every $\Gamma\in\mathcal{W}$, the group $\Gamma$ admits a presentation using $\Gamma\cap S_G$ as set of generators and relators of length $\le\max(2,n_0)$ (2 is necessary because of the possible generators of order 2, unless these are represented by double edges). Since there are only finitely many such presentations, we are done. Note that the proof even shows that there are finitely many marked groups $(\Gamma,S)$ with a given Cayley graph, in the finitely presentable case. 

The equivalence between (1) and (2) is clear (given that subgroups of free groups are free - otherwise "locally free" would be a bit imprecise); (3) is tautologically implied by (2). Conversely suppose (3), and let's prove (1). Passing to a finitely generated subgroup of $G$ reduces to $G$ finitely generated. Then passing to a cofinal subsystem allows to assume that the filtering system has an initial element $H$ with $H\to G$ surjective. Then some finitely generated subgroup $K$ of $H$ has onto image in $G$ and then replacing each group in the filtering system, we realize $G$ as a filtering inductive limit of finitely generated free groups with surjective connecting homomorphisms. Then the rank of these free groups decreases until it stabilizes, and since finitely generated free groups are Hopfian, this means that there's a cofinal subsystem made up of isomorphisms. So $G$ is free. Note: for more other classes of groups, usually such an implication as (3)$\Rightarrow$(2) fails. For instance, every group is a filtering inductive limit of finitely presented groups (this is not specific to groups!), but usually this cannot be done with injective connecting homomorphisms (e.g., for an infinitely presented finitely generated group). 

It is a straightforward consequence of the combination of two old results of Malcev and most likely Malcev was aware of this consequence. 1) The first is the well-known Malcev's residual finiteness result (every finitely generated linear group over, say, a field, is residually finite), or rather the stronger result that follows from the proof. Indeed, the main ingredient is the lemma saying that every finitely generated domain is residually a finite field. As a corollary, we have that for every $n$, every field $K$, every finitely generated subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ is residually a subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ where $F$ ranges over finite fields (with the same $n$). 2) The second is Malcev's result (1951, English translation 1956) that solvable subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ have solvability length $\le r_n$ for some $r_n$, independently of the field $K$. This can be found (Theorem 3.21) in the book of D. Robinson Finiteness conditions and generalized soluble groups I, Theorem 3.21. Actually, Malcev proved the stronger result that for some $s_n$ independent of the field, every solvable subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ has a subgroup of index $\le s_n$ that is conjugate, in $\mathrm{GL}_n(\hat{K})$, to the upper triangular group ($\hat{K}$ denoting an algebraic closure). 

Besides, as I mentioned, the result is true for FC-groups $G$ with trivial center: indeed these groups act faithfully on themselves by conjugation, and since the orbits are finite, the closure of the image of $G\to Sym(G)$ is compact. This is more generally true for residually finite FC-groups. However since as you mention, it is also true for abelian groups (which may fail to be residually finite), it's unclear what it the greatest generality. 

It is straightforward that every triangle is of type I or type II, that the $S_6$-action preserves types of triangles, and that elements of $\mathrm{Aut}(S_6)\smallsetminus S_6$ exchange the two types. Consider the graph $W_6$ whose vertices are triangles in $Z_6$ and such that there is an edge between two triangles whenever they have a common vertex. For instance, there is an edge between $T_1$ and $T_2$ since they have the common vertex $(12|34)$. It is easy to check that $W_6$ is connected. Vertices of $W_6$ thus have type I or II, and we see that no vertices of the same type are joined. So $W_6$ is bipartite. Thus, for vertices of $W_6$, the relation "to have the same type" (which is not defined intrinsically) is indeed intrinsic, as it is equivalent to be at even distance. In particular, the isometry group $G$ of $W_6$ preserves the partition by types. Let $G'$ be its index 2 subgroup of type-preserving isometries. Define $W'_6$ as the graph consisting of vertices of type I in $W_6$, linked whenever they have distance at most 2 in $W_6$. We see that $W'_6$ is canonically isomorphic to the transposition graph! The isomorphism is given by mapping the triangle $T_1=\{(12|34),(13|24),(14|23)\}$ to $(56)$, etc. By the previous result on $X_6$, we deduce that $G'=S_6$. It follows that $G$ is reduced to $\mathrm{Aut}(S_6)$ (since clearly an isometry of $W_6$ that is identity on vertices of type I has to be the identity). To conclude that $\mathrm{Aut}(Z_6)$ is reduced to $\mathrm{Aut}(S_6)$, it is enough to show that the canonical homomorphism $\mathrm{Aut}(Z_6)\to\mathrm{Aut}(W_6)$ is injective. This is also immediate: for $f$ in the kernel, any double transposition belongs to exactly two triangles, i.e., two unordered triples of linked vertices, each of which is $f$-invariant, and hence is fixed by $f$. So we have proved that $\mathrm{Aut}(Z_6)$ is reduced to $\mathrm{Aut}(S_6)$, answering the original question. 

If you mean that every continuous homomorphism $H\to\mathbf{R}$ can be extended to a continuous homomorphism $G\to\mathbf{R}$, this is contained in Theorème 5 of [1] (the "unitary" version is when $\mathbf{R}$ is replaced twice by $\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$).

The inclusion can indeed be proper. Indeed, there exist simple groups $S$ with no maximal subgroup. So $\Phi(S)=S$. But the diagonal in $S\times S$ is a maximal subgroup, and in particular contains $\Phi(S\times S)$. Since $\Phi(S\times S)$ is normal, it follows that $\Phi(S\times S)=\{1\}$, which is properly contained in $\Phi(S)\times\Phi(S)=S\times S$. I'm not sure what's the simplest example of such $S$, but at least one comes from Shelah's construction of a simple Jonsson group (a Jonsson group an uncountable group in which every proper subgroup is countable). (Sciencedirect link to Shelah's 1980 article) (added: there also exists a simple countable group without maximal subgroups: Theorem 35.3 in Olshanskii's book Geometry of defining relations in groups) 

We can assume that the $G(k)$-conjugacy class of $s$ generates a Zariski-dense subgroup $Q$ of $G$. Let me assume that $k$ has characteristic zero and provide consequences. So $G=U\rtimes S$ for the unipotent radical $U$, which is defined over $k$, and some $k$-defined reductive subgroup $S$, and $G(k)=U(k)\rtimes S(k)$. I claim that $Q$ contains $U(k)$. If $U$ is abelian, $Q\cap U(k)$ contains all commutators $quq^{-1}u^{-1}$ ($q\in Q$, $u\in U(k)$), which can be rewritten as additively $q\cdot u-u$ and such element form a $k$-linear subspace, which is the whole of $U$, because $G$ is generated by unipotent elements. In general, this applies to $G/[U,U]$ and one deduces that $Q\cap U(k)$ has a surjective image in $[U(k),U(k)]=[U,U](k)$ and hence a standard lemma about nilpotent groups implies $Q\cap U(k)=U(k)$. This completely reduces the question (in char 0) to reductive groups. In the abelian case there is not much to say: a conjugacy class is a singleton. So mostly things amount to understand the semisimple case. Then in the isotropic case we can get somewhat fine results. Let $Z$ be the largest finite normal subgroup of $G$, that is, the centralizer of the unit component $G^0$. Let $G(k)^+$ be the subgroup of $G(k)$ generated by unipotent elements. Suppose that $G$ is connected, $k$-isotropic and $k$-simple. It is known (I think it's in Margulis' book) that every normal subgroup of $G(k)$ not contained in $Z$ contains $G(k)^+$. [This extends immediately to the case when $G$ is semisimple, $k$-isotropic, $G(k)$ is Zariski-dense (i.e., meets all connected components), and $G/G^0$ acts transitively on minimal nontrivial $k$-defined semisimple subgroups (these latter assumptions implies that they are all $k$-isotropic). Typical example: the wreath product $S\wr\mathrm{Sym}_n=S^n\rtimes\mathrm{Sym}_n$, with $S$ $k$-simple $k$-isotropic.] Example: $G=\mathrm{PGL}_2(k)$ (here $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ is connected, simple, trivial center). Then the subgroup generated by the $G(k)$-conjugacy class of $s\in G(k)\smallsetminus\{1\}$ is equal to the subgroup of those $t\in\mathrm{PGL}_2(k)$ such that $\overline{\det}(t)\in\{1,\overline{\det}(s)\}$, where $\overline{\det}$ is the determinant viewed as function into $k^\ast/(k^\ast)^2$, which is well-defined as homomorphism $\mathrm{PGL}_2(k):k^\ast/(k^\ast)^2$. The anisotropic case is far worse-understood. Still in the real case it behaves well and even better (in the above setting with "isotropic" replaced by "anisotropic", we automatically have $Q$ Zariski-closed.). In the $p$-adic case, for $G$ semisimple anisotropic, $G(k)$ is profinite and thus has no "minimal" normal subgroup; anyway some easy $p$-adic analysis probably ensures that $Q$ is an open subgroup, which is a reasonable conclusion. 

It's the subgroup of these elements in $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Z}_\ell)$ with determinant in $\pm 1$. Thus the quotient is naturally isomorphic to the quotient of $\mathbf{Z}_\ell^\times$ by $\{\pm 1\}$. Indeed, denote by $e_{ij}(x)$ (for $i\neq j$) the matrix with entry $(i,j)$ equal to $x$, diagonal entries equal to 1, and other entries 0, and $d_i(x)$, for $x$ invertible, the diagonal matrix with $(i,i)$ entry equal to $x$, and other diagonal entries equal to $1$; write $s_{ij}(x)=d_i(x)d_j(x^{-1})$. Then, for $\{i,j\}=\{1,2\}$, and $x\in \mathbf{Z}_\ell^\times$, we have $s_{ij}(x)e_{ij}(1)s_{ij}(x)^{-1}=e_{ij}(x^2)$. Since any element in $\mathbf{Z}_\ell$ is a sum of squares (of 2 squares for $\ell$ odd, 4 squares for $\ell=2$, if I remember correctly), it follows that the normal closure of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbf{Z})$ contains all matrices $e_{ij}(y)$ for any $y\in\mathbf{Z}_\ell$. Since such matrices generate $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbf{Z}_\ell)$ (because it's a Euclidean ring), we deduce that the normal closure of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbf{Z})$ is all of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbf{Z}_\ell)$. (The same simple argument work in $\mathrm{SL}_d$ for $d\ge 2$.) Now since $\det(\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{Z})=\{\pm 1\}$, we get the result. (Thanks to grghxy for a correction, I was initially essentially thinking of $\mathrm{SL}_2$ and $\mathrm{GL}_2$ makes an issue with the determinant.)
