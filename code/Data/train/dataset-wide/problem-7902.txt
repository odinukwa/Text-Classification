This is a result of Witten, a crucial ingredient for the relation between Chern-Simons theory and the Jones polynomial. You might want to start in Section 5 of 

Recall (in the finite-dimensional case) the dimensions: $$ \dim \Lambda^k V = \binom{n}{k} \quad\text{ and }\quad \dim\mathrm{Sym}^kV = \binom{n+k-1}{k} $$ Looking at $k=1$ shows that we have non-trivial intersection. Looking at $n=k=3$ shows that the sum is not exhausting. 

I think the important information is that $H^3(G,\mathbb{R}) \neq 0$. By the way, every $G$-bundle over $M$ is trivializable, under the conditions you have mentioned. That's why a gauge transformation can be regarded as a (smooth) map $g: M \to G$. Now you look at the behaviour of the Chern-Simons 3-form $CS(A)$ of a connection $A$ on $E$ under a gauge transformation $g$. The formula is $$ CS(g^*A) = CS(A) + g^*H + \text{exact terms}. $$ where $H$ is the canonical 3-form of $G$ that represents a non-trivial element of $H^3(G,\mathbb{R})$. Now you can find a gauge transformation $g$ such that $g^*H$ is not exact. In that sense you have non-trivial gauge transformations. EDIT: The comment that every $G$-bundle is trivializable is only true if $G$ is additionally assumed to be simply-connected, sorry. So you either assume that (so does Witten) or you must see gauge transformations as maps $g:P \to G$, rather, and the Chern-Simons form $CS(A)$ as a form on $P$, not on $M$. 

The "Lichnerowicz formula" relating the square of the Dirac operator to the Laplacian has been proved more than 30 years earlier by Schrödinger. See: E. Schrödinger, Dirac'sches Elektron im Schwerefeld, Sitzungsber. Preuß. Akad. Wiss., Phys.-Math. Kl. 1932, 105-128 (1932). 

Now, define $\mathcal{L}_P$ as the transgression of $\mathcal{G}_P$. Since transgression is an equivalence of categories, it is a bijections on Hom-sets, and this bijection is exactly the statement of the theorem. Ok, in order to complete my claim that this is an application, I should probably mention an example where the theorem is useful. That's the case for $spin$ and $spin^c$ structures on manifolds, and I have learned about it from Stephan Stolz and Peter Teichner. In the case of $spin$ structures, $\mathcal{L}_P$ is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-bundle over $LM$ and plays the role of the orientation bundle of $LM$. Since $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is discrete, all the connections disappear and forms are identically zero. So, the theorem says that isomorphism classes of $spin$ structures on $M$ are in bijection to "fusion-preserving orientations" of $LM$. In the $spin^c$ case, a similar statement follows that additionally includes the scalar curvature of the $spin^c$-structures. 

This is not an answer to your questions, but rather a way to avoid them. Additionally, the assumption that the group $G$ is connected or simply-connected becomes unnecessary. For a general (compact) Lie group $G$, the level $k$ is not an integer but a class $k \in H^4(BG,\mathbb{Z})$. (If the group is simple, connected and simply-connected, then $H^4(BG,\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}$; this reproduces the integer.) Associated to the class $k$ and the connection $A$ on the bundle $E$ is a bundle 2-gerbe with connection over $M$, the Chern-Simons 2-gerbe $\mathbb{CS}(k,A)$. Connections on bundle 2-gerbes have $U(1)$-valued holonomies around closed oriented 3-manifolds, and so one defines the (exponentiated) Chern-Simons action $$ S_{CS}(k,A) := Hol_{\mathbb{CS}(k,A)}(M) \in U(1). $$ With this definition, it is not necessary to extend the manifold $M$ or the bundle $E$. However, if extensions of $M$, $E$ and $A$ exist one has the following: there is a Stokes' Theorem for 2-gerbe holonomy, namely $$ Hol_{\mathbb{G}}(M) = \exp \left ( \int_B \mathrm{curv}(\mathbb{G}) \right ). $$ Now, the curvature of the Chern-Simons 2-gerbe $\mathbb{CS}(k,A)$ is $\frac{1}{8\pi^2} b_{k} ( F \wedge F )$, where the bilinear form $b_{k}: \mathfrak{g} \times \mathfrak{g} \to \mathbb{R}$ corresponds to $k$ under the Chern-Weil homomorphism. So we have $$ S_{CS}(k,A) = \exp \left ( \frac{1}{8\pi^2} \int_B b_{k}(F \wedge F) \right ) $$ which is the formula you have asked for in (2). 

Thomas Nikolaus and Christoph Schweigert discuss the +-construction for $n=2$ in their paper Equivariance in Higher Geometry. They split it up into two steps (I think): first producing a pre-2-stack out of a presheaf of 2-groupoids, and then making it a 2-stack. Applied to the pre-2-stack obtained by delooping the monoidal stack of principal $U(1)$-bundles, one gets exactly the definition of a bundle gerbe. 

I am very much used to these kind of questions. Are 2-categories useful? What can one prove using gerbes? Why should I care about stacks? I think a funny way to react to these kind of questions, with often surprising results, is to return the question: 

For an abelian structure group $A$, principal $A$-bundles over a smooth manifold $M$ can be described completely in terms of their holonomy functionals $f: LM \to A$. Here, $LM$ is the thin loop space whose elements are homotopy classes of loops, with the rank of the homotopies bounded by one. A map $f:LM \to A$ is by definition smooth, if its pullback to the ordinary loop space is smooth (in the Fréchet sense). Definition. A fusion map is a smooth map $f: LM \to A$ such that for every triple $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\gamma_3)$ of paths in $M$, with a common initial point and a common end point, and each path is smoothly composable with the inverse of each other, the map satisfies $$ f(\overline{\gamma_2} \star \gamma_1) \cdot f(\overline{\gamma_3} \star \gamma_2) = f(\overline{\gamma_3} \star \gamma_1). $$ Theorem. 

This is an extremely interesting question. I think what you need is the notion of a stack over smooth manifolds (i.e. a sheaf of groupoids). Such a stack could assign to each smooth manifold $U$ 

This comes from the following relation between the parameters of the two theories. Recall that a Chern-Simons theory is determined by an element $$\xi \in \hat H^4(BG,\mathbb{Z}),$$ an element in the degree four differential cohomology of the classifying space of the gauge group. Often $\xi$ can be identified with an element in ordinary cohomology, and in turn with just an integer, called level. Recall that a Wess-Zumino-Witten-model is determined by an element $$ \eta \in \hat H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}). $$ Now, there is a transgression map $$ t: \hat H^4(BG,\mathbb{Z}) \to \hat H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}) $$ which converts a Chern-Simons theory into a WZW model. This is discussed (using bundle gerbes) in 

The string group $String(n)$ is by definition a 3-connected cover of $Spin(n)$. This definition determines the homotopy type of the string group. [In a previous version of this question I screwed up the definition and caused some confusion, see the comments below.] A common argument is saying that "the string group cannot be a Lie group because it has vanishing $\pi_3$". This is obviously not a complete argument because $(\mathbb{R},+)$ is a nice Lie group with vanishing $\pi_3$. What is the correct statement about Lie group structures on the string group, and how does one prove it? 

How much do you want to stick to Chen's original definition of a "differentiable space"? I recommend to look for the very similar notion of a "diffeological space", for which more literature is available. The comments below should apply to either notion. The book 

I would like to point out that stacks are "just" higher analogues of sheaves - a very basic tool to arrange structure. The same is true for topological or differentiable stacks. So I think everybody who expects amazing applications of stacks should be able to name an equally amazing application of a sheaf. (I am not saying that those don't exist!) That said, let me mention an application. In view of the fact that you didn't get any answers so far (apart from your own), I hope it's not too inappropriate to take one from my own research. It applies abelian gerbes with connection to lifting problems for principal bundles. I hope the following specifications qualify the theorem below as application: its statement does not involve any stacks or gerbes, just "basic" differential geometry. Its proof, however, is a simple composition of two gerbe-theoretical theorems. 

I think that for $G$ a connected compact Lie group, we have $$ H^m_{cont}(G,M) = 0 $$ for $m>0$. This follows from the van Est-isomorphism $$ H^m_{cont}(G,M) \cong H^m(g,k; M), $$ which holds for $G$ a connected Lie group, $K$ a maximal compact subgroup and $g$, $k$ the Lie algebras of $G$, $K$, and the thing on the right hand side is the relative Lie algebra cohomlogy. For $K=G$ in the compact case, this relative Lie algebra cohomology is identically zero. A good place to look is Stasheff's "Continuous cohomology of groups and classifying spaces". 

There is a nice geometrical treatment of the Chern-Simons action functional for a general Lie group $G$ - not necessarily simply connected - that relates it to "holonomy". It also clarifies why Chern-Simons theories are classified by $H^4(BG,\mathbb{Z})$. This point of view is described in a paper by Carey et. al. ($URL$ The group $H^4(BG,\mathbb{Z})$ classifies geometrical objects over $G$ called "multiplicative bundle gerbes". Given a multiplicative bundle gerbe $\mathcal{G}$ and a closed oriented 3-manifold $M$ with a principal $G$-bundle $P$ with connection over it, Carey et. al. describe a beautiful construction of a bundle 2-gerbe $CS(\mathcal{G},P)$ over $M$, the Chern-Simons 2-gerbe. They prove that this 2-gerbe carries a connection such that its holonomy around $M$, $$ Hol_{CS(\mathcal{G},P)}(M) \in S^1 $$ is the (exponentiated) Chern-Simons action. This works without any assumptions on the manifold $M$ or on the Lie group $G$. For a little background, recall that connections on $n$-gerbes have holonomies around closed oriented $(n+1)$-manifolds. Ordinary bundles are 0-gerbes. Part of a connection on an $n$-gerbe is a curving: a $(n+1)$-form on some covering space. In case of the 2-gerbe $CS(\mathcal{G},P)$, the covering space is the total space of the given bundle $P$, and the curving 3-form is the Chern-Simons 3-form $CS_A$ on $P$.
