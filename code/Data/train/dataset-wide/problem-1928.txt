Some things to consider. Even if elements are formed randomly in stars that does not necessarily imply that the elements will be distributed evenly and randomly when the star explodes. Following the explosion of a star there will be a gravitational attraction between the elements created within the star which will cause clumping/agglomeration of the elements. The other thing to consider is chemical attraction due to ionic charges and the lack or excess of electrons in the outer shells of atoms which causes atoms to chemically combine with other atoms to form molecules. Many elements and molecules are soluble in water. When conditions change, such as temperature, pressure or chemical attraction, metals can precipitate out of solution and collect en-mass, sometimes forming nuggets. 

The first thing to do is to stop putting pollution in the air, particularly very small particulate matter that are produced by combustion. For the Beijing Olympic Games of 2008, the Chinese government forced the polluting plants and factories in the vicinity of Beijing and nearby areas to stop operating for weeks prior to the games and during the games to ensure the air in Beijing was clear and had minimal pollution during the duration of the games. The measure was successful. Burning wood, animal dung, coal, petroleum products (particularly diesel and heavy oil) produce soot and other small particulate matter which leads to poor air quality and smog. This is an easy solution that results in clean air. The difficulty with this is that it is detrimental to the economy in the short term. For a longer term solution, energy sources need to be changed to ones that do not cause air pollution. 

This can account for even more of the difference than you might think, because it's thought that bolide impacts were several orders of magnitude more frequent a billion years ago than they are today. There was a lot of detritus in the early solar system! We also see this surface age effect on the moon itself: the mare (seas) are made of relatively young lava, and have many fewer craters than the older highlands: 

This is not to say that things don't hit earth — they do, all the time. Just look at this map of recorded bolides over a recent 20 year period (Planetary Science, NASA, via Universe Today): 

No, there are nowhere near this many craters on earth. I think you're asking if there are lots of craters on earth too, but they're hard to see because of vegetation and the oceans. The answer is 'no'. The main reason is that — thanks to plate tectonics — most of the crust is substantially younger (hundreds of millions of years) than the surface of, say, the moon (billions of years): 

The area is experiencing post-glacial isostatic rebound. Much of Canada was covered in an extensive ice sheet in the last glacial period (the 'Ice Age'), from about 110 ka until 12 ka. The ice in the Hudson Bay area was among the last to melt: 

The types of hydrocarbon extracted from the ground ranges from gas to crude oil and bitumen. Each deposit of hydrocarbon is different; some are all gas whereas others are various types of crude oil or mixtures of oil and gas. Extraction methods also vary depending on the style of geology containing the hydrocarbon. Geology with relatively large spaces between the grains of the rock, such as sandstone, may have hydrocarbons that can flow easily. This type of deposit represents the classical oil deposits, such as in Saudi Arabia. Generally, with such deposits, holes are drilled into the deposit and oil is pumped out. Geology with very tight spaces, such as shale, do not have the conditions for hydrocarbons to flow easily. In this type of geology the rock needs to be fractured to allow the hydrocarbon fluids to flow more easily. To achieve this a relatively new technique called fracking is used to fracture the rock containing the deposit. Both classical hydrocarbon extraction and fracking require the use of drill holes to access the deposit. If the deposit of hydrocarbon occurs below a water aquifer, or other form of ground water storage, the drill holes that access the hydrocarbon deposit will pass through the underground water store. To prevent the hydrocarbon wells (drill holes) from contaminating the water lying above them, the wells need to be cased (lined). The casing of hydrocarbon wells needs to be done by people who are committed to doing so and who are extremely competent in doing such tasks. Nothing is ever perfect and there will always be risks of well casing failing which would result in ground water contamination. It then becomes a question how large is the risk, what will be the effect of such a risk and who is prepared to take such risks. 

It sounds to me like the reviewer is fixated on a 'rule' they encountered in grad school, but the rule ignores some real-world nuance (as rules do). Quick caveat: my answer isn't definitive, it's more of an opinion, but it was too long for a comment. It seems intuitively true that some phenomena just are smooth, so the resolution of the data is not the limiting factor in an analysis of resolution. I'm thinking of things like maps of average seasonal air temperature (say). Certainly, you can combine that with higher-resolution data and still claim to have a high-resolution analysis. Other data may not be implicitly smooth, but it's interesting to aggregate the data for the purposes of generalization.So the quality of academic institutions obviously varies on a per-institution basis (or per teacher, if you want to get silly about it), but it would be crazy to interpolate data like that and, since it's reasonable to think there might be national-level influence (e.g. in funding for education), it only makes sense to aggregate it that way. Again, I think it's reasonable to argue that you can combine data like this with higher-resolution data and have a high-resolution analysis overall. Still other data may simply be oversmoothed, or smoothed on the wrong basis. Temperature data by country, or geological data on a 100-km grid... Then I'd say those are limiting the resolution of any analysis you do. In conclusion... I can't think offhand of a way to formalize all this, and don't know of any research around it (though I'd bet on its existence). Assuming you don't want to go down the research rabbit hole, or have a protracted argument with the reviewer, my advice is to respond to the objection by using more specific language. Instead of generalizing, specify the resolutions of the various datasets involved and mention where it might be possible to improve the resolution. 

If the planet is geologically/volcanically active hydrothermal vents are a way by which nutrients, in the way of minerals and chemicals, can enter the ocean. Certain types of bacteria can consume the minerals and such bacteria form the base of a food chain. Also, the heat from the hot water can provide energy to life forms. 

Alice Springs (lat:-23.8, long: 133.89) is in the centre of the continent. It's weather observations for 11 August 2015 reveal the temperature ranged between $5.8$ $^oC$ and $26.0$ $^oC$ and the dew point range was between $-18.8$ $^oC$ and $-2.5$ $^oC$. Similarly for Darwin (lat: -12.42, long: 130.89), which is located on the coast in the sub tropics, in the central north of the country, the temperature range for 11 August 2015 was $19.7$ $^oC$ to $30.1$ $^oC$, while the dew point range was $15.4$ $^oC$ to $19.8$ $^oC$. Perth (lat: -31.93, long: 115.98), on the southern western coast has a temperate Mediterranean climate. It's temperature range was $10.2$ $^oC$ to $17.6$ $^oC$ and the dew point range was $5.7$ $^oC$ to $11.7$ $^oC$. Adelaide (lat: -34.95, long: 138.52), on the southern coast, in the centre region , also has a temperate climate and its temperature ranged from $7.6$ $^oC$ to $15.4$ $^oC$ and the dew point range was $-0.3$ $^oC$ to $8.5$ $^oC$. Lastly, Brisbane (lat: -27.39, long: 153.13) which is on the east coast had temperatures between $8.2$ $^oC$ and $21.9$ $^oC$ and the dew point varied between $6.9$ $^oC$ and $15.8$ $^oC$. All these weather observations show significant variance in the dew point for these locations given the respective temperature ranges and the lack of weather fronts and adverse weather systems.
