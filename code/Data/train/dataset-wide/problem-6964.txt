In this simplified hypothetical world, yes, person B could give 100 currency to person A to build the factory directly. But what if person B does not want to take on that risk? How does person B know that person A will be contracted to make 150 worth of goods properly? Person B could just wait to see if someone else finances person A and then buy from A if the factory is successful. A single individual lending, or even small businesses lending out money can be a relatively large amount of money for that entity (so, high risk), whereas banks are able to diversify risks, by making many different loans and spending time evaluating how risky different people are. Banks take on risk that other people/firms can't afford to or don't want to. Interest rate is very roughly, the price needed to be willing to take on these risks, or more precisely, the rental rate of money. 

The question "how are the first order conditions" seems very unclear to me, and I am providing a set-up for finding and writing them out, while explaining the Kuhn-Tucker conditions that are easy to struggle with. Though we try to avoid giving away basic study question answers, it's a positively voted question without an answer, and I still think these questions have value for future users. Enough time has also passed where there's no risk of helping someone get through a class, if that was the intention. 

This question, as is, does not particularly describe a well-defined hypothetical. Am I paying people a higher rate for more hours? The change in productivity might be a net positive or negative if wages rise, depending on the time allocation of the worker. Where is the change in working hours happening? If I go from 1 minute of work to 1 hour of work, productivity would presumably increase because of the time it takes to get into a state of mind to work. These kinds of things that are needed to answer your question is related to the time allocation of labor, leisure, and household work as posited by Gary Becker in 1965. It has been revisited again by Gronau, 1977 and so on. If I am increasing working hours, I have to decrease activity in household production and leisure, so in order to say whether productivity increases if working hours increase, you have to answer what causes the marginal value of work to increase so that people willingly take on more work and less leisure. If something like a technological advancement makes it easier for me to work, I may become more productive, but willingly take on less hours to do my work if I am on a salary/commission. This does mean the inverse, that more hours would make me less productive per se, would be true. If I am on a hourly rate, technology that makes it easier to work changes my marginal cost of effort, which changes the opportunity cost of leisure or household work. So maybe I'll take on more work in this case and become more productive. The question isn't whether higher working hours decreases productivity. The question is why workers change working hours, and whether those voluntary changes overlap with productivity changes. The "effect" of extra hours on productivity, is ambiguous. 

For the certainty equivalent and the "risk compensation" (which I am interpreting as probability premium because it's the only thing that intuitively makes sense in this context to me; feel free to correct me), think more intuitively about the concepts. The certainty equivalent is the amount of cold hard cash you'd be indifferent to taking in lieu of the uncertain outcome. In the good outcome with $\frac{1}{3}$ probability, you'd end up with a wealth of $10 + 12$, and in the the bad state with probability $\frac{2}{3}$ where the lottery does not give you anything, you still end up with wealth of $10$. Thus, we are looking for wealth that I will denote $w^c$ where $$v(w_c) = \mathbb{E}(v(w)) \implies \frac{w_c - 1}{w_c} = \left(\frac{22-1}{22}\right)\cdot \frac{1}{3} + \left(\frac{10-1}{10}\right) \cdot \frac{2}{3}$$ Solve for $w_c$ and that will be the certainty equivalent. You'll notice that trying to solve this out, we get: $$\frac{w_c - 1}{w_c} = \frac{101}{110}$$ $$\implies \boxed{w_c = \frac{110}{9} \approx 12.2}$$ 

Suppose a representative agent is solving $$ \begin{align} & \max_{\left\{ c_t, w_t \right\}^\infty_{t=0}} \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u(c_t) \\ & \text{s.t.} \\ & w_t = Rw_{t-1} - c_t \\ & c_t \geq 0 \\ & w_t \geq 0 \\ \end{align} $$ For all $t$, and $w_{-1}$. Additionally, $0 < \beta < 1$, $R > 1$. $c_t$ is consumption at time $t$, and $w_t$ is wealth at the end of time $t$. $\beta$ is a discount factor. Let $$u(c_t) = \phi \mathrm{e}^ {\theta c_t^p}$$ where $\phi, \theta, p$ are constant parameters. 

Well, certainly you'll see literature saying it is possible to make monetary redistributive. This paper by Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2012), Redistributive Monetary Policy, says that deflation can cause redistributive effects in an economy, and that monetary policy can be used to correct that, but "shouldn't" be used as a redistributive tool beyond that correction. 

That's sort of an odd position to take. Obviously once the burger is cooked you can't recuperate the costs, but in the aggregate, the decision to cook some number of burgers in such and such a time period is made before actually cooking them. So the cost of making a burger (including labor) isn't a sunk cost; it's a prospective cost. Additionally, just because the monetary cost of making the burger is the same for each burger doesn't make it a sunk cost, just fixed (perhaps). But more to the point, there's a time cost which varies the more burgers you cook. We pay for convenience. Part of the marginal cost of cooking the burger is the opportunity cost of that time that could be spent not running a nice little fast food restaurant. 

Fixed-exchange rates can definitely help with assuring investors and consumers of low inflation. If you say, you will trade 1 of your currency for x of someone else's currency and vice versa, then if you caused a lot of inflation, and 1 of your currency suddenly can't buy a whole lot, then people won't want to trade with you or your country anymore. If you are wondering why central banks might not be automatically trusted to keep inflation down, consider the following. Imagine a central bank making monetary policy. According to models along the lines of Lucas perceptions, creating inflation can stimulate an economy, but only in the short run when no one knows that the central bank is creating more inflation than expected. The idea is that firms will attribute the rise in prices from the inflation to higher demand rather than inflation, and will thus higher more people, lowering unemployment. If the Fed kept trying to secretly keep inflation above expectations to keep unemployment down, you'd expect businesses to catch on, and the Fed in turn would have to keep raising their inflation target and...well, that's a disaster of infinitely rising inflation. In the 1970s in America, we had huge amounts of inflation (well, for us huge), until Paul Volcker decided to revamp central banking policy to more credibly target inflation. Today in the good ol' USA of course, when the central bank tells everyone they are loosening the money supply to try to stimulate the economy, it has some effect on inflation. Why? Because the Federal Reserve can be expected to later tighten policy back down later when the economy is doing better, instead of falling into the above time-inconsistency problem.
