Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis, and Herstein's Topics in Algebra if not heavily used, are the ideal that many people strive to in teaching introductory analysis and abstract algebra to undergraduates. 

Witten's asymptotic expansion conjecture as described in "Problems on invariants of knots and 3-manifolds" in Geometry and Topology Monographs, Volume 4 states that $$Z_r^{SU(2)}(M)\sim_{r\rightarrow \infty} e^{-3\pi \bf{i}(1+b^1(M))/4}\times \sum_{[A]}e^{2\pi \bf{i}CS(A)} r^{(h^1_A-h^0_A)} e^{-2\pi \bf{i}(I_A/4+h^0_A/8)}\tau_M(A)^{1/2},$$ where $b^1(M)$ is the first betti number of $M$, $CS(A)$ is the chern-simons invariant of $A$, $h^i_A$ is the rank of the $i$th cohomology of $M$ with coefficients in the $su(2)$ bundle twisted by the adjoint action of the monodromy of $A$ and $I_A$ is the spectral flow of the Laplace operator along a path connecting $A$ to the trivial flat connection. Finally, $\tau_M(A)$ is the Reidemeister torsion. Since $h^1$ is often the dimension of the Zariski tangent space of the space of gauge equivalence classes of flat connections, if $h^1>0$ in this formula, you are admitting the possibility that the moduli space of flat connections has positive dimension. In this case the sum is not really a sum, but an integral. The torsion in this case defines a volume form on $H_0(M,adA)\oplus H^1(M;adA)\oplus H_2(M,ad A)\oplus H^3(M,adA)$ ,where I mean the complex with twisted homology as appears above. Clearly what is meant by $\tau_M(A)^{1/2}$ must be a volume form on the moduli space of gauge equivalence classes of flat connections for the integral to work. That means $\tau_M(A)^{1/2}$ is a top dimensional form on $H^1(M;adA)$. What is the explicit formula for the volume form? In other words, how do you go about cutting down the torsion and taking its square root as as a differential form? 

There are actually some hyperbolic volume results due to Francois Costantino which you can find on his web page $URL$ Especially the papers in the Proceedings of the London Math Society and Geometry and Topology. Also Stavros has an interesting conjecture about the Reshitkhin-Turaev invariant of closed manifolds and the complex Chern-Simons invariant, which includes volume. $URL$ Stavros idea is to form a generating function whose coefficients are the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants of the manifold of level $r$. He proves that the power series converges in a neighborhood of zero in the plane, and then conjectures that the Borel regulator of the manifold has something to do with the poles of the analytic continuation. More speculatively, using the standard values of $q$, that is $e^{2\pi i/r}$ where $r\geq 3$ is an integer, the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant of a three-manifold grows polynomially, where the exponent is half the complex dimension of its $SL(2,C)$-character variety, so you don't get exponential growth. This means the asymptotics of the values of the invariants are quite subtle. On the other hand, by picking other primitive $r$-th roots of unity, the positivity of the quantum dimensions of the representations break down and you can get exponential growth. The failure of positivity is broached in Habegger, Masbaum, Vogel and Blanchet's big paper in Topology on TQFT. Anyways... I don't know of the results of any experiments about the growth of the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant with such choices. My guess is that there is interesting stuff going on with the exponential growth rate, that is reflecting the geometry of the underlying manifold. In a slightly different direction, using "bad" values of $q$ as above, Gregor Masbaum, Jorgen Anderson and Kenji Ueno were able to recover the translation length of an element of the mapping class group of a planar surface with four boundary components on Teichm\"{u}ller space from the representation on the state space assigned to the surface by the TQFT with corners underlying the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant. They get it as the exponential growth rate of the trace of the induced morphism. See for instance: Andersen, JÃ¸rgen Ellegaard; Masbaum, Gregor; Ueno, Kenji Topological quantum field theory and the Nielsen-Thurston classification of $M(0,4)$. Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 141 (2006), no. 3, 477--488 Not only has the volume conjecture not been resolved, it is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to detecting classical geometry from semiclassical limits. 

Let $\epsilon: F(2)\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be the map that sends a word to its total exponential sum. It is a homomorphism. Notice that $lrlr^{-1}l^{-1}r^{-1}$ is sent to zero, as is any conjugate of it, so that the map descends to $\epsilon:PB_3\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$. The map is nonzero, as $l^2$ is a pure braid but $\epsilon(l^2)=2$. Notice that $(lr^{-1})^3$ is in the kernel of $\epsilon$ so that the normal subgroup generated by $(lr^{-1})^3$ is in the kernel of $\epsilon$, meaning that it cannot generate $PB_3$ normally. 

I am a little reticent to do this. This is just an outline that is based heavily on the BFK paper you cited in the question, and what seems to be your observation. Maybe I am just repeating back to you what you are thinking. To start with $SL_2$ is the restricted dual of $U(sl_2)$ that is the linear functionals that factor through a finite dimensional representation. You can also think of $SL_2$ as the coordinate ring of $SL_2\mathbb{C}$. There is a linear functional $\mu:SL_2\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ given by restricting the function to $SU(2)$ and integrating against Haar measure. Even though its analytic its really algebraic, as Weyl orthogonality gives a complete set of rules for evaluating it. $SL_2$ is a Hopf algebra, which you will need for the next construction. Taking the tensor product of $\mu$ with itself $k$-times you get $\mu^{\otimes k}:SL_2^{\otimes k}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. There is an action of $U(sl_2)$ on $SL_2^{\otimes k}$ that is the analogy of the diagonal action by conjugacy of $SL_2\mathbb{C}$ on the coordinate ring of the cartesian product of $SL_2\mathbb{C}$ with itself $k$-times, $C[SL_2\mathbb{C}^k]=SL_2^{\otimes k}$, so that the ring of invariants can be identified with the characters of $SL_2\mathbb{C}$ representations of the free group on $k$ letters. From the Bullock paper in Commentari, or if you wish the Przytycki-Sikora paper about the same time, you can identify this ring with Kauffman bracket skein algebra with $A=-1$ of a cylinder over any orientable surface $F$ whose fundamental group is the free group on $k$ letters. That means we can use the algebra of Jones-Wenzl idempotents to construct things. Let $F$ be a closed oriented surface of genus $g$ and let $F'$ be the result of removing an open disk from $F$. Let $\sum_c (-1)^c(c+1)s_c(\partial F')$ be series coming from coloring $\partial F'$ with the $c$th Jones Wenzl idempotent. We can define a linear functional on the characters ring of $F'$ by letting $$YM(\alpha)=\lim_{N\rightarrow \infty} \mu^{\otimes 2g}(\sum_{c=0}^N\alpha(-1)^c(c+1)s_c(\partial F'))$$ The linear functional cannot see handleslides across the boundary of $F'$. That was how we defined the Yang-Mills measure in the paper. Lets see if we can see it more algebraically. Complete $ SL_2^{\otimes 2g}$ so that $$ \zeta=\sum_{c=0}^{\infty}(-1)^c(c+1)s_c(\partial F') $$ is in the completion and annihilates handleslides. Here is how to complete. The Yang-Mills measure defines a symmetric pairing $$<\alpha,\beta>=YM(\alpha\beta)$$ We say a sequence $\alpha_n$ is Cauchy if for every character $\beta$, the sequence of complex numbers $<\alpha_n,\beta>$ is Cauchy. We complete by including the characters of the free group into the equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences. The completion is no longer an algebra, but it is a module over the the characters of the free group. Notice for any character $\alpha$, the sequence of partial sums of $\alpha \zeta$ is Cauchy, and hence defines an element of the completion. The span of all $\alpha\zeta$, the cyclic module generated by $\zeta$ is isomorphic to the $SL_2\mathbb{C}$ characters of the fundamental group of $F$. Furthermore the restriction of the extension of the $\mu^{\otimes 2g}$ to that cyclic module is the Yang-Mills measure. Finally, instead of using characters, you can use the Kauffman bracket skein algebras of cylinders over surfaces as long as $A$ doesn't lie on the unit circle, or it it does, it needs to be a $2p$th root of unity for some counting number $p$. There are other ways of getting there. I always thought that the Yang-Mills measure had something to do with type $II_1$ factors, at least in the quantized case, but I could never get there. No doubt you need $A$ to be real, and then you need to do some some sort of transform as initially skeins act like unbounded operators. 

The answer no. Neither quantum invariants nor the Alexander polynomial sees the difference between a knot in the three sphere and a knot in Euclidian three space. In the case of the Alexander polynomial the missing point does not interfere with the first homology of the infinite cyclic cover. In the case of quantum invariants, it is often proved that the coefficients of the vector assigned to the the knot complement by whatever TQFT you are working with are given by evaluations of one of the standard knot polynomials, which are the same for knots in the sphere and knots in Euclidian space. No matter how you present the torus knot there is a subgroup of the homeomorphism group of the complement of the $(p,q)$-torus knot ( in the sphere) that is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p\times \mathbb{Z}_q$. So you cannot rule it out with topological invariants that don't distinguish between knots in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and knots in $S^3$. 

A 2-group? You are tough cookie. For a knot group, Crowell-Fox's book on knot theory does a nice job. In general its just an observation about the module structure of the CW groups of a normal covering space of your CW complex, where you are working over the group ring of the deck transformations. It only works for computing the 0th and 1st homology groups. Maybe you meant two complex. :) In which point it works for every homology group. 

I remember that in the beginning, there was an axiom for $(n+1)$-dimensional TQFT that said that the state space $V(\Sigma)$ assigned to an $n$-dimensional oriented manifold is spanned by the invariants of all $n+1$-dimensional oriented manifolds $M$ with $\partial M=\Sigma$. If we call the invariant of $M$, $Z(M)\in V(\Sigma)$, this just says that $V(\Sigma)$ is spanned by all $Z(M)$. Maybe it was in Segal's Swansea notes, maybe it was in an early version of Atiyah's axioms. It doesn't seem to have made it into "The Geometry and Physics of Knots" For instance if you read "Topological Quantum Field Theories Derived from the Kauffman Bracket" by Blanchet, Habegger, Masbaum and Vogel, the vacuum hypothesis is implicit in their constructions. There is a theorem that the category of Frobenius algebras is equivalent to the category of $1+1$-dimensional TQFT's. For instance, let $A=\mathbb{C}[x]/(x^3)$, with Frobenius map $\epsilon(1)=\epsilon(x)=0$ and $\epsilon(x^2)=-1$. This is the choice that Khovanov made to construct his $sl_3$-invariant of links. At this point, no one would deny that this gives rise to a TQFT. The state space associated to a circle is just $A$. The $2$-manifolds with boundary the circle are classified by genus. Using TQFT to compute them, I get that a disk has invariant $1$, a surface of genus one with one boundary component has invariant $3x^2$, and any other surface has invariant $0$. The invariants don't span $A$. The problem as I learned from Chris French is that $A$ is not semisimple. In fact, $A$ being spanned by the invariants of surfaces with one boundary component is equivalent to the semisimplicity of $A$. Here is my question. At what point, and why was the vacuum hypothesis abandoned? 

Don't think about $SO(3)$ to start with, think about the unit quaternions, $S^3\subset \mathbb{R}^4$ where multiplication is given by quaternion multiplication and inverses are given by "complex conjugation". It might help to realize that the dot product in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is given by $q.p=Re(q\overline{p})$. The unit quaternions act on themselves by conjugation, and this action fixes the identity, inducing an action of the unit quaternions on the tangent space of $S^3$ at $1$ which is canonically isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^3$. Call the unit quaternions $S^3$, call this action $ad:S^3\times \mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$. First prove that this action is as rigid rotations by proving it preserves the dot product on $\mathbb{R}^3$. Next prove that the kernel of the map induced by $ad$, $h:S^3\rightarrow SO(3)$ has kernel $\{\pm 1\}$. Finally, use a dimension count to prove the map is onto. From there you can conclude that $S^3$ is the universal cover of $SO(3)$ with group of deck transformations $\mathbb{Z}_2$. I usually assign this as homework, though I set the kids up by giving this outline to fill in. Another fun picture of $SO(3)$ is given by the unit tangent bundle of $S^2$. Notice that this can be described as $$ T_1S^2=\{(\vec{u},\vec{v})\in \mathbb{R}^3\times \mathbb{R}^3|||\vec{u}||=||\vec{v}||=1, \ \vec{u}.\vec{v}=0\} $$ Notice that the matrix with columns $\vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{u}\times \vec{v}$ is in $SO(3)$. This map gives a diffeomorphism between $T_1S^2$ and $SO(3)$. The projection map $p:T_1S^2\rightarrow S^2$ that sends the pair $(\vec{u},\vec{v})$ to $\vec{u}$ is a fibration, and this is the standard fibration that people use to analyze the homotopy groups of $SO(3)$. 

I would say that topology is defined in terms of open sets and closed sets. I think it is motivated by two theorems from the Calculus. The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem and the intermediate value theorem. In its simplest form, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem says that an infinite subset of a closed bounded interval $[a,b]$ of the real numbers has a limit point. You find that limit point as follows. As there are infinitely many points in the set, then there are infinitely many in the left half or the right half of $[a,b]$. Say the left half. Divide that interval in half and there are infinitely many in one half or the other. Proceed this way to produce a sequence of closed intervals $I_{n+1}\subset I_n$ with the length of the $n$th interval equal to $\frac{b-a}{2^n}$. By Cantor's theorem $\cap_n I_n$ is nonempty, and the point in there is your limit point. It didn't really make a difference if you broke the interval into two pieces or 10 pieces. This leads to the notion of compactness, by saying that every open cover has a finite subcover. The fact that the intersection of the closed intervals $I_n$ is nonempty is the complementary notion that a collection of closed subsets with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection. The proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem leads you to think of open and closed sets. A similar analysis of the proof of the intermediate value theorem leads likewise to open sets and closed sets. Really, the concept of a topology was an incredible creative leap, that allowed people to take ideas from the Calculus and apply them in other places. Similar leaps to me, are the notion of sigma algebra, distribution (in the PDE sense), and the construction of homological algebra. :) 

I'd like to buy some hypotheses. Hopf algebras are ubiquitous algebraic objects that can be the cohomology ring of an H-space, the Universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra, the group ring of a group, or a crucible for understanding a solution to the Yang-Baxter equation. Put on enough additional hypotheses and you can get several different theorems of the form you are asking for. 

No. If you look in Charles Frohman and Benjamin Fine, "Some Amalgam Structures for Bianchi Groups," 1988, Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 102, No. 2, pp. 221-229, we construct a splitting of $PSl_2(\mathcal{O})$ where we are in a $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{-d}]$ for d a positive square free integer that is big enough, and one of the factors is the elementary matrices. The fact that the elementary matrices do not generate was well known. I think I learned it from Morris Newman. Maybe Richard Swan proved it?
