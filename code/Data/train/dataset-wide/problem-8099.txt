As a bonus question in an exam we were asked to find compact metrix spaces $X,Y$ and $Z$ such that $d_{GH}(X,Y)=d_{GH}(X,Z)=d_{GH}(Y,Z)>0$. The proposed answer is to take $\{0\},\{-1,1\}$ and $\{-1,0,1\}$. And the distances can be easily calculated by trying all appropriate correspondances and calculating distortions. However I proposed the following three sets ( there are only two radii and they are $R>r$) 

set $X$ is the big closed ball of radius $R$. Set $Y$ is the small closed ball of radius $r$. Set $Z$ is a closed ball of radius $r$ union two perpendicular line segments of length $2R$ that intersect in the center of the ball. The conjecture is that all distances are $R-r$. To achieve this distance simply place the figures concentrictly. (I think we may need that $\frac{r}{R}$ is big) In order to get lower bounds for the distances involving $Y$ one simply uses the bound $d_{GH}(A,B)\geq |\text{Diam}(A)-\text{Diam}(B)|/2$. But I am stuck calculating the distance between $X$ and $Z$. One approach is to use contradiction and try to use distortions. If we take $x_1$ and $x_2$ diametrally opposite then if $z_1\sim x_1$ and $x_2\sim z_2$ we must have $d(z_1,z_2)>r$ and so at least one of $z_1$ and $z_2$ is outside the small ball, but Im stuck after this. 

Good lord, Charles, was the reposting of this an invitation for another advertisement from me? ``More concise algebraic topology. Localization, completion, and model categories'', by Kate Ponto and myself, is available for purchase and will be formally and officially published next month. I have a copy in my hand, and the final version is 514 pages (including Bibliography and Index). Still 65 dollars (and don't fall for pirate editions on the web). It is not perfect, of course. (I know of one careless mistake every reader will catch and one subtle mistake almost no reader will catch). I offer $10 to any reader finding a mistake I don't know about, even misprints. The book is intended to help fill the gap (and another, more calculational, follow up to Concise is planned). The first half covers localization and completion and is more technical than I hoped simply because so much detail was needed to fill out the theory as it was left in the great sources from the early 1970's (Bousfield-Kan, Sullivan, Hilton-Mislin-Roitberg, etc), especially about fracture theorems. The second half is an introduction to model category theory, and it has a number of idiosyncratic features, such as emphasis on the trichotomy of Quillen, Hurewicz, and mixed model structures on spaces and chain complexes. The order is deliberate: novices should see a worked example of serious homotopical algebra before starting on categorical homotopy theory. There is a bonus track on Hopf algebras for algebraic topologists and a brief primer on spectral sequences. There are example applications sprinkled around, although more might have been desirable. The book is quite long enough as it is. Merry Christmas all. 

Let $U$ be a finite set and $\mathcal O$ a set of subsets of $U$, how many subsets $\mathcal S$ of $\mathcal O$ satisfy the union of the elements of $\mathcal S$ is equal to $U$? I think the problem of finding the smallest of these subsets is called the set cover problem, I can't find any reference to this structure though. Thanks in advance. Regards. 

I think the following works: Looking at the book enumeration of finite groups, We obtain that the number of groups of order $p^k$ is at least: $$\frac{p^{\frac{2m^3}{27}}}{p^{\frac{2}{3}m^2}}$$ We also obtain that the number of groups of order $n$ is: $$n^{\frac{2\mu^2}{27}}n^{\mathcal O(\mu^{3/2})}$$ where $\mu$ is the largest exponent for a prime power dividing $N$. So take a natural $N$, and suppose that $2^m$ is the largest power of $2$ not exceeding $N$, we obtain that the number of groups of order $2^m$ is at least: $$\frac{2^{\frac{2m^3}{27}}}{2^{\frac{2}{3}m^2}}=\frac{(2^m)^{\frac{2}{27}m^2}}{(2^m)^{\frac{2}{3}m}}\geq\frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^{\frac{2}{3}m}2^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}\geq \frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^m}$$ On the other hand, if $n$ is an odd integer less than $N$, clearly its $\mu$ is at most $m\log_3(2)+1$. For large values of $m$ we can just bound this by $\alpha m$, for some pre-selected $\alpha<1$. So the number of groups of odd order is : $$N(N^{\frac{2\alpha^2 m^2}{27}}N^{\mathcal O(m^{3/2})})$$. So the fraction between the number of groups of order $2^m$ and the number of groups of odd order less than $N$ for large $N$ is at least: $$\frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^mN(N^{\frac{2\alpha m^2}{27}}N^{\mathcal O(m^{3/2})})}=N^{\frac{2(1-\alpha^2)m^2}{27}-\mathcal O(m^{3/2})}$$ Which clearly goes to infinity. 

This is really just a comment, but a bit too long. Thanks Tyler. Ulrich, that is a good question. I once worked hard to understand the zeroth space of MU (and more simply BP), one prime at a time, calculating Dyer Lashof operations. I threw away my notes because the answers I was getting seemed unhelpful. I seem to recall a paper of Steve Wilson that considers the Hopf ring of BP_0, but my memory may be failing me. The problem is that these spaces are very large and seem to have nothing like the economical and intuitive description of their K-theory analogues. It could be a good problem to try to understand what these infinite loop spaces really look like and what they mean geometrically. A short modern summary of early work on GL_1(R), alias FR, in general is in [114] on my web page. There is work in progress by John Lind that makes honest the idea that BGL_1R is a classifying space for a reasonably concrete kind of ``principal GL_1R-bundle''. 

Let $E_n$ be the number of isomorphism classes of groups of even order at most $n$, let $G_n$ be the number of isomorphism classes of groups of order at most $n$ and $T_n$ be the number of isomorphism classes of $2$-groups of order less than $n$. I think that it is an open problem if $\frac{T_n}{G_n}$ approaches $1$, so I figured that it is probably not so hard to prove that $\frac{E_n}{G_n}$ approaches $1$, although I was not able to do so. 

Let $X,Y$ be a bipartite graph and $X',Y'$ be two subsets of the vertices. Is there a Hall type theorem for the existence of matchings saturating both subsets simmultaneously? Clearly necessary conditions are for a saturating matching to exist in $X'\cup Y$ and $X\cup Y '$ but I don't know if this is sufficient. 

I am also interested in formulas for the expected length if the initial vertex is chosen uniformly. Thank you kindly. 

Chris, that is not actually what we did. Personally, I find indexing simplicial sets by inner product spaces to be unnecessary and unhelpful, and I've not coauthored any paper with such a construction. One can easily compare symmetric spectra in simplicial sets with symmetric spectra in topological spaces, and one can easily compare symmetric spectra in topological spaces with orthogonal spectra. I see no point in a hybrid. As a matter of detail, in defining orthogonal spectra one can perfectly well work with all finite dimensional inner product spaces, without choosing a universe, whereas the universe is needed to define the linear isometries operad used in the EKMM construction. It is nice to keep the S^V as they are: that makes generalization to G-spectra effortless, where G is a compact Lie group, and that works for both orthogonal spectra of spaces and EKMM S-modules. I prefer eclecticism: the different models have different advantages. Here is an eclectic correct definition: a map of symmetric spectra (of spaces) is a weak equivalence iff its pushforward map of orthogonal spectra induces an isomorphism of homotopy groups. (Proven in the paper MMSS Chris cites.) 

Good evening, I am currently taking a class which has combinatorial designs as the first topic, we are using Peter Cameron's book Designs, Graphs, Codes and their Links which I am finding extremely interesting. I am really interested in a rigorous study of combinatorial designs without their links now.Of course I plan to continue taking the class, but I would really like to read a textbook just on designs (I am especially interested in realizable designs (like the social golfer and Kirkman girl problem)). Thank you very much in advance. Regards. 

I am aware that the problem of finding compositions of $n$ into numbers less than or equal to $k$ has been studied. But I do not think one of them can be used to compute the other. 

I am looking for some resources that provide information on traceable graphs(paths containing a hamiltonian path). I have found a lot of information on hamiltonian graphs, but none on traceable graphs. Thank you very much in advance. Regards. 

Here is how I like best to think about this, although I'll point to a few other proofs. Consider a general space $X$ (say compactly generated). There is a natural weak homotopy equivalence $\epsilon\colon |SX|\to X$ from the geometric realization of the singular simplicial set of $X$ to $X$. Moreover, $|SX|$ is a CW complex whose cellular chains (and cochains) are isomorphic to the (normalized) singular chains and cochains of $X$. If $X$ itself is a CW complex, then $\epsilon$ is a homotopy equivalence and is homotopic to a cellular homotopy equivalence. The induced map of cellular chains is a chain homotopy equivalence between the singular chains of $X$ and the cellular chains of $X$. Another proof just checks the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms for both. Relative homology is irrelevant since there is a version of the axioms for the reduced homology of spaces that is equivalent to the usual axioms for pairs of spaces. There is also a version of the axioms just on CW complexes, where the excision axiom reduces to the tautology that if a CW complex $X$ is the union of subcomplexes $A$ and $B$, then $A/A\cap B$ and $X/B$ are isomorphic CW complexes. The general excision axiom reduces to this version by a purely topological argument (no use of homology in any form needed). Here is a concise reference for these statements: $URL$ 

The stirling number of the second kind $S(n,k)$ counts the number of partitions of the set $[n]$ into $k$ non-empty parts. I found a definition for the numbers called the $r$-associated stirling numbers of the second kind in wikipedia. These count the number of partitions of $[n]$ into $k$ non-empty parts such that all of the parts have at least $r$ elements. They seem to be "not too hard to calculate" via the recursion: $S_r(n+1,k)=kS_r(n,k)+\binom{n}{r-1}S_r(n-r+1,k-1)$. I am interested in a very similar construction, for which I have been unable to find any references. I would like to count $F_r(n,k)$ defined as the number of partitions of $[n]$ into $k$ non-empty parts so that each of them has size $r$ or less. Most of all I am interested in $\sum\limits_{k=0}^nF_r(n,k)$, basically the number of partitions of $[n]$ into parts of size $r$ or less. Thank you very much in advance Regards. 

A high level purely homotopical answer that does not require explicit consideration of homology or cohomology is given in Theorem 19.1.5 of Parametrized Homotopy Theory, by Johann Sigurdsson and myself. That result works equivariantly, where orientation is not as well understood as one would like. Nonequivariantly, the result gives a description of the spectrum $k\wedge M_+$ for any spectrum $k$ and smooth closed manifold $M$ as a function spectrum defined in terms of parametrized spectra. That may sound daunting, but it is really very natural. Here $k$ doesn't even have to be a ring spectrum. 

The diagonal condition was used crucially in Milnor's classical paper. Milnor, John. On spaces having the homotopy type of a CW-complex. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 90 1959 272–280. He gives earlier references to Fox and Serre. In the parametrized generalization, there is a general fiberwise NDR pair characterization of cofibrations that applies (e.g. Lemma 5.2.4 in May and Sigurdsson, Parametrized homotopy theory). 

I would like to know information regarding the function $h(n)$ where $h(n)$ is the number of hamiltonian cycles the graph $K_n$ has after removing the edges that make up a hamiltonian cycle of $K_n$. Thank you very much in advance. Regards. 

Let $F$ be a finite family of non-empty sets such that any two of them intersect. Consider the set $F'$ consisting of all sets that are a subset of at least one element of $F$. Prove $|F'|\geq 2|F|$. I conjectured this yesterday but have been completely unable to prove it. I tried doing things like inclusion-exclusion on the poset of the subsets but I was not able to solve it, I also tried things similar to Dilworth's theorem. Since this problem is so natural I think that it should have been attempted before, does anyone have any references?
