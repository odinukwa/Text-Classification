The definition of entanglement entropy in Quantum Field Theory involves decompositing a Hilbert space into a tensor product $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_A \otimes \mathcal{H}_B$. As an example, is it possible to decompose the $L^2$ hilbert space $L^2([0,1], dx)$ into the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces just by splitting the interval? Is there "mutual information"? To what extent is it possible to construct the value of an $L^2$ function on $[\tfrac{1}{2},1]$ using information from $[0,\tfrac{1}{2}]$? Or is there no mutual information, and it is possible to have an $L^2$ function on $[0,1]$ gluing together such functions on the left and right halves? 

When is this thing periodic? If it is periodic, there is $3 \times 3$ matrix encoding that sequence and the eigenvalues must be a roots of the characteristic polynomial, which is a cubic. Conversely, if I get three numbers which are roots to some polynomial $$ x^3 + ax + b = 0 $$ and if I run the Brun continued fraction with the three roots, $(r_1, r_2, r_3)$ so I always get a periodic sequence? This makes sense if all three roots $r_1, r_2, r_3 \in \mathbb{R}$ are real numbers. Alternatively we could try to adjoin $\sqrt[3]{n}$ and get the real cubic extension $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{n})$ and then $1, \sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[3]{4}$ span the ring of integer, $\mathcal{O}_K$. We an ask if this sequence is periodic. $$ (n^{2/3}, n^{1/3}, 1) \mapsto \big(n^{2/3}- n^{1/3}, n^{1/3}, 1\big ) \mapsto \dots $$ Even in the quadratic case, I don't think I've read carefully the argument that periodic continued fractions must be quadratic irrationalities $a + b\sqrt{D}$ with $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}$. Perhaps I could read the relevant part of Khinchin or other resource. 

A zonotope is a linear combination of m vectors with coefficients in [0,1]: $Z = \{ \sum \lambda_i v_i : 0 \leq \lambda _i \leq 1 \}$. The fancy way is to say it's the Minkowski sum of line segments in Rn. One step in a certain geometric construction is to find the boundary faces of a zonohedron (3D). The boundary points all have λ=0 or 1 but that requires finding 2m points. It's also not clear which ones are within the polygon and which ones are corners. It might be possible to do it faster inductively. In two dimensions you can arrange the set $\{ v_i, -v_i: i = 1 \dots m\}$ in a circle and add them in clockwise order. In 3D, I might arrange the vectors in a sphere, but then I'm not sure in which order to add the vectors. I read somewhere, this is like integrating a discrete version of the Gauss map. 

Here's a machine to cook up (possibly) difficult to compute numbers. Take a dynamical system $T: X \to X$ (to be very careful say $(X, \mu)$ is a measure space and $\mathcal{B}$ is a sigma algebra -- often these are provided for you). The Birkhoff ergodic theorem says for any $f \in L^1(X, \mu)$ one should have: $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f\Big( T^n(x) \Big) = f^\ast(x) \stackrel{?}{=} \frac{1}{\mu(X)} \int f \, d\mu$$ and if $T$ is ergodic then $f^\ast$ is constant almost everywhere and is equal to the RHS The left side is called "average" but the right side is also called "average" -- so the question if you're talking vernacular is which type of average do you mean? Worst of all that average $f^\star(x)$ is constant a.e. so you get pointwise convergence usually -- almost always -- but for any single point you may have to do the computations all over for yourself. 

Is quantum mechanics necessary here? I think we are using Feynman-Hellman or Rayleigh-Ritz but I think there is something even more basic facts about Hermitian matrices as in these notes. 

How do sheaves arise in studying solutions to ordinary differential equations? EDIT: Is it possible to construct non-isomorphic sheaves on a domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ using solution sets to differential equations? EDIT: Is the sheaf of vector spaces arising from the solution set of a linear ODE necessarily a vector bundle? 

The problem is that critical percolation (in the scaling limit) has a larger group of symmetries than the grid it lives on at any finite scale. Therefore we need some way to find "holomorphic" observables that works in $\displaystyle \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{C}$. We could define a "discrete holomorhpic function on the grid by making sure it behaves correctly under translations: $$ f(z + dz ) = f(z) + f'(z) \, dz $$ This is really two equations, one for deformations $dx$ and another for $i \, dy$ and these should obey some type of Cauchy-Riemann equations: $$ \frac{f(z + dx) - f(z)}{dx} = \frac{f(z + i\, dy) - f(z)}{i\, dy} $$ Another relation that one might try to discretize is the Cauchy integral formula: $$ \oint f(z) \, dz = 0 $$ When we could draw a small loop around $z$ and make sure the average sums to zero: $$ f(z + dx ) \,(2 i \, dy) - f(z + i dy) \,(2\,dx) - f(z - dx) \,(2i\, dy) + f(z - i dy) \,(2\,dx) = 0$$ RSW is needed to establish Hölder continuity of certain observables in the scaling limit. We start to get concern the boundararies of these random regions in the plane, are simply too rough. 

I am trying to find a correspondence between 6-vertex model and an Aztec Diamond tiling. Here are the building blocks of the 8-vertex model: 

They start off with the KdV equation, and observe it has a very large space of symmetries. So we can take a solution and boostrap it to generate other solutions. $$ \partial_t \phi + \partial^3_x \phi - 6 \phi \, \partial_x \phi = 0 $$ The Korteweg de Vries equation is a nonlinear cubic differential equation, describing water waves. (See Boussinesq approximation). In this case, I believe there is a traveling wave solution: $$ \phi(x,t) = - \frac{1}{2} c \, \text{sech} \left[ \frac{\sqrt{c}}{2} (x - ct - a) \right] $$ However, I suspect the more attractive features of these equations are the integrals of motion: 

In anticipation of comments, by "amoeba" here I think I mean the boundary of the 2D region which is usually called "amoeba". 

You can find in the literature equivalences between dimer model and six-vertex, XXZ spin chain, Ising model, free fermions, Dirac operators etc. And there will always be a few details missing. Here in this work of Julien Dubedat we get how the Kasteleyn matrices are discretization of the Cauchy-Riemann operators. So we are only getting the complex structure 

and we can check these are integrals of motion using the rules of ordinary calculus, showing that $\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int [\dots ] \,dx = 0$. I was never 100% sure about these two styles of studying PDE. One generates solutions using algebraic manipulations, another studying the well-posedness conditions and things like that. Huygens' principle leads to the KdV hierarchy, Schrödinger equation and many other famous equations. In that case, we are studying the scattering of light: rainbows.
