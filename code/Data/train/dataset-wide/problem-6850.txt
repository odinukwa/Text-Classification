I think the best approach to describe this phenomenon is to see it as a change from relational-oriented economics of poor countries (developing countries) to transactional-oriented economics of developed countries. The first is governed by uncertainty: the good’s value is what the customer is willing to pay, it difficult for the seller to calculate all the costs involved in selling the good, and without specialization there is no knowledge to calculate how much of items must be sold for price X to reach the certain profitability. Example: Lets imagine a street seller of bottled water in a developing country. The price of a bottled water will not be fixed, if his business activity has too many unknown factors. Perhaps he knows the price per unit at which he bought a bottled water, but there are more factors he has to consider. For example, 

On the other hand, Bolivia's growth of GDP is not that signifficant. In fact, the four quarters average of GDP growth does not exeede 2,5% (it dropped below 0% after 2015) (source). Bolivia's economy is much smaller than Peru and Chile (according to CIA World Factbook, Bolivia GDP is about 83 bln USD, while Peru GDP is 424 bln USD, Chile is 452 bln USD), so there is some kind of 'base effect' as regards measuring the GDP growth in relative values All in all, the last ten years were preety good for the global economy. In the age of low interest rates the capital was looking for developing countries like Bolivia to invest in. The real test for the Bolivia economy will come, when the bull market ends. 

In the standard discrete time economies with a finite number of states, $n$, a complete markets economy is simply an economy with $n$ independent assets (Think Ljunqvist and Sargent Chapter 8). This is because $n$ independent assets is sufficient to span the set of states tomorrow. I had a discussion with a professor last week in which he stated that one of the conveniences of continuous time when thinking about asset pricing is that within a continuous time economy one can get complete markets simply with a risk-free bond and a risky asset (independent) for each Brownian motion in the economy. He explained it as we talked, so I think I mostly understand it, but was wondering if someone would mind writing down the details? I will probably spend a day or two this week on it (depends on some of the properties of the differential calculus), so if no one else answers the question then hopefully I can provide a satisfactory answer. 

Consider a standard exchange economy (agents are endowed with some set of goods that they will use to trade with others). Piccione and Rubenstein wrote a somewhat interesting paper about "jungle equilibria" of an exchange economy. In their paper, allocations are decided by allowing more powerful animals are able to take goods from weaker animals (I don't think their preferences were necessarily monotonic -- i.e. I think there was satiation). They not only show that an equilibrium of this form exists, but that it is Pareto efficient (you can't make anyone better off without making someone else worse off). Obviously this paper isn't exactly a model of the jungle, but the point is that there could be an equilibrium in the wild which follows a framework similar to this (and I think it is a cool paper and your question reminded me of it). 

So, the answer is no. Panel (a) is not possible in perfect competition. And it follows much of the idea from the previous answer. The price will be equal to the average cost if the firm is to have zero profit. Moreover, from the maximization of the firm's problem, price will also equal the marginal cost. This situation is given to you on panel (b). 

Fama-French library has good data on which you can test your first Fama-French regression model. I have found this video on Youtube that might help you with this first project. Ps.: It would help a lot if you were more specific about what you want to learn. I can give other suggestions, but I really don't know what you are looking for. 

Yes, this is supposed to be the GDP. You can interpret it as being the sum of all aggregate value in the economy, so all intermediary goods and services are already in there. 

As mentioned in Herr K's comment, asset pricing is the theory to price assets (such as equity, bonds, options, futures, swaps, etc). For this, you can use models like CAPM/Fama-French (returns), Black-Scholes (options), Swensonn (interest rates), and many many others. When you say empirical asset pricing, this means that you go to the data (and each model deals with a different type of data) and try to price an existing asset based on the information that you see on the market. For example, in the Black-Scholes model, given the current stock price (S), the strike price for the option (K), the time until exercise (T-t), the risk-free rate (r) and the volatility of returns (sigma), you can use the formula directly and calculate the price of the option. Notice that this would be a theoretical price. In practice, you might observe something else in the market. You may want to do some arbitrage from here since there is mispricing (Don't go using this in the real market, but you get my point). For your last question, asset pricing is not necessarily just about the current value of an asset. You probably would also want to estimate future values based on your models. In fact, it is really of no use a model that tells you today's price. For that, you just look at the price on the tape and ignore your model. The whole point of building models is to make predictions. 

thus he chooses lottery $A'$. Now consider $L_{C'}$ and $L_{D'}$. He thinks these lotteries will pay 

Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it), we don't know what $x$ and $y$ look like in this equation. Instead we are given $(x' x)$, $(x' y)$, and $(y' y)$. Using your comment about what RSS actually is -- Namely, that $$\text{RSS} = (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})' (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})$$ First notice that $y_{\text{estimated}}$ is simply $x \beta$. Then replacing this in the previous formula gives us \begin{align*} \text{RSS} &= (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})' (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}}) \\ &= (y_{\text{observed}} - x \beta)' (y_{\text{observed}} - x \beta) \\ &= y'y - 2y'x\beta + x \beta \beta' x' \end{align*} Now this is almost what we want. We want things to ultimately be in terms of $(y'y)$, $(x'x)$, $(x' y)$, and $\beta$. The first term is exactly $y'y$, but other terms look like they have pieces we want and we just have to find a way to get them. Now, notice that each of the elements in our equation above is simply a scalar (aka sizes are such that they are $1 \times 1$). The determinant of a scalar is itself, then by using properties of determinants we can say: \begin{align*} 2y'x \beta &= \det(2y'x\beta) = \det(2 \beta' x' y) \\ x \beta \beta' x' &= \det(x \beta \beta' x') = \det(\beta' x' x \beta) \end{align*} I will leave the linear algebra itself as an exercise. 

As for the empirical research itself, I’ve seen many comparisons between transactional selling vs. relational selling, but this is a comparison between different marketing strategies (and approaches to marketing in general) in developed countries rather than cross-national analysis. This refers to your question in some way, for example in relational selling you are more inclinable to extend your budget for a certain customer and renegotiate price for the sake of creating long-lasting relationship with your client. Hope this helps. 

Thus, an idea is not purchasable for big companies. IP, prototype or a small company with IP is. Business perspective Even if you will have purchasable IP/prototype/company, big companies still decide which is the most beneficial: to buy or to reproduce. Most often the latter is cheaper. This is because if a larger company can, as you say, remove you from the market very easily, it probably will. If you are considering building your own company, I suggest seeing Michael Skok’s framework, especially chapter ‘Disruptive business models’ and ‘Getting Behind the Perfect Investor Pitch’. In short: if there are no technical barriers for possible competition, make a business model impossible to be replicated by competitors (real life example: Netscape market position was taken by Microsoft’s Internet Explorer because Microsoft could sell IE with every copy of Windows; Microsoft’s lost huge part of the market to the Google, because Google's business model comprised of delivering free products to consumers and profit based on advertisements). Please also consider that creating a new market takes not shorter than 3 years from the release of the product, sometimes even 7 years (source: S.Blank, B.Dorf, The Startup Owner's Manual). If you are interested in methods of evaluation return of investment However, if you are interested how big companies evaluate new ideas for investment (usually for development by themselves), most important factors are soft criteria. Those depend on the project, please find some exemples of such criteria below: 

A speculative bid in a Vickrey auction means that it is not what the bidder really thinks that the product is worth. Hence, a speculative bid is anything different from the true valuation of this product by the bidder (either a smaller or a larger price than the true one). In a Vickrey auction, the bidder has incentive to reveal his/her true valuation. If he/she does not do so, he/she risks losing (either by winning the bid and paying more than what the product is worth for them - if price was higher than true valuation -, or by losing the bid - if price was lower than true valuation). 

If that were the case, then they would have to print each time more and more money. And this does not happen. If fact, they usually just print what naturally comes out of circulation (bills get old and coins get lost) and enough to have inflation above zero, but not too far from it. (Deflation, as well as excessive inflation, have been shown to cause many problems to an economy.) 

Suppose the competitive price is P. If you quote at a a higher price Ph2>P, then someone else, say firm 2, will quote at a slightly lower price than you, say Ph2, and Ph1>Ph2>P. Since competition is perfect, firm 2 will capture all the market and you will go bankrupt. But firm 3 may put price Ph3 such that Ph2>Ph3>P and capture all the market. This process can be repeated until the equilibrium price is reached. On the other hand, if you place a price that is below the competitive price, you will go bankrupt. Hence, there is no economic rent because all firms in the competitive equilibrium will choose the equilibrium price which gives them an economic profit(rent) of zero. 

As you stated, transitivity is that overall $x \succeq y$ and $y \succeq z$ implies $x \succeq z$. I will show an example where majority rule isn't transitive and hopefully it will answer your question. Imagine that we live in a world with three people: Person 1, Person 2, and Person 3. Each of these people have preferences over three outcomes $x$, $y$, and $z$. Every decision in this world is made according to majority rules, i.e. The outcome chosen is the one preferred by at least two of the individuals. Now imagine that the three people have preferences according to: 

This is similar to what has already been said and it depends on what you classify as an asset. Money, although intrinsically worthless, maintains some worth which allows you to purchase in the future. There are three papers that I found really interesting on the subject (and I don't remember them being overly technical). They are three Kiyotaki Wright papers (1989, 1991, 1993). These papers basically set up a very simple economy (the one I'm thinking of has n goods and n agents). They then show what trade would look like in these economies without money and then what it would look like with the money. And one of the papers gets people basically establishing money (by saving a certain type of good which everyone accepts in trade). The others show that if you insert money into the economy then you are better off. Also, worth looking into if this is interesting to you is Neil Wallace's idea of "essentiality of money." 

Please see below historic results from Amazon’s first public annual report from 1997 (the year of IPO): 

As for an easy reference, @denesp cited an interesting source on this. There are some slight differences in the data, so I thought I would cite it alongside with annual report data, which is more precise. 

This enables to calculate profitability of the business give the price of a certain level. If you don’t agree with the price you will not buy the product, which is fine with the seller, because he thinks in the long-run and he may adjust in the price in the future to meet certain profitability. 

usually legal systems does not provide protection for ideas themselves, even if an idea is protected by intellectual protection rights (IP, as a side note please consider long procedure for application for patents, etc.), litigation is costly and long-lasting. You will have significantly smaller resources to be able to protect your idea (even if you win, by the time of the court ruling the market will be taken). 

It is very common for a company to have a loss (i.e. expenses > revenue) in the first year. Amazon is actually a very good example of that. It’s also a good example of ‘growth before profit’ strategy. Amazon was incorporated on July 5, 1994, and begun service in July 1995. This means that not only it did not generate profit in its first year, there were also no sales. Even after the launch the company generated loss:
