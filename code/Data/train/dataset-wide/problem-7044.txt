I would like to start by saying that I'm not a programmer and I have never contributed to any open source project. However, I have been interested in open source for a long time and I believe that I understand the general concepts of open source and how it works. To start of, I would like to say that open source does not mean that you cannot make money on the software. It just means that the code has to be publicly available. Companies like Red Hat and Canonical make money not by selling the software, but by selling their expertise. If i wan't my company to run a Linux server, I can get the software for free. But I need somebody to install it, set it up and give support. This is where specialist from e.g. Red Hat comes in and makes money. For the company it makes sense, because hiring their own specialist would probably be much more expensive. This also gives these companies an incentive to contribute the the code. They want their product to be good so people will use it and by their services. But lets talk about your points about scalability. 

If you have a game where both players are sender and receiver, then there is no asymmetric information and you do not have a signalling game, but a game with uncertainty. There are a lot of these games. E.g. bayesian games, global games etc. These types of games can also handle situations where some players no more about the state of the game than other player. E.i. they have a higer probability of being right. 

An additional answer would be bequests (Kessler & Masson, 1989; Becker & Tomes, 1994) or actually deriving "utility" from holding wealth, due to some status effect. 

Ok, first try for your first question. From $u'>0\Rightarrow \phi\theta p>0 \Rightarrow \phi,\theta, p\ne 0$. From $u''<0\Leftrightarrow \phi \theta p c_t^{p-1}\exp(\theta c_t^p)(p-1)c_t^{-1}+\phi \theta p c_t^{p-1}c_t^{p-1}\exp(\theta c_t^p)c_t^{-1}p\theta<0\Leftrightarrow \phi \theta p c_t^{p-1}\exp(\theta c_t^p)(p-1)c_t^{-1}+\phi \theta p c_t^{p-1}c_t^{p-1}\exp(\theta c_t^p)c_t^{-1}p\theta<0 \Leftrightarrow \phi \theta p (p-1)+\phi \theta p c_t^{p-1}p\theta<0$

I know that if the objective function (aka utility) is homothetic, demand functions will be linear in income. So for an homothetic demand function to give goods independent of prices other than their own, one has to have a Cobb-Douglas function as it also has to be homogeneous of degree zero. My question: can someone supply an example of a class of preferences yielding price independent demand functions $x_i = g(\frac{y}{p_i})$? (no prices nor income in preferences, just quantities) 

I googled a lot and I'm still to find: 1. In which paper/book/reference do Leontief [production] functions make their first appearance? Similarly 2. In which paper/book/reference do perfect complements/Leontief utilities make their first appearance? 

I'll try to fit this in an answer. I think you are confusing nominal and relative value. Inflation means that the 'value' of your money depreciates relative to other things. For example, in the year 2000 I could buy a bread for 1 USD. In the year 2015 I can buy a bread for 2 USD. This means that the dollar lost half of it's value relative to bread. But nominal 1 USD is still 1 USD and 1 bread is still 1 bread. So in your example: today 1 BTC = 578.25 USD. If there is inflation of the USD (the value depreciates), then all else being equal BTC should appreciate against the USD (go up in nominal USD-value). So to work further with the bread-example. If in the year 2000 1 BTC would buy 500 USD then in 2015 1 BTC should buy 1000 USD. So the USD went down in value relative to BTC. for more information: $URL$ $URL$ 

Looked a bit further, I think I possibly found what you're looking for: The Overall Trade Restrictiveness Index (OTRI) summarizes the trade policy stance of a country by calculating the uniform tariff that will keep its overall imports at the current level when the country in fact has different tariffs for different goods. The data: $URL$ Background: $URL$ hope this helps, best regards 

Real GDP is a variable for aggregate income. You might think of your model very loosely as an "aggregate demand function". Then, as the elasticity of a function $\varepsilon=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{f(x)}{x}$ can be expressed in terms of logarithms $\varepsilon=\frac{\partial \ln f}{\partial \ln x}$, in your estimation it would amount to say that, ceteris paribus, the elasticity of (assuming average) higher education to real income per capita is $0.47$. This implies that the "demand" for higher education is inelastic ($\varepsilon \in (0,1)$), which kind of makes some sense. Within that framework (aggregate average, not consistent with demand theory), I think a better model would come from adding ${(\ln RGD)}^2$ to your model, to let the "income elasticity" describe some nonlinearities as it would sound really strange that if RGDP would go up 1000x average education would go up 470x, as this would mean people would be living some centuries before completing their education... 

The excerpt does not say "inefficient production", so I'm assuming the question is not exactly well put. Regarding this problem, I recommend checking literature on Baumol's cost disease. As to why services will then make up the lion's head of GDP, well if you'll spend relatively more on them than on material "things"... [it'll come by the definition of GDP itself]
