The above is obviously a toy model of Supply and Demand. But since nobody will start building a new car having only a toy model of it, I suppose that there must be some empirical research showing how Supply and Demand curves behave in real life and how equilibrium is reached which are used by economists for decision-making etc. Is there any article or probably textbook which contain an example of working model (i.e. an opposite of the toy model) of Supply and Demand? I'd like to grasp the difference between toy and working model of Supply and Demand. 

i.e. $W_r(N)$ in equations $\eqref{wg}$ and $\eqref{nwg}$ is shifts down so intersection with the function on the right side of equations shifts to the right. 

According to conventional analysis, a key factor in exchange rate determination is the state of the balance of payments. An increase in imports gives rise to an increase in a demand for foreign currency. To obtain the foreign currency importers will sell the domestic currency for it. Obviously, this will lead to the strengthening in the exchange rate of the foreign currency against the domestic currency. Conversely, if there is an increase in exports, all other things being equal, then once the exporters exchange their foreign currency earnings for domestic currency this sets in motion a strengthening in the domestic currency exchange rate against the foreign currency. Is there any model which relates the changes in exchange rate with balance of payment quantitatively? 

Yes, I would say so. If there is a stable increase in technological progress and productivity over time, the efficiency of the work force would increase, leading to current goods being produced more efficiently. This opens up space for new, higher-quality goods and services to be introduced into the market, which would undoubtedly grow the economy and likely increase consumption per capita. It seems unlikely to me, however, that such an economy would be able to maintain a fixed population in the long run. There would likely be an increase in the standard of living and life expectancy of the population. 

The question as posed doesn't make sense to me. An increase in the market interest rate will reduce the price of current bond holdings precisely because they become less attractive since there are now more profitable alternatives in the market. Market forces will lower the price of the bonds in response to the increase in expected future coupon streams from these alternatives. 

"Store of value" is part of the definition of money. That is to say, it's not really meaningful to ask "is money a store of value", because if it wasn't a store of value, it wouldn't be money. If a purported currency can't be exchanged for assets next week, next month, in a very similar manner to how it can be exchanged today, then it's not money. No one can trust it enough to accept it in exchange for goods and services. It doesn't have the option value of: consume now versus consume later. Your analogy confuses wealth with money. They overlap, but are not identical. In your example, the bank has no wealth unless people accept that trade must occur with pebbles: in that case, the bank is indeed wealthy, because it has all the pebbles, and everyone else has to give up something in order to access the pebbles. 

or $$ W(N) = P \cdot \frac{dQ}{dN}(N) $$ where $W(N)$ is a money wage, $N$ is an employment level, $Q(N)$ is a physical productivity of labour at that employment level and $P$ is a price of goods or as we call it today price level. In accordance with the principle of diminishing returns $\frac{dQ}{dN}(N)$ is a decreasing function of an employment level $N$. $W(N)$ is a non-decreasing function for those who agree to work for a smaller wage are hired first. Then the money wage $W(N)$ is equal to $P_w \cdot W_r(N)$, where $P_w$ is a price of wage-goods (or as we call it today consumer or final goods) and $W_r(N)$ is a real wage. Keynes uses it in the second postulate of classical theory: 

i.e. the function on the right side of $\eqref{wg}$ shifts up so intersection with the function on the left side of the equation shifts to the right. And finally: 

Assuming a firm is a perfect competitor in input markets, the long-run average cost curve, which traces out the minimums of short-run average cost curves, can be used to characterize economies and diseconomies of scale for a firm. This is definitely a practical concept in business and IO. In an industry where the long-run average cost curve is always decreasing, a natural monopoly will tend to emerge due to the increasing cost-efficiency of larger firms. In a monopsony, the employing firm's average labor cost curve is equal to the supply of labor in the labor market. The marginal cost curve lies above the supply curve in this market because the firm's market power allows it to expressly set wages as a function of the quantity of labor. One reason this is practical is that it offers a potential theoretical explanation of why we do not see significant disemployment effects, or may even see an increase in employment, from establishing minimum wages in particular labor markets. 

But Macroeconomics by G.Mankiw (2012) mentions neither this difficulty nor Clower constraint. So has this difficult task been solved and the model that formally explains why money is used in transactions when it is dominated as a store of value has been created? 

In Lectures on Macroeconomics by O.Blanchard and S.Fisher (1993) stated that (the emphasize is mine): 

i.e. increase of the ratio $\frac{P_{n-w}}{P_{w}}$ in $\eqref{nwg}$ effectively shift the marginal product of labour for non-wage goods expressed in wage-goods $\frac{P_{n-w}}{P_{w}}\frac{dQ_{n-w}}{dN}$ up so the intersection with $W_r(N)$ will move again to the right. Please note that Keynes aims to refute (some of) the above speculations. 

In his Quantity Theory of Money article M. Friedman uses the following formula for the money multiplier: $$ M = H \times \frac{\frac{D}{R}(1 + \frac{D}{C})}{\frac{D}{R}+\frac{D}{C}} $$ where $M = $ money supply under fractional reserve, $H$ = high-powered money, $D$ = deposits, $R$ = bank reserves, $C$ = currency in the hands of the public. Why did he write the formula in this unusual form? Are there any insights to be seen from it? For me the usual form is the one given for example in Mankiw: $$ M = H \times \frac{C+D}{C + R} = H \times \frac{\frac{C}{D} + 1}{\frac{C}{D} + \frac{R}{D}}$$ 

If you don't have any information about how demand behaves when prices vary (because prices haven't varied), then you can't say anything from that data about price elasticity. Given that you have the current price, you can say something about price elasticity based on information from other sources. In Bayesian terms, as you have no new information, your posterior is the same as your prior. 

Writing as an academic modeller who would use the outputs of such models, what's required (and what I look for as a reviewer) is: 

It all depends on what you mean by inflation and by money supply. Technical questions and answers need specific definitions, otherwise everyone ends up talking at cross-purposes. Is it possible to have an increase in general price levels without any changes to the amount of money in circulation? Yes: if the velocity of circulation of money increases, and the amount of goods and services available to buy does not increase by as much. Is it possible to have an increase in general price levels without any changes to the amount of money in circulation or the velocity of circulation? Yes: if the amount of goods and services available to buy, decreases, so that there's more money chasing fewer goods. Is it possible to have an increase in general price levels without any changes to the amount of money in circulation or the velocity of circulation, and with no decrease in the amount of goods and services available to buy? Yes, if the demand curve changes so that the same amount of money is now used to buy a smaller quantity of stuff at higher prices. Is it possible to have an increase in general price levels without any changes to the amount of money in circulation or the velocity of circulation, and with no change in the amount of goods and services bought? No, because the velocity of circulation is by definition total transaction value divided by the amount of money in circulation, so if velocity, quantity and money supply are constant, then prices must be too, because total transaction value equals prices times quantity. 

I think you're misreading what Sala wrote. The first sentence in the image you linked is just saying that in the worlds where either Case 1 or Case 2 occurs, the response of $b_t$ to a shock in $s_t$ allows us to differentiate between Ricardian and non-Ricardian regimes since there are no identification issues. In other words, if either the Case 1 inequalities or the Case 2 inequalities hold, then we can be confident that we have identified a non-Ricardian regime from a Ricardian regime. According to Sala, it seems that we cannot as easily identify Ricardian regimes from non-Ricardian regimes in Case 3 due to identification issues related to co-movements in real debt. 

You can visually inspect for heteroscedasticity in the disturbances by plotting the regression residuals against the fitted values and then checking if you can discern some pattern to the spread of the residuals in the scatterplot. The idea here is that the variance (spread) of heteroscedastic errors $\varepsilon_i$, conditional on the explanatory variables $X_i$, is not constant: $$ Var(\varepsilon_i | X_i) \neq \sigma^2.$$ You can also explicitly test for heteroscedasticity in a linear regression by using statistical tests such as Breusch-Pagan or White.
