The completed group ring of a compact $p$-adic Lie group with coefficients in a field of characteristic $p$ is topologically Noetherian. In fact, it is even abstractly Noetherian. This is a theorem of M. Lazard from the 1960s, and you can read more about these rings here. 

No. The problem is that $\Lambda$ might have too few units. Here is an example that illustrates this point. Let $\Lambda$ be the ring of Hurwitz quaternions. This is the subring of the usual quaternions $\mathbb{R} \oplus \mathbb{R} i \oplus \mathbb{R}j \oplus \mathbb{R}k$, freely generated as an abelian group by the four elements $\frac{1}{2}(1 + i + j + k), i, j, k$. It is known that $\Lambda$ is a maximal order in its division ring of fractions. Now let $p$ be any odd prime number and consider the ring $\bar{\Lambda} := \Lambda/p\Lambda$. It turns out that this $4$-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra is always isomorphic to ring of $2 \times 2$ matrices $M_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ with entries in $\mathbb{F}_p$. To see this, let $J$ be the Jacobson radical of $\bar{\Lambda}$; then by Wedderburn's Theorem, $\bar{\Lambda} / J$ is a direct sum of matrix rings over division rings. Suppose for a contradiction that all the matrix rings are $1 \times 1$. Since all finite division rings are commutative fields by another theorem of Wedderburn, $\bar{\Lambda} / J$ is commutative. But then $J$ contains the commutator $ij - ji = 2k$ which is a unit in $\bar{\Lambda}$ since $p$ is odd. This is a contradiction because $J$ is necessarily a proper ideal of $\bar{\Lambda}$. So there is at least one $n \times n$ matrix ring $M_n(D)$ with $n > 1$ occurring as a direct summand of $\bar{\Lambda} / J$ for some division ring $D$. A dimension count now shows that $n = 2$, $D = \mathbb{F}_p$ and $J = 0$. Now consider the action of $\bar{\Lambda}^\times \cong GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ on the set of maximal left ideals in $\bar{\Lambda} \cong M_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ by conjugation. The stabilizer of the maximal left ideal $\{\begin{pmatrix} \ast & 0 \cr \ast & 0\end{pmatrix} \}$ is the subgroup of lower triangular matrices in $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ which has index $p+1$ in $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$. So we conclude that there are at least $p+1$ distinct maximal left ideals in $\bar{\Lambda}$ (in fact it can be shown easily that $\bar{\Lambda}^\times$ acts transitively so that there are exactly $p+1$ distinct maximal left ideals in $M_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$.) However, it is known that $\Lambda^\times$ is a finite group (of order $48$, in fact). So as soon as $p + 1 > 48$ (we can take $p = 53$ for concreteness if you like), $\Lambda^\times$ cannot possibly act transitively by conjugation on the set of maximal left ideals belonging to $p \Lambda$. One final remark: if you change your hypotheses on $\Lambda$ and assume instead that $\Lambda$ is local (in the sense of having a unique maximal two-sided ideal), then the answer to your question becomes "yes". This is because any two maximal left ideals in a simple Artinian ring are conjugate by a unit, and units can be lifted modulo the Jacobson radical in any ring. 

Let $A$ be a reduced ring of order $p^n$. Then $(pa)^n = p^n a^n = 0$ for all $a \in A$ so $pA = 0$ and $A$ is an algebra over $\mathbb{F}_p$. Adjoining an identity element to $A$ if necessary, we may view $A$ as an ideal (of codimension at most $1$) in a finite dimensional unital $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra $B$. Let $J$ be the radical of $B$ and $C = B/J$. Since $A$ is reduced and $J$ is nil, $A \cap J = 0$ so $A$ is isomorphic to an ideal in $C$. Write the finite semisimple ring $C$ as a direct sum of simple rings $C = S_1\oplus \cdots \oplus S_m$; then $A \cap S_i$ is either $S_i$ or $0$ for all $i$. Assume without loss of generality that $S_i \subseteq A$ for $i=1,\ldots, k$ and $A \cap S_i = 0$ for $i > k$. Then $A$ contains $S_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus S_k$. We can find unique central idempotents $e_i \in S_i$ such that $S_i = e_iC$ and $1 = e_1 + \cdots + e_m$. Because $A$ is an ideal in $C$, if $a \in A$ and $i > k$ then $e_i a \in A \cap e_i C = A \cap S_i = 0$ so $a = e_1a + \cdots + e_ka \in S_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus S_k$. Hence $A = S_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus S_k$ is a finite direct sum of finite simple rings. By Artin-Weddernburn, each $S_i$ is a matrix ring over a finite division ring. These division rings are commutative by another theorem of Wedderburn, and the matrix sizes involved must all be $1 \times 1$ because otherwise $A$ would not be reduced. Therefore $A$ is commutative, and actually is isomorphic to a finite direct product of finite fields. Note that if the reduced assumption on $A$ is dropped, then any non-zero one-sided ideal in the matrix ring $M_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ gives an example of an associative, non-unital, non-commutative ring of order $p^2$. 

I usually find the statement of Nakayama's Lemma easy to remember because of its proof, which is really nothing more than the definition of the Jacobson radical plus the existence of maximal left ideals in a ring. Every non-zero finitely generated module $M$ admits a non-zero cyclic quotient module, which in turn (by a Zornication) admits a non-zero simple quotient module. So we can find a submodule $N$ of $M$ with $M/N$ simple. But now $J . (M/N) = 0$ since the Jacobson radical $J$ of the ring kills every simple module, so $JM \leq N < M$ which says that $JM$ is a proper submodule of $M$. Note that this general form of the Lemma doesn't need any complicated determinant-type arguments. In the commutative case, other forms of the Lemma can easily be obtained from this general form "$JM < M$" by considering localisation. 

Let $a \in J(A)$, and suppose for a contradiction that the left ideal $A[x](1 - xa)$ is proper. We can then choose a maximal left ideal $J$ of $A[x]$ containing $A[x](1-xa)$, so that $M := A[x] / J$ is a simple $A[x]$-module. Let $v := 1 + J$ be the canonical $A[x]$-module generator of $M$; then $(1 - xa)\cdot v = 0$ by construction. Now $x$ acts on $M$ by $A[x]$-module endomorphisms, so by assumption, there exists $\lambda \in k$ such that $x - \lambda$ kills $M$. Hence $$(1 - \lambda a) \cdot v = (1 - xa) \cdot v = 0.$$ However, since $a \in J(A)$, $1 - \lambda a$ is a unit in $A$, and it follows that $v = 0$. Hence $M = 0$, contradicting the simplicity of $M$. So in fact $A[x](1 - xa) = A[x]$, and therefore we can elements $b_0, b_1,\ldots, b_n \in A$ such that $$(b_0 + b_1x + \cdots + b_nx^n)(1 - xa) = 1.$$ Equating coefficients, we see that $b_i = a^i$ for all $i = 0, \ldots, n$, and also that $b_na = 0$. Hence $a^{n+1} = 0$ and $a$ is nilpotent. 

If this is the case then the Ore localisation $M_{\mathfrak{m}} = M_S$ coincides with $M$, so we can deduce that $pd_R(M) = fd_R(M) = fd_R(M_{\mathfrak{m}}) = fd_{R_{\mathfrak{m}}}(M_{\mathfrak{m}}) = pd_{R_{\mathfrak{m}}}(M_{\mathfrak{m}})$ using the results cited above. The third condition is known to hold for example whenever $R / \mathfrak{m}$ is an Artinian ring, since in this case the image of $S$ in $R /\mathfrak{m}$ is precisely the set of units of $R / \mathfrak{m}$ and therefore acts invertibly on $M$. 

No. Let $R = \mathbb{Z}_p[C_p]$ and consider the $R$-modules $M = R$ and $N = \mathfrak{m}$, the maximal ideal of the local ring $R$. Let $A,B$ the matrices in $GL_p(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ giving the action of a generator of the cyclic group $C_p$ on $M$ and $N$ respectively. Then $M \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}_p} \mathbb{Q}_p \cong \mathbb{Q}_p[C_p] \cong N \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}_p} \mathbb{Q}_p$ as $\mathbb{Q}_p[C_p]$-modules, so $A$ is conjugate to $B$ in $GL_p(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Write $R \cong \mathbb{Z}_p[T] / \langle (1 + T)^p - 1\rangle$ and let $f$ be the image of $\frac{1}{T}( (1 + T)^p - 1)$ in $R$; then it is not difficult to see that $N \cong R/\langle T\rangle \oplus R / \langle f\rangle$ as $R$-modules. This means that $N/pN$ is not a cyclic $R/pR$ module. However $M/pM = R/pR$ is a cyclic $R/pR$ module, so $M/pM$ is not isomorphic to $N/pN$ over $\mathbb{F}_p[C_p]$. This is because the $C_p$-coinvariant spaces of $M/pM$ and $N/pN$ are $1$ and $2$-dimensional over $\mathbb{F}_p$, respectively. Hence the reductions of $A$ and $B$ cannot be conjugate in $GL_p(\mathbb{F}_p)$. 

In general, the answer is No. Certainly Alex's example above shows that the condition that $Q$ is the classical left quotient ring of $R$ is necessary for your property to hold. Here is a (commutative) example which shows that it is not sufficient. Let $k$ be any field, let $R = k[x,y] / \langle xy\rangle$, and let $k(a)$ be the field of rational functions in one variable. Let $Q = k(a) \oplus k(a)$ be the direct sum of two copies of these, and consider the map $\varphi$ $: R \to Q$ which sends $x$ to $(a,0)$ and $y$ to $(0,a)$. Now $Q = I \oplus J$ where $I = k(a) \oplus 0 = Q\varphi(x)$ and $J = 0 \oplus k(b) = Q\varphi(y)$. This shows that $xR \subseteq \varphi^{-1}(I)$. Since $R$ is spanned over $k$ by powers of $x$ and powers of $y$, $R = xR \oplus k[y]$ as a $k$-vector space. If $\varphi( f(y) ) = (0, f(a)) \in I$ for some polynomial $f[t] \in k[t]$, then $f = 0$ because $k[a] \hookrightarrow k(a)$. This shows that $\varphi^{-1}(I) = xR$. Similarly $\varphi^{-1}(J) = yR$. Next, $\ker \varphi = \varphi^{-1}(I \cap J) = xR \cap yR = 0$, so we can view $\varphi$ as an embedding of $R$ into $Q$. If we identify $R$ with its image in $Q$ using $\varphi$, then $I \cap R = xR$ and $J \cap R = yR$ by the above paragraph, but $xR + yR$ is not the whole of $R$ (since the ideal $\langle x,y \rangle$ of $k[x,y]$ is proper). Thus $R$ properly contains the direct sum $(I \cap R) \oplus (J \cap R)$. Let $S$ be the set of regular elements of $R$, that is, the set of non-zero-divisors. We will show that $Q$ is the classical (left and right) quotient ring of $R$. To do this, we have to prove that (a) $\varphi(S)$ consists of units in $Q$, and (b) every element of $Q$ has the form $\varphi(r) \varphi(s)^{-1}$ for some $r \in R$, $s \in S$. For (a), note that $S$ is precisely $R \backslash (xR \cup yR)$; so if $s \in S$ then $\varphi(s) = (v,w)$ for some non-zero $v,w \in k(a)$. But then $(1/v,1/w) \in Q$ is an inverse for $\varphi(s)$. For (b), let $(v,w) \in Q$ and write $v = f(a)/h(a), w = g(a)/h(a)$ for some polynomials $f,g,h \in k[t]$ with $h \neq 0$ (you can choose the same denominator $h$ by passing to a common denominator). Then $(v,w) = \frac{ \varphi(xf(x) + yg(y)) }{ \varphi((x+y) h(x+y))} = \varphi(r) \varphi(s)^{-1}$ with $r = xf(x) + yg(y) \in R$ and $s = (x+y) h(x+y) \in S$. What's happened here is that the classical ring of quotients $Q$ of $R$ (also known in the commutative literature as the "total ring of quotients") has orthogonal idempotents $\frac{x}{x+y}$ and $\frac{y}{x+y}$ which don't lie in $R$; this stops $R$ from breaking up into a direct sum of two ideals. Geometrically, $Spec(Q) = \{xQ, yQ\}$ is disconnected, but $Spec(R)$ is not (it's the union of two intersecting lines in $\mathbb{A}^2_k$). This is a fairly common phenomenon. There are more complicated, but similar, non-commutative examples, too. Chapter 2 of the book "Noncommutative Noetherian Rings" by McConnell and Robson has information that you may find useful. See in particular Proposition 2.1.16. 

Yes. Let $J(\mathfrak{g}) := (Z(\mathfrak{g}) \cap \mathfrak{g} U( \mathfrak{g} ) ) \cdot U(\mathfrak{g})$ denote the ideal of $U(\mathfrak{g})$ you're interested in. First note that if $\mathfrak{g}$ is the $2n + 1$ dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}_n$ with basis vectors $x_1,\ldots, x_n, y_1,\ldots, y_n, z$ and the only non-zero Lie brackets $[x_1,y_1] = [x_2,y_2] = \cdots = [x_n,y_n] = z$, then it's not hard to calculate that $Z(\mathfrak{h}_n) = k[z]$ (since $k$ has characteristic zero), so that in this case $J(\mathfrak{h}_n) = zU(\mathfrak{h}_n)$ has infinite codimension in $U(\mathfrak{h}_n)$. Now if $\varphi : \mathfrak{g} \twoheadrightarrow \mathfrak{h}$ is a quotient of $\mathfrak{g}$, then $\varphi(J(\mathfrak{g})) \subseteq J(\mathfrak{h})$. Thus it suffices to show that every finite dimensional non-abelian nilpotent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ admits some $\mathfrak{h}_n$ as a quotient. Since $\mathfrak{g}$ is non-abelian, by replacing $\mathfrak{g}$ by $\mathfrak{g} / [\mathfrak{g}, [\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]]$ if necessary, we may assume that $\mathfrak{g}$ has nilpotence class two. Therefore $0 \neq [\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]\subseteq z(\mathfrak{g})$ (the centre of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$). Pick some non-zero $z \in [\mathfrak{g}, \mathfrak{g}]$ and let $\mathfrak{a}$ be a vector space complement to $kz$ in $z(\mathfrak{g})$. By replacing $\mathfrak{g}$ by $\mathfrak{g} / \mathfrak{a}$, we may therefore assume that $[\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}] = kz$. But now $[\bar{x},\bar{y}] = (x,y)z$ defines a non-trivial alternating bilinear form $(-,-)$ on $\mathfrak{g}/kz$. By the classification of such forms, we can find a quotient $\mathfrak{h}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ such that $[\mathfrak{h}, \mathfrak{h}] = kz$, and moreover the corresponding bilinear form on $\mathfrak{h} / kz$ is non-degenerate. This $\mathfrak{h}$ is isomorphic to some $\mathfrak{h}_n$. 

In general, if $V = \bigoplus_{\mu \in \Lambda} V_\mu$ and $W = \bigoplus_{\nu\in \Lambda} W_\nu$ are $\Lambda$-graded vector spaces (for some abelian group $\Lambda$), then $V \otimes W = (\bigoplus_\mu V_\mu) \otimes (\bigoplus_\nu W_\nu) = \bigoplus_{\mu,\nu} V_\mu \otimes W_\nu = \bigoplus_\lambda \left( \bigoplus_{\mu + \nu = \lambda} V_\mu \otimes W_\nu\right)$ shows that $V \otimes W$ is again a $\Lambda$-graded vector space, and that its $\lambda$-component is $\bigoplus_{\mu + \nu = \lambda} V_\mu \otimes W_\nu$. 

I don't think it's true even when $A$ is diagonalisable. Suppose that $A$ is a diagonal matrix, with $(i,i)$th entry $\lambda_i$; thus $A = \rm{diag}$$(\lambda_i)$. Then we can write $\rm{ad}(A) = \rm{diag}$$(\lambda_i - \lambda_j)$, so $P(\rm{ad}$$(A)) = \rm{diag}$$ (P (\lambda_i - \lambda_j) )$ for any polynomial $P(t)$. On the other hand, $A^m = \rm{diag}$$(\lambda_i^m)$ so $\rm{ad}$$(A^m) = \rm{diag}$$(\lambda_i^m - \lambda_j^m)$. So if $P(\rm{ad}$$(A)) = $$\rm{ad}$$(A^m)$ then $P(\lambda_i - \lambda_j) = \lambda_i^m -\lambda_j^m$ for all $i,j$ such that $1\leq i,j\leq n$. But it can happen that $\lambda_i - \lambda_j = \lambda_a - \lambda_b$ for two pairs of indices $(i,j)$ and $(a,b)$ with $\lambda_i^m - \lambda_j^m \neq \lambda_a^m - \lambda_b^m$. For a concrete example we can take $A = \rm{diag}$$(2,1,4,3)$. 

Let $k$ be a finite field, and let $R := k[X,Y] / (X^2,XY,Y^2)$. Then $R = k \oplus kx \oplus ky$ is a finite ring of order $|k|^3$ with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m} := kx \oplus ky$ of square zero. Now let $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & x \newline 0 & y \end{pmatrix} \in M_2(R)$. Then $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & x \newline 0 & y \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b \newline c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} cx & dx \newline cy & dy\end{pmatrix}$ whereas $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \newline c & d \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 0 & x \newline 0 & y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & ax +by \newline 0 & cx + dy\end{pmatrix}$. The equation $ax + by = 0$ with $a,b \in R$ implies $a, b \in \mathfrak{m}$ as can be seen by writing $a = \lambda + u, b = \mu + v$ for some $\lambda,\mu \in k$ and $u,v \in \mathfrak{m}$. Hence rann$(A) = \begin{pmatrix} R & R \newline \mathfrak{m} & \mathfrak{m}\end{pmatrix}$ has size $|k|^{10}$, whereas lann$(A) = \begin{pmatrix} \mathfrak{m} & \mathfrak{m} \newline \mathfrak{m} & \mathfrak{m}\end{pmatrix}$ has size $|k|^8$. 

This is Proposition 4.2.2 of Dixmier's book Enveloping algebras. First one shows that the intersection of the annihilators in $U(\mathfrak{g})$ of all finite-dimensional representations of $\mathfrak{g}$ is zero; this is a non-trivial result due to Harish-Chandra. Now if $J$ is a non-zero two-sided ideal of $U(\mathfrak{g})$, then we can find some finite-dimensional representation $V$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ such that $J \nsubseteq I := \mathrm{Ann}(V)$. Since $\mathfrak{g}$ is semisimple, by Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility we can replace $V$ by one of its irreducible direct summands and thereby assume that $V$ is itself irreducible. Therefore $\mathrm{End}_k(V)$ is a simple ring, and it follows that $$ \frac{J}{J \cap I} \cong \frac{I + J}{I} = \frac{U(\mathfrak{g})}{I} \cong \mathrm{End}_k(V) $$ because $I + J$ is a two-sided ideal in $U(\mathfrak{g})$ properly containing $I$. This is an isomorphism of $\mathfrak{g}$-bimodules. Next, the adjoint representation of $\mathfrak{g}$ in $U(\mathfrak{g})$ is locally finite (i.e. is the union of its finite-dimensional submodules). Since $\mathfrak{g}$ is semisimple, the short exact sequence of $\mathfrak{g}$-modules $$ 0 \to J \cap I \to J \to \mathrm{End}_k(V) \to 0 $$ splits, so we can find a $\mathfrak{g}$-module complement $W$ for $J \cap I$ inside $J$. Now the centre $Z(\mathfrak{g})$ of $U(\mathfrak{g})$ is just the set of $\mathfrak{g}$-invariants in $U(\mathfrak{g})$ under the adjoint representation, so that $$ W^{\mathfrak{g}} = W \cap Z(\mathfrak{g}) \subseteq J \cap Z(\mathfrak{g}).$$ However $W \cong \mathrm{End}_k(V)$ as a $\mathfrak{g}$-module, and $$ \mathrm{End}_k(V)^\mathfrak{g} = \mathrm{End}_{\mathfrak{g}}(V) \neq 0$$ because, for example, the identity map $\mathrm{id} : V \to V$ is a non-zero $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant. Hence $J \cap Z(\mathfrak{g})$ is non-zero, so $U(\mathfrak{g})$ has the intersection property. 

Let's treat the $c_i$ as formal indeterminates. Let $S(n,m)$ be the set of increasing functions $i:\{1,\ldots, m\}\to \{0,\ldots, n-2\}$, written $j \mapsto i_j$, such that $i_{j+1} > i_j + 1$ for all $j=1,\ldots, m$. So $S(n,m)$ is in bijection with the set of subsets of $\{0, \ldots, n-2\}$ of size $m$ which contain no adjacent pair $(k, k+1)$. Then the coefficient of $x^{n - 2m}$ in $q_n$ is $\sum_{i \in S(n,m)} c_{i_1} c_{i_2} \cdots c_{i_m}$ and all other coefficients are zero: $q_n = \sum_{m = 0}^{[n/2]} \left( \sum_{i \in S(n,m)} c_{i_1} c_{i_2} \cdots c_{i_m} \right) x^{n - 2m}$. Proof: induction on $n$. Possibly considering the generating function $F = \sum_{n=0}^\infty q_nt^n$ may be helpful? Note that these coefficients are not elementary symmetric polynomials in the $c_i$, since for example already $c_2c_0$ isn't invariant under all permutations of $\{0,1,2\}$. I just thought I'd spell out the symmetry that is involved here, and perhaps someone else knows a name for these coefficients.
