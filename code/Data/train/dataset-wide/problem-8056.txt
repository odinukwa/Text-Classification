Have any of you looked at the following? Higgins, P.~J. The fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups. J. London Math. Soc. (2) 13~(1) (1976) 145--149. He gives a nice normal form for this fundamental groupoid which has been further exploited in Moore, E. Graphs of groups: word computations and free crossed resolutions. Ph.D. thesis, University of Wales, Bangor (2001). (downloadable) One could then investigate coverings of graphs of groups in terms of covering groupoids of this fundamental groupoid. The relevant theory of covering morphisms of groupoids is given by Higgins in Higgins, P.~J. Notes on categories and groupoids, Mathematical Studies, Volume~32. Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. London (1971); Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories, No. 7 (2005) pp 1-195. and also in my book Topology and groupoids Chapter 10, which makes clear in terms of an equivalence of categories the relation between covering maps of a "good" space $X$ and covering morphisms of the fundamental groupoid of $X$. I have not had time to compare this with the paper by Bass. For some reason, the main authors on graphs of groups insist on choosing base points and trees. Incidentally, the notion of covering morphism of groupoids occurred under the name "regular morphism" in a 1951 Annals paper of P.A. Smith. 

The monoidal closed category of chain complexes was discussed in my 1964 paper Cohomology with chains as coefficients, (Proc LMS) including the relation with the Dold-Kan functor, but not using that terminology. Part of the problem is that the "natural" monoidal closed structure on simplicial abelian groups, using tensor in each dimension, is not the one that comes from chain complexes and the Dold-Kan equivalence! This problem has been recently studied by Joyal. In my experience cubical methods have value in handling higher homotopies, because of the formula $I^n \times I^m \cong I^{m+n}$. There is a Dold-Kan type theorem for cubical abelian groups (with connections!). 

The full story is also given in the EMS Tract Vol 15. The proofs very much involve the use of filtered spaces, the algebra of the multiple compositions of cubes, and the relation with the classical invariants of relative homotopy groups. 

I think the relevant formula is 8.4.1 in T&G. This is applied in section 9.2 to the Phragmen-Brouwer property and the Jordan Curve Theorem. My original motivation for the investigation was to avoid a detour to compute the fundamental group of the circle: a basic theorem should compute THE basic example! I like the view of the integers (an infinite set) as an identification of a groupoid $\mathbf I $ with 4 arrows, identifying 0 and 1. Also I tend to see covering spaces in terms of covering morphisms of groupoids, since then a covering map is algebraically modelled by a covering morphism, whereas an action is one step further. In the new book `Nonabelian algebraic topology', published by the EMS, the van Kampen style arguments are used to compute relative homotopy groups as modules, and second relative homotopy groups as crossed modules, using colimit calculations. January 25,2016 There is a small correction to the Phragmen-Brouwer proof. 

Actions of a Lie groupoid are defined on p. 34 of K.C.H. Mackenzie, "General Theory of Lie Groupoids and Lie Algebroids" LMS Lecture Notes Series no 213, 2005. Note that in general for a groupoid action of $G$ on sets it is often convenient to follow C. Ehresmann and to insist on having a function $f: E \to Ob(G)$ so that $g \in G(x,y)$ maps the fibre of $f$ over $x$ to the fibre over $y$. In fact a standard equivalence is between actions on sets in this sense; functors $G \to Sets$; and covering morphisms of the groupoid $G$. But the point of the first definition is that this easily transcribes to the case $E$ is a topological space, as in Mackenzie's book. A full exposition of covering space theory based on covering morphisms of groupoids, rather than actions, is given in the book now called "Topology and Groupoids", and was in the 1968 edition. John Klein is also right to emphasise the covering space example. This leads to the idea that for the cellular homology of the universal cover of a CW-complex you actually need chain complexes with a groupoid of operators, rather than the usual group of operators. This idea was developed in a paper with Higgins (Proc Camb. Phil. Soc. (1990)) and is explained in the book Nonabelian algebraic topology, see for example Section 8.4. Edit May 19: A simple and basic example of a groupoid acting on spaces generalises the case of a topological group acting on itself by left multiplication. A groupoid $G$ acts on the families of stars $St_G(x), x \in Ob(G)$, where $St_G(x)$ is the union of the sets $G(x,y)$ for all $y \in Ob(G)$, using the convention that if $g: z \to x, h:x \to y$ then $gh: z \to y$. If $G$ is a topological groupoid, then we get an action of $G$ on topological spaces. An example of this is the case the space $X$ admits a universal cover. Then the fundamental groupoid $\pi_1 X$ may be topologised making it a topological groupoid. (R. Brown and G. Danesh-Naruie, ``The fundamental groupoid as a topological groupoid'', Proc. Edinburgh Math. Soc. 19 (1975) 237-244.) The star of $\pi_1 X$ at $x$ is of course the universal cover of $X$ based at $x$. (See also Topology and Groupoids 10.5.8, which deals with the case $(\pi_1 X)/N$ for $N$ a totally disconnected normal subgroupoid of $\pi_1 X$. )

Rather than write out a solution I would like to make some suggestions that I hope would enable you to solve the problem. I am open for further discussion. It seems to me that one of the difficulties you have is the lack of a notation for some of the concepts that are likely to crop in the solution. Thus you have a notation for classes of sections, but not for more general situations. So here is my suggestion, including changing a little the notation in the cited paper. Let $p:D \to A, u: Z \to A$ be maps. Write $[Z,D;u]$ for the set of homotopy classes of maps $f:Z \to D$ such that $pf=u$ and each homotopy projects down to the constant homotopy on $u$. Thus classes of sections are the case $Z=A, u=1_A$. The first result is that if $p$ is a fibration and $\theta: u \simeq v$ is a homotopy then we have a bijection $\theta_{\#}: [Z,D;u] \to [Z,D;v]$ giving an operation of the groupoid of such homotopies on the sets of homotopy classes. Now look at the results in the paper and see if you can see how this operation changes if you replace $p$ by a homotopy equivalent $q: E \to B$. The paper gives a reference 1. which is available in a new edition titled Topology and Groupoids. The dual problem to yours could also be of interest. That will involve retractions. Later: What your question exposes is that the paper cited does not discuss at all is how $[Z,D;u]$ depends on maps $(D \to A) \to (E \to B)$, and homotopies of such. So this is something you could try to write up. July 9, 2015: here is some more information. Consider a diagram as follows: $$ \begin{matrix} && D & \xrightarrow{e} & E & \xrightarrow{d} & D \\ & f \nearrow & \downarrow p & & \downarrow q && \downarrow p\\ Z & \xrightarrow{u} &A & \xrightarrow{b} & B & \xrightarrow{a} & A \end{matrix}$$ We suppose $p,q$ are fibrations and $e,b$ give a fibre homotopy equivalence with homotopy inverse $d,a$. We are considering lifts $f$ of $u$. Note that if $u=1: A \to A$ then $f$ will be a section of $p$. We then get an induced diagram $$ \begin{matrix} [Z,D;u] & \xrightarrow{\alpha} & [Z,E;bu] && \\ & \cong \searrow & \downarrow \rho & \searrow \cong & \\ && [Z,D;abu] & \xrightarrow{\gamma} & [Z,E;babu] \end{matrix} $$ where $\alpha$ is induced by $e,b$ and $\gamma $ is induced by $d,a$. The first slanting arrow comes from the homotopy $u \simeq abu$ and the second from the homotopy $1 \simeq ba$. The diagram is commutative because the homotopies are part of the fibre homotopy equivalence. So $\rho \alpha$ and $\gamma \rho$ are isomorphisms. It is now a standard elementary categorical result that $\alpha, \rho, \gamma$ are isomorphisms. When one examines the last part of the argument, one finds that curious "conjugacies" come in, see the cited paper. As you see, to get the result on sections, i.e. when $u=1: A \to A$ , one has to introduce a more general concept and notation. 

Dan Schechtman, winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of quasi crystals, said: “The main lesson that I have learned over time is that a good scientist is a humble and listening scientist and not one that is sure 100 percent in what he reads in the textbooks.” My research on groupoids and higher groupoids was started in the 1960s by a dissatisfaction with a van Kampen theorem that did not compute the fundamental group of the circle, a basic example: but groupoids were at the time regarded as "rubbish" by many senior mathematicians, and the idea of higher van Kampen theorems using higher groupoids was described by one such for 10 years as "ridiculous". (He gave in eventually!) My worry is that people may be encouraged to follow high ups, rather than to analyse a programme on mathematical grounds, and so to develop their own feeling for mathematical structures. January, 2015: One needs a variety of strategies, one of which is to look at what a theory does not do but somehow in principle should. This is the notion of anomaly. I have listed 5 anomalies in standard algebraic topology in this presentation Dec, 2014, Galway. See also the advice given to me 1964 by S. Ulam, quoted in my web page discussing the issue of famous problems in category theory. Alexander Grothendieck wrote to me that: "Throughout my whole life as a mathematician, the possibility of making explicit, elegant computations has always come out by itself, as a byproduct of a thorough conceptual understanding of what was going on. Thus I never bothered about whether what would come out would be suitable for this or that, but just tried to understand -- and it always turned out that understanding was all that mattered." So I always advocate writing and rewriting to make things clear to yourself, testing that by explaining to other people. At Bangor we explained to research students that a thesis must have a "thesis". So having decided on the latter, the first thing for the student to do is write up the background to that "thesis", which can always be expected to be a useful part of the final thesis. All sorts of things may turn up in that process. 

I am bound to recommend my book Topology and Groupoids, (2006) Ronald Brown, available from amazon.com . An e-version is also available from www.kagi.com for £5. See my web page $URL$ for links to reviews. It takes a geometric approach, and at the same time a categorical view, that is, there is an emphasis on constructing continuous functions. The approach to the fundamental group via groupoids goes a long way beyond a first course, but then the results go beyond other books, for example on the fundamental group(oid) of an orbit spaces, and a gluing theorem on homotopy equivalences. 

For the early history of the function concept, and the confusions, see the delightful book J.E. Littlewood, "A mathematician's miscellany" Methuen, London, 1953. Republished as Littlewood's Miscellany, Edited B. Bollobas, Cambridge University Press, 1986. 

Henry Whitehead told me that the key tools for a mathematician were a pencil and erasor ("rubber" in English). I paid for my thesis to be typed on an old Banda system which meant I could produce multiple copies, even if in a horrid shade of purple. It was widely circulated widely in 1961, so that many people knew then about the function space results on the category of Hausdorff k-spaces. My book "Elements of modern topology" (1968) (now "Topology and Groupoids") was written in pencil, and typed on a machine with two keyboards, with a shift by moving a lever. Also I did not have the facilities to produce great figures, so had to pay from royalties for some to be redrawn, when the publisher's draughtsman did not get it quite right. A great change with Latex is indexing. The method for the above book was to go through the page proofs with index cards, noting the term and page number, then sort them all by hand, and finally get the result typed. In those days one knew that printing mathematics would be expensive, because it was all set by hand in monotype, and so maths books, and journals, would be expensive. Now that the typesetting is all done by authors, guess what happens? Maths books and journals are still expensive, but the publishers do well! It is not clear if they have all got onto the advantages for specialised books, such as maths, of Print-on-Demand, which produces a book at a time from a pdf file, so there is little warehousing cost. I heard of one major publisher who retyped in Latex a whole book from a pdf file which was produced by Latex! Guess what happened! 

Not exactly an autobiography but entertaining and with some autobiographical comments is J.E. Littlewood's "A mathematician's miscellany". 

Here is a topic that he kept me wasting (?) many hours: there is a theorem that every embedding in 3-space of $K_7$ , the complete graph on 7 vertices, contains a knot. Draw such an embedding and find the knot(s)! Every embedding of $K_6$ contains a link, but that is usually much easier to find. If I can find the reference, I'll add that as a comment. 

I prefer to do a more general case, which is useful anyway, and to use fibrations of groupoids. For spaces $X,Y$ define the track groupoid $\pi_1 Y ^X$ to have objects the maps $X \to Y$ and arrows $f \to g$ the homotopy classes rel end maps of homotopies $f \simeq g$, with the usual composition of homotopies. If $i :A \to X$ is a cofibration then $$i^*: \pi_1 Y^X \to \pi_1 Y^A $$ is a fibration of groupoids (give the "obvious definition", but it first appeared in a paper of mine in 1970, J. Algebra, although it is a specialisation of an earlier definition for categories, which has a different purpose). Now for a fibration of groupoids $p: E \to B$ there is an operation of $B$ on the disjoint union of $\pi_0$ of the fibres. Applied to the above case, this gives an operation of $\pi_1 Y^A$ on homotopy classes $X \to Y$ relative to maps $A \to Y$. You can find this in Chapter 7 of my book "Topology and groupoids" (2006), with applications to, for example, a gluing theorem for homotopy equivalences. (and in essence in the first 1968 edition). These ideas were found by thinking about maps $(S^n,x) \to (Y,y)$, and then generalising first replacing $S^n$ by $X$ and then the point $x$ by a subspace $A$ and forgetting $y \in Y$. Sorry to be so long in giving an answer to this but till June, 2011, I was busy with another writing job! 

Degenerate elements are thin. Every horn has a unique thin filler. If every face but one of a thin element is thin, then so also is the remaining face. 

MR0531162 Johnstone, P. T. On a topological topos. Proc. London Math. Soc. (3) 38 (1979), no. 2, 237–271. "The author defines a topos E which has the category of sequential spaces F as a reflective subcategory whose inclusion functor preserves the colimit diagram arising from any open cover, certain colimit diagrams arising from closed covers, and the equalizer diagram giving the quotient space for an equivalence relation which is sequentially closed. The author answers the questions which spring to mind for the topos theorist about E:...." @Todd: The notion of topological space has been around for a long time and we need to consider whether or not it is the "right" concept for various needs. Grothendieck in Section 5 of "Esquisse d'un programme" argues for more elaborate concepts such as stratifications to model geometry. Another question is whether the category of the objects under consideration has "convenient" properties; in some cases this might be the prior consideration. In any case, the use of this "topological topos" in say algebraic topology should be considered. For example, it might be appropriate in the theory of parametrized spectra, and also develop further Peter Booth's notion and applications of fibred exponential laws. 

One of the intuitions of (simplicial) T-complexes is that you can make the simplicial singular complex $SX$ of a space into a natural Kan complex, by making choices of the appropriate retractions in the models. But of course these choices are not unique, and what is unclear is what are the relations among these natural fillers! The idea has something to do with "composition" since in a Kan complex the filler of a horn makes the remaining face in some sense the composition of the other faces; the filler is a "program" for determining this composition. Keith Dakin (1977) then axiomatised the idea that these natural fillers are in some sense "thin". So the axioms are:
