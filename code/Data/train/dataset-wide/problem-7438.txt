Note that $a\precsim b$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $r\in A$ such that $\|a-rbr^*\|\leq\varepsilon$. Assume that $a\precsim b\precsim c$. To show that $a\precsim c$, let $\varepsilon>0$. First, using that $a\precsim b$, choose $r\in A$ such that $\|a-rbr^*\|\leq\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}$. We may assume that $r\neq 0$. Next, using that $b\precsim c$, choose $s\in A$ such that $\|b-scs^*\|\leq \tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}\|r\|^{-2}$. Then $$ \|a-rsc(rs)^*\| \leq \|a-rbr^*\| + \|rbr^*-rsc(rs)^*\| \\ \leq \tfrac{\varepsilon}{2} + \|r(b-scs^*)r^*\| \\ \leq \tfrac{\varepsilon}{2} + \|r\| \|b-scs^*\| \|r^*\| \leq \varepsilon. $$ 

Is every group isomorphic to an inductive colimit (that is, directed colimit, also called inductive limit, or directed limit) of free groups? I guess, the answer is no. In that case: Is there a characterization of the groups that are isomorphic to inductive colimits of free groups? 

This is an expansion of my comments. Grothendieck's conjecture is now a theorem, except perhaps when $S$ is in characteristic $p$ and $\ell=p$. The explanation that follows is presumably what Grothendieck had in mind in his comment regarding the Tate conjecture. First, we make some reductions: We can certainly assume that $S$ is integral. In fact, we can assume that $S$ is normal. This follows from Proposition 1.2 of Grothendieck's article. Finally, we can assume that the generic point $\eta$ of $S$ is the spectrum of a finitely generated field. This can be shown as in 2.2 of Grothendieck's article. In this scenario, by Proposition 2.7 in Chai-Faltings, 'Degeneration of Abelian varieties', the natural restriction map $Hom(A,B)\to Hom(A_{\eta},B_{\eta})$ is a bijection. Suppose now that $\eta$ is the spectrum of a finitely generated field. Then, by the Tate conjecture for homomorphisms of abelian varieties over finitely generated fields (proved by Zarhin in finite characteristic, and Faltings in characteristic $0$), the natural map of $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$-modules: $$Hom(A,B)\otimes\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}\to Hom_G(T_{\ell}(A_{\eta}),T_{\ell}(B_{\eta}))$$ is an isomorphism. Here, on the right hand side, $G$ is the absolute Galois group of the spectrum of $\eta$. In particular, $u_{\ell}$ gives rise to an element of $Hom(A,B)\otimes\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$. Now, suppose that the specialization of $u_{\ell}:T_{\ell}(A)\to T_{\ell}(B)$ over a point $s\in S$ arises from an honest homomorphism $u_s:A_s\to B_s$. Then we find that, for some $n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$, $nu_{\ell}$ arises from a homomorphism $u':A\to B$. Essentially, the map $$Hom(A,B)_{\mathbb{Q}}\to Hom(A_s,B_s)_{\mathbb{Q}}$$ identifies the left hand side with a vector sub-space of the right hand side. In fact, if $S$ is of characteristic $p$, we can take $n$ to be a power of $p$, since the specialization map will have saturated image after inverting $p$. 

Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra is an excellent book for learning group theory, ring theory, and module theory. There's also a section on basic algebraic geometry and homological algebra. 

Abstract and concrete categories: The joy of cats by Jiri Adamek, Horst Herrlich and George Strecker, is a nice book for learning category theory. It went out of print, so the authors made it available online for free. 

I like to talk about planarity of graphs, because it's easy to introduce, easy to draw on a napkin, and on the "application" side of things you can mention computer chip design, transportation networks, and other things. The nonplanarity of $K_{3,3}$ can be introduced via the "three utilities" puzzle: you have three houses and you want to connect each one to each of three utilities (water, hydro, gas) -- can you do it without having the lines cross? Similarly the nonplanarity of $K_5$ can be posed as a puzzle, and Kuratowski's theorem basically asserts that these two examples give the only obstructions to planarity: a graph is planar if and only if it contains no subgraph homeomorphic to $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$. Going further, you can talk about embedding graphs on a torus (i.e. in a game of Asteroids), for which you can draw examples of embeddings of $K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$, and say that there's an analogy of Kuratowski's theorem (by corollary to the Robertson-Seymour theorem): there is a finite list of "forbidden graphs" which are the only obstruction to a graph being embeddable on the torus, in the sense that any nonembeddable graph contains one of those forbidden graphs as a minor. 

To expand on my comment to the question, we have the following algebraic construction (I think originally due to Robert Brown, 'A characterization of spin representations'): Let $V$ be a quadratic space over a field $k$ of characteristic $\neq 2$. Attached to this is the Clifford algebra $C=C(V)$: it is equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-grading $C=C^+\oplus C^-$ and an embedding $V\hookrightarrow C^-$. The general Spin group $GSpin(V)$ consists of units in $C^+$ that preserve $V$ under conjugation. The group $Spin(V)$ is the sub-group of elements that have trivial spinor norm. So, to describe $Spin(V)$ as an automorphism group, it suffices to do so for $GSpin(V)$. Let $H$ be the graded vector space $C$ viewed as a representation of $GSpin(V)$ via left multiplication: it is also a right $C$-module via right multiplication. Then $GSpin(V)$ clearly lies within the group $U(H)$ of $C$-equivariant, grading preserving automorphisms of $H$. Set $E=End(H)$: this is a representation of $GSpin(V)$ via conjugation. Define a bilinear form $\{,\}:E\times E\to k$ by $$\{f,g\}=\frac{1}{2^{dim(V)}}trace(fg).$$ Now choose a basis $\{v_i\}$ for $V$, and let $A=(v_i\cdot v_j)_{i,j}$ be the inner product matrix attached to this basis. Set $(b_{i,j})=B=A^{-1}$. Define an endomorphism $\pi:E\to E$ by the formula: $$\pi(f)(h)=\sum_{i,j}b_{i,j}\{v_i,f\}v_jh.$$ Clearly, the image of $\pi$ is $V\subset E$, where $V$ acts on $H$ via left multiplication. Let $G'\subset U(H)$ be the stabilizer of the endomorphism $\pi$. Then $G'$ preserves $V$ via conjugation, and is therefore contained in $GSpin(V)$. On the other hand, it is not hard to see that $GSpin(V)$ stabilizes $\pi$. So we see that $GSpin(V)$ can be described as the group of $C$-equivariant, grading preserving automorphisms of $H$ that also stabilize $\pi$. 

Since $A(G)$ is closed under passing to complex conjugation, a positive answer to Question 1 would imply a positve answer to Question 2. Additionally, if $f,|f|\in A(G)$, is there a relation between the norms of $f$ and $|f|$ in $A(G)$? 

Let $A$ be a unital C*-algebra. As was already noted in the comments, we have $n(A)=1$ if and only if $A$ has a character. Let $M_n=M_n(\mathbb{C})$. It is easy to see that $n(M_n)\leq n$. Conversely, a linear subspace of $M_n$ of codimension less than $n$ contains an invertible matrix, as shown by Dieudonné, [1], see also [2]. Thus $n(M_n)=n$. If $\pi\colon A\to B$ is a surjective ${}^*$-homomorphism onto another C*-algebra $B$, then $n(A)\leq n(B)$. Indeed, let $B_0$ be a subspace of $B$ of codimension $n(B)$ such that $B^{-1}\cap B_0=\emptyset$. Set $A_0:=\pi^{-1}(B_0)$. Then $A_0$ has codimension $n(B)$ in $A$ and $A^{-1}\cap A_0=\emptyset$. Therefore $n(A)\leq n(B)$. Next, let $X$ be a compact, Hausdorff space and consider $A=C(X,M_n)=C(X)\otimes M_n$. We show $n(A)=n$. First, for every $x\in X$, there is a surjective ${}^*$-homomorphism $\pi_x\colon A\to M_n$ given by evaluating at $x$. It follows $n(A)\leq n$. Let us show that the converse inequality also holds. So assume there exists a subspace $A_0$ of noninvertible functions of codimension $\leq n-1$. Then there are at most $n-1$ points in $X$ such that $\pi_x(A_0)\neq M_n$, say $x_1,\ldots,x_k$. For each $j\in 1,\ldots,k$, since $A_0$ has codimension $\leq n-1$, we have that $\pi_{x_j}(A_0)$ has codimension $\leq n-1$, and so $\pi_{x_j}(A_0)$ contains an invertible matrix. Since the set $\{x_1,\ldots,x_k\}$ is discrete in $X$, we can easily construct an invertible element in $A_0$, a contradiction. One could now ask if $n(A)<\infty$ if and only if $A$ has a (nonzero) finite-dimensional representation (equivalently, a nonzero, finite-dimensional quotient C*-algebra).

This is parallel transport. Note that you only get an explicit formula for the isomorphism between $F_1^*H(\mathbb{T})$ and $F_2^*H(\mathbb{T})$. To get explicit formulas over other thickenings of $\mathbb{T}$, you would need lifts of both $\mathbb{T}$ and also of the Frobenius lifts. For convenience, set $H_1=H(\mathbb{T})$. We will assume that $\mathbb{T}$ has \'etale co-ordinates $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. Since $H_{\mathbb{T}}$ is a crystal over $\mathbb{T}$, there is a flat connection $\nabla:H_1\to H_1\otimes\Omega^1_{\mathbb{T}/W_2(k)}$. Note that, for any $a\in\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{T}}$, $\delta(a)=F_1(a)-F_2(a)$ is in $p\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{T}}$; in particular, $\delta(a)^2=0$. Now, for any $h\in H_1$, the isomorphism sends $F_1^*h$ to $F_2^*h+\sum_{i=1}^n\nabla(\partial_i)(m)\delta(x_i)$. This is just a Taylor expansion up to the first degree. 

We also suppose that the Weil restriction $X'=\text{Res}_{K/F}X_K$ is representable. Let $p:X'_K\to X_K$ be the natural adjunction map. The hypotheses imply (see Lemma above) that both $f$ and $f\circ p$ are defined over $F$. The same proof as in the claim above shows that $p$ is also defined over $F$. This shows that $K=F$. 

As to what cohomology actually measures, I think a general theme is "the failure of locally trivial things to be globally trivial", or perhaps "the failure of local solutions to glue together to form a global solution". In the de Rham cohomology of a smooth manifold, any closed form ω is "locally trivial" in that you can cover the manifold by contractible charts, over each of which a solution to dα=ω exists by the Poincaré lemma. The cohomology class [ω] measures the failure of existence of a global solution of this equation. Similar remarks can be made about simplicial, singular, and (especially) Čech cohomology. 

If the action of $G$ on $X$ is continuous (i.e. the multiplication map $X\times G\to X$ is continuous) then the resulting topology is $\tau$: Let $\tilde X$ denote $(X\times G)/\sim$, and let $\phi:X\to \tilde X:x\mapsto[x,e]$ be the identification you mentioned (with the factors $X,G$ reversed for convenience). Then $\phi$ is clearly continuous. Let $\psi:\tilde X\to X$ be the inverse of $\phi$, i.e. $\psi([x,g]) = xg$. For an open subset $U$ of $X$, $\psi^{-1}(U) = \{(x,g):xg\in U\}$. Pulling this back to $X\times G$ via the projection $X\times G\to\tilde X$ gives exactly the preimage of $U$ under the multiplication map $X\times G\to G$, which is open, and so $\psi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $\tilde X$. So $\phi$ is a homeomorphism. 

Considering $B(X)$ as a subalgebra of $B(X^*)$ in the usual way, we may ask related questions in connection with $F(X)$ and $K(X)$. The principle of local reflexivity implies $\overline{F(X)}^{wk*}=\overline{F(X^*)}^{wk*}$ in $B(X^*)$. However, it is not clear to me if we always have $\overline{K(X)}^{wk*}=\overline{K(X^*)}^{wk*}$ (I guess not). Therefore, we may also ask: 

(1) If $A$ is $1$-complemented in its bidual, then $A$ is an AW*-algebra. Indeed, assume that $A$ is $1$-complemented in its bidual, via a contractive projection $p\colon A^{**}\to A$. By a theorem of Tomiyama, $p$ is a conditional expectation. This implies that $A$ is monotone closed, that is, every upward directed family of self-adjoint elements in $A$ has a supremum. In particular, $A$ is an AW*-algebra. (A C*-algebra is an AW*-algebra if every maximal abelian $*$-subalgebra is monotone complete, see [1].) (2) Every separable AW*-algebra is finite-dimensional. Indeed, assume $A$ is a separable AW*-algebra. Consider a maximal abelian $*$-subalgebra (=masa) $B$ of $A$. Then $B\cong C(X)$ for some compact, Hausdorff, extremally disconnected space $X$ (such spaces are also called Stonean). Every metrizable, extremally disconnected space is discrete. Therefore, $X$ is finite. Thus, every masa in $A$ is finite-dimensional. This implies that $A$ is finite-dimensional. (Every infinite-dimensional C*-algebra contains a positive element with infinite spectrum, and hence an infinite-dimensional masa.) Combining (1) and (2) we obtain that a separable, infinite-dimensional C*-algebra is never $1$-complemented in its bidual. [1] arxiv.org/abs/1501.02434 

Now that I've had the chance to look at Fargues's proof carefully, it seems incomplete for what it claims to prove, but it might answer the question under consideration. Suppose that you have a collection of integers $f_{\iota}$ indexed by embeddings $\iota:K\hookrightarrow\mathbb{C}$ and satisfying for some integer $m$ (this is slightly different from the OP's identity): $$\prod_{\iota}\iota(\epsilon)^{mf_{\iota}}=1,\text{ for all $\epsilon\in\mathcal{O}_K^\times$}.$$ Then I claim that there exists a CM sub-field $L\subset K$ such that $f_{\iota}$ only depends on $\iota\vert_L$ (for the purposes of this statement, totally real fields are CM). The assertion that allows us to reduce this to Dirichlet's unit theorem is the following: It suffices to show that, for all $\sigma\in Aut(\mathbb{C})$, $f_{\sigma\iota}+f_{\sigma\overline{\iota}}$ is independent of $\iota$ and $\sigma$. (EDIT: It was incorrectly stated in the original version that it was enough to require independence from $\iota$ alone). To see this, we reinterpret this condition as follows: After fixing an embedding $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{C}$, we can view the collection $(f_{\iota})$ as an element $f$ of the $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$-module of maps $Hom(K,\bar{\mathbb{Q}})\to\mathbb{Z}$. The Galois action is given by $(\sigma(f))_{\iota}=f_{\sigma^{-1}\iota}$. From this point of view, our claim amounts to: For every complex conjugation $c$ of $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$, $f_{\iota}+f_{c(\iota)}$ is independent of $c$ and $\iota$. In particular, for all $\sigma\in G_{\mathbb{Q}}$, and all complex conjugations $c$, we have: $$ f_{\sigma^{-1}\iota}+f_{c(\sigma^{-1}\iota)}=f_{\iota}+f_{c\iota}. $$ Another way to write this is, for all $\iota$: $$ \sigma(f)_{\iota}+\sigma(c(f))_{\iota}=f_{\iota}+c(f)_{\iota}. $$ So $\sigma$ stabilizes $f$ if and only if it stabilizes $c(f)$, for all complex conjugations $c$. Let $L$ be the fixed field of the stabilizer of $f$ in $G_{\mathbb{Q}}$. We have shown that $L$ is stabilized by all complex conjugations. To show that $L$ is CM we need to now need to know that all complex conjugations have the same action on $L$. This amounts to showing that $f_{c(\iota)}$ does not depend on the choice of $c$. But, since $f_{\iota}+f_{c(\iota)}$ does not depend on $c$ by hypothesis, this is clear. Let us return to the first identity above. Taking the logarithm of its absolute value gives us: $$ \sum_{\iota}f_{\iota}\vert \iota(\epsilon)\vert=0. $$ But consider the map $$ \ell:\mathcal{O}_K^\times\otimes\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\oplus_{v\vert\infty}\mathbb{R}. $$ given by $\ell(\epsilon\otimes 1)_v=\log\vert \epsilon\vert_v$ if $v$ is real and by $\ell(\epsilon\otimes 1)_v=2\log\vert \epsilon\vert_v$ if $v$ is complex. The indexing set here is the set of inequivalent archimedean norms on $K$. Then Dirichlet's unit theorem says that $\ell$ is an isomorphism onto the hyperplane $H$ where the sum of the co-ordinates is identically $0$. This shows that, for all $(b_v)\in H$, $$\sum_{v}\frac{f_{\iota(v)}+f_{\overline{\iota}(v)}}{2}b_v=0.$$ Here, if $v$ is complex, $\iota(v)$ and $\overline{\iota}(v)$ are the two complex embeddings inducing $v$. If $v$ is real, they're the same embedding. If one uses the usual basis of $H$ consisting of differences of the basis vectors for the ambient space, one finds that $f_{\iota}+f_{\overline{\iota}}$ is independent of $\iota$. Applying the same argument to the character $\epsilon\mapsto\prod_{\iota}\sigma^{-1}(\iota(\epsilon))^{f_{\iota}}=\prod_\iota\iota(\epsilon)^{f_{\sigma\iota}}$, one sees that $f_{\sigma\iota}+f_{\sigma\overline{\iota}}$ is independent of $\iota$ as well. (EDIT: The remainder of the proof has been changed to reflect the correction in the criterion above.) Set $w(\sigma)=f_{\sigma\iota}+f_{\sigma\bar{\iota}}$: this doesn't depend on $\iota$. To finish the proof, we must show that it is independent of $\sigma$ as well. First, let $L$ be as above. From what we have proven already, we find that $L$ is stable under all complex conjugations. Assume that $L$ is totally complex; this implies that $K$ is also totally complex. Then, if $n=[K:\mathbb{Q}]$, we have: $$ 2nw(1)=\sum_{\iota}(f_{\iota}+f_{\bar{\iota}})=\sum_{\iota}(f_{\sigma\iota}+f_{\sigma\bar{\iota}})=2nw(\sigma). $$ So, in this case, the independence is clear. To finish, it is enough to show the following: If $L$ has one real place, then $L=\mathbb{Q}$. But the hypothesis implies that there is a complex conjugation $c$ that acts trivially on $L$, and so $2f_{\iota}=f_{\iota}+f_{c(\iota)}$ is independent of $\iota$. In this case, the Hecke character must be the twist of a finite order character by a power of the norm character. 

Originally I had written: "We know that $B(X)$ is always weak*-dense in $B(X^*)$. (In general, this is weaker then being $1$-norming.) Translating back to $\alpha$, this means that $\alpha$ is always injective." However, as pointed out by Bill Johnson below, not even that is the case. So the answer to my question is a big "NO". If $X$ is reflexive, then $\beta$ is surjective, and so $\alpha$ is isometric. (This can also be seen more directly.) If $X$ has the metric approximation property, then already the unit ball of $F(X)$, the finite rank operators on $X$, is weak*-dense in the unit ball of $B(X^*)$. Thus, also in this case, $\alpha$ is isometric. 

The category Mon of commutative monoids has plenty of projective (and even free) objects. Indeed, for every set $X$ one can consider the commutative monoid $\mathbb{N}[X]$, with generators $\delta_x$ for $x\in X$. Then, for every commutative monoid $M$ one can consider the free monoid $P_0:=\mathbb{N}[M]$ together with the canonical surjective homomorphism $\varphi_0\colon P_0\to M$, which sends the (formal) sum $\sum_m c_m \delta_m$ in $P_0$ (with $c_m\in\mathbb{N}$, and all but finitely many $c_m$ zero) to the sum $\sum_m c_m m$ in $M$. One can consider this as the first step in building a projective resolution for $M$. In the category of groups, one would next consider the kernel of $\varphi_0$ and find a free group surjecting onto that kernel. However, the notion of kernel in Mon is more subtle. If one simply considers $L:=\{x\in P_0 : \varphi_0(x)=0\}$, then it is in general not true that $M$ is isomorphic to $P_0 / L$. One needs to consider kernel pairs, which categorically are the pullbacks of the two maps $(\varphi_0,\varphi_0)$. Thus, a "better" definition of kernel for the map $\varphi_0$ is $$ K_0 := \{(x,y)\in P_0\oplus P_0 : \varphi_0(x)=\varphi_1(y) \}, $$ together with the two natural maps $p_0,p_1\colon K_0\to P_0$ satisfying $p_0(x,y)=x$ and $p_1(x,y)=y$. Then, it is true that $M$ is isomorphic to the quotient of $P_0$ by the congruence relation generated by $p_0$ and $p_1$. Categorically, $\varphi_0$ is the co-equalizer of $p_0$ and $p_1$. Next, I can set $P_1:=\mathbb{N}[K_1]$ and consider the natural surjection $\varphi_1\colon P_1\to K_1$. Doing this, I obtain two maps from $P_1$ to $P_0$, namely $p_0\varphi_1$ and $p_1\varphi_1$. Thus, we have obtained the following situation: $$P_1 \rightrightarrows P_0 \to M.$$ What is the next step? I could consider the kernels of the two maps from $P_1$ to $P_0$. This would mean to construct two free monoids with two morphisms each. Thus, at each next level it seems that this (naive) approach doubles the number of arrows. Is this really how it should be done? Has this been considered? Are there better (simpler) notions of projective resolutions for commutative monoids? In either case, the following seems like an interesting question to aks as well:
