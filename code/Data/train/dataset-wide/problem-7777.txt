Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an elliptic surface over $\mathbb{P}^1$ without a section and let $\mathcal{J}$ be an elliptic surface over $\mathbb{P}^1$ with a section. Assume we have the commutative diagram \begin{array}{ccc} \mathcal{X} \times_{\mathbb{P}^1} C & \hspace{-0.2cm} \stackrel{\Large{\varphi}}{\leftarrow - \rightarrow} \hspace{-0.2cm} & \mathcal{J} \times_{\mathbb{P}^1} C \\ pr_{\mathcal{X}} \downarrow & \Box & \downarrow pr_{\mathcal{J}} \\ \mathcal{X} \longrightarrow \hspace{-1.6cm} & \mathbb{P}^1 & \hspace{-1.7cm} \longleftarrow \mathcal{J} \end{array} In this diagram $C$ is a curve over $\mathbb{P}^1$, $\varphi$ is a birational isomorphism over $C$, and $\times_{\mathbb{P}^1}$ is the fiber product over $\mathbb{P}^1$. Is $\mathcal{J}$ the Jacobian of $\mathcal{X}$ in that case? The question arised from the following example. Let $\mathcal{X} = Q_1 \cap Q_2 \subset \mathbb{A}^4$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of even characteristic, where \begin{array}{l} Q_1\!: y^2 + y = t[(x^{\prime^2} + xx^\prime t + x^\prime t^2 + xt^3 + t^4) + (x^\prime + xt + t^2)], \\ Q_2\!: x^\prime = x^2. \end{array} The projection on $t$ is the elliptic fibration, because a general fiber is an nonsingular intersection of two quadrics. I know that $\mathcal{X}$ is rational. I can write the proof if necessary. Consider the conic $C\!: s^2 = t \subset \mathbb{A}^2$. You can check that the surface $\mathcal{X} \times_{\mathbb{P}^1} C$ is birationally isomophic over $C$ to the surface $\mathcal{J}\times_{\mathbb{P}^1}C$ by the rational map $$ \varphi: \mathcal{J}\times_{\mathbb{P}^1} C \to \mathcal{X} \times_{\mathbb{P}^1} C, \qquad x := \frac{x_2 + s}{t^2}, \ y := \frac{y_2}{t^2} + (t^2 + 1 + x^2)s, \ x^\prime := x^2, $$ where $$ \mathcal{J}\!: y_2^2 + t^2y_2 = x_2^3 + t(t^2 + 1)x_2^2 + t(t^5 + t^3 + 1)x_2 + t^2(t^5 + t^3 + t^2 + 1). $$ It is clear that Kodaira-Néron model of this surface is the K3 surface. However in the book Enriques surfaces I by F. R. Cossec and I. V. Dolgachev the proposition 5.6.1.(ii) states that the Jacobian of an rational elliptic surface is again rational. Thus I have the contradiction, because a K3 surface is irrational. What is an error? 

I know the surfaces $X$ and $Y$ are birationally equivalent over $k$ to the Kummer surface of the Jacobian of genus 2 curve $C_b$: $$ y^2 + y = x^5 + x^3 + b, $$ where $b \in \mathbb{F_2}$. This is a motivation of my questions. 

Assume there is $\varphi\!: \mathbb{P}^2 \to X$, a purely inseparable rational dominant map over a finite field $k$, where $X$ is an absolutely irreducible smooth surface over $k$. Is there a regular surjective map $\psi\!: \mathbb{P}^2 \to X$ over $k$? 

What is a canonical divisor $K_Y$ of $Y$? How can I find a $k$-basis of $H^0(Y, -K_Y)$ as functions from variables $x$, $y$, $z$, $t$, $s$? 

Let $E_i\!: y_i^2 = x_i^3 + a_4x_i + a_6$ be two copies ($i = 1$, $2$) of a supersingular elliptic curve over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, for odd prime $p > 3$. Consider the Kummer surface $K = \mathrm{Kum}(A)$ for the superspecial abelian surface $A = E_1\times E_2$. Katsura and Schütt proved in the articles "Generalized Kummer surfaces and their unirationality in characteristic p (1987)" and "Zariski K3 surfaces (2017)" that the surface $K$ is a Zariski surface, i.e., there is a purely inseparable covering $\mathbb{A}^2 \to K$ over $\overline{\mathbb{F}_p}$, where $p \not\equiv 1$ (mod $12$). Is it still true over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ at least for some supersingular elliptic curve and some $p$? A positive answer to this question may have value for cryptography :) If $K$ is a Zariski surface over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, then we have a method to compress a pair $(P_1, P_2) \in A(\mathbb{F}_{p^2})$ by computation of a map from $A$ to the affine plane $\mathbb{A}^2$ (through $K$) of separable degree 2. This is very compact and efficient method, because for decompression we need to solve only one quadratic equation. Computation of a preimage for a purely inseparable map is very fast. People usually take two projections on x-coordinates for $P_1$ and $P_2$ independently, hence they should solve two quadratic equations. The state of the art for this part of cryptography is represented, for example, in the article $URL$ 

If $C_1$ is isomorphic over $k$ to $C_2$ in algebraic geometry sense, then $C_1$ is projectively equivalent over $k$ to $C_2$? How can I find coefficients of the projective equivalence except the brute-force search. 

Consider the Fermat quartic surface $$F\!: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 + t^4 = 0$$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of odd characterstics $p$. Shioda proved that for $p=3$ this surface is a generalized Zariski surface, i.e., there is a purely inseparable covering $F \dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}^2$ (or equivalently $\mathbb{P}^2 \dashrightarrow F$). Is this true for other primes $p$ such that $p \equiv 3 \ (\mathrm{mod} \ 4)$? How can a purely inseparable map be found explicitly? 

Consider an algebraically closed field $k$ of prime characteristic. It is widely known that up to $k$-isomorphism there is a finite number of supersingular elliptic curves over $k$. Let $C$ be a projective reduced irreducible smooth genus 2 curve over $k$. It is called supersingular if the Jacobian $J_C$ is supersingular. Is there a finite number of supersingular genus 2 curves over $k$ up to $k$-isomorphism? 

Let $k$ be a perfect field of even characteristic. Consider the simplest example of a supersingular genus 2 curve, i.e., $$ C\!: y^2 + y = x^5. $$ By the article of J. S. Müller "Explicit Kummer surface formulas for arbitrary characteristics" the Kummer surface of the Jacobian of $C$ is the quartic surface $$ K\!: k_2^2k_4^2 + k_1^3k_4 + k_1^2k_2k_3 + k_1k_2^3 + k_3^4. $$ Let $k_1 := t$, $k_2 := 1$, $k_3 := x$, $k_4 := y$. Then we have $$ K\!: y^2 + t^3y = x^4 +t^2x + t. $$ Associate with $K$ the curve $K_t$ over the function field $k(t)$. What is the geometric genus of this curve? Unfortunately, the classical geometric genus formula for plane curve doesn't work, because $K_t$ has the cusp on the infinity. If $g(K_t) = 0$, then the surface $K$ has the quasi-elliptic $k$-fibration and so $K$ is $k$-unirational. I think the proof is still true for an arbitrary genus 2 supersingular curve over $k$. 

Let $E_1$, $E_2$, $E_3$, $E_4$ be supersingular elliptic curves over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, where $p$ is an odd prime. There is a well known theorem stating that over the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{F}_{p^2}}$ direct products $E_1 \times E_2$ and $E_3 \times E_4$ are isomorphic. Under what conditions are they isomorphic over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$? And how can this isomorphism be explicitly constructed? 

Let $X$ be an absolutely irreducible reduced surface over a finite field $k$ of characteristic $p$. What are sufficient and necessary conditions for $X$ to be a generalized Zariski surface over $k$ (there is a purely inseparable rational dominant map $\varphi\!: \mathbb{P}^2 \dashrightarrow X$ over $k$)? More precisely, I am interested in the case when $X$ is the Kummer surface of an Jacobian $J$, which is also a generalized Zariski surface over the algebraic closure $\overline{k}$ (there is a purely inseparable rational dominant map $\psi\!: \mathbb{P}^2 \dashrightarrow X$ only over $\overline{k}$). 

Let $A$ be a supersingular abelian surface over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. In that case the Neron-Severi group $NS(A\otimes\overline{\mathbb{F}_q})$ is the lattice of rank $6$. Are there methods to compute the induced action of Frobenius map $F_q$ on $NS(A\otimes\overline{\mathbb{F}_q})$? In particular, I am interested in the Jacobian variety $J$, associated with the hyperelliptic curve $C\!: y^2 = x^5 - 1$ over a field $\mathbb{F}_p$, $p \equiv 2, 3$ $(mod$ $5)$. This is the supersingular abelian surface by Choie, Jeong, Lee, Supersingular hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 over finite fields, for example. 

Let $\mathbb{F}_3$ be the Hirzebruch surface (with index $3$) over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\pi\!: \mathbb{F}_3 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be the unique $\mathbb{P}^1$-fibration on $\mathbb{F}_3$. Also, let $S$, $\Sigma$ be sections of $\pi$ with self-intersections $S^2 = 3$, $\Sigma^2 = -3$. At the same time, $F$, $F^\prime$ are two $\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugate fibers of $\pi$. It is well known that $$ T = \mathbb{F}_3 \setminus \big( S \cup \Sigma \cup F \cup F^\prime \big) $$ is a non-split algebraic torus, which is equal to the Weil restriction (of scalars) $\mathbb{Res}_{\mathbb{F}_{q^2}/\mathbb{F}_{q}}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ of the split one-dimensional algebraic torus $\mathbb{G}_m$. Consider a $T$-invariant $\mathbb{F}_q$-divisor $D$ on $\mathbb{F}_3$ (for example, $D = S$) and the algebraic geometry code $C_q\big( \mathbb{F}_3, D, T(\mathbb{F}_q) \big)$, i.e., the image of the map $$ \mathrm{Ev}\!: H^0(\mathbb{F}_3, D) \to \mathbb{F}_q^n,\qquad f \mapsto \big( f(P_1), \cdots\!, f(P_n) \big), $$ where $T(\mathbb{F}_q) = \{P_1, \cdots\!, P_n\}$, $n = q^2-1$. How can I compute minimal distance $d$ of the AG-code $C_q\big( \mathbb{F}_3, D, T(\mathbb{F}_q) \big)$? I remind that $d = \mathrm{min} \ w\big( \mathrm{Ev}(f) \big)$, where the minimum runs over $f \in H^0(\mathbb{F}_3, D) \setminus \{0\}$ and $$w\big( \mathrm{Ev}(f) \big) = |\{i \mid f(P_i) \neq 0\}|.$$ 

Consider the surface $X \subset \mathbb{P}^2_{x, y, z}\times\mathbb{P}^1_{t, s}$: $$ s^3y^2 + t^3yz = (t+s)x^2 + tsxz + t(t^2 +s^2)z^2 $$ over a finite field $k = \mathbb{F}_{2^d}$, $\mathrm{gcd}(d, 6) = 1$. We have the conic bundle $pr\!: X \to \mathbb{P}^1_{t,s}$. The surface $X$ has the unique singular point, which lays on the unique non-reduced fiber $X_0 = pr^{-1}(0:1)$. If we reduce this fiber, then we'll get a surface $Z$ over $k$ with degenerate fibers for $t = 0, w, w^2, \zeta, \zeta^2, \zeta^4$, where $w^2 + w + 1 = 0$ and $\zeta^3 + \zeta + 1 = 0$. It is easily seen that we can simultaneously blow down fibers $Z_{\zeta}$, $Z_{\zeta^2}$ and $Z_{\zeta^4}$ over $k$. We get a surface $Y$ over $k$ with 3 degenerate fibers for $t = 0, w, w^2$. Iskovskikh theorem states that $Y$ is the del Pezzo surface of degree 5. In that case the anticanonical linear system $|\!-\!K_Y|$ gives the embedding of $Y$ to $\mathbb{P^5}$. Questions: 

Consider two copies $E_1$, $E_2$ of the supersingular elliptic curve $$ y^2 = x^3 - 1\qquad (y^2 = x^4 - 1) $$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ of odd characteristics $p$ such that $$p \equiv 2\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 3)\qquad (p \equiv 3\ (\mathrm{mod}\ 4)). $$ In Katsura's article "Generalized Kummer surfaces and their unirationality in characteristic p" on 30 page it is stated that over the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{F}_{p^2}}$ the Kummer surface $K = \mathrm{Kum}(E_1\times E_2)$ is birationally isomorphic to the elliptic surface $$ y^2 = x^3 - t^4(t-1)^4\qquad (y^2 = x^3 - t^3(t-1)^3x). $$ Is this true over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$? How can I see this elliptic fibration on $K$? These particular questions are very important to answer the global one Is there a purely inseparable covering $\mathbb{A}^2 \to K$ of a Kummer surface $K$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$? 

Let $C_1\!: a_1x^2 + b_1y^2 + c_1z^2 + d_1xy + e_1xz + f_1yz$ and $C_2\!: a_2x^2 + b_2y^2 + c_2z^2 + d_2xy + e_2xz + f_2yz$ be nondegenerate projective plane conics over a nonperfect field $k$ of even characteristics. Questions:
