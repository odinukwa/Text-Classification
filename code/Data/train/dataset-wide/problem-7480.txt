I'm not quite certain what Peter May had in mind 40 years ago, but probably he had in mind the fact that pushouts are a lot better behaved in CGWH than in CHG. Specifically, CHWH is closed under pushouts, one leg of which is the inclusion of a closed subspace. CHG does not have such nice behavior, and pushouts like that are used all over The Geometry of Iterated Loop Spaces, specifically in the construction of a monad from an operad and in the use of geometric realizations of simplicial spaces. 

There are differences in conventions and philosophy in different subjects. Mathematically, there are two natural symmetric monodal structures on the monoidal category of graded modules over a commutative ring under the tensor product. In algebraic topology, the natural one is the one with signs. In algebraic geometry it is (usually) the one without signs. There is another related difference. Algebraic geometers allow sums of elements of different degrees and talk of homogeneous elements for contrast. Algebraic topologists generally think of graded modules as sequences of modules and do not allow the addition of elements of different degrees. The symmetry with signs makes little sense when elements are not restricted to be homogeneous. To test whether you are an algebraic geometer or an algebraic topologist, ask yourself whether or not the Laurent series ring $F[x,x^{-1}]$ is a field, where $F$ is a field and $x$ has degree $2$, say (so this has nothing to do with signs). I once taught a joint course with a very fine algebraic geometer (Spencer Bloch no less) and we disagreed about the answer. As to your actual question, signs are unlikely to appear out of the air when passing to associated graded rings. There is no reason why they should. 

There is a very careful analysis of this question in Lemma 3.4.2, page 57, of More Concise Algebraic Topology, by Kate Ponto and myself. Assuming that $E$ and $B$ are connected, a fibration $E\longrightarrow B$ with fiber $K(A,n)$ for an abelian group $A$ is a pullback of of the path space fibration over $K(A,n+1)$ if and only if $\pi_1(B)$ acts trivially on $A$. 

There is a comprehensive set of calculations of the homology of classical groups over finite fields in Z. Fiedorowicz and S. Priddy. Homology of classical groups over finite fields and their associated infinite loop spaces. Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics Volume 674, 1978. I'm a little surprised this has not yet been mentioned, since it seems to give more complete answers than some that are cited above. It is written with a topological slant, following up Quillen's original work that used such homological calculations to determine the K-theory of finite fields, by comparison of Frobenius in algebra with Adams operations in topology. 

There is a joke definition of a Lie algebra, due to my adviser John Moore, that is relevant. His definition of a Lie algebra over a commutative ring $R$ is that it is a module $L$ with a bracket operation such that there exists an associative $R$-algebra $A$ and a monomorphism $L \to A$ of $R$-modules that takes the bracket operation to the commutator in $A$. The point is to try to build in the PBW and dodge the question of which identities characterize Lie algebras. It is equivalent to the usual definition when $R$ is a field, as one sees by proving PBW using only the standard identities, but not so over a general commutative ring. Even over a field (char $\neq 2$ for simplicity) there is an interesting contrast with the definition of a Jordan algebra. There the analogue of the commutator is $1/2 (ab + ba)$. One writes down the identities this satisfies and defines a Jordan algebra to be a vector space that satisfies the identities. But Jordan algebras do not generally embed in associative algebras (those that do are called special). 

Oh, come on! Prop. 17.4, p. 69, of my ancient but still current book ``Simplicial objects in algebraic topology'' proves that the homology groups of the Moore complex of a simplicial group $G$ are the homotopy groups (defined simplicially) of the Kan complex $G$. That G is a Kan complex is Thm 17.1. The homotopy groups of any Kan complex agree with the homotopy groups of its geometric realization (op cit, Thm 16.6). The cited book is still available from the University of Chicago Press (or Amazon of course). 

That is not what one expects from analogy with simpler structures. It would be of interest is to compute the ``box product'' $RV\Box RW$ in terms of the additive description of Mackey functors that Greenlees and I gave. The point is that a Green functor $M$ is specified by a product $M\Box M \to M$. The calculation should not be hard in the simplest cases (cyclic groups of prime order say), and as far as I know has not been done. 

One answer these days is to think of $K$-theory as represented by a commutative ring spectrum (alias $E_{\infty}$-ring spectrum) $K$. Then there is a perfectly good theory of $K$-module spectra, to which we can apply Waldhausen's approach to algebraic $K$-theory to construct the $K$-theory of $K$-theory. This first appeared in EKMM (Elmendorf-Kriz-Mandell-May. Rings, modules, and algebras in stable homotopy theory. AMS 1997) and has been much studied since, for example by Blumberg and Mandell. The localization sequence for the algebraic $K$-theory of topological $K$-theory. 

This is dealt with in the book ``More concise algebraic topology'' by Kate Ponto and myself, and of course elsewhere, I am sure. We used compactly generated spaces (for us, that means weak Hausdorff $k$-spaces). Since all spaces and all based spaces in the Quillen model structure are fibrant, 14.3.9 shows that the three kinds of left homotopies one can define in any model category all give the same notion of homotopic maps. The choices depend on how good you require your cylinder objects to be. In the case of based spaces your elementary sense presumably means via homotopies defined on the cylinders $X\wedge I_+$. Here there is the quibble that the natural map $X\wedge I_+\longrightarrow X$ must be a weak equivalence for $X\wedge I_+$ to be a model theoretic cylinder object. This holds if you take your based spaces to be well-pointed (alias nondegenerately based, alias cofibrant in the Hurewicz model structure). Then 14.3.9 kicks in as before; you do not need to restrict to cofibrant based spaces. The question of using a standard elementary notion of homotopy is axiomatized in 16.4.10 and 16.4.11 of our book (and to the best of my knowledge nowhere else). 

Dylan, I am afraid that you are missing something. It is true that each element of the group gives a map of spectral sequences. But look at the fibers and my comment about isotropy groups above. If you construct the Serre spectral sequence in the usual way, there is a non-equivariantly inconsequential choice of base point in the base space. But that is no longer inconsequential equivariantly. You do not get to collate your actions one element of the group at a time into an algebraically meaningful action of the group on "the" spectral sequence. If you try to express the action of $G$ on the $E_2$ term algebraically, you will see the point. Unfortunately for calculations, the "right" way to think about the question is to switch to Bredon cohomology, say with the constant integer coefficient system. Then there is an equivariant Serre spectral sequence, developed by Moerdijk and Svensson: The equivariant Serre spectral sequence. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 118 (1993), no. 1, 263â€“278. While there has been more recent theoretical work, there have been few serious calculations with it. Edit: Dylan, in answer to your question below, the incorporation of varying fixed point data (as in the base space here) is just the kind of thing Bredon cohomology is designed for. For a simple but serious use of Bredon cohomology to obtain information about ordinary cohomology see "A generalization of Smith theory" (#57 on my web page). For a nice exposition and a worked example of the equivariant Serre spectral sequence, see Megan Shulman's "Equivariant spectral sequences for local coefficients" arXiv:1005.0379
