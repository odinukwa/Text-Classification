Here, Rob Kirby describes some of his experiences as an undergraduate at Chicago, and how he "snuck into graduate school". 

To elaborate on the possible connection with the Riemann hypothesis: One of the parts of the Weil conjectures (which were proved by Deligne, and which also follow from Grothendieck's "standard conjectures") states: 

Here are some random thoughts. If your cones are polyhedral cones, then maybe you can do something like the following: Suppose $M$ is $n$ dimensional. Let $Gr_{n-1}(TM)$ be the Grassmannian bundle over $M$ such that the fiber over $p$ is the Grassmannian of $(n-1)$-planes in $T_p M$. Let $Gr_i$ be the product bundle $Gr_{n-1}(TM)^{i}$. Let $Gr$ be some appropriate colimit of the $Gr_i$'s. For example, you could take the colimit of the maps $Gr_i \to Gr_{i+1}$ given by $(P_1,\dots,P_i) \mapsto (P_1,\dots,P_i,P_i)$. Then define a smooth/continuous/whatever polyhedral-cone-valued-function $f$ to be a smooth/continuous/whatever section $s_f$ of the bundle $Gr$ over $M$. The section $s_f$ assigns to the point $p$ the hyperplanes which form the faces of the polyhedral cone $f(p)$. I guess this works if you have orderings on the faces of the polyhedral cones. If you don't have orderings, you could take symmetric products of the bundles instead of products. 

The following might be helpful: Theorem 8.9 of Toën's $URL$ Theorem 1.2 (as well as Theorem 4.7 and Corollary 4.10) of Ben-Zvi, Nadler, Francis's $URL$ Remark: I don't yet fully understand their proofs, and I don't have any good intuition as to why these types of theorems are true, but the fact that such theorems are indeed true does seem to suggest that the $\infty$-categorical (or dg categorical) point of view is a "correct" point of view. 

Let $\overline{M}_{g,n}(X,\beta)$ be the moduli of stable maps into $X$ of class $\beta \in H_2(X)$. We have the evaluation maps $\operatorname{ev}_i : \overline{M}\_{g,n}(X,\beta) \to X$. Given $\alpha_i \in H^\ast(X)$, the Gromov-Witten invariant corresponding to the tuple $(X,\beta,g,n,\alpha_i)$ is the integral $$\int_{[\overline{M}_{g,n}(X,\beta)]^\text{vir}}\bigwedge_i \operatorname{ev}_i^\ast(\alpha_i).$$ There is also the "forgetful" map (or "stabilization" map) $F : \overline{M}_{g,n}(X,\beta) \to \overline{M}\_{g,n}$. I don't know if this is the standard terminology (is it?), but one can define the Gromov-Witten class corresponding to the tuple $(X,\beta,g,n,\alpha_i)$ to be the (virtual) pushforward $$F_\ast^\text{vir}\left(\bigwedge_i \operatorname{ev}_i^\ast(\alpha_i)\right) \in H^\ast(\overline{M}_{g,n}).$$ 

Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch is a special case of Atiyah-Singer. On the RHS you have the Euler characteristic of a holomorphic vector bundle, and on the LHS you have an integral of some characteristic classes, which are topological invariants. The RHS is an analytic index, the LHS is a topological index. The reason why the Euler characteristic is equal to the analytic index is basically because of Dolbeault cohomology, i.e. you can compute sheaf cohomology using $\overline{\partial}$. Edit: I'm not sure what kind of answer you're looking for. RR says that two numbers, which are defined purely algebraically, are equal. We are interested in computing these numbers, especially the LHS number, the Euler characteristic. On the other hand, these numbers also happen to be equal to analytic and topological indexes of an elliptic operator. So we can equivalently say that we are interested in computing these indexes, especially the analytic index. 

I would guess that the terminology goes back to the work of Sullivan and Quillen on rational homotopy theory. You should probably also look at the paper of Deligne-Griffiths-Morgan-Sullivan on the real homotopy theory of Kähler manifolds. Actually, I think that at least some familiarity with the DGMS paper is an important prerequisite for understanding many of Kontsevich's papers. I am not totally sure, but I believe that the definitions are as follows: 

This is claimed on page 309 of the book "Geometry of Algebraic Curves" by Arbarello-Cornalba-Grifiths-Harris, for $n \geq 2g-1$ (so that $E_n$ is a vector bundle, by Riemann-Roch; for smaller $n$ it isn't necessarily a vector bundle and they don't address this case). Their proof is pretty sketchy. It basically just says that, since the fibers of $\mathbb{P}(E_n) \to J(C)$ correspond to effective degree $n$ divisors, it follows that $C^{(n)} \cong \mathbb{P}(E_n)$. But this seems to me to only prove a set theoretic bijection between the two. So, how do I prove that I actually have an isomorphism of varieties? Or, is there a(nother) reference? I believe the claim should still be true for $n < 2g-1$. Again, how do I prove this? Is there a reference? The sheaf $E_n$ will no longer be locally free, so $\mathbb{P}(E_n)$ will no longer be a bundle of projective spaces, but one should still be able to take the projectivization of a sheaf... On page 7 of the paper $URL$ by Moonen and Polishchuk, they talk about the families version of this statement. To be precise, they consider a family $\pi: C \to S$ of curves, and everything is done relative to the base $S$ (take relative symmetric product, take relative Jacobian, and so on). In this case, we must have a section $s: S \to C$ of $\pi$, corresponding to picking a point in each fiber, in order for the map $C^{(n-1)} \hookrightarrow C^{(n)}$ and the divisor $D$ to make sense. Anyway, Moonen and Polishchuk claim that in this families situation, $\mathbb{P}(E_n)$ is still isomorphic to the symmetric product $C^{(n)}$, and that under this isomorphism the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(1)$ corresponds to the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(D + n\psi)$, where $\psi$ is given by $\psi = \pi^\ast s^\ast K$, where $K$ is the relative canonical class of $\pi$. But how do I prove these statements? 

I can compute the $S_n$-equivariant index of $E$ to get an element $V \in K_{S_n}(\text{pt})$. Then I can take the dimension of the $S_n$-invariant part $V^{S_n}$ to get a number. I can compute the ordinary index of $\tilde{E}$ over $C^{(n)}$, which is a number. 

Given a representation $V$ of a group $G$, we can think of $V$ as a vector bundle over the classifying stack $BG$, and we can define its index $\chi(BG; V)$ to be the dimension of the $G$-invariant part $V^G$ of the representation. Now let $G = GL(1)$ (or $\mathbb{G}_m$ or $\mathbb{C}^\ast$ if you like). Then let $\phi_n : \mathbb{P}^n \to BG$ be the map corresponding to the bundle $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (or maybe we should take map corresponding to the bundle $\mathcal{O}(-1)$, I always mix it up). Let $V$ be a representation of $G$. Then we can compute the index (i.e. sheaf cohomology Euler characteristic) of $\phi_n^\ast V$ over $\mathbb{P}^n$. We can show, just by doing the calculation, that for sufficiently large $n$ (how large depends on the representation $V$), this index is a polynomial in $n$. Then, plugging in $n=-1$ into this polynomial, one can show that the result is equal to $\chi(BG; V)$, defined as above. So, in this fashion, we can recover the index over the stack $BGL(1)$ if we know the index over each $\mathbb{P}^n$ (for sufficiently large $n$). This result seems to make sense, because at least in topology we have $B\mathbb{C}^\ast \simeq \mathbb{CP}^\infty$, and at least intuitively we can think of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ as "approximating" $\mathbb{CP}^\infty$. But so far I don't really have a satisfactory explanation for this, other than "it follows by doing the computation" and "it seems to make intuitive sense" as I've explained above. I wonder if there is a better way to see this; does it follow by some deeper facts?; does it follow by some more general theorems? I'm sorry that my question is not very precise. I would also be interested in any other theorems or results which relate finite dimensional projective spaces with $BGL(1)$. (There are already a few such results in the link in S. Carnahan's comment below.) 

In (for example) Semisimple Frobenius structures at higher genus (section 1.2) and Gromov-Witten invariants and quantization of quadratic Hamiltonians (section 6.8), Givental gives a conjectural formula for the higher genus Gromov-Witten potentials in terms of data coming from the Frobenius manifold of quantum cohomology, assuming that the quantum cohomology is (generically) semisimple. (The formula was proven to be correct by Teleman.) Givental does not give much explanation as to how or where he obtained these mysterious formulas. Can anybody here give some explanation or background? Another question, more general, that I have is: Where does the quantized quadratic Hamiltonians formalism come from? How does it naturally arise? Presently (and still now, several months later after first asking this question...) everything just seems to me like a bunch of magical formulas that are pulled out a hat. I'd like to have this magic explained... 

In the context of Kaehler geometry, we have the Kodaira embedding theorem. If you google "Kodaira embedding" you can get lots of good references. See also Huybrechts and Griffiths-Harris. 

I understand the heuristic reason why Gromov-Witten invariants can be rational; roughly it's because we're doing curve counts in some stacky sense, so each curve $C$ contributes $1/|\text{Aut}(C)|$ to the count rather than $1$. However, I don't understand why or how Gromov-Witten invariants can be negative. What is the meaning of a negative GW invariant? What are some simple examples? 

Let $f : X \to Y$ be a [fill in the blank] morphism of [fill in the blank] complex varieties. Then we have the pushforward $f_! : K(X) \to K(Y)$ which is defined by $f_!(E) = \sum_i (-1)^i [R^i f_\ast E]$, the alternating sum of the higher direct images. Here we take $K(X)$ to mean the $K$-group of coherent sheaves. On the other hand we can also define $K(X)$ as the $K$-group of $C^\infty$ complex vector bundles on $X$ considered as a real manifold. Then we can define a Gysin map $f_!$ using the Thom isomorphism theorem for $K$-theory. 

I'm not sure if this is the kind of answer you're looking for but... There is a very useful and simple lemma on sheaves which is (I think) never explicitly stated in Hartshorne. It is Proposition I-12 of Eisenbud-Harris. I think you should definitely make sure to explicitly state this. Sheafification was very scary and mysterious to me until I learned this lemma. 

The Kodaira embedding theorem states that a compact complex manifold is projective -- and thus algebraic by Chow's theorem -- if and only if it has a Kaehler structure with integral Kaehler class. Kaehler manifolds are symplectic, and integral Kaehler class means that the cohomology class of the corresponding symplectic form $\omega$ lives in the second cohomology with $\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients. Note that the Kaehler class of a Kaehler manifold must be nonzero, because the symplectic volume $\int_X \omega^{n}$ must be nonzero. So maybe one way to find compact things that are non-Kaehler and non-projective is to look for things with zero second cohomology, because then they wouldn't even be symplectic. Perhaps there are examples of compact toric varieties that satisfy this? 

There is a draft of a book on deformation theory by Kontsevich-Soibelman. It's available here. There are also these notes from an old course on deformation theory that Kontsevich taught back when he was at Berkeley in 1994. This is all very much in a similar vein to the references that Mariano has cited. This material is a bit more "modern" and is not quite the same as deformation theory in algebraic geometry, though they do share many characteristics. For deformation theory in algebraic geometry, try taking a look at "Moduli of Curves" by Harris-Morrison, "Deformations of Algebraic Schemes" by Sernesi, or these notes of Hartshorne. One motivation to look at deformations comes from physics, see for example Kontsevich's famous paper on deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds. Another motivation, as I already mentioned, is moduli theory. Even if you are just interested in blahs and not deformations/families/moduli of blahs, it can still be useful to study deformations/families/moduli of blahs. For example, suppose we are interested in some object X. If X has a moduli space of deformations, then we can study how X changes, or how some property of X changes, as we move around in the moduli space. This can then be taken as an invariant of X itself. If X is a smooth projective variety and the property we are looking at is the Hodge structure of X, then this leads to a beautiful theory of variation of Hodge structure, which was developed by Griffiths and others. Finally, deformations themselves can be interesting in their own right: they sometimes have very rich and complex mathematical structures (leading to, for example, applications to knot theory in the case of quantum groups) that we would not see if we just looked at non-deformed objects. This is probably not "obvious" at all, but that's probably largely why it's so awesome. 

Edit 1: I probably should have mentioned this when I first posted this (almost 3 months ago now!), but somehow I forgot. Kontsevich has been at least implicitly talking about deformations of categories since at least 1994, in the original paper introducing homological mirror symmetry. The idea (or "philosophy") seems to be that the deformation theory of a category should have something to do with its Hochschild (co)homology. But I still do not understand this connection, at least in any sort of generality. Perhaps this is explained in some of the papers already listed in the answers below --- what I'd most like to see is how to relate "deformation of a (linear/dg/A-infinity) category", however one defines it, to Hochschild (co)homology. Perhaps it's somehow obvious... but I'm pretty dense and would like to see it spelled out... So I hope someone can explain this to me, or point me to a spot in a paper where it is explained. I'm adding a bounty to this question just for the heck of it. Edit 2: See my answer below. 

Is this correct? Is there a reference? Hitchin's original paper (titled "Self duality equations on a Riemann surface") does some confusing maneuvers; for example he considers solutions of the self-duality equations for $SO(3)$ rather than for $U(2)$ or $SU(2)$, which would seem more natural to me. Moreover, for instance, he doesn't look at all stable Higgs bundles, but only a certain subset of them - but I think this is just for the purpose of getting a smooth moduli space. And finally, Hitchin looks at $PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$ representations of $\pi_1$ rather than $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ representations or $GL(2,\mathbb{C})$ representations, which confuses me as well... Thanks in advance for any help!! EDIT: Please note that I am only interested in the case of a Riemann surface. Here it appears that degree zero stable Higgs bundles correspond to $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ representations. But the question remains: are stable Higgs bundles of arbitrary degree related to representations? If so, which representations, and how are they related? Moreover, I think that general stable Higgs bundles should correspond to solutions of the self-duality equations -- but what's the correct group to take? ("Gauge group"? Is that the correct terminology?) I think it's $U(n)$ but I am not sure. For example, in Hitchin's paper, he considers the case of rank 2 stable Higgs bundles of odd degree and fixed determinant line bundle, with trace-zero Higgs field (see Theorem 5.7 and Theorem 5.8). As for the self-duality equations, he uses the group $SU(2)/\pm 1$. We get a smooth moduli space. In the discussion following Theorem 9.19, it is shown that this moduli space is a covering of the space of $PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$ representations. It seems that this should generalize... 

Sometimes people say that the Fukaya category is "not yet defined" in general. What is meant by such a statement? (If it simplifies things, let's just stick with Fukaya categories of compact symplectic manifolds, not Fukaya-Seidel categories or wrapped Fukaya categories or whatever else might be out there) What should a "correct" definition of the Fukaya category satisfy? (--- aside from, perhaps, "it makes homological mirror symmetry true") What are some of the things which make defining the Fukaya category difficult? What are some cases in which we "know" that we have the "correct" Fukaya category? 

The first place that one sees that torsion is deep is in the homotopy groups of spheres, which, mod torsion, are described completely by a theorem of Serre. However the torsion part of the homotopy groups of spheres is very complicated. If we work rationally, that is, if we forget about torsion, then lots of cohomology theories tend to be the same. (There's a general theorem of this sort, but I've forgotten the precise statement.) For example, singular cohomology and K-theory are isomorphic, rationally, via Chern character.
