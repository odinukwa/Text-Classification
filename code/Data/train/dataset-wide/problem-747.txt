We can see that this rough estimate has good agreement with the magnitude of Iridium flares, caused by reflective antennas 1â€“2 meters in size. Assuming again that the reflector is close to flat, the width of the reflected beam will be around 30-40 arcminutes. The diameter of the beam at the surface will be about one percent of the reflector's altitude (from a 4 km spot in low orbit to a 350 km spot in geosynchronous orbit). However, we need to maximize not the peak magnitude, but the average magnitude. This is affected both by visibility of the spacecraft from the ground and shadowing of the spacecraft by the Earth. I performed some simulations to determine the optimal altitude. I took into account four factors: 

Right now you're probably thinking things like: shouldn't we try our best to preserve this piece of antique instead of exploding it, and: Nice! pointing bombs at visitors while sight-seeing... Let me explain: The magi want the staff intact. They cannot remove the staff without triggering the explosives, and like any decent booby-trap, the system is tamper-proof: any attempt to deactivate or destroy the explosives before the timelock expires will detonate them immediately. If they know about the system, they will not attempt to remove the staff. Thus, the system will never be activated, the staff will not be destroyed, and the public will never be in danger. And if the magi are really comparable to "MI6 high on mojo", then you can bet they'll have done their research and know about the system. 

Surprisingly, the simulations indicate that you want the reflector to be in as low an orbit as possible. The decrease in brightness with altitude dominates the increased visibility. However, our orbit can't be too low, since with a large, lightweight structure drag becomes an issue. Let's spec a 1000 kilometer orbit. At this altitude, even a 100-meter reflector would drop by only about ten kilometers per year. The inclination should be a little higher than the latitude of the northernmost (or southernmost) location you want it to be visible from. The reflector will cast a spot about ten kilometers wide on the Earth's surface. At 1000 kilometers, we could make the spacecraft as bright as the full moon with a 20-meter reflector. This size is easily within the realm of plausibility; JWST's sunshield is close to this size at 18 meters long. 

You might try a sun-synchronous orbit. Because the Earth is not a perfect sphere, satellites' orbits move over time. By cleverly designing the orbit, you can get the plane of the orbit to rotate once a year, so that the orbit is always in the same alignment with respect to the Sun. Earth-observing satellites love to use this type of orbit. They can pass over the day side of the planet close to local noon on every orbit (and local midnight on the night side). However, turn this orbit 90 degrees, and you have a terminator-riding orbit. That is, the orbit always passes over the the line separating the sunlit side of Earth from the night side. Such an orbit would have an inclination of 23.4 degrees, and an altitude of around 3100 km. It would still be affected by eclipses though. Note that geostationary satellites also enjoy constant sunlight. Since they are so far away from the Earth, their 23.4 degree inclination from the ecliptic takes them far above and below the Earth's shadow (except around the equinoxes, when their orbit crosses the ecliptic right behind the Earth). 

A self-supported cable of constant density forms a curve known as a catenary, which is close to a parabola. (In fact a parabola is formed when the weight is distributed evenly horizontally like a suspension bridge, instead of evenly along the cable.) I won't go into all the mechanics, but there are two important equations we need. First, the shape of the caternary is described by: $$ y=a\left[\cosh\left(\frac x a\right)-1\right] $$ Where $a$ is some characteristic length. We can describe the tension $T$ in the cable as: $$ T=\lambda ga\cosh\left(\frac x a\right)=\lambda g(y+a) $$ Where $\lambda$ is the cable's mass per unit length, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. All we need to know is how wide the span is and how much the cable sags. In the best-case scenario, the cable will be allowed to sag all the way to the bottom of the canyon; we can use this as a lower bound on the required material strength. Assuming that $y=800~\text{m}$ and $x=2.5~\text{km}$ (and implicitly $g=9.8~\text{m}/\text{s}^2$), we get: $$ a = 4.03~\text{km} \\ \frac T \lambda = 47\,400~\text{m}^2/\text{s}^2=47.4~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}/\text{kg} $$ The ratio $T/\lambda$ is the required specific strength of our bridge material (I'll use the symbol $\varsigma$ to denote it). At first this looks pretty good, since steel has a strength of around $250~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}/\text{kg}$. However, this doesn't account for the whole bridge, only the cables. We can figure out the payload fraction $\zeta$ (the fraction of the weight of our bridge that is not cable) with this formula: $$ \zeta = 1-\text{SF}\times\frac{\varsigma_\text{requirement}}{\varsigma_\text{material}} $$ Note $\text{SF}$, the safety factor. It ensures that we have some margin, so we don't fall apart at the slightest touch. Based on some quick research, typical actual safety factors for bridges are around 4, but I'll use a design SF of 5. The maximum payload fraction for steel cables over this canyon is therefore $$ \zeta = 1-5\times\frac{47~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}/\text{kg}}{250~\text{kN}\cdot\text{m}/\text{kg}}=6.3\% $$ This means that pretty much all of the weight of the bridge will have to be dedicated to the supporting cable(s). Plotting the shape of the bridge reveals another problem: the slope at the ends is pretty steep. 

Note that, in this picture, we're looking at the nadir (Earth-facing side) of the ISS (you can tell from the Leonardo module sticking out the bottom) and that the sunlight is coming from the top of the screen (see the shadow of the Orbiter's wing on the starboard solar array). This means that the scene is partially lit by earthshine; in particular the underside of the radiators is completely lit by reflected sunlight. No patterns are visible. Why? The pattern of light you're looking for is a type of caustic. Caustics are caused when reflection or refraction off of a curved surface causes light to be concentrated at some points and diffused at others. You can think of each wave in the surface of the water as a poor approximation to a lens, focusing the light that it refracts or reflects. The kicker is that the approximate focus point is relatively close to the surface. Take a look at this computer rendering: 

Realistically, the windows would probably not be slid open in an emergency. The aerospace industry tries to avoid mechanisms as much as possible, since they not only increase weight but are prone to failure. I would assume that the windows would either be installed with pyrotechnic fasteners or with plastic explosive embedded in the window itself, like some aircraft canopies. In that case your characters would die: there's no easy way to close a window that's now travelling away from you at several hundred meters per second. Unless... ...You give your characters oxygen masks. Likely mandated to be next to the panel that activates the emergency decompression sequence, they would be held tightly to the nose and mouth and emit a large flow of pure oxygen. Even one or two psi might be sufficient for a few extra seconds of consciousness, enough to make your way to an open airlock. Picture the scene: your heros are crouching behind the bar, looking around for anything that might help them. One notices a stray shot has blown open a panel marked, "EMERGENCY FIRE SUPPRESSION," with three small gas cylinders inside. She jumps up and grabs one, tossing the other two to her compatriots. The stormtroopers realize what's about to happen and stop shooting as they look around for the second emergency panel, but it's too late: pressing the mask tightly against her face, our heroine pulls the lever. The sound of the explosive bolts is overwhelmed by the rush of air shooting out the window, the black of space briefly turning white as a flash of condensation escapes. The stormtroopers are thrown to the floor silently, as our heroes struggle to the door, the dark tunnel of anoxia closing in on their vision. Thirty seconds later, they wake up coughing and sputtering in the airlock between this compartment and the next. (One-liner, rimshot, explosions) 

Curiosity Spotted on Parachute by Orbiter, www.nasa.gov The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a US-owned and operated satellite currently orbiting Mars. It carries a 50-centimeter telescope called HiRISE. MRO's 250-by-316-kilometer sun-synchronous polar orbit gives HiRISE a resolution of about 0.3 meters across nearly the entire surface of Mars. Just to demonstrate HiRISE's resolving power, the above image (taken by HiRISE) shows the Curiosity rover descending on its parachute. HiRISE is even capable of resolving details on the rover itself: 

Video Games I think this one wins with $2~\text{m}^3$ per player (for console games, $3~\text{m}^3$ for PC games). The only requirement this falls afoul of is "physical and healthy" (or possibly "no virtual reality"). However, on a space station with extremely limited space, people would probably use dedicated excercise equipment. "Fun to play and watch" is a matter of opinion; some people find gaming more exciting than any physical sport. 

Curved Tunnels It turns out that a longer path can actually be faster than the straight-line path. The fastest possible path in a uniformly dense Earth is a hypocycloid. We can define this path parametrically as follows: $$ x = (R-r)\cos\theta + r\cos\left(\frac{r-R}{r}\theta\right) \\ y = (R-r)\sin\theta + r\sin\left(\frac{r-R}{r}\theta\right) $$ $R$ is the radius of the planet, and $r$ is the 'radius' of a single loop of the cycloid. $\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\pi r/R$ over a single loop. For example, the case $R=1,\ r=0.1$ looks like this:
