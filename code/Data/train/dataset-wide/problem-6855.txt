"Who moves first" can be conveniently detached from any causal inference, since there may be some third variable influencing both. Certainly one could build a logical and reasonable argument that links increases in investment to increases in GDP (or vice versa), but it is not necessary. Then, examining cross-correlation coefficients on the levels or on an appropriate transformation (like first differences, or first log-differences) is a simple and valid way to examine the issue, as long as the chosen transformation will provide stationary series. Specifically, one can examine (sample) ${\rm Corr} (X_t, Y_{t})$, ${\rm Corr} (X_t, Y_{t-k})$ and ${\rm Corr} (X_{t}, Y_{t+k})$, where, again, $X$ and $Y$ can represent the chosen transformation and not necessarily the levels of the variables. Also, what calendar time length will $t$ represent should also be decided according to the phenomenon under study. In turn, the distance represented by $k$ is a matter of experimentation, but it is advisable to start with $k=1$. If there is a temporal order, then the contemporaneous cross-correlation ${\rm Corr} (X_t, Y_{t})$ should be negligible. Then, the magnitude and sign of the other two cross-correlations should provide statistical evidence as to "who moves first". 

A standard example would be firms like Tupperware, which employed a variant of the direct marketing model (at least historically). In this business model, Sales depend on "salesperson networking" and little else: the vintage method is for the salesperson to organize get-togethers with possible customers in houses, where the salesperson exhibits the firm's products and obtains orders. There is no advertisement -even, there are no stores. 

...and I would say he is right. This leads us to the more broader characterization, that the natural rate of interest is compatible with output being at its natural level also. Now, re-arrange and use the Fisher equation to get the interest rate gap, $$E_t(x_{t+1}) - x_t = \frac{1}{\sigma}(r_t-r^n_{t})$$ with $x_t = y_t - y^n_t$. Given the discussion above, if the actual real interest rate $r_t$ is equal to $r^n_t$ (so zero interest rate gap), we also have $x_t = 0$ and so also $E_t(x_{t+1})=0$ Assume that the interest rate gap is negative, $r_t < r^n_t$. Then the output gap is expected to be smaller next period. Etc. Such is the analysis that makes sense here, rather than considering "stand alone" changes in the natural interest rate (because such changes are never "stand-alone", since the natural level is not a decision variable of any economic agent).

As @Foobar notes in a comment, technically speaking this appears to have to do with the rate of increase of efficiency in resource use compared to the rate of decrease of resources available. But one could argue that, efficiency in resource use has its limits, and the constraint will eventually set in. In such a technological unemployment scenario (which I don't believe anyone can really put a reliable time-line on), there is one resource that won't decrease but rather increase in availability: labor. So, and if nothing truly life-changing happens (like devastation of human population, massive colonizations of other planets, or the equivalent of Amalthea's Horn of Plenty), production will tend to utilize this available resource (which we should expect to command a relatively lower reward being in high supply). Meaning, a tendency for production to grow in sectors where services delivered by humans remain central, by their nature (or by the prevailing consumer preferences). Servants, personal assistants, waiters, nurses, sex workers, trainers, teachers, baby sitters, security guards, body guards, arts and sports entertainers... even if only as a relative "luxury", rather than strictly needed in the amounts employed. And we may even see innovative ways of using labor (i.e. once more creating new sectors) -but I leave that to anyone's imagination... Of course this labor should get paid something for its services, so those employing it should have the income/wealth needed to pay this something... which indirectly brings in the issue of wealth and income inequality, and whether it plays (or not) a part in all these. 

(I cannot say if my answer will respond to your questions, which indeed, are a bit unclear). If one browses through many-many economic papers, one will get the impression that "representative" just means identical. Indeed in large chunks of literature this is the case, for historical reasons. The drive behind the adoption of the "representative consumer" modelling framework came from the Lucas critique on the previous-generation macro-models, and the requirement that macroeconomic models are "micro-founded". But true theoretical aggregation (with heterogeneity present) requires some skill and knowledge and the bulk of the discipline appeared to have quickly settled for the "representative means identical" framework. The problem is that in such a case, you don't really have a macro-model, just a blown-up version of a micro-model (note: here the words micro/macro are not to be mapped to the partial/general equilibrium concepts). There is nothing to "aggregate" here: the whole point of aggregation is to see whether the behavior of the collective differs from the behavior of the individual. And in the "representative means identical" approach, no such thing can happen, by construction: Instead of micro-founded macro-models, we ended up having blown-up micro-models posing as macro-ones (this is not opinion, I am just describing). There are some models where the term "representative" obtains some intuition -especially in models with more than one classes of agents (say, labor owners and capital owners). Here we model two agents, and each is "representative" of its class. In-class are all identical, but here it sounds more appropriate to call the two individuals "representative". The funny thing is, the concept "representative consumer" (RC) does have a special meaning: the representative consumer represents all consumers as regards basic structure, not measurement or quantities. E.g. "all individual maximize utility from consumption ("same structure"), but their utility parameters may differ("different measure"). All consumers have wealth, but the level of wealth may differ. Etc. RC is still a modelling abstraction, but it does leave room for heterogeneity. A good source on the matter is Caselli, F., & Ventura, J. (2000). A representative consumer theory of distribution. American Economic Review, 909-926. Apart from their focus on developing a theory of distribution in the context of an RC model, they make a good job in presenting what can be done in an RC framework and what not. An excerpt: 

The question should be: Does there appear to be enough heteroskedasticity so that not taking it into account would lower the quality of inference? And this is because "taking heteroskedasticity into account" (even if only for robust standard errors) is not without costs -with small sample sizes it may worsen the reliability of results. And it becomes even riskier if you want to implement the more traditional approach where you will specify a functional relationship between the error variances and the regressors. From the graph, my initial conjecture would be "no, not enough". But peform an "influential observations" analysis, since you obvioulsy have a few large residuals. Also, with today's software, it is cheap to estimate a heteroskedasiticity robust variance covariance matrix, and see whether standard errors differ visibly or not, whether they reverse statistical sigificance tests or not, etc. 

As @FooBar mentions in a comment, with "Income" we want to measure what we produce (production being the whole targetfocus of economic activity, with consumption being the ultimate purpose). Measuring Income as 

"Some form of debt write-off" means usually, mutually agreed (between creditor and debtor) elimination of a portion or the whole of debt. "Partial default": I had the contractual obligation to pay EUR $100$ on Monday, but I paid only EUR $80$. Technically speaking, this is not always (or immediately) considered a "default", but a "credit incident" (alternatively it is characterized as "default on a payment" and not "default on the loan"). Then the reason why I haven't paid the remaining EUR $20$ is crucial: Do I recognize my obligation but I am unable to fulfill it because of financial inability? Or do I deny my obligation, questioning the validity of the underlying contract of the debt from which the obligation to pay the remaining EUR $20$ came? In the first case, the issue is whether this financial inability is deemed as "temporary" or "permanent". If it is deemed "permanent" (usually by a court decision), then in some countries the debt is officially written off by necessity, while in other countries the creditors retain the right to seek payment whenever the debtor acquires assets in the future (so the creditors may be monitoring you). If it is deemed "temporary", then the issue is to make an attempt to restructure the debt. For Public Debt, the inability is never officially considered "permanent" so the issue is always to restructure (which of course may include a mutually agreed partial write-off, which essentially means a recognition that there exists a "partial" permanent inability to pay). We could call the second case, where we question/deny the validity of our obligation, a "unilateral debt write-off", which of course is rarely if ever accepted by the creditors, and so whether it should be called a "write-off" is questionable in turn. 

The specific table appears to be part of the obligatory disclosures under applicable Accounting Standards, so that users of the company's financial statement have information of future obligations/claims the company may have based on existing long-term contracts. This is why it refers to future years. Moreover, it is not an estimate or a projection, but it is based solely on existing contracts. This is why contractually guaranteed rent in total gets lower as we move into the future: some of the franchisee contracts expire earlier than others. The fact that there is a probability that they will be renewed-extended, is not taken into account. 

The problematic part of the statement, is the "because of other reasons not important here" part . In other words: "ignore general equilibrium" -which is an unacceptable statement to make when discussing government policy and actions. Consider the naive quantity theory of money: $$PQ = VM \tag{1}$$ $P$ is the price level, $Q$ is output produced (measured in quantity), $M$ is money supply, and $V$ is "velocity of money", an indicator of the "transactions technology" in the economy, how fast money circulates around to settle transactions. Assume now that we are talking for a "small" country that needs to import basic factors of production like raw materials or energy. "Small" here means "with no market power". Such a country is a price-taker in the international market. More over, substitution possibilities for these factors are usually small to non-existent. Competitive markets or not, the economy's output will be distributed to factors of production and for our purposes, it doesn't matter whether there will be "capital rents" and "profits", or only capital rents. Use for convenience three factors of production and write $$PQ = rK + wL + p_fE \tag {2}$$ where $r$ and $w$ are nominal, and $p_fE$ is the nominal cost of imported factors. Denote $s_f$ the foreign exchange rate (units of local currency per one unit of foreign currency), $c_f$ the price of the imported factors in foreign currency, so $p_f = c_fs_f$. Use this and substitute $(2)$ in $(1)$ $$rK + wL +c_fs_fE= VM \tag{3}$$ If something happens to the international market and $c_f$ goes up to $c_f' > c_f$, this will tend to increase the left hand side. This "something" in the international production factors market does not relate to the level of domestic output $Q$, or to domestic money transactions technology, $V$. More over, at least in the short run, factor substitutions will not happen, wages do not move that easily, and firms will maintain their output level while increasing selling prices, to cover the increased production costs. And since the reasons for the increase affect more-or less the whole economy, it is not that likely that competition will stop firms from doing so: they all want to cover their increased costs, they all know that the cost-rise is general and comes from abroad, so they don't need to actually collude in order to sustain a price increase. "Common knowledge" suffices. So in order to preserve the equality in $(3)$ it appears that we must have $$rK + wL +c_f's_fE = VM', \;\; M' > M\tag{3}$$ You see? This is the phenomenon called "imported inflation". Whatever the reasons were for the price increase (the "not important" reasons), inflation was not caused by the expansion of the money supply (that's indeed true), and what else the government could do than raise the money supply to service the higher nominal level of output? Of course what the story above does not say, is that foreign factors of production will want a "money" that they accept, and most likely this won't be the local currency of this small country. And by increasing the money supply the exchange rate $s_f$ will suffer (increase), because $s_f = h(M), \;\; h' >0$, increasing in this way further the costs of imported factors in terms of local currency, and making the increase in the money supply equivalent to "shoot oneself in the foot". And this is only one more step towards the road to general equilibrium. The essence here is that a) it is trivial that there are many other factors that may tend to affect prices upwardly, except money supply expansion b) in the presence of these other influences, increasing the money supply is not necessarily the appropriate government response. 

In all indexed references to the Slutsky matrix in Mas-Collel et al. no such relation can be found. It is my impression that the authors meant that the expression they write conveys the same information and restrictions with the original, being a scaled version of it. I will use indices $i$, $k$, and write the logarithm explicitly in order to avoid confusion. $$\frac {\partial b_i}{\partial \ln p_k} = \frac {\partial (x_ip_i/w)}{\partial \ln p_k}$$ Get liberal with partial differentiation, think of it as a differential, which gives $$\partial \ln p_k = \partial p_k/p_k$$ Insert above to get $$\frac {\partial b_i}{\partial \ln p_k} = p_k\frac {\partial (x_ip_i/w)}{\partial p_k} = \frac{p_ip_k}{w}\cdot \frac {\partial x_i}{\partial p_k}$$ and rearranging $$\implies \frac {\partial x_i}{\partial p_k} = \frac{w}{p_ip_k} \cdot \frac {\partial b_i}{\partial \ln p_k} \tag{1}$$ So we have expressed the first term of the usual Slutsky element in terms of logarithmic derivatives of budget shares. For the second component we have $$\frac {\partial b_i}{\partial \ln w} = w\frac {\partial (x_ip_i/w)}{\partial w} = w \frac {(\partial x_i/\partial w)p_iw - x_ip_i}{w^2} = p_i\frac {\partial x_i}{\partial w} - b_i$$ rearranging and also multiplying by $x_k$ we get $$\frac {\partial x_i}{\partial w} x_k = \frac {x_k}{p_i}\frac {\partial b_i}{\partial \ln w} + \frac {x_k}{p_i} b_i$$ Multiply and divide each element by $p_kw$: $$\frac {\partial x_i}{\partial w} x_k = \frac {x_kp_kw}{p_ip_kw}\frac {\partial b_i}{\partial \ln w} + \frac {x_kp_kw}{p_ip_kw} b_i$$ $$\implies \frac {\partial x_i}{\partial w} x_k = \frac {w}{p_ip_k}\frac {\partial b_i}{\partial \ln w} b_k + \frac {w}{p_ip_k} b_ib_k \tag{2}$$ Combining, $$(1),(2) \implies s_{ik} = \frac {\partial x_i}{\partial p_k} + \frac {\partial x_i}{\partial w} x_k \\ =\frac{w}{p_ip_k} \cdot \frac {\partial b_i}{\partial \ln p_k} + \frac {w}{p_ip_k}\cdot \frac {\partial b_i}{\partial \ln w} b_k + \frac {w}{p_ip_k}\cdot b_ib_k $$ $$\implies s_{ik} = \frac{w}{p_ip_k} \Big(\frac {\partial b_i}{\partial \ln p_k} + \frac {\partial b_i}{\partial \ln w} b_k + b_ib_k\Big) \tag{3}$$ The term in the big parenthesis is what the authors give as the off-diagonal element of the Slutsky matrix. The scaling factor $\frac{w}{p_ip_k}$ is symmetrical, so the expression in the big parenthesis nevertheless reflects the same symmetry conditions as the usual $s_{ik}$ terms. If you apply the same method for the diagonal elements you will get the $-b_i$ term. This form of the Slutsky matrix I believe is old story, and it has come about for purposes of econometric estimation of demand systems. For example, in Theil, H., & Clements, K. W. (1980). Recent Methodological Advances in Economic Equation Systems. American Behavioral Scientist, 23(6), 789-809. we find this form of the Slutsky elements, which the authors call "elements of the Slutsky matrix" without any "explanation" as to why the textbook expressions are scaled. But I would advise to go ahead and e-mail the authors asking for clarifications.
