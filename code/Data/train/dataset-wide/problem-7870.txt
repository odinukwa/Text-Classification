Let $X$ be a finite (CW or simplicial - doesn't matter) complex and consider the space of all compact subspaces of $R^\infty$ which are homotopy equivalent to $X$, topologized say as a subspace of the space of all compact subspaces of $R^\infty$ with the Hausdorff metric. What is known about this space? I vaguely recall that it is related to Waldhausen's $A$-theory - are there any references for that? Motivation: if one instead looks at the space of all subspaces homeomorphic to or respectively diffeomorphic (if $X$ is a manifold) to $X$ one has a model for $BHomeo(X)$ or $BDiff(X)$ (since the corresponding space of embeddings of $X$ in $R^\infty$ is weakly contractible and this space is the quotient of the space of embeddings by the homeo/diffeo group). I have been having fun lately thinking about these models when $X$ is a finite set of points or a surface. This space of subspaces homotopy equivalent to $X$ is different - in particular I do not see it (directly anyways) as a model for $BHomotopySelfEquiv(X)$ - so I'd like to know more what is known about it.

I have been trying to make sure that my daughter hears me say with some frequency "I don't know (but I'm curious)" and "I'm wrong (but I'd like to know what's right)," since that's the best way for her to learn to say these things when appropriate. Looking in the big picture well beyond math, the world would be a better place if people would say those things more frequently. But math is one of the best places to come to terms with these sentiments (which is one of the many reasons some people dislike it). Children are sometimes OK with not knowing, but hate being wrong. I don't want my daughter to have the impression that I know everything, so I'm really happy when she asks science questions I don't have good answers for. That's not going to happen in math for a while, but I will sometimes intentionally lead her astray and push along until she catches me - that has a big element of fun to it (she gives me these looks when she starts to suspect me) and catching me being wrong is a step, I think, in her developing the ability to catch her own mistakes. 

Given an n-dimensional polytope $P$ in $\mathbb R^n$, Given as a convex hull of a finite set of points, $S$ I would like to construct an expliict formula for a function $f\colon \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ such that $P=\left\{x\in\mathbb R^n \Big|\ f(x) \le 1\right\}$ Is there any nice known closed formula? It seems that there should be one in existance, as everything is piecewise linear. Moreover, I would like to ask the same question in the case P is given as intersections of half planes (hence, the data I have are normal vectors to the plane and distance from the origin) Thanks 

I will present my question in the specifics I encountered it, so maybe some of the details are irrelevant for the desired conclusion. Consider $(S^2\times S^2,\omega_{std})$ the product of two spheres with standard product symplectic structure. $L\subset M$ is a Lagrangian torus in M. Given a family $\omega_s$ of forms, such that $\omega_0=\omega_{std}$ Choose $J_s$ an almost complex structure compatible with $\omega_s$. (which we are allowed to choose generically). Let $u_s$ be a family of Maslov 2 discs with boundary on $L$, converging to some bubbled curve $v$. Is there something I can say about the shape of the limit curve? The best case scenario would be a statement "If $J_s$ is generic, then the limit consists of two discs, one of Maslov 2 and the other of Maslov 0" I think I can rule out sphere bubbles by area considerations (A sphere in $S^2\times S^2$ has more area than the original disc), But as for discs I don't know how this works. Can I get in the limit discs with negative Maslov? Discs with Maslov $\ge 4$? a lot of Maslov 0 discs? Thank you very much 

I have recently been doing some calculations in topology which are naturally expressed in terms commutative ring objects in the category of cocommutative coalgebras. These have been studied for quite a while - initially by Milgram and Ravenel-Wilson since they arise in studying homology of ring spectra - and go by the name "Hopf rings" (for better or worse). I'd like to make the calculations more "meaningful" if possible so my question is: how much of commutative algebra has been reproduced for ring objects in categories other than vector spaces sets? For some suitably nice categories C, hopefully including cocommutative coalgebras, do ring objects in C have analogues of ideals/modules, dimension, Spec, localization,...? I realize this is open-ended, but if there is existing work along any of these lines it would be nice to look and see if the ring objects I am considering fit in with and are illuminated by such a framework. Since (an interesting subset of) cocommutative Hopf algebras are given by group objects in the category of cocommutative coalgebras, one would suspect that this category's ring objects are also particularly nice but I am not aware of any such general development. 

Here's one which is key for calculations: Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and $W_G(H) = N_G(H)/H$. Then the restriction map $H^*(BG) \to H^*(BH)$ maps to the invariants $(H^*(BH))^{W_G(H)}$. When $H$ is abelian, its cohomology is well-known (polynomial tensor exterior) and thus the cohomology of $G$ is mapping to something which can in principal be computed by invariant theory. Follow this with Quillen's theorem that the sum of these maps over all abelian subgroups has kernel which contains only nilpotent elements, and special cases such as Milgram's theorem that this is injective for symmetric groups, and you have a powerful computational tool. Also, here is a nice survey by Alejandro Adem (whose book with Milgram is a good reference, complementary in many ways to Brown's). It is intended for a graduate student summer school audience: $URL$ 

The polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ decomposes as a direct sum of isotypic components for the action of the symmetric group $S_n$. The isotypic component of the trivial representation is simply the ring of symmetric functions. The complementary summand--that is, the direct sum of all the other isotypic components--is a free module of rank $n!-1$ over the ring of symmetric functions. I would like to have an explicit basis, or at least an explicit set of generators, for this module. For example, if $n=2$, we have $\mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2] = \mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2]^{S_2} \oplus \mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2]^{S_2}\cdot (x_1-x_2)$, so we have a basis consisting of the single element $x_1-x_2$. More generally, the isotypic component of the sign representation is equal to symmetric functions times the Vandermonde determinant, so the Vandermonde determinant should probably be one of the elements of my generating set. 

Let $f:Y\to X$ be a proper birational map of normal varieties over an algebraically closed field which is an isomorphism over the regular locus. Q1: Is it the case that the pullback $f^*\operatorname{Pic}(X)\to\operatorname{Pic}(Y)$ is always injective? (Update: this was answered in the affirmative by Jason Starr.) Q2: Suppose that there exists a finite set $\{C_i \mid i\in I\}$ of projective curves in $Y$ such that a line bundle is ample (respectively nef) on $Y$ if and only if its restriction to each $C_i$ has positive (respectively non-negative) degree. Is it the case that a line bundle on $X$ (interpreted via pullback as a line bundle on $Y$) is ample (respectively nef) if and only if its restriction to each $C_i$ that isn't contracted by $f$ has positive (respectively non-negative) degree? For example, suppose that $Y$ is a crepant resolution of a Kleinian singularity, with exceptional divisor $E\subset Y$ consisting of a finite union of projective lines. Suppose that $X$ is a partial resolution, obtained from $Y$ by contracting some (but not all) of the components of $E$. Then the Picard group of $X$ should be isomorphic to the subgroup of the Picard group of $Y$ consisting of line bundles whose restrictions to the contracted curves have degree zero, and its ample cone should be those line bundles whose restrictions to the un-contracted curves have positive degree. 

First an important distinction: "Each element in $\pi_3(\vee S^2)$ has description in terms of linking number of point preimages (circles in $S^3$) of map $S^3 \to S^2$" is not a fully correct statement. What has a description in terms of such linking numbers is $Hom(\pi_3(\vee S^2), Z).$ As you say, $\pi_3(\vee S^2)$ itself is described as generated by Whitehead products and $\pi_3(M)$ is a quotient of this. Dually, $Hom(\pi_3(M), Z)$ will consist of a sub-module of these linking numbers, and if you want you can make it more geometric. For any collection of closed two-dimensional cochains $\{ \alpha_i, \beta_i \}$ such that $\sum \alpha_i \smile \beta_i= d \theta$ one can form the generalized linking number which to some $f : S^3 \to S^2$ evaluates the "integral" $\int_{S^3} [ \sum f^* \alpha_i \smile d^{-1} f^* \beta_i - f^* \theta]$. Here $\int_{S^3}$ is evaluation on the fundamental class of $S^3$ and $d^{-1} f^* \beta_i$ indicates a choice of $1$-cochain which cobounds $f^* \beta_i$. If the $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ are Poincare dual to codimension two submanifolds of $M$ this will be a linking number (with "correction" by the $\theta_i$) of the preimages of those submanifolds. So far, this is just addressing $\pi_3$. But in recent work Ben Walter and I generalize such "linking numbers" and show that the resulting collection yields a finite-index subgroup of $Hom(\pi_n(X), Z)$ for all $n$ for simply connected $X$. One can take the formulae there - in this case one will need to go to "weight two" - and translate them into geometric terms as I did for $\pi_3$ above. We give a number of examples, and I'd be happy to provide closer analysis for simply connected $M^4$ if you think what we do is relevant and I understood better what you're looking for. The caveats are that we are representing functionals on homotopy groups rather than homotopy groups themselves, and what we can do about torsion is very limited (but is likely to suffice in this case). 

I am reading a paper and there is some computation of RHom of sheaves that I don't understand. I hope this is the right place to ask. It is this paper, example 3.10 , page 25 arxiv.org/pdf/1005.1517v4.pdf In the first RHom equality there, They claim that: $R\mathcal{Hom}(k_{\Delta\times\{0\}}, k_{M\times M\times \mathbb R}) \simeq k_{\Delta\times\{0\}}[-n-1]$ Where, for a closed immersion $j: N\to M$ of manifolds we denote by $k_N := j_*j^{-1}k_M$ where $k_M$ is the constant sheaf on $M$, and the diagonal of $M\times M$ is denoted by $\Delta$. Why does the result come shifted by the codimension? How does one begin to compute RHoms of such sheaves in general? will deRahm resolution work? Thanks ! 

$\mathbb Z$ acts on the lattice $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ by adding an element to itself n times. I am studying some function arising from symplectic geometry which happens in my case to be naturally defined on $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ and is constant on each orbit of the $\mathbb Z$-action, thus it lives ob the orbit space. I am curious what kinds of algebraic/geometric/arithmetic structures does this set or orbits has, to compare with the behaviour of my function. Thanks 

Hello, I am looking for a source that discusses and teaches hyperbolic geometry from a synthetic approach (As opposed to the common analytinc approach in the poincare disk). I am looking for something more in spirit with eucld's elements or hilbert's geometry book. Thank you 

Brown Representability combined with the Landweber Exact Functor theorem allows one to construct homotopy types out of purely algebro-geometric data, and is in particular the starting point for theories such as that of topological modular forms. Thus, this old theorem underlies one of the key themes which modern algebraic topology is fleshing out. 

It is standard to construct numbers associated to a linear transformation $f: V \to V$ of a finite-dimensional vector space which are invariant under change of basis. The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are such, and it is quite simple to see for example that the trace is invariant by equating it with the map which takes $\sum v_i \otimes w_i \in V \otimes V^* \cong Hom(V, V)$ and then evaluates $\sum w_i(v_i)$. My question is: can one explicitly associate quantities to maps $V \to V \otimes V$ which are invariant under change of basis? A simple dimension count indicates there should be plenty of invariants, since the orbits will have dimension roughly $d^3 - d^2$, where $d$ is the dimension of $V$, but I have yet to construct a single one. 

Start with the really well-known fact that $R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]^{S_n}$, where $R$ is any commutative ring, is polynomial on elementary symmetric polynomials. Now consider the slight generalization of multiple collections of variables, namely $R[x(i)_1, \ldots, x(i)_n]^{S_n}$, where $i$ runs over some finite indexing set and $S_n$ still acts by permuting subscripts. These rings are generally not polynomial algebras, in particular when $R$ is ${\mathbb F}_p$. Ten years ago, in the context of computing the cohomology of symmetric groups, Mark Feshbach gave generators and inductively-defined relations for these rings when $R$ is ${\mathbb F}_2$. My questions are: (1) Does anyone know of calculations over ${\mathbb F}_p$ or other approaches over ${\mathbb F}_2$? (2) Restricting to $R = {\mathbb F}_p$ and replacing $S_n$ by $GL_n({\mathbb F}_p)$ we get the Dickson algebras in the case of one collection of variables. Has anyone studied the analogues of Dickson algebras where there are multiple collections of variables? 

For a topological space M, It is known from homotopy theory that the elements of the first cohomology $H^1(M;\mathbb{Z})$ are in 1-1 correspondence with homotopy classes of maps $[M,S^1]$ In my case of interest M is a smooth manifold. Take $\alpha$ and take smooth $f\colon M \to S^1$ representing $\alpha$ under the above identification. My question is, under what (sufficient / necessary / equiv) conditions $f$ gives a locally trivial fibration (Fiber bundle) of M over $S^1$? I would prefer conditions in terms of homology / cohomology of M. What comes to my mind is that, according to Ehrshmann theorem, since $S^1$ is compact,this map is a fibration iff surjective + submersion. Surjectivity can be assured by picking nontrivial cohomology class. As for submersion. I have no idea how to characterize. Thanks 

For every $m\in\mathbb{N}_+$, $k=0,\dots,m-1$, denote $I_{m,k}:=(\frac{k}{m},\frac{k+1}{m})$. Denote $W = H^1(S^1,\mathbb R^{2n})$ = The Hilbert space of $C^1$ maps maps $v(t)$ from the circle to $\mathbb R^{2n}$ with $v$ and $\dot v$ in $L^2$. We will think of those maps as maps $v\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb R^{2n}$ with $v(0)=v(1)$. Consider the spaces: \begin{eqnarray*} W_m &:=& W\cap\{v\in H^1([0,1],\mathbb R^{2n}):\text{$v|_{I_{m,k}}$ is linear}\} \end{eqnarray*} Consider the projection $P$ from $W$ to $W_m$. Does $P$ have a kernel in the sense of convolution operator or Hilbert-Schmidt operator? Is there a closed formula? (This is reminiscent of the situation in Fourier series, where the projection onto the space of truncated Fourier sums is a convolution with Dirichlet Kernel) Thanks
