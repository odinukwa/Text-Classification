You don't need to be talking fast. Something does happen, and you could call it "dropping", but /t/ isn't necessarily phonologically deleted. If you do delete /d/, you'd get flapping and the result would be the same as if you deleted /t/. Or the tongue gestures overlap in time, giving the same result as segment deletion. I don't think you can do that in British English. EDIT: BTW, this is not a general process, it's limited to a few fixed expressions. Compare most instances of /t#d/ as in "straight down", "Put Don on the chair", "Hit Darlene", "sit downwind" and so on, where there is no dropping. It's the same lexicalized contraction process that you have in "will not" → "won't", "going to" → "gonna". 

There are indeed dialect issues. I presume you are aware that IPA letters represent regions of vowel articulation and not precise points. There is an informal transcriptional practice for vowels that in transcribing a language, one uses the symbol which most closely matches standard reference performances. But this is not an absolute rule, and in fact usually people write "a" unless there is a contrast such as [a,ɑ]. For most American dialects, one could use either [æ] or [a] for the vowel in "hat", since [æ] and [a] do not contrast. Typically, [æ] is used because that better matches the reference pronunciation. The treatment of diphthongs in IPA is analogous to the treatment of affricates: they are written with two letters, possible with the tie diacritic to imply a phonological analysis as a single segment. Again, the convention of "closest phonetic match" would be applicable in deciding how to transcribe "fight". There are about 3 reasonable choices for the first vowel: [a, ɑ, ɐ]. Because of the following diphthong element [ɪ], it's difficult to make the decision based just on introspection (hearing [ɪ] right after the low vowel is a distraction), but you can use Praat to extract just the initial 1/3 of the diphthong and compare it to the initial 1/3 of other vowels to see which vowel you think the a-like vowel is closer to. I suspect that you won't find [ɐ] to be a particularly good match (there are dialects where that is the appropriate vowel, often diagnosed by the pair "rider/writer"). Many dialects have both a low front vowel and a low back unrounded vowel, so [a, ɑ] are plausible choices. Whichever vowel you pick, it won't really match the phonetic quality of the low-vowel part of "fight". This is when articulation-adjustment diacritics are appropriate, for example you might classify it as an advanced ([˖]) version of [ɑ], or a retracted ([ˍ]) or centralized ([¨]) version of [a]. Phonetic closeness is not the only consideration: another, relevant to transcribing diphthongs, is whether the component vowels are individually required. If a language has an ai-like diphthong that sounds most like [æi] but the language has only [a] and not [æ] as a phoneme, then you might appeal to the lack of an [æ] phoneme as justification for the transcription [ai]. Since many American dialects have both [æ] and a lower backer vowel written either [ɑ] or [a], any of [æɪ, aɪ, ɑɪ] would be a possible transcription for that diphthong. [aɪ, ɑɪ] fare better in terms of matching the quality of the initial part of the diphthong to the corresponding reference vowels. Assuming that "father" is transcribed with [a], then you would write [faɪt] if you're not introducing new vowel symbols for diphthongs. My dialect lacks [ɑ] ("cot" and "caught" are both [kɔt]), so I would opt for [aɪ]. However, the vowel [a] exists only in [aɹ, aɪ] and adult-acquired foreign words like "pasta". If I were minimizing the number of letters in my transcriptions, I would probably write [æɪ, æɹ], but that would be phonetically misleading. 

It goes back to the properties of the glottal wave. With modal phonation, there is a sharp discontinuity to what is fundamentally a sine wave coming from the glottal airflow function, when the vocal folds slam shut and are blown open. That gives the modal phonatory source a move triangular shape. With breathy voice, there may not be much (or any) of a closure period, so the source wave is closer to a sine wave. A sine wave has just one component, whereas a triangular wave has many components, the most prominent being the fundamental but higher harmonics are also quite prominent. So it really goes back to the spectrum (or cepstrum) of different glottal airflow functions. 

Logoori has two taste words, -rur-u and -nʊr-u. The former covers hot (spicy), bitter, sour and generally anything negative (it also means "fierce" when applied to animates), and the latter is "sweet". Phrases can be constructed to convey whatever you'd like to say such as "salty, meaty, mushroomy, vegetal". 

This is a version of the general phenomenon of fixed-segmental reduplication. Many languages have partial reduplication where a particular element is a fixed phoneme (e.g. di-dō from /dō/; gbi-gbona). A number (smaller) have complete reduplication: rimisirana-rimisirana. The English echo reduplications mentioned above combine those two properties; likewise, Kolami maasur-giisur ('men and the like') has a fixed constituent (the onset of the second syllable). Replacive vowel patterns are also found in a number of languages, such as the Munda language Gta', where root vowels are replaced in various ways for various effects (e.g. "gross", "tender", "different"), so fixed segmentalism is not limited to reduplication. (I would be remiss if I ignored Semitic root-and-pattern changes in vocalism). The ultimate historical explanation for the specific vowel pattern found in English is not clear, but it is something that languages do. It is fairly common in "affective" word-formation (i.e. processes that convey an added nuance to a meaning, as opposed to being a grammatical inflection). There does not seem to be any extensive study that assembles the facts and tries to discern universal patterns (e.g. is [ɪ-æ] more common than [æ-ɪ]). If the English choices and orders of vowels is just one of a myriad set of attested patterns, then there isn't much to explain other than "what happened that this pattern got fixed and not [ɛ-u]?". It's really not know if there are significantly recurring patterns across languages. 

You can get the actually official charts from the IPA here. There is no reason to use unofficial and potentially error-ridden charts when you can use the real thing. The IPA is not just a list of letters, it is a system of symbols and terms. There are no stops in IPA -- they are called plosives. The Wiki page is wrong. 

The concept of "unit" is not a term of linguistics, so you have to draw on an independent epistemology and not specifically linguistics to understand what a "unit" is. I understand a "unit" to be a mental abstraction, abstracted from things that it is like but distinct from. The crow on my porch is an example, one which happens to be constant regardless of label (whether or not I call it "crow", "corbeau", "kråke" or "garja"). A linguistic unit is a specific kind of unit, one that has to do with language. Syllables, words, phonemes, letters, sentences are all units which are about language, thus linguistic units. This is congruent with the vocabulary definition you give. But linguistic units are not all "messages" – that definition commits the fallacy of "the primacy of messages". You can use language to transmit messages, just as you can use paint to convey emotions, but the elements of paint (dirt of various types, lipids, etc.) are not units that emotions can be analyzed into. A "message" is not something concrete, indeed it is so open-ended that linguists can never be sure what others mean by "message". It is sometimes seen as being "communicative intent", but that suggests that the intent is always to communicate and never to obfuscate. Indeed, a person can use linguistic units without have any awareness or "intent", when their mental capacity is suitably diminished.
