The manifold you're describing has a very natural open book decomposition (see e.g. John Etnyre's lecture notes) in which the pages are the $n$-punctured spheres $(S^2 \backslash \cup_i N(p_i)) \times \{*\}$ and the monodromy is trivial. We can view this as a Murasugi sum of n-1 copies of the abstract open book $(S^1\times I, \mathrm{Id})$, which describes $S^1\times S^2$, and since Murasugi sums of open books correspond to connected sums of 3-manifolds, the manifold you want is $\#^{n-1}(S^1\times S^2)$. 

The answer for knots is still "no", because if you have an open book decomposition with disconnected binding then you can stabilize it (see section 2 of Etnyre's lecture notes) by attaching a handle to the page with feet on different binding components. This reduces the number of binding components by one, and you can repeat until the binding is connected, in which case it is a fibered knot. 

Let M5 be a closed and oriented. A contact form α gives a 4-plane distribution with symplectic form dα, reducing the structure group of TM to U(2)×1; such a reduction is called an almost contact structure, and it exists iff the integral third Stiefel-Whitney class is zero (Gray, "Some global properties of contact structures", MR0112161). Equivalently, M is almost contact iff w2(M) lifts to an integral cohomology class. The existence problem for actual contact structures is much harder, though. Contact structures are known to exist in at least the following cases: 

Anyway, that was long enough that I've probably made several mistakes above and still not been anywhere near rigorous. There's a nice overview that's now several years old (and thus probably missing some of the things I said above) on Zoltan Szabo's website, $URL$ if you want more details. 

This was conjectured by Witten in his paper in his paper Monopoles and four-manifolds. The conjecture says that if $X$ has Seiberg-Witten simple type (meaning that $SW_X(\mathfrak{s})$ is nonzero only when the moduli space associated to $X$ is 0-dimensional) and satisfies some mild homological conditions (including $b_1(X)=0$ and $b^+(X)>1$ odd), then $X$ has Donaldson simple type, its Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten basic classes coincide, and its Donaldson series has the form ${\mathcal D}^w_X(h) = 2^{2+(7\chi(X)+11\sigma(X))/4}e^{Q(h)/2}\sum_{\mathfrak{s}} (-1)^{w^2+c_1(\mathfrak{s})\cdot w} SW_X(\mathfrak{s})e^{c_1(\mathfrak{s})\cdot h}$ where $\mathfrak{s}$ ranges over Spin^c structures on $X$ and $Q(h)$ is the intersection form on $X$. Recall that the Donaldson series is defined as a formal power series by the sum $\sum_i D^w_X((1+\frac{x}{2})\frac{h^i}{i!})$, where $x$ is a point of $X$ and $h$ is an element of $H_2(X)$; this definition is originally due to Kronheimer and Mrowka, in Embedded surfaces and the structure of Donaldson's polynomial invariants. There is a series of papers by Feehan and Leness proving many cases of the conjecture, although it has not been established in full. For an overview of this program, originally proposed by Pidstrigach and Tyurin, you might try their survey article PU(2) monopoles and relations between four-manifold invariants. Notably, their most recent paper, Witten's conjecture for many four-manifolds of simple type, proves it assuming that $c_1^2(X) \geq \chi_h(X)-3$, and before that, A general SO(3)-monopole cobordism formula relating Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants was used by Kronheimer-Mrowka to prove enough cases of the conjecture to establish the Property P conjecture, in Witten's conjecture and Property P. 

There is an upper bound of $O\left(\frac{(\log n)(\log \log \log n)}{(\log \log n)^3}\right)$ due to Daniel Kane: see "Improved bounds on the number of ways of expressing t as a binomial coefficient," Integers 7 (2007), #A53 for details. 

The Cairns-Hirsch theorem says that a PL manifold $M$ is smoothable if and only if $M\times \mathbb{R}$ is smoothable, so you can take $M$ to be any one of the known compact, PL examples such as Kervaire's manifold and then $M\times\mathbb{R}^n$ is non-smoothable for $n \geq 1$. 

This was addressed in Miyazaki, Conjugation and the prime decomposition of knots in closed, oriented 3-manifolds, using the definition of connected sum suggested by Ryan Budney in the comments. The main results are that a prime decomposition of K exists iff a meridian of K is not null-homotopic in the complement of K, and if a prime decomposition of K does not contain a particular knot R in S1×S2 then it is the unique decomposition of K, whereas knots with this summand R can admit several prime decompositions. 

The knot must be quasipositive. You can perturb it to be transverse as in Marco Golla's answer, and then a theorem of Boileau and Orevkov (in Quasi-positivité d'une courbe analytique dans une boule pseudo-convexe, MR1836094) says that transverse knots which bound symplectic surfaces in $B^4$ must be quasipositive. 

The figure eight knot is hyperbolic, so by Thurston all but finitely many 1/n-surgeries on it yield hyperbolic homology spheres. The Casson invariant of the 1/n surgery is (n/2)Δ''(1), where Δ(t) = -t + 3 - t-1 is the Alexander polynomial of the figure eight, so it should be -n and therefore there are at least n distinct SU(2) representations. In practice you should be able to work these out explicitly from a presentation of the knot group: figure out the SU(2) representation variety of the knot group (see Klassen, "Representations of knot groups in SU(2)" for the figure eight), impose the relation μλn=1, and compute what's left. 

It provides lots of computable invariants in contact geometry, in particular the contact invariant defined by Ozsvåth and Szabó via open books and the Giroux correspondence. For example, on Seifert fibered spaces the question of whether tight contact structures exist was completely solved by Lisca and Stipsicz, and the classification was completed in many of these cases in several other papers; and Ghiggini used it to exhibit contact structures which are strongly fillable but not Stein fillable. Similarly, the LOSS invariant (named after Lisca-Ozsváth-Stipsicz-Szabó) and the related, easily computable Ozsváth-Szabó-Thurston grid diagram invariants of Legendrian and transverse knots were used by Ng-Ozsváth-Thurston to successfully distinguish many pairs of knots in the standard contact $S^3$, and been used to prove other properties such as the fact due to Etnyre and Vela-Vick that the complement of the binding of any open book of any contact structure has no Giroux torsion. (According to recent work of Baldwin--Vela-Vick--Vértesi, these invariants are the same for knots in the standard $S^3$.) 

This is known for any knot in a closed, oriented 3-manifold whose complement is irreducible. Ni proved this in Knot Floer homology detects fibred knots, building on Ghiggini's proof in the genus 1 case; another proof was given by Juhász (see theorem 9.11). 

The upper bound holds if you replace kn by the much larger number ln of prime n-crossing links. Sundberg and Thistlethwaite ("The rate of growth of the number of prime alternating links and tangles," MR1609591) also found asymptotic bounds on the number an of prime alternating n-crossing links: lim (an)1/n exists and is equal to (101+√21001)/40. 

For large enough n, the matrix B = A + A2 + ... + An has positive entries since there's a path of length at most n connecting any two vertices. Thus by the Perron-Frobenius theorem B has a unique maximal eigenvalue and its multiplicity is 1. Any eigenvector of A with eigenvalue λ is an eigenvector of B with eigenvalue f(λ)=λ+λ2+...+λn, and f(λ) is maximized on [-1,1] at λ=1, so if there were two independent eigenvectors of A with λ=1 then B would have two independent eigenvectors achieving the maximal eigenvalue f(1) and this is a contradiction. 

Let g be a generator of the multiplicative group of the field; assuming x and y are nonzero, we can write x=ga and y=gb with 0 <= a,b < p2-1, and then xp+1=y4 becomes ga(p+1)=g4b, or equivalently a(p+1) = 4b (mod p2-1). From this we see that p+1 | 4b is necessary, and if 4b=k(p+1) then (a,b) gives a solution iff a=k (mod p-1). Since a can range from 0 to p2-2, then, there are either 0 solutions or p+1 solutions for any fixed b. The total number of nonzero solutions is therefore (p+1)* #{b | p+1 divides 4b}, and then (x,y)=(0,0) is the remaining solution. Now if p is 1 (mod 4) we have p+1 | 4b iff b is a multiple of (p+1)/2, and there are 2(p-1) such b up to p2-1, so there are 2(p-1)(p+1)+1 = 2p2-1 solutions. On the other hand, if p is 3 (mod 4) then p+1 | 4b iff b is a multiple of (p+1)/4, so we have 4(p-1) such b and there are 4p2-3 solutions. 

One source of restrictions is the Montesinos trick: if you take the branched double cover of $L$, then a small neighborhood of the framed arc lifts to a solid torus because it intersects $L$ in two small arcs. Replacing those small arcs with the ones coming from the surgery produces another solid torus in the new branched cover, so the two branched covers are related by a Dehn surgery. If the surgery produces the unknot, then this means that the branched double cover $\Sigma(L)$ has to be Dehn surgery on a knot in $S^3$. For example, the above implies that $H_1(\Sigma(L))$ must be cyclic. If $K$ is a knot with determinant $d > 1$, then $H_1(\Sigma(K))$ has order $d$. The connected sum $L = K \# T(2,2d)$ is a 2-component link with branched double cover $\Sigma(K) \# L(2d,1)$, where $T(2,2d)$ is the $(2,2d)$-torus link and $L(2d,1)$ a lens space. Its first homology is $H_1(\Sigma(K)) \oplus \mathbb{Z}/(2d)$, and since this is not cyclic, no surgery on $L$ will produce the unknot. This also reproves the result of Scharlemann which Ian Agol mentioned, because if L is a split link $L_1 \sqcup L_2$ then its branched cover is $\Sigma(L_1) \# \Sigma(L_2) \# S^1\times S^2$. Then by Gabai's proof of the Poenaru conjecture (which came after Scharlemann's paper), we must have $\Sigma(L_1)=\Sigma(L_2)=S^3$, and so $L_1$ and $L_2$ are both unknots. 

For knots in S3 it is also known how to compute HFK(K) combinatorially: see papers by Manolescu-Ozsvath-Sarkar and Manolescu-Ozsvath-Szabo-Thurston. The relation to other knot homology theories isn't all that well understood, but there are some results comparing it to Khovanov homology. For example, given a knot K in S3: 

As pointed out by Hedden, Livingston showed that strongly quasipositive knots have $g(K) = g_4(K) = \tau(K)$, where $g_4$ is the smooth slice genus and $\tau$ is the Ozsváth-Szabó concordance invariant, so this is an easy way to show that some quasipositive knots aren't strongly quasipositive. Baader gave a list of knots which are quasipositive but not positive up to 10 crossings, and among these the criterion $g = g_4$ is actually equivalent to strong quasipositivity, so for example $8_{20}$ (with $g=1$ but $g_4=0$) is quasipositive but not strongly quasipositive. 

I'm not an expert, but I don't think there are any almost contact 5-manifolds which are known to not be contact. 

The (p,q) torus knot has a presentation with two generators, namely $\langle x,y \mid x^p = y^q\rangle$, but if $p,q>2$ then it's non-alternating and so it must have bridge index greater than 2. 

It's actually a conjecture of Fox, sometimes known as the trapezoidal conjecture: the absolute values of the coefficients of $\Delta_K(t)$ are nonincreasing if K is an alternating knot. I think the original citation is Fox, "Some problems in knot theory." Murasugi apparently proved the conjecture for alternating algebraic knots -- see "On the Alexander polynomial of alternating algebraic knots", MR0802722, which doesn't seem to be online -- and Ozsváth and Szabó proved it for genus 2 alternating knots in "Heegaard Floer homology and alternating knots," arXiv:0209149, but it's still open in general. 

I can say something about this for Heegaard Floer homology. Given a 3-manifold Y, you can take a Heegaard splitting, i.e. a decomposition of Y into two genus g handlebodies joined along their boundary. This can be represented by drawing g disjoint curves a1,...,ag and g disjoint curves b1,...,bg on a surface S of genus g; then you attach 1-handles along the ai and 2-handles along the bi, and fill in what's left of the boundary with 0-handles and 3-handles to get Y. The products Ta=a1x...xag and Tb=b1x...xbg are Lagrangian tori in the symmetric product Symg(S), which has a complex structure induced from S, and applying typical constructions from Lagrangian Floer homology gives you a chain complex CF(Y) whose generators are points in the intersection of these tori and whose differential counts certain holomorphic disks in Symg(S). Miraculously, its homology HF(Y) turns out to be independent of every choice you made along the way. We can also pick a basepoint z in the surface S and identify a hypersurface {z}xSymg-1(S) in Symg(S), and we can count the number nz(u) of times these disks cross that hypersurface: if we only count disks where nz(u)=0, for example, we get the hat version of HF, and otherwise we get more complicated versions. Given two points z and w on the surface S of any Heegaard splitting we can construct a knot in Y: draw one curve in S-{ai} and another in S-{bi} connecting z and w, and push these slightly into the corresponding handlebodies. In fact, for any knot K in Y there is a Heegaard splitting such that we can construct K in this fashion. But now this extra basepoint w gives a filtration on CF(Y); in the simplest form, if we only count holomorphic disks u with nz(u)=nw(u)=0 we get the invariant \hat{HFK}(Y,K), and otherwise we get other versions. The fact that this comes from a filtration also gives us a spectral sequence HFK(Y,K) => HF(Y). This was constructed independently by Ozsvath-Szabo and Rasmussen, and it satisfies several interesting properties. Just to name a few: 

There are some known exponential bounds on the number. For example, if kn is the number of prime knots with n crossings, then Welsh proved in "On the number of knots and links" (MR1218230) that 

Update (7/25/15): The problem has been completely solved since my original answer in 2011. For 5-manifolds, Casals, Pancholi, and Presas and Etnyre proved that every homotopy class of almost contact structure contains a contact structure. This was then generalized to all odd dimensions by Borman, Eliashberg, and Murphy, who gave a definition of overtwistedness in higher dimensions and showed that every homotopy class of almost complex structure contains a unique overtwisted contact structure up to isotopy.
