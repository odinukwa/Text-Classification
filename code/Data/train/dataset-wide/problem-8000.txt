The Zariski topology is part of the basic structure of varieties and schemes. Unlike other, fancier Grothendieck topologies, it is actually a topology, defined by subsets of the variety/scheme, and so gives rise to the notion of closed, as well as of open, subset. The closed subsets are the algebraic subsets (in the variety case) or (the spaces underlying) the closed subschemes (in the scheme case), which are what the study of algebraic geometry is to a large extent about. If you look at Hartshorne, Chapters IV and V, you will find a lot of geometry of curves and surfaces (as well as some geometry of higher dimensional varieties too), all of it treated without recourse to any topology other than the Zariski topology. Added: A good example, in my opinion, is the (direct) proof that the addition law on a smooth plane cubic curve is associative. (By direct, I mean the proof working from the definition of the group law in terms of collinear points, not the more involved proof that proceeds by identifying the curve with its Picard variety.) It is not hard to see that associativity holds when the three points being added are in suitably general position. To conclude, one can either make complicated special cases arguments in the various non-generic situations, or, one can make a continuity argument in the Zariski topology. The latter argument is simple (in that it uses the most basic kinds of arguments about continuous maps in general topology) and decisive. It illustrates perfectly the role of the Zariski topology in geometric arguments. One could generalize from this example as follows: two of the most fundamental notions of algebraic geometry are the complementary concepts of general and special position, and these notions are precisely what the Zariski topology captures (just as the topology on a metric space captures the notion of closeness in the metric). 

Let $v \in V$ be non-zero. Then the span of the elements $g v$ ($g \in G$) is finite-dimensional, because $G$ is finite, and is a $G$-invariant subspace of $V$. Since $V$ is irred., it is just equal to this span, and so is itself finite-dimensional. This should deal with both your points 1 and 2. 

Dear Amitsur, It might help you to think geometrically. For example, $k[x,x^{-1}]$ is the ring of functions on a hyperbola $xy = 1$, and the projection from this hyperbola to the line $x = y$ is a finite projection. This corresponds to the fact that $k[x,x^{-1}]$ is finitely generated as a module over $k[x + x^{-1}].$ (If we write $f = x + x^{-1}$, then $x^2 - f x +1 = 0$ and $x^{-2} - f x^{-1} + 1 = 0$.) 

My comments above formulated as an answer: People typically post a preprint on the arxiv at the same time that they post it on their own homepage, with the goal of disseminating their work to their colleagues. (These days, posting on the web is more important than journal publication for sharing your work, and the arxiv is the central repository for math on the web.) This is often at the same time that they submit to a journal, although sometimes they wait for feedback (as Joe Silverman suggests in comments above), and sometimes they spend more time polishing their preprint before submitting it (as Darij Grinberg suggests, again in the comments above). The conclusion seems to be that it is standard to post on the arxiv as soon as one is ready to share one's work with colleagues, and that this is often at, or close to, the same time that one is ready to submit one's paper. In particular, it is quite common to post on the arxiv at the same time as submitting, or not long prior to submitting. (But there is nothing wrong with posting on the arxiv and then spending some more time polishing your preprint before submitting it to a journal.) 

Dear HYYY, You should assume that the group $G$ acts freely and properly discontinuously on $M$. Also, you should equip $V$ with the discrete topology. (This way you will get a local system rather than a vector bundle, which was a point of confusion in the comments above.) If $G$ acts freely and properly discontinuously, then if $m$ is any point of $M$, it has a neighbourhood $U$ such that $Ug$ is disjoint from $U$ for all non-trivial $g \in G$. (Here I am writing the $G$-action on $M$ on the right, as is implicit in the question.) Thus $U$ maps injectively into $M/G$, and $U \times V$ maps injectively into $M\times_G V$. Hence $M\times_G V$ is locally constant (because, as we have just shown, its pull-back over the open subset $U$ of $M/G$ is constant). 

There are several different ways to see this. Here is one: Let $G$ be our irreducible projective algebraic group variety over the field $k$, with identity element $e$. The group $G$ acts on itself by conjugation, and this action fixes $e$. Thus this induces a $k$-linear action of $G$ on the local ring $\mathcal O_e,$ and hence on the (finite-dimensional) quotients $\mathcal O_e/\mathfrak m_e^n$ for each $n$. Now any morphism from the irreducible projective variety $G$ to the affine variety $End_k(\mathcal O_e/\mathfrak m_e^n)$ must be constant, and so the $G$-action on each $\mathcal O_e/\mathfrak m_e^n$, and hence on $\mathcal O_e$ itself, must be trivial. Since $G$ is irreducible, it is now easy to see, using the fact that the conjugation action induces a trivial action on $\mathcal O_e$, that the conjugation action is in fact trivial on $G$ itself, and hence that $G$ is commutative. (This argument breaks down if $G$ is not projective, because then $G$ can have non-trivial morphisms to the matrix rings $End_k(\mathcal O_e/\mathfrak m_e^n)$; it is instructive to think about this in the case $G = GL_n(k)$. It also breaks down if $G$ is not irreducible, e.g. if $G$ is a finite non-abelian group, then we can think of it as a zero-dimensional projective algebraic group. The point in this case is that one can't make the "analytic continuation" argument from the action on $\mathcal O_e$ to all of $G$.) 

As Harry suggests in his answer, it is probably more intuitive to work with associated primes, rather than the slightly older language of primary decompositions. If $I$ is an ideal in $A$, an associated prime of $A/I$ is a prime ideal of $A$ which is the full annihilator in $A$ of some element of $A/I$. A key fact is that for any element $x$ of $A/I$, the annihilator of $x$ in $A$ is contained in an associated prime. The associated primes are precisely the primes that contribute to the primary decomposition of $I$. Geometrically, $\wp$ is an associated prime of $A/I$ if there is a section of the structure sheaf of Spec $A/I$ that is supported on the irreducible closed set $V(\wp)$. E.g. in the example given in Cam's answer, the function $x^2 - x$ is not identically zero on $X:=$ Spec ${\mathbb C}[x,y]/(x y, x^3-x^2, x^2 y - xy),$ but it is annihilated by $(x,y)$, and so is supported at the origin (if we restrict it to the complement of $(0,0)$ in $X$ then it becomes zero). The non-minimal primes of $I$ that play a role in the primary decomposition of $I$ (i.e. appear as associated primes of $A/I$) are the generic points of the so-called embedded components of Spec $A/I$: they are irreducible closed subset of Spec $A/I$ that are not irreducible components, but which are the support of certain sections of the structure sheaf. An important point is that if $I$ is radical, so that $A/I$ is reduced, then there are no embedded components: the only associated primes are the minimal primes (for the primary decomposition of $I$ is then very simple, as noted in the question: $I$ is just the intersection of its minimal primes). There is a nice criterion for a Noetherian ring to be reduced: Noetherian $A$ is reduced if and only if $A$ satisfies $R_0$ and $S_1$, i.e. is generically reduced, and has no non-minimal associated primes. Geometrically, and applied to $A/I$ rather than $A$, this says that if $A/I$ is generically reduced, then the embedded components are precisely the irreducible closed subsets of Spec $A/I$ over which the nilpotent sections of the structure sheaf are supported. This may help with your ``nilpotentification'' mental image. 

Let me offer an explanation of the difference between truth and provability from postulates which is (I think) slightly different from those already presented. (Although perhaps close in spirit to that of Gerald Edgars's.) First of all, if we are talking about results of the form "for all groups, ..." or "for all topological spaces, ... " then in this case truth and provability are essentially the same: a result is true if it can be deduced from the axioms. (There is the caveat that the notion of group or topological space involves the underlying notion of set, and so the choice of ambient set theory plays a role. This role is usually tacit, but for certain questions becomes overt and important; nevertheless, I will ignore it here, possibly at my peril.) But other results, e.g in number theory, reason not from axioms but from the natural numbers. Of course, along the way, you may use results from group theory, field theory, topology, ..., which will be applicable provided that you apply them to structures that satisfy the axioms of the relevant theory. But in the end, everything rests on the properties of the natural numbers, which (by Godel) we know can't be captured by the Peano axioms (or any other finitary axiom scheme). How do we agree on what is true then? Well, experience shows that humans have a common conception of the natural numbers, from which they can reason in a consistent fashion; and so there is agreement on truth. If you like, this is not so different from the model theoretic description of truth, except that I want to add that we are given certain models (e.g. the standard model of the natural numbers) on which we agree and which form the basis for much of our mathematics. (Again, certain types of reasoning, e.g. about arbitrary subsets of the natural numbers, can lead to set-theoretic complications, and hence (at least potential) disagreement, but let me also ignore that here.) In summary: certain areas of mathematics (e.g. number theory) are not about deductions from systems of axioms, but rather about studying properties of certain fundamental mathematical objects. Axiomatic reasoning then plays a role, but is not the fundamental point. 

First form the fibre product $Z$ of $X$ and $C$ over $Y$, to get maps $f':Z \to X$ and $\phi':Z \to C$ such that $\phi\circ f' = f \circ \phi'.$ Now if the map $\phi'$ is not surjective (equivalently, dominant, since all varieties in sight are projective) then we can't find $C'$. (This happens when the image of $f$ is not contained in the image of $\phi$.) [EDIT: As Sandor Kovacs and Roy Smith noted, I am taking it as a condition that $h$ is also non-constant, although this is not explicitly stated in the question; otherwise one could allow more degenerate solutions. Also, I am assuming that all curves under discussion are connected.] Suppose now that $\phi'$ is surjective. Then we can find a one-dimensional subvariety $D$ of $Z$ such that $\phi'(D) = C$. Indeed, since $\phi'$ is surjective, we may find at least one component of $Z$ such that the restriction of $\phi'$ to that component is already surjective. Replace $Z$ by this component, and so assume that $Z$ is irreducible. If $Z$ is also one-dimensional, then we can take $D = Z$. If not, a general hyperplane section of $Z$ will also surject onto $C$, and so we may replace $Z$ by this hyperplane section, thus reducing the dimension. Continuing in this way, we eventually find the desired $D$. Finally, we can form the normalization $C'$ of $D$. The composite $$C' \longrightarrow D \hookrightarrow Z \buildrel f' \over \longrightarrow X$$ is then the desired map $g$, while the composite $$C' \longrightarrow D \hookrightarrow Z \buildrel \phi' \over \longrightarrow C$$ is the desired map $h$. 

William Stein has answered your question (i). As for your question (ii), since $\xi$ has $p$-power order, and since any $p$-power root of unity is congruent to $1$ modulo the unique prime ideal lying over $p$ in $\mathbb Q$ adjoin the $p$-power roots of unity, we see that $f\otimes \xi$ is congruent to $f$ modulo any prime ideal lying over $p$ in the field of definition of $f$ adjoin the $p$-power roots of unity. Finally, you have already noted in (i) that the character of $f\otimes \xi$ is just $\chi\eta$. Since the conductor of $\xi$ divides $N$ and the conductor of $\eta$ divides $p$, we see that the conductor of $\chi\eta$ divides $p N$. This gives (iii). (Note that (iii) is simply a statement about the conductor of the character of $f\otimes \xi$: In general, a modular form $g$ of level $C$ is modular on $\Gamma_0(C)\cap \Gamma_1(D)$, rather than just $\Gamma_1(C)$, for some integer $D$ dividing $C$, if the character of $g$, a priori a character of $(\mathbb Z/C)^{\times}$, actually factors through $(\mathbb Z/D)^{\times}$. In your particular case, $f$ has conductor a power of $p$ times $N$, and $\xi$ has conductor a power of $p$, so $f\otimes \xi$ has conductor a power of $p$ times $N$. The conductor of its character divide $p N$, as already noted, and so (iii) follows.) 

The ingredient in the Beilinson and Bloch--Kato conjectures is a motive (over ${\mathbb Q}$, say). If we take the integral cohomology of this motive (mod torsion, say) we get an integral lattice. If we take some kind of Neron model, and take the algebraic de Rham cohomology of this, we get a second integral lattice. Now computing the determinant of the pairing of one of these on the other, we get a transcendental number, well defined up to a unit in ${\mathbb Z}^{\times}$, i.e. a sign. This should give you an idea of how one can attach a canonical period to a motive, and is the basic idea underlying the construction of periods for motives. (Since one doesn't have Neron models in general, this idea is just heuristic as it stands, but I think it gives the right idea. If you apply it to ${\mathbb G}_m$, you should recover the period $2\pi i$.) EDIT: I should point out that the above really is just a heuristic, explaining how there are two ways of getting integral structures in cohomology: in singular cohomology, one just takes integral cycles (i.e. "true" cycles on the motive, with no funny coefficients), and in de Rham cohomology, one takes algebraic differential forms that are defined over the integers, like the Neron differential $dx/2y$ on an elliptic curve with minimal Weierstrass equation $y^2 = f(x)$. To actually get the correct periods for a given $L$-function, one has to do a little more manipulation than I indicated; e.g. for an elliptic curve over ${\mathbb Q}$, one will integrate the Neron differential over the a basis for the real integral cycles (i.e. the cycles that are fixed by the action of complex conjugation on $E({\mathbb C})$; these are rank one subgroup of the cohomoloy of $E({\mathbb C})$). But hopefully what I wrote above gives some intuition for what is going on. 

First note that it is not true that regularity above $\mathfrak q$ implies regularity of the fibre. For example, consider the map $\mathbb k[s] \to \mathbb k[t]$ given by $s \mapsto t^2$. Each prime in $k[t]$ is regular, and so in particular each prime of $k[t]$ above the prime $(s)$ is reqular. (In fact there is just one of them, namely $(t)$.) On the other hand, the fibre over $(s)$ is the ring $k[t]/(t^2)$, which is a non-regular local ring. If you want an arithmetic example instead, consider the inclusion $\mathbb Z \subset \mathbb Z[i]$, and take the prime $\mathfrak q = (2)$ downstairs, which has a unique prime $(1+i)$ lying over it. Again, every prime in the PID $\mathbb Z[i]$ is regular, but the fibre $\mathbb Z[i]/2 = \mathbb Z[i]/(1+i)^2$ is a non-regular local ring. (The general phenomenon is that a map $X \to Y$ between smooth spaces can have non-smooth fibres: these occur at the critical points of the map.) As for your question, your asking if the fact that a map $X\to Y$ has a smooth fibres over some point implies that the target is smooth at that point. This is also false in general. Consider for example the identity map $k[t^2,t^3] \to k[t^2,t^3]$. The fibre over $(t^2,t^3)$ is just $k$, which is a regular local ring. But $K[t^2,t^3]$ is not regular at $(t^2,t^3).$ (Of course this example is cheap, but its existence foreshadows the existence of many other counterexamples, for example for any etale map $k[t^2,t^3] \to R$, of which there are many non-trivial examples, as well as my trivial example.) On the other hand, when the base is Spec $\mathbb Z$, which is very nicely behaved (regular, Noetherian, excellent, perfect residue fields, ... ), if the map $X \to $ Spec $\mathbb Z$ is flat and of finite type (e.g. arising from an inclusion $\mathbb Z \subset R$ of the form you envisage) then having regular (and hence smooth) fibre at one point implies being smooth in a neighbourhood of that point, and a smooth map over a regular base has a regular total space --- thus $X$ will be regular in a neighbourhood of the regular fibre. In particular, the points of the regular fibre will themselves be regular in $X$. In particular, in your special case $\mathbb Z \subset R$, the answer is "yes". Edit: I should note that in your situation, where $R$ is a subring of a number field, this "yes" is easily proved directly: one combines the fact that $R/\mathfrak q$ is regular with the fact that it is a priori finite (in cardinality) to see that it is a product of finite field extensions of $\mathbb Z/\mathfrak q$, and hence that the completion of $R$ at $\mathfrak q$ is a product of DVRs, and hence that $R$ is a DVR --- and thus regular --- after localization at each prime above $\mathfrak q$. The point of the more highbrow explanation above is to indicate how one thinks about such questions geometrically --- which is normally the easiest way to see what should be true and what should be false for these kinds of questions.
