Projective varieties Let $X\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$ be a smooth non-degenerate degree $p$ (a prime number) variety of codimension $c$. Then $X$ is not a scheme-theoretic complete intersection. Indeed, if $X = H_1\cap H_2\cap...\cap H_c$, then $deg(H_2)=...=deg(H_c) = 1$ and $deg(H_1) = p$ by Bezout's theorem because $p$ is prime. Therefore $X$ would be degenerate. An example is again the twisted cubic $C\subset\mathbb{P}^3$. However $C$ is a set-theoretic complete intersection. There exist a quadric surface $Q$ and a cubic surface $S$ such that $Q\cap S = 2C$ (i.e. $Q$ and $S$ are tangent along $C$). Hartshorne Conjecture: If $X\subseteq\mathbb{P}^N$ is a smooth variety of dimension $n$, codimesnion $c$ and $c\geq 2n+1$ then $X$ is a scheme-theoretic complete intersection. Hartshorne Conjecture has been proven for Fano varieties of codimension two and quadratic varieties (i.e. varieties that can be defined just by quadratic polynomials). Thanks to Barth’s result: Barth, W.: ”Transplanting cohomology classes in complex-projective space”, Amer. J. Math., 92, 951-967 (1970), and since no indecomposable rank two vector bundle on $\mathbb{P}^N$, $N\geq 5$, is known, it is generally believed that any smooth, codimension two subvariety of $\mathbb{P}^N$, $N \geq 6$, is a complete intersection. The main results for codimension two subvarieties can be summarized as follows: let $\omega_X\cong \mathcal{O}_X(e)$, $d$ the degree of $X$ and $s$ the minimal degree of an hypersurface containing $X$. if $e \leq N + 1$ or if $d < (N − 1)(N + 5)$ or if $s \leq N − 2$, then $X$ is a complet intersection. For $N = 5,6$ we can something more: let $X \subset \mathbb{P}^6$ be a smooth, codimension two subvariety, if $s\leq 5$ or if $d \leq 73$, then $X$ is a complete intersection. Let $X \subset \mathbb{P}^5$ be a smooth, subcanonical threefold. If $s \leq 4$, then $X$ is a complete intersection. This is Theorem 1.1 of $URL$ 

My question is whether this weaker version of square is necessary to get a lower bound in terms of large cardinals, or whether there is some large cardinal lower bound on the consistency strength of "square fails everywhere" itself? 

For each weight $w$, we may associate the collection $$I_w = \left\{A \subseteq \omega\ |\ \sum_{n \in A}w(n) < \infty\right\}$$ Then $I_w = P(\omega)$ iff $\sum_{n \in \omega} w(n) < \infty$. If the series is divergent, then $I_w$ is a non-principal ideal extending the ideal $\mathrm{Fin}$ of finite sets, and moreover this ideal is not maximal, i.e. its dual filter is not an ultrafilter. $S_{\infty}(w) = \bigcup _{A \in I_w}S_A$ where $S_A$ is the subgroup of $S_{\infty}$ which fixes $\omega \setminus A$ pointwise, i.e. it's the set of permutations of $A$. The map $(I_w,\subseteq) \to ($subgroups of $S_\infty,\leq)$ defined by $A \mapsto S_A$ is an injective homomorphism of posets. We're essentially interested in the union of the range of this map, but unfortunately this is not equal to the image of the union of the domain of this map. Also note that $(I_w,\subseteq)$ is a lattice and a directed set, as is the range of the above map. If $\lim_{n\to\infty}w(n) = 0$ but $\sum_{n\in\omega}w(n) = \infty$, then there is no partition of $\omega$ into countably many infinite sets $A_n (n \in \omega)$ such that $S_\infty(w)$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of the $S_{A_n}$ in the "obvious" way. That is, $S_\infty(w)$ doesn't consist merely of those permutations which can be expressed as a finite product of elements from finitely many of the $S_{A_n}$. [Proof: For each $n$, pick some $m_n \in A_n$ such that $w(m_n) < 2^{-n}$. Set $A = \{m_n : n \in \omega\}$. Then $S_A \leq S_{\infty}(w)$ but there are elements of $S_A$ which can't be written as a finite product of elements of the $S_{A_n}$.] 

I will just develop a bit the comment by Jason Starr. In these notes $URL$ you can find the following theorem by Keel and Mori: Let $S$ be a scheme and let $\mathcal{X}$ be an Artin stack that is locally of finite presentation over $S$ and has ﬁnite inertia stack $I_S(\mathcal{X})$. There exists a coarse moduli space $\pi:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow X$, such that: 

Perhaps Liaison Theory could be useful to you. Roughly speaking two subschemes $V,W\subset\mathbb{P}^n$ are linked if there is an arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay scheme $X$ such that $X = V\cup W$. In particular they may be linked by a complete intersection $X$. If $V$, and hence $W$, is locally Cohen-Macaulay then $$deg(V)+deg(W) = deg(X).$$ Furthermore one can express the arithmetic genus of $V$ in terms of the arithmetic genera of $W$ and $X$. This theory works for schemes of arbitrary codimension but it is particularly well behaved in codimension two. Assume to have a curve $C\subset\mathbb{P}^n$ which is not a complete intersection but such that there exists an arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve $X\subset\mathbb{P}^n$ with minimal free resolution $$0\mapsto S(-d)\rightarrow E_r\rightarrow E_{r-1}\rightarrow ...\rightarrow E_1\rightarrow I_X\mapsto 0$$ such that $C\cup\Gamma = X$. That is $C$ and $\Gamma$ are linked via $X$. Let $g_1$ and $g_2$ be the arithmetic genera of $C$ and $\Gamma$. Then $$p_a(X)-1-deg(\Gamma)(d-n-1) = g_1-g_2.$$ On the other hand $$p_a(X) = \frac{1}{2}deg(X)(d-n-1)+1.$$ Combining these with $$deg(X)-2deg(\Gamma) = deg(C)-deg(\Gamma)$$ we get $$g_1-g_2 = \frac{1}{2}(d-n-1)(deg(C)-deg(\Gamma)).$$ In particular, if $\deg(C)=deg(\Gamma)$ then $g_1 = g_2$. Assume $X\subset\mathbb{P}^3$ is complete intersection of two surfaces of degree $d_1,d_2$. Then we get $$g_1-g_2 = \frac{1}{2}(d_1+d_2-4)(deg(C)-deg(\Gamma)).$$ An easy example: take a twisted cibic $C\subset\mathbb{P}^4$ and two quadrics $Q_1,Q_2$ containing $C$. Then $C\cup L = X =Q_1\cap Q_2$. The residual curve $L$ is a line. Furthermore we know that $p_a(X) = 1$. From the formula we get $g_1-0 = \frac{1}{2}(4-3-1)(3-1) = 0$. Another example: Let $C\subset\mathbb{P}^3$ be a smooth curve of degree $5$. Then $C$ is contained in a unique quadric surface $Q$. Take a cubic surface $S$ containing $C$. Then $C\cup L = Q\cap S = X$. We have $deg(X) = 6$ and $p_a(X) = 4$. Therefore $g_1 = \frac{1}{2}(2+3-4)(5-1) = 2$ and $C$ is a curve of genus two. In particular it is hyperelliptic.

Does anyone know of generalizations of pcf theory where we might consider products of the form: $$\aleph_1 \times (\aleph_2 \times \aleph_2) \times (\aleph_3 \times \aleph_3 \times \aleph_3) \dots$$ $$(\aleph_1 \times \aleph_2 \times \dots) \times (\aleph_1 \times \aleph_2 \times \dots) \times \dots$$ or, more abstractly: $$P_1 \times P_2 \times P_3 \times \dots$$ where each $P_i$ is a $\mathrm{cof}(P_i)$-directed partial order. My motivation is that I'm interested in what the relationship between $$\max\mathrm{pcf}\langle \aleph_1,\aleph_2,\aleph_2,\aleph_3,\aleph_3,\aleph_3,\dots\rangle$$ and $$\max\mathrm{pcf}\langle\aleph_n\rangle_{0 < n < \omega }$$ might be because it might help me understand the relationship between $$\max \mathrm{pcf} \langle \aleph_n \rangle_{0 < n <\omega }$$ and $$\max \mathrm{pcf} \langle \aleph_{2n} \rangle_{0 < n <\omega }$$ 

Let $G$ be a $(V,P)$-generic filter containing $q$. We want to show that $G \cap M$ is a filter on $P$ generic over $M$. $G \cap M$ will be countable so it typically won't be closed upwards in $P$, the relevant point is that it's closed upwards in $P \cap M$. So it's not hard to see that it's a filter on $P \cap M$. Next we need to see it's generic over $M$. Let $A \in M$ be a maximal antichain in $P$. Let $p$ be the sole element of $A \cap G$. Let $r$ extend both $p$ and $q$, which is possible because they're both in $G$ and $G$'s a filter. By (i), $A \cap M$ is predense below $q$, and $r \leq q$, so there's some $p' \in A \cap M$ compatible with $r$. But since $A$ is a maximal antichain, there's precisely one element of $A$ compatible with $r$, and we already know $p \in A$ is compatible with $r$ (in fact it's above $r$), so $p' = p$. Therefore $p \in A \cap G \cap M$, meaning $G \cap M$ meets $A$. Since $A$ was arbitrary, $G \cap M$ meets every maximal antichain belonging to $M$, hence it's generic over $M$. Just as genericity of a filter can be defined in terms of dense sets, open dense sets, predense sets, or maximal antichains, it can so be done for genericity of a condition. See Lemma 1.2 in my notes below; it gives three equivalent conditions for $(M,P)$-genericity. The first and third are just like your (i) and (ii) but with antichains replaced with dense sets. The second one is also in terms of dense sets but slightly different from your (i) and (ii), and it's another useful way of looking at $(M,P)$-genericity. $URL$ 

One way to prove this is to show that for each closed point $x\in X$ the differential $T_\pi(x):T_xX\rightarrow T_{\pi(x)}Y$ is surjective, that is $\pi$ is a smooth morphism. Let $\pi:X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism or relative dimension $r$ of smooth varieties over an algebraically closed field. Assume that the relative cotangent sheaf $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is locally free of rank $r$ on $X$. We have an exact sequence $$\pi^{*}\Omega_{Y}\rightarrow\Omega_{X}\rightarrow\Omega_{X/Y}\mapsto 0.$$ Let $k(x)$ be the residue field at a closed point $x$. Tensorizing we get $$\pi^{*}\Omega_{Y}\otimes k(x)\rightarrow\Omega_{X}\otimes k(x)\rightarrow\Omega_{X/Y}\otimes k(x)\mapsto 0.$$ Since $X$ and $Y$ are smooth and $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is locally free of rank $r$ these three vector spaces are of dimension $dim(Y),dim(X),r$ respectively. So the first map is injective and we have $$0\mapsto\pi^{*}\Omega_{Y}\otimes k(x)\rightarrow\Omega_{X}\otimes k(x)\rightarrow\Omega_{X/Y}\otimes k(x)\mapsto 0.$$ For any closed point $x\in X$ we have $k(x)\cong k$. Therefore we can identify the injective map $\pi^{*}\Omega_{Y}\otimes k\rightarrow\Omega_{X}\otimes k$ with the map between the cotangent spaces $\mathfrak{m}_y/\mathfrak{m}^2_y\rightarrow\mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}^2_x$ where $y = \pi(x)$. Dualizing we have that the differential $T_\pi(x):T_xX\rightarrow T_yY$ is surjective. Therefore $\pi$ is a smooth morphism. In particular, if any fiber of $\pi$ is just one point, then $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is locally free of rank $r = 0$ and $\pi$ is a smooth morphism of relative dimension zero. Finally, since $\pi$ is surjective it is an isomorphism. 

I'm re-reading a paper of Stevo Todorcevic's entitled "Localized Reflection and Fragments of PFA" and there's a claim in the proof of one of the lemmas that I thought I understood but now I'm not so sure. The claim is this: 

For $\kappa = \omega$ the above holds, it is a theorem due to M. Pouzet. The proof hinges on the following fact: 

Then, since $D$ is a directed subset of $j^{\ast}(C)$, elementarity will give us that $j''\lambda \in j^{\ast}(C)$, as desired. Since $M^{\lambda} \subset M$, we know that $g := j\upharpoonright \lambda \in M$. So for $x \in X$ (and in particular for $x \in C$), $j^{\ast}(x) = j''x = g''x$. Using this it's not hard to see that $\bigcup D = j''\lambda$. It also implies that $j^{\ast}$ $''X$ $= \{j^{\ast}(x)\ |\ x \in X\}$ $= \{j''x\ |\ x \in X\} = \{g''x\ |\ x \in X\}$ belongs to $M$. Now if $h : X \to C$ is a surjection in $V[G]$, then $j^{\ast}(h)\upharpoonright j^{\ast}$ $''X$ is belongs to $M[G\times H]$ and its range is $D$, so $D \in M[G\times H]$. It remains to show $M[G\times H] \vDash |D| < j(\kappa)$. Since $j(\kappa)$ is inaccessible in $M$, there's some bijection $i: \alpha \to Y$ in $M$ for some $\alpha < j(\kappa)$. This gives a surjection $k : \alpha \to X$ in $M[G\times H]$. We can obtain a bijection $l : X \to j^{\ast}$ $''X$ via $l(x) = g''x$. And $j^{\ast}(h)\upharpoonright j^{\ast}$ $''X$ is a surjection onto $D$. So: $M[G\times H] \vDash |D| \leq |j^{\ast}$ $''X| = |X| \leq \alpha < j(\kappa)$. 

The stack $\overline{\mathcal{P}}_{g}$ of Prym curves is a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack. This implies that its coarse moduli space $\overline{P}_{g}$ is normal with at most fine quotient singularities.

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a finite morphism between normal varieties. Let $E$ be a vector bundle on $X$ and let us consider its pushforwad $f_{*}E$. Does anyone know an example where $E$ is nef but $f_{*}E$ is not nef ? 

Let $X$ be a normal $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial variety, and let $f:Y\rightarrow X$ be a resolution. Then we can write $$K_Y = f^{*}K_X+\sum a(E_i,X)E_i,$$ where the $E_i$'s are $f$-exceptional divisor. If $f$ is small then the contracted locus is in codimension at least two. That is there is no $E_i$, and $K_Y = f^{*}K_X$. Alternatively, one can consider the open immersion $i:X_{reg}\rightarrow X$, and define $\omega_{X}:=i_*\omega_{X_{reg}}$. Note that $\omega_{X} = \mathcal{O}_{X}(K_{X})$. Furthermore, if $X$ is be a projective variety and $U=X∖Z$ is an open subset, $\mathcal{F}$ is a torsion-free coherent sheaf on $U$, $Z$ has codimension greater or equal that two, and $X$ is normal. Then $i_{*}\mathcal{F}$ is a coherent sheaf on $X$, where $i:U\rightarrow X$ is the inclusion. You can find this theorem here: J. P. Serre, "Prolongement de faisceaux analytiques cohérents", Ann.Inst.Fourier 16, 363-374. Therefore $\omega_{X}:=i_*\omega_{X_{reg}}$ is a coherent sheaf on $X$. Now, let $f:Y\rightarrow X$ be a small resolution. Then $f^{*}\omega_{X}$ is a coherent sheaf on $Y$. Let $V\subset Y$ be the open subset where $f$ is an isomorphism. Then $\omega_{Y|V}\cong (f^{*}\omega_{X})_{|V}$. Now, $\omega_{Y}$ and $f^{*}\omega_{X}$ are coherent sheaves on a smooth variety which are isomorphic outside of a closed subset of codimension at least two. Therefore $\omega_{Y}\cong f^{*}\omega_{X}$. 

EDIT: At the bottom, I'll explain how, if you have a ring $R$ and a subset $A$ of $R$, how you can construct a theory such that any model of that theory contains a copy of $R$ such that the copies of elements of $A$ are units. First, let me comment on a couple issues with the approach you're taking. Then I'll try to resolve these issues by answering your question, but since I'm not 100% sure what your question is I'll give two answers. Some technical issues: The formula $\exists x, x = x$ doesn't say anything, it just says "there's something which is equal to itself," which essentially just says "there is something." Furthermore, this formula is only well-formed when $x$, is a variable, it doesn't make sense to say it when you're picking $x$ to be some element of your ring, it would be like saying $\exists 4, 4 = 4$. Also, this formula doesn't depend on $x$ the way I think you expect it to. The formulas $\exists x, x = x$ and $\exists y, y = y$ are essentially the same, much like how $\int f(x) dx$ and $\int f(y) dy$ are the same. I understand what you're trying to do with your theory $T_x$ (or $T_f$ in the comments), it's supposed to be a theory such that any model has an inverse for all the $x \in A \setminus${$0$}. The theory you've constructed won't work for various reasons, some of which can be fixed and some can't. One problem is there's nothing to ensure that a model of $T_x$ has a copy of your original $M$, but this can be fixed. Another problem is that there's no guarantee that $T_x$ has a model at all. Or rather, there is a guarantee, and that guarantee comes from the already known fact in commutative ring theory that localizations exists, but model theory is not doing any work for you here. Similarly, model theory does nothing to guarantee that any resulting model will satisfy the desired universal property. Now here's how we might try to salvage your approach, and use model theory to "construct" the localization. I won't go into full detail here since I'm not sure this is what you want to know, but if you want more details just ask and I'll edit my post accordingly (edit: I've added some details at the end). The vague outline is this: Forget the universal property for now. Pick an appropriate signature, and theory in this signature, such that a model of this theory would give you the desired object - in this case a commutative ring $N$ into which $M$ embeds such that the image of $A$ under this embedding is contained in the set of units of $N$. Then, show that every finite subset of this theory has a model, which will essentially amount to showing that you can produce a localization (minus the universal property) for any finite subset of $A$. At this point, the Compactness Theorem will give a model of your entire theory, and you'll have your $N$ (and implicitly, your embedding). There's a couple problems here. First, how would you tackle the stage where you need to be able to show that you can produce a localization (minus the univ. prop.) for finite subsets of $A$? I would use one of the standard ring-theoretic proofs of the existence of the localization. But these proofs are sufficiently general that it's just as easy to apply them to the whole of $A$ as it is to apply them to any finite subset of $A$. In other words, if you're going to have to use a ring-theoretic proof of the existence of localizations at some point in a model-theoretic construction of the localization, why do any of the model theory in the first place and apply your ring-theoretic proof directly to $A$? More crucially, we have a problem with the universal property. There's no way to express the universal property in first-order language in such a way that the result of applying the Compactness Theorem has the desired universal property. If we are working in a much richer structure (e.g. a model of ZFC) where we can talk about rings and the elements of rings both as objects in our universe, then we can express, in a first-order way, that $N$ is the localization $A^{-1}M$, including saying everything we need to about the universal property. This is just an instance of the fact that most math can be expressed in ZFC. But if we're trying to do something like in the previous paragraph, where we use model theory, especially Compactness, to produce a localization, then we want to work in the language of rings. In this case, our universe has to pretty much be just a ring, thus its elements will be objects of a ring, and so we don't have as objects all rings, and all morphisms between rings, etc, i.e. we don't have enough expressive power to talk about the universal property. And since we can't express the universal property, applying Compactness has no way of guaranteeing us that the resulting object satisfies the universal property. So to summarize, if you're trying to construct the localization using model theory, you can get all of it except the universal property, but even then, in order to get it you have to make heavy use of ring theory to the point that the model theory isn't doing any of the work for you. If you merely want to express or axiomatize what it means for something to be the localization of something else, it depends on how rich a structure you want to work in. If you want to work in ZFC, of course you can express pretty much everything. If you want to work in the language of rings, you can express everything except the universal property (and again, I can give details of this if you'd like). EDIT: Consider the following signature: $\sigma = (0, 1, +, \times, c_r (r\in R))$ Here, $0, 1$ and each $c_r$ are constant symbols, and the other two symbols are binary function symbols. Let $\mathrm{diag}^+(R, 0, 1, +, \times)$, the so-called positive diagram of $R$, consist of all true atomic formulas in the structure $(R, 0, 1, +, \times, r (r\in R))$ regarded as a $\sigma$-structure. Now consider the $\sigma$ theory which is the union of the following theories: 

Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an algebraic stack over $k$. A coarse moduli space for $\mathcal{X}$ over $k$ is a morphism $\pi:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow X$, where $X$ is a scheme such that: 

$X$ is a Mori Dream Space, i.e. $Cox(X)$ is finitely generated. Indeed $X$ is a toric variety if and only if $X$ is a Mori Dream Space and $Cox(X)$ is a polynomial ring. $X$ is log Fano, in particular $-K_X$ is big and movable. Any nef divisor is semiample. 

Note that a conic bundle is rationally connected. It is still an open problem to establish if rational connectedness and unirationality are equivalent notions or not. An example of a non unirational conic bundle would be a counterexample. On the other hand the unirationality of conic bundle is an important open problem as well. There some partial results, under some hypothesis on the discriminant here $URL$ Here is an example of a morphism with rational target and rational fiber. Let $π : X\rightarrow \mathbb{F}_e$ be a standard $3$-fold conic bundle. Let $\Delta$ be the discriminant curve. Assume that $\Delta \sim aC_0 + bF$, with $3 < a \leq 7$, then $X$ is unirational but not rational. This is Corollary $1.3$ in $URL$ 

Consider the tree of finite partial attempts to build a well-ordering, and notice that it has size continuum. More rigorously, let: $$T = \{ f : n \to \omega\ |\ n \in \omega, f \mbox{ injective } \}$$ ordered by extension. This is clearly an $\omega$ branching tree of height $\omega$, and its branches are precisely the injections $\omega \to \omega$. But we're interested in the set of well-orderings of $\omega$. Now, those injections which are bijections give us distinct well-orderings, but perhaps there are too few of them. What about the branches that aren't surjections? We can create distinct well-orderings out of them too: if a branch $b$ is not surjective and $X$ is the set of naturals missed by its range, consider the well-ordering obtained by taking $b$, then concatenating on to its end the numbers in $X$, ordered naturally. So the branches of our tree are in bijection with a set of well-orderings of $\omega$, and there are continuum many branches, so there are continuum many well-orderings. Note that the set of well-orderings we get is not even the set of all well-orderings. In particular every well-ordering we get has order type $\leq \omega + \omega$. 

Let $Y$ be a rationally connected variety over an algebraically closed field, and let $$\phi:X\dashrightarrow Y$$ be a rational fibration such that the general fiber of $\phi$ is rationally chain connected. Is it true that $X$ is rationally chain connected? If we assume that the general fiber of $\phi$ is smooth and rationally connected can we conclude that $X$ is rationally connected? 

you might think of this in a more differential way. Take a general point $y\in Y$ and let $x\in f^{-1}(y)$ be general on the fiber. Then $x$ is a smooth point of both $X$ and $f^{-1}(y)$. Consider the differential $df_{x}:T_{x}X\rightarrow T_{y}X$. Now $T_{x}f^{-1}(y) = Ker (df_{x})$, and the result follows just by the dimension theorem in linear algebra and by semicontinuity. 

You gave the definition of normal crossing divisor. The definition of simple normal crossing is the following. A Weil divisor $D = \sum_{i}D_i \subset X$ on a smooth variety $X$ of dimension $n$ is simple normal crossing if any component $D_i$ is smooth and for every point $p \in X$ a local equation of $D$ is $x_1\cdot...\cdot x_r$ for independent local parameters $x_i$ in $O_{p,X}$ with $r\leq n$. What goes wrong in the case of three line passing through the same point in $\mathbb{P}^2$ is that you need three local parameters in a neighborhood of $p$ and $3 > 2$. The same for the cusp. More generally, let $D = \sum H_i\subset\mathbb{P}^n$ be a reduced divisor, where the $H_i$'s are hyperplanes. Consider the points $h_i\in\mathbb{P}^{n*}$ dual the the $H_i$'s. Then $D$ is simple normal crossing if and only if the $h_i$'s are in linear general position in $\mathbb{P}^{n*}$. You see that three lines through the same point in $\mathbb{P}^2$ correspond to three points on the same line in $\mathbb{P}^{2*}$. Therefore this case does not work. More generally for a curve $C$ on a surface simple normal crossing means any irreducible component is smooth and $C$ as at most nodes as singularities.
