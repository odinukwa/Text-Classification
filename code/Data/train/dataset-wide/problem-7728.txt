Let $L$ be a dihedral extension of the rationals with degree $2\ell$ (where $\ell$ is an odd prime number), $k$ its quadratic subextension and $K$ one of the conjugate fields of degree $\ell$. I will only consider the case where $k$ is complex, as it already shows that the whole thing is far from being trivial. Let $\tau$ be complex conjugation and $\sigma$ an automorphism of order $\ell$; then $\tau\sigma\tau = \sigma^{-1}$. It is known that the conductor of the cyclic extension $L/k$ is an integer $f$ [Martinet, Sur l'arithmétique des extensions galoisiennes à groupe de Galois diédral d'ordre $2p$, Ann. Inst. Fourier 19 (1969), 1-80; Sect. IV] and that prime number $p$ dividing $f$ satisfy $p \equiv (\Delta/p) \bmod \ell$, where $\Delta$ is the discriminant of $k$. We now distinguish three cases. 

The quadratic number field $k = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-39})$ has a cyclic class group of order $4$. Its genus field is $K = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-3},\sqrt{13})$, which has class number $2$. The Hilbert class field of $K$ is dihedral over ${\mathbb Q}$, hence not contained in the cyclotomic field $L = {\mathbb Q}(\zeta_{39})$. This already shows that the class number of $L$ is even. Now verify that one of the prime ideals above $13$ in $K$ is not principal (obvious since its norm down to $k$ is not principal) and that it ramifies completely in $L/K$. 

Eisenstein defined elliptic functions by working with conditionally convergent series. In particular he studied how a series changes when you rearrange the terms in a specific way. You can find a lot about his work in this direction in Weil's beautiful book Elliptic Functions according to Eisenstein and Kronecker. An analogous question would be what happens to your product formula when you use a different way of pairing positive and negative indices. I do not know whether this has been studied before . . . A look into Weil's book will convince you (if you didn't know that already) that some functions are most interesting at those places where convergence fails. 

Since your interest is in deformation theory I would advise you to have a look at "Introduction to singularities and deformations" by Greul, Lossen and Shushtin. The first part of the book treats complex analytic geometry (complex space germs) and the second their deformation theory. There's also a survey paper by Palamodov "Deformations of complex spaces" in Encyclopedia of Mathematics (Springer) which treats some foundational material as well. Good luck! 

I'm interested in covers of modular curves (especially cyclic covers) and I'm sure there's a lot of information out there available on this topic. However, I'm unable to locate any literature (on Google or MathSciNet). Anyone has any references? Edit: In response to the comment below, I'm particularly interested in the local properties of the cover. For example, how, if at all, Heegner points or supersingular points, translate into properties of the fibers over these points. 

Let $M$ be an algebraic family of isocrystals over a base scheme $R/\mathbb{Q}_p$ (not a rigid analytic space). The question is: is the set of weakly admissible points (i.e., the points $r\in R$ over which $M$ is weakly admissible) Zariski closed or open (or neither)? The answer might be very simple and/or well-known, but I haven't been able to figure it out. Thanks for any help! 

I'm a bit confused concerning tamely ramified covers of arithmetic schemes. I guess they would reduce to tamely ramified extensions of number fields, but they don't seem to do so. Let me elaborate: First of all, let me recall the standard definition of tamely ramified covers of arithmetic schemes (by which we mean connected, flat, regular schemes of finite type over a Dedekind domain, or $\mathbb{Z}$ if someone prefer this). Let $D$ be a divisor on $S$ of an arithmetic cover $X\to S=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$, where $A$ is a Dedekind domain. Then $X\to S$ is said to be tamely ramified along $D$ if $X\times_S (S\setminus D)\to (S\setminus D)$ is finite and étale and tamely ramified along $D$. Now, $X$ being connected and étale over $S\setminus D$ means that it is actually a $G:=\mathrm{Aut}_S(X)$-torsor (see Milne, Étale cohomology, page 40), that is, a Galois cover. Since being a $G$-torsor implies that $G$ acts freely and transitively on the fibers, the number of closed points in the fiber is equal to the order of the group $G$. But this means that the fibers all have the same number of points over $S\setminus D$. Ok, so far so good. Restricting to rings of integers in Galois number fields is where my problem begins. So, let $X=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathfrak{o}_L)\to S=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathfrak{o}_K)$ be a cover of the associated arithmetic schemes to $L/K$. In this case, a divisor $D$ is a $\mathit{finite}$ sum $\sum_\mathfrak{p} a_\mathfrak{p} \mathfrak{p}$, $a_i\in \mathbb{Z}$. So $X\to S$ being tamely ramified along $D$ means that $L/K$ is at most tamely ramified at the primes in $D$. Outside $D$, the primes can be unramified, inert and completely split (in $L$). $\mathit{However}$, the only possibility, comparing with tamely ramified coverings of arithmetic schemes is that $\mathfrak{p}\in S\setminus D$ is completely split, but there are infinitely many unramified and inert primes by the Cebotarev density theorem. What the heck am I missing? 

In Nowak (1989), a modular $\rho$ on a vector lattice is defined by the following properties (N1) $\rho(x)=0\implies x=0$; (N2) $\lvert x\rvert \le \lvert y\rvert\implies \rho(x) \le \rho(y)$; (N3) $\rho(x\vee y )\le \rho(x)+\rho(y)$ for all $x\ge 0, y\ge 0$; (N4) $\rho(\lambda x)\to 0$ if $\lambda \to 0$ This supposedly implies $$ \rho(\alpha x+\beta y)\le \rho( x)+\rho(y) \text{ for all } \alpha,\beta\ge0,\alpha+\beta=1,$$ which features in the definition of modular in Musielak and Orlicz (1959). I don't see how this follows. NB: convexity is not assumed. 

To begin with, if we stick to semimartingales, one assumes these have right-continuous paths with left limits. Correspondingly, if $X_-$ denotes the process whose values are these left limits (so necessarily $X_-$ is predictable) one may define a new semimartingale by setting $\Delta X := X-X_-$. Note that $X_-$ itself may not be a semimartingale because it is no longer necessarily right-continuous. To get back to your question, if $X$ and $X_-$ are different from zero then one may define a new process, typically denoted $\mathscr{L}(X)$ and called stochastic logarithm, by setting $$\mathscr{L}(X)_t:=\int_0^t \frac{1}{X_{s-}}dX_s.$$ For this process one has the equality $$\Delta \mathscr{L}(X) = \frac{\Delta X}{X_-},$$ which formally resembles your expression if you identify $t+\Delta t$ with $t$ and change $t$ to $t-$. This definitely works in one dimension. I suppose that if the object $X_-^{-1}$ is a well-defined locally bounded matrix-valued process the same operation (stochastic logarithm) can be performed in higher dimension. In such case standard multivariate Ito lemma would be applicable to functions of $X$. 

I feel that I more or less agree with everything that has been said so far (so in a sense I don't know why write this), but personally, I find it really annoying when the type-setting and grammar are really really poor in a paper that I've accepted refereeing (maybe I shouldn't have accepted then you might say). If the authors haven't spent the effort making the paper readable and pleasing to the eye it all looks so sloppy and that doesn't inspire confidence in the paper. I know this is wrong of me, but that's the way I feel. In practice though (this has happened more than once) I try my very best to give the paper a fair and unbiased review and I also indicate in my report most of the typos and grammatical errors I find, even if this is somewhat pedantic. I feel that my job as a referee is also to make the paper readable to others, in addition to error-spotting. 

Oh, there are many papers recently devoted to $N$-complexes, in particular in connection with theoretical physics. A lot of these papers have simplicial stuff in it. I don't have access to MathSciNet now so some of my suggestions you have to look up yourself as I sometimes don't know the exact titles. Here goes: 

I'm looking for examples of explicit actions of the infinitesimal group schemes $\alpha_{p^n}$ on schemes (maybe as simple as the affine plane) in characteristic $p$ or mixed characteristic, and their associated quotients. Tried googling but I couldn't find any explicit examples. Any such or references would be much appreciated.
