Yes, that statement is independent of the axioms of set theory. Let $X$ be a compact strong S-space, that is a compact space such that $X^n$ is hereditarily separable but not hereditarily Lindelof for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (De La Vega and Kunen constructed a homogeneous space with these features in $URL$ If $C_p(X)$ contained an uncountable discrete set, this would yield an uncountable discrete set in $X^n$ for some $n$. But this is impossible, because every subspace of $X^n$ is separable. Now, $X$ is not metrizable, because separable metrizable spaces have a countable base, and hence are hereditarily Lindelof. EDIT: It remains to prove that if $C_p(X)$ contains an uncountable discrete set then some finite power of $X$ also does. I believe this is due to Tkachuk. Let $D=\{f_\alpha: \alpha <\omega_1\}$ be a discrete set in $C_p(X)$ of size $\omega_1$. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a countable base for $\mathbb{R}$. Since $D$ is discrete, for every $\alpha < \omega_1$, we can find a positive integer $n_\alpha$, a sequence $(x^\alpha_1, \dots x^\alpha_{n_\alpha})$ of elements of $X$ and a sequence $(B^\alpha_1, \dots B^\alpha_{n_\alpha})$ of elements of $\mathcal{B}$ such that $[x^\alpha_1, \dots x^\alpha_{n_\alpha}, B^\alpha_1, \dots, B^\alpha_{n_\alpha}] \cap D=\{f_\alpha\}$, where $[x_1, \dots x_n, B_1, \dots B_n]$ denotes the following basic open subset of $C_p(X)$: $\{f \in C_p(X): (\forall i \leq n)(f(x_i) \in B_i)\}$. By the pigeonhole principle, we can find an uncountable set $E \subset \omega_1$, a positive integer $n$ and a finite sequence $(B_1, \dots B_n)$ of elements of $\mathcal{B}$ such that $n_\alpha=n$ and $(B^\alpha_1, \dots B^\alpha_{n_\alpha})=(B_1, \dots B_n)$, for every $\alpha \in E$. We claim that $S=\{(x^\alpha_1, \dots, x^\alpha_n): \alpha \in E \}$ is a discrete subset of $X^n$. Indeed, by definition of the $B_i$s and the $x^\beta_i$s, we have that $f_\beta$ is the only element of $D$ such that $f_\beta(x^\beta_i) \in B_i$ for every $i \leq n$. But this implies that the open set $\prod_{i=1}^n f_\alpha^{-1}(B_i)$ intersects $S$ in the single point $(x^\alpha_1, \dots x^\alpha_n)$, and hence $S$ is discrete in $X^n$. 

Since $E^u, E^s$ are equivariant, the projections of $df_x (u + v)$ according to $E^u_{f x}, E^s_{fx}$ are exactly $df_x u$ and $df_x v$, respectively. So, $$ \frac{\| df_x v \|}{ \|df_x u\|} \leq \frac{\| df_x|_{E^s_x}\|}{m( df_x|_{E^u_x})} \frac{\|v\|}{\|u\|} \, , $$ where $m(A) = \min \{ \| A v \| : \| v\| =1\} = \| A^{-1} \|^{-1}$ is the minimal norm of a linear operator. The desired cone membership follows from this estimate. 

No. With $n = r = 2$, set $$X = \bigg(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \bigg) \, , \quad V = \bigg( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \bigg) \, .$$ In particular, $X^T V = V^T X = 0$, the zero matrix. If you restrict to invertible square matrices, the statement is still false. Set $$X = \bigg(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \epsilon \end{array} \bigg) \, , \quad V = \bigg( \begin{array}{cc} \epsilon & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \bigg) \, .$$ Then $X^T V = V^T X = \epsilon \operatorname{Id}$ and $\operatorname{Tr}(X^T V) = 2 \epsilon$. So, your LHS is $$ 2 \| \epsilon \operatorname{Id}\|_F^2 + (\operatorname{Tr}(\epsilon \operatorname{Id}))^2 = 8 \epsilon^2 \, , $$ which can be made arbitrarily small, while your RHS is $$ c \| X \|_F^2 \| V \|_F^2 = c (1 + \epsilon^2)^2 \geq c $$ The moral of the story is that the matrix norm is submultiplicative (not the Frobenius norm as above, but bear with me) in the sense that $\| X V \|$ can be arbitrarily smaller than $\| X \| \| V \|$. In the end, your constant $c$ depends either on how $X, V$ map each others singular value spaces to each other, or on some lower bound on the lowest singular value for either $X$ or $V$. 

Call a family $\mathcal{F}$ of infinite subsets of a countable set strongly centered if every finite subfamily of $\mathcal{F}$ has infinite intersection. We say that a set $S$ is a pseudointersection of the family $\mathcal{F}$ if $S \setminus F$ is finite for every $F \in \mathcal{F}$. Now $$\mathfrak{p}:=\min \{|\mathcal{F}|: \mathcal{F} \mbox{ is a strongly centered family without an infinite pseudointersection} \}$$ Since $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of subsets of a countable set we have $\mathfrak{p} \leq \mathfrak{c}$. Moreover, you can cook up an infinite pseudointersection of a given countable family of infinite subsets of a countable set by an easy diagonalization, so $\mathfrak{p} \geq \omega_1$. It is known that $\mathfrak{p}>\omega_1$ is consistent. For example, under Martin's Axiom we have $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{c}$, and hence it suffices to take a model of Martin's Axiom plus the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis. 

Background/Motivation A space is scattered if every non-empty subset has an isolated point. A space is pseudoradial if every non-closed set contains a transfinite sequence (a well-ordered net) converging outside of it. A classical result of Mrowka, Rajagopalan and Soundararajan from "A characterization of compact scattered spaces through chain limits (chain compact spaces)" provides a surprising link between these two notions. 

A wonderful mistake, which paved the way to singular cardinals, was done by Felix Bernstein in his dissertation. I learnt this from Menachem Kojman. Berstein thought he had proved that for every ordinal $\alpha$, $\aleph_\alpha^\omega=\aleph_\alpha \cdot 2^{\aleph_0}$. This is true for every $\alpha < \omega$ but already fails for $\alpha=\omega$. Berstein's mistake was to assume that every cardinal has an immediate predecessor. Kőnig later used Berstein's result to prove that the continuum is not an aleph, thus disproving at once two of Cantor's main beliefs: 1) every set can be well-ordered and 2) the continuum hypothesis! He presented his result at the third International Congress of Mathematicians in Heidelberg in 1904 and the organizers cancelled all parallel session to allow all participants (which included Cantor and Hilbert) to attend Kőnig's lecture. And his discovery was even reported in the local news! Here is Kőnig's reasoning: First he proves the correct result that for every ordinal $\beta$, $\aleph_{\beta+\omega}^\omega>\aleph_{\beta+\omega}$ (a special case of what is now known as Kőnig's Theorem). He then reasons that if the continuum were an aleph, say $2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_\beta$, then substituting $\alpha=\beta+\omega$ into Berstein's result one obtains that $\aleph_{\beta+\omega}^\omega=\aleph_{\beta+\omega} \cdot 2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_{\beta+\omega}$, which is a contradiction! 

Well, now there is a great textbook for Sasaki-Einstein geometry, by Boyer-Galicki: Here is a link to the book at Oxford University Press I would definitely start there. 

Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional real vector space with an inner product $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle$. Then $\Lambda^k (V)$, the $k^{\text{th}}$ exterior product of $V$, inherits an induced inner product defined as follows. If $\alpha = v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_k$ and $\beta = w_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge w_k$, then $\langle \alpha , \beta \rangle = \det \langle v_i , w_j \rangle$ on decomposable vectors, and then extend by linearity to all of $\Lambda^k(V)$. Now a $k$-dimensional subspace $P$ of $V$ can be represented by a decomposable element $\alpha_P = v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_k$ of $\Lambda^k(V)$, where $v_1, \ldots, v_k$ is a basis for $P$. If the basis is taken to be oriented and orthonormal, then the element $\alpha_P$ is uniquely determined. (Otherwise it is only determined up to a non-zero real scalar, so in general it defines a point in the projectivization $\mathbb P (\Lambda^k(V))$. Since this is a real inner product on a finite-dimensional vector space, it does indeed give you a measure of "how far" two vectors are from being parallel, or in this case, how far two $k$-dimensional subspaces are from being the same. If $k = 2$ and $a_1, a_2$ and $b_1, b_2$ are two oriented orthonormal bases for two planes $P_a$ and $P_b$ in $V$, then $$ \langle P_a, P_b \rangle = \det{\langle a_i, b_j \rangle} = \langle a_1, b_1 \rangle \langle a_2, b_2 \rangle - \langle a_1, b_2 \rangle \langle a_2, b_1 \rangle. $$ You can search for "induced inner product on exterior algebra" or look at any book on differential forms for more details. 

Let $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a convex body, symmetric about the origin and with nonempty interior. Then John's theorem asserts that there exists a unique ellipsoid $E$ of minimal volume such that $K \subset E$. My question: let $K, K'$ be two such convex sets (that is, symmetric with nonempty interior), and apply John's theorem to get the John's ellipsoids $E, E'$ respectively. Suppose that $K \subset K'$. Is it true, then, that $E \subset E'$? I have been concerned with how John's ellipsoid varies as you vary the convex set $K$, in particular how the gauge function of $E$ varies. Suppose my claim is true: then it would follow that for any two convex bodies $K_1, K_2$ (again, symmetric about the origin and with nonempty interior) with John's ellipsoids $E_1, E_2$, we'd have $$ \sup_{v \in \mathbb{R}^d} \left| 1 - \frac{n_{E_1}(v)}{n_{E_2}(v)} \right| \leq \sup_{v \in \mathbb{R}^d} \left| 1 - \frac{n_{K_1}(v)}{n_{K_2}(v)} \right| $$ where $n_K$ is the gauge function of a convex body $K$. 

This is not a precise argument, but rather a conceptual reason why you shouldn't expect stable manifolds to sit inside global attractors (even for ODE on $\mathbb R^n$). By definition, all trajectories are attracted to the global attractor in forwards time. What distinguishes points in the attractor from points outside has to do with behavior in backwards time: the attractor is precisely what remains in the limit when you take $t \to - \infty$. This is, morally speaking, the content of Theorem 10.7 in Robinson's book.(*) On the other hand, the stable manifold through a point $x$ in the attractor is determined solely by future behavior. So, points on $W^s_x$ get very close to the attractor in forwards time. But this does not "single out" points of $W^s$ for membership in the attractor. (*) The concept of isolating neighborhood of an attractor formalizes this idea (for continuous systems on compact spaces, and also to some extent for dissipative systems on non-locally-compact spaces-- a common reference is Rybakowski).
