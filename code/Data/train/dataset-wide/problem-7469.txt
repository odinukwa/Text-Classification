Irreducible representations of $GL_n$. Their discovery is usually attributed to Schur in his 1901 dissertation. However, they can be found in the 1891 "Essai d'une théorie générale des formes algébriques" by Deruyts. In fact, they are even older than that since they can also be found in the 1872 acticle "Ueber eine Fundamentalaufgabe der Invariantentheorie" by Clebsch in the super well known journal Abhandlungen der Königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften in Gottingen. A reasonably modern account of Clebsch's contribution is in the article "Invariant Theory, Tensors and Group Characters" by Littlewood. 

If one needs to use tools from classical invariant theory or elimination theory then some books that come to mind are: 

There is also a new method which gets a hold of eigenvectors directly by an iterative diagonalization procedure rather than indirectly via expectations of products of resolvents. It is in the recent article "Multi-Scale Jacobi Method for Anderson Localization" by John Imbrie. I should add that the hot topic in the area now is many-body localization with tons of physics articles posted on the cond-mat section of arXiv. The above article by Imbrie can serve as an introduction to his other one about MBL: "On many-body localization for quantum spin chains" in JSP 2016. 

Some of the best understood conformal field theories are the 2D unitary minimal models $\mathcal{M}(m+1,m)$ indexed by the integer $m\ge 2$ and with central charge $$ c=1-\frac{6}{m(m+1)}\ . $$ I would like to understand the extreme cases $m=2$ and $m=\infty$. According to the article "Conformal symmetry and multicritical points in two-dimensional quantum field theory" by Zamolodchikov in Sov. J. Nucl. Phys. 1986 (the article is also reprinted in this book edited by Itzykson, Saleur and Zuber), these should be scale invariant cases of $\mathcal{P}(\phi)_2$ theories as studied in the constructive quantum field theory literature (e.g., in the classics by Glimm-Jaffe or Simon). In this correspondence, $\mathcal{M}(m+1,m)$ is obtained by perturbing the Gaussian fixed point using a polynomial $\mathcal{P}(\phi)$ which is even, of degree $2m-2$, and with $m-1$ wells. Some of these minimal models have been identified as the scaling limits of specific statistical mechanics models: $m=3$ is the Ising model, $m=4$ is the tri-critical Ising model, $m=5$ is the three-state Potts model. However, almost all references I have seen say nothing about the simplest case $m=2$ which seems too degenerate to be worth mentioning. Q1: Is $m=2$ really that trivial? The multicritical correspondence suggests that this model is obtained by running the RG along a $\lambda\phi^2$ perturbation of the Gaussian fixed point. Equivalently, it would be a large-distance scaling limit of a massive free field with action $\frac{1}{2}\int\{(\partial\phi)^2+\lambda\phi^2$}. If this is the case then this limit should be 2D Gaussian white noise. Q2: 2D Gaussian white noise is conformally invariant by a result of Hida and collaborators. Did anyone compute the central charge and show it is zero? Also, is there a relation between the $m=2$ minimal model and percolation (also with $c=0$) as well as black noise? The other half of my question concerns the $m\rightarrow\infty$ limit. Then the multicritical correspondence suggests the field looks almost $\mathbb{Z}$-valued since the number of potential wells becomes infinite. Q3: is there a good explanation of why this should look more and more like the massless free field with $c=1$? 

Update: A new reference on the Lévy-Fernique continuity theorem for $\mathcal{S}'$ is $URL$ (re MathNovice's comment below: this one is English!) 

I think I know the perfect reference for your particular needs: "Topics in Functional Analysis" by Barry Simon in "Mathematics of Contemporary Physics" edited by R. F. Streater, Academic Press 1972, pp. 17-76. It basically covers the topics you mentioned without going into too much technical detail. 

This is the second fundamental theorem of classical invariant theory for $GL$ acting on vectors and covectors. This is Theorem 8.1 from Ch. 13 of the book Lie Groups: An Approach Through Invariants and Representations by C. Procesi (I still don't have it in front of me but I trust Darij on this). Alternatively, it is Theorem 5.2.15 (SFT for $GL(n)$) in the book Representations and Invariants of the Classical Groups by Goodman and Wallach. I have that one on front of me, the old 1998 edition. The problem is about finding equations for the variety of $n\times m$ matrices $Z$ which factor as $XY$ where $X$ is $n\times k$ and $Y$ is $k\times m$. The condition is that the rank is at most $k$. By elementary linear algebra the $(k+1)\times(k+1)$ minor determinants are set-theoretic equations, however Darij's question is about showing these are also ideal-theoretic equations and that needs a bit more work. 

Edit: I gave a few more details about this particular toy model in this MO answer. Also note that there has been quite a bit of action going on recently in this area since $p$-adics provide a simplified setting in which one can study the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence. See, e.g., Gubser's talk at the Strings 2016 conference. 

Faa di Bruno's formula for derivatives of compositions of functions says $$ (f\circ g)^{(n)}(t)=n!\sum_{k\ge 0}\ \sum_{n_1,\ldots,n_k\ge 1} \mathbf{1}\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i=n\right\} \ \frac{f^{(k)}(g(t))\ g^{(n_1)}(t)\cdots g^{(n_k)}(t)}{k!\ n_1!\cdots n_k!} $$ where $\mathbf{1}\{\cdots\}$ stands for the indicator function of the condition within braces. For $f(x)=e^{-x}$ and $g(t)=\frac{1}{t^2}$, we of course have $f^{(n)}(x)=(-1)^n e^{-x}$ and $g^{(n)}(t)=(-1)^n (n+1)!\ t^{-(n+2)}$ for the derivatives. When $n\ge 1$, we thus get $$ \phi^{(n)}(t)=e^{-t^{-2}} n! \sum_{k\ge 1} \sum_{n_1,\ldots,n_k\ge 1} \mathbf{1}\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i=n\right\} \frac{(-1)^{n+k}t^{-(n+2k)}}{k!} (n_1+1)\cdots (n_k+1) $$ Now use the trivial bound $\frac{x^m}{m!}\le e^x$ for $x=t^{-2}$ (followed by taking the square root) and for $x=\frac{1}{2}t^{-2}$ in order to get $$ t^{-n}\le \sqrt{n!}\ e^{\frac{1}{2}t^{-2}} $$ and $$ t^{-2k}\le 2^k\ k!\ e^{\frac{1}{2}t^{-2}}\ . $$ This results in $$ |\phi^{(n)}(t)|\le n!^{\frac{3}{2}}\times \sum_{k\ge 1}\ \sum_{n_1,\ldots,n_k\ge 1} \mathbf{1}\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i=n\right\} \ 2^k\ (n_1+1)\cdots (n_k+1)\ . $$ By the arithmetico-geometric inequality and the elementary bound $1+x\le e^x$, we have $$ (n_1+1)\cdots (n_k+1)\le \left(\frac{n+k}{k}\right)^k\le e^n\ . $$ Therefore, $$ |\phi^{(n)}(t)|\le n!^{\frac{3}{2}}\ e^n\times \sum_{k\ge 1}\ 2^k\ \sum_{n_1,\ldots,n_k\ge 1}\mathbf{1}\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i=n\right\} $$ $$ =n!^{\frac{3}{2}}\ e^n\times \sum_{k=1}^{n}\ 2^k\ \left( \begin{array}{c} n-1 \\ k-1 \end{array} \right) =2 n!^{\frac{3}{2}} e^n 3^{n-1}\ . $$ So your bound holds with $\rho=3e$. 

It is strange to distinguish the QFT point of view from the mathematics point of view. That's comparing apples to oranges. One can distinguish the physics (non-mathematically rigorous) point of view from that of rigorous mathematics. In this case QFT has overlaps with both. I think the distinction here is between classical sigma models, an example of geometric PDE, and quantum sigma models which involves probability on a space of fields. As Willie Wong covered classical sigma models from the mathematics point of view and José covered quantum sigma models from the physics point of view; let me add some pointers to the literature regarding quantum sigma models from the mathematics point of view. For rigorous work on perturbative (in the sense of formal power series) renormalization of the quantum sigma model, see: 

It seems you may want to turn the large $k$ property to your advantage and use a Laplace-type asymptotic method with controlled bounds. For fixed $d$ you may find some useful tools in the book "Analytic Combinatorics in Several Variables" by Pemantle and Wilson. If also $d$ becomes large, then this starts looking like a problem in statistical field theory. There is a method people used for this kind of thing called the Lipatov argument (see for instance this article by Spencer). 

This is the problem of division of distributions. The general existence theorem is the Malgrange-Ehrenpreis Theorem. The first two volumes of Hörmander's "The Analysis of Linear Partial Differential Operators" is a canonical reference. See also this book by Ortner and Wagner. 

The Aronhold invariant vanishes when the form has border rank $\le 3$, i.e., lies in the Zariski closure of sums of three cubes of linear forms. I don't know how your specific cubic looks like but if you show it is a sum of three cubes that would explain the phenomenon you observed. If you don't immediately see the three linear forms, one way to get them is to compute the Hessian of your cubic and then try to factor it as a product of three linear forms. More precisely, if you can write your cubic $C$ as $C=L_1^3+L_2^3+L_3^3$ then the Hessian of $C$ should be proportional to the product $L_1 L_2 L_3$. So this should help identify these linear forms $L_i$ if they exist. 

According to Dolgachev in $URL$ the ring of invariants is generated by 6 invariants of degrees 6, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 100 the last one being a polynomial in the other ones. In addition to the references to Salmon and Clebsch indicated by Dolgachev, I would also look up the book by Salmon "A treatise on the analytic geometry of three dimensions" pp 392-400. It is downloadable from google books: $URL$ The article $URL$ also contains some references which might help. 

Not an answer to your question but a variant which is perhaps more à propos given that you said you are teaching a rigorous undergrad analysis class. Let $V=\oplus_{\mathbb{N}}\mathbb{R}$ be the space with countable basis which motivated your question. Another way to salvage the isomorphism $V\simeq V^{\ast\ast}$ (without giving up any cherished axiom) is to think of $V$ as equipped with the finest locally convex topology and consider duals as topological duals always given the strong topology. It is easy to see that $V^{\ast}\simeq \prod_{\mathbb{N}}\mathbb{R}$ with the product topology. Although perhaps counterintuitive, when one takes the proper (i.e., strong topological) dual of $\prod_{\mathbb{N}}\mathbb{R}$, then one gets back to $\oplus_{\mathbb{N}}\mathbb{R}$. 

I finally found a book which does exactly what I need: "Probability Distributions on Linear Spaces" by N. N. Vakhania, North-Holland Publishing Co., 1981. Bochner's Theorem is done Section 1.2.2 and the Lévy Continuity Theorem is done in Section 1.2.8 As for the classics on weak convergence of probability measures I found a result in Ethier and Kurtz "Markov Processes, Characterization and Convergence" (1986 edition) which immediately implies the statement in bold. It is Theorem 4.5 on Page 113 together with the easy observation that bounded continuous functions that factor through finite-dimensional projections form a strongly separating set. In fact, although I did not catch that earlier, Billingsley (1999 edition) also has the needed result in Example 2.4 using a similar idea, although, I prefer convergence-determining continuous functions (as in EK) rather than sets (as in B). 

I think the graph studied in my article "16,051 formulas for Ottaviani's invariant of cubic threefolds" with Christian Ikenmeyer and Gordon Royle fits the bill. In the paper we considered a hypergraph on a set $V$ of 15 vertices where the hyperedges are 5-subsets of $V$. Let $G$ be the collinearity graph, namely the obtained by replacing each hyperedge by a complete graph $K_5$. See Section 4 of the article for an explicit description which shows that $\chi(G)=8$ while $\omega(G)=7$. This graph is vertex-critical and I suspect it is not contraction-critical but I did not check this last property. 

In addition to the "canonical" references mentioned above, the book "A Basic Course in Probability Theory" by Bhattacharya and Waymire has a very nice treatment of this topic in Chapter 5. 

The construction of the $\Phi^4_3$ quantum field theory model. This was done in the early seventies by Glimm-Jaffe, Feldman, Feldman-Osterwalder, Magnen-Seneor. This model is related to current research since it should provide the invariant measure for the stochastic quantization SPDE in three spatial dimensions (see e.g the work of Hairer, Catellier-Chouk and Kupiainen). 

This looks like a special case of a formula by Samson Shatashvili related to the HCIZ integral as mentioned in Ryan's answer. Compare, in particular the two ways of computing $\langle 1\rangle$ given by Equations 3.2 and 3.4 in "Correlation Functions in The Itzykson-Zuber Model" (thanks to Leonid Petrov for letting me know about this reference in his answer to this MO question). 

Modern constructive field theory is based on rigorous implementations of the renormalization group (RG) approach. To get an idea of what this is about see this short introductory paper. The RG is an infinite dimensional dynamical system and constructing a QFT essentially means constructing an orbit which typically joins two fixed points. So first you need a fixed point (for instance the massless Gaussian field) and you need it to have an unstable manifold which is not entirely made of Gaussian measures (trivial QFTs). In 4d the only fixed point we have at our disposal is the Gaussian one and at least at the level of perturbation theory one has strong indications that for models like phi-four and even much more complicated generalizations, the corresponding unstable manifold is Gaussian. The only models in 4d known not to suffer from this problem are non-Abelian gauge theories and their construction (in infinite volume) is a difficult question (one of the 7 Clay Millennium Problems). The main technical obstacles for having good candidates to even consider constructing are stability (being in the region of positive coupling constant) and Osterwalder-Schrader positivity. In 4d one should be able to construct a phi-four model with fractional propagator $1/p^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha$ slightly bigger than 2 (the standard propagator). There are partial rigorous results in this direction by Brydges, Dimock and Hurd: "A non-Gaussian fixed point for $\varphi^4$ in $4−\varepsilon$ dimensions". Unfortunately, such a model would most likely not satisfy OS positivity.
