Let $f: X \to S$ be a morphism of algebraic spaces, where $S$ is a scheme. If $f$ is separated and étale then Knutson's criterion says that $X$ is actually a scheme. I have a some closely related questions. 

My knowledge on the subject is pretty poor. For example, I don't even know if $n_0$ is known to exist. Much of the literature seems to be concerned with just rank $2$ vector bundles, and I was struggling to find anything about vector bundles of higher rank. 

Bjorn Poonen and his coauthors have studied topics of this type in a series of papers on "Bertini Theorem over Finite Fields". See for example the paper: Poonen, Charles - Bertini irreducibility theorems over finite fields. $URL$ Edit: I should clarify; this answer addresses the first part of the question, which asks about generalisations of "cardinality of all irreducible polynomials with given degree". 

I have a very naive question concerning Hilbert's irreducilibity theorem over function fields. Let $f: V \to \mathbb{A}^2_\mathbb{Q}$ be a finite morphism, with $V$ an irreducible variety over $\mathbb{Q}$. It is known that the function field $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is Hilbertian. Hence Hilbert's irreducibility theorem implies that there exists a point $x \in \mathbb{A}^2_\mathbb{Q}(\mathbb{Q}(t))$ such that $f^{-1}(x)$ is irreducible. However, it is very possible in the statement of the irreducibility theorem that actually $x \in \mathbb{A}^2_\mathbb{Q}(\mathbb{Q})$; I would like to know that one can choose an $x$ such that this is not the case. 

Here are some definitions and results from the above papers. You may find further information in the mentioned references: Definition. A polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ over the reals $\mathbb{R}$ is $(k, n)$-ary if each $x_i$ is an $n$-tuple of variables. We say that a $(k, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is avoidable if the points of $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be colored with countably many colors such that whenever $a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ are distinct and $p(a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1})=0$, then there are $i < j < k$ such that the points $a_i, a_j$ are differently colored. The polynomial is unavoidable if it is not avoidable. Similarly, for an infinite cardinal $\kappa$, the $(k, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is $\kappa$-avoidable if the points of $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be colored using $\kappa$ colors such that whenever $a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ are distinct and $p(a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1})=0$, then there are $i < j < k$ such that the points $a_i, a_j$ are differently colored. A polynomial is $\kappa$-unavoidable if it is not $\kappa$-avoidable. In fact, $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is avoidable if the chromatic number $\chi (H)$ of its zero hypergraph $H$ is countable, and it is $\kappa$-avoidable if $\chi (H)\leq\kappa$. Example 1. For each $k<\omega$ and ordinal $\alpha$, the polynomial, $x_0+\cdots+x_{k}-x_{k+1}-kx_{k+2}$, in Fox' theorem is a $(k + 3, 1)$-ary polynomial which is $\aleph_{\alpha}$-avoidable if and only if $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{\alpha+k}$. Example 2. The $(3, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x, y, z)=||x-y||^2-||y-z||^2$, for $2\leq n<\omega$ where $||.||$ denotes the Euclidean norm in $\mathbb{R}^n$, is avoidable. Theorem 1. For each $n < w$ there is a countable partition of $\mathbb{R}^n$ which avoids every avoidable $(-, n)$-ary polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$. Theorem 2. Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\geq \aleph_{m}$, every avoidable polynomial is $m$-avoidable. Theorem 3. Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{m}$, every $m$-avoidable polynomial is avoidable. Corollary. The followings hold: (a) Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\geq \aleph_{m}$, a polynomial is avoidable iff it is $m$-avoidable. (b) Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{m}$, a polynomial is avoidable iff it is $\omega$-avoidable. 

There were quite a few different questions, so forgive me if my answer is somewhat fragmented. The Néron-Severi group $NS(X)$ (divisors modulo algebraic equivalence) is finitely generated over any field for any non-singular projective variety $X$, this is Severi's theorem of the base (at least for the case of characteristic zero). In what follows however I am assume that the variety is defined over $\mathbb{C}$ for simplicity. Some answers to your other questions: 

Let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero and let $G$ be an adjoint semi-simple algebraic group over $k$. On p34 of the paper "Sansuc - Groupe de Brauer et arithmétique des groupes algébriques lineaires sur um corps de nombres", it is claimed that there exists a collection of finite field extensions $k \subset k_i$ such that $$G \cong \prod_i \mathrm{R}_{k_i/k}(G_i) \quad (*)$$ where the $G_i$ are absolutely simple adjoint groups over $k_i$ and $\mathrm{R}_{k_i/k}$ denotes the Weil restriction. I was quite surprised when I saw this, as it certainly seems to be something special about adjoint groups. However, Sansuc unfortunately gives no explanation nor reference why this holds. 

This problem has been considered by a few authors. Versions for $a$ and $b$ rational were considered by Hooley and Guo (independently). See Hooley - On ternary quadratic forms that represent zero. Guo - On solvability of ternary quadratic forms. Hooley obtained the (sharp) lower bound of the form $H^3/(\log H)^{3/2}$ for the corresponding counting problem. Guo obtained an asymptotic formula for the slightly different problem where $a$ and $b$ are assumed to be square-free (i.e. the numerators and denominators are square-free). An asymptotic formula without the square-free assumption does not seem to be known. More recent work: Friedlander, Iwaniec - Ternary quadratic forms with rational zeros considers the case where $a$ and $b$ are integers, and obtained an asymptotic formula of the order $H^2/(\log H)$ under the additional assumption that $a$ and $b$ are odd, coprime and square-free. An asymptotic formula for general $a$ and $b$ might be possible to obtain from their methods, but probably quite messy. 

The theorem shows the consistency of having a model of $ZFC$ (like $W_{\kappa}$) in which $GCH$ fails everywhere (in a finite gap form) but in its $HOD$, $GCH$ holds. In a remark after the theorem the author says: 

Remark. Following Joel's comment below, it is worth mentioning that the above definition is NOT the only variant of fast function forcing. There are other versions with slightly different properties. For a more complete argument along these lines see Joel's answer in this MO post. On one hand, preserving Shelah cardinals through lifting arguments often needs dominating the corresponding functions $f:\kappa\rightarrow \kappa$ by functions in the ground model. On the other hand, we know that the fast function forcing $\mathbb{P}_{\kappa}$ adds a very fast (and so non-dominatable) function of this type into the universe (i.e. the fast function) and simultaneously fails to satisfy $\kappa$-cc property which is a usual condition for providing dominating functions in the ground model. 

Remark 2. Potentially, one may find some questions, related to the possible number/behavior of wild knots of the certain knot invariant (such as bridge, unknotting, stick numbers, etc.) in a forcing extension, interesting. However, for the sake of this question, I preferred to stick to a very specific one concerning crossing number. Please feel free to share your thoughts about other possibly interesting problems along these lines in the comments below. 

Finally, one may ask about the analogy of Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in the case of hyperprimes. Although, we are not dealing with a commutative hyperoperator for $n\geq 3$ but it is still meaningful and interesting to wonder whether every natural number has a unique representation in terms of $n$-hyper combination of $n$-hyperprime numbers or not? For instance, $8^{9^{10}}$ is a natural number. While $8=2^3$ and $9=3^2$ aren't $3$-hyperprime but this number has a representation $2^{3^{21}}$ via $3$-hyperprime numbers $2, 3, 21$. Does such a representation exist for every other number? Is it unique? 

Im not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for, but try searching google for the "dimension growth conjecture". This is essentially the conjecture that $N(X,B) \ll_{d,\varepsilon} B^{dim X + \varepsilon}$ for any projective variety $X$ of degree $d \geq 2$. I think this is now known for any variety whose degree is not three. This follows from work of Heath-Brown, Browning, Salberger, Marmon and others. Also, Salberger has recently announced a proof for the case of degree three, however the implied constant is not uniform with respect to $X$. These results are generally proved using a higher dimensional analogue of the determinant method of Bombieri and Pila, in particular Heath-Brown has developed a $p$-adic version of the determinant method that has proved fruitful. You might be able to use this to get the kind of result that you are looking for. For an overview of these results I would recommend: $URL$ 

The fact that it is fano is not perhaps immediately obvious, but it is clear that it is unirational since it is dominated by $G$, which is a rational variety. There is no reason to expect your average fano variety to be rational, however are flag varieties rational? I am particularly interested in the case where $dim X = 3$. 

Shafarevich made heavy use of embedding problems in his resolution of the inverse Galois problem for solvable groups. The (naive) viewpoint is that solving the relevant embedding problems allowed him to reduce to the case of abelian extensions, where a positive solution to the inverse Galois problem was already known. You can find further details and precise statements in Sections IX.4 and IX.5 of: Neukirch, Schmidt, Wingberg - Cohomology of number fields. 

Update. A MathOverflow fellow just emailed me expressing his interest in conducting some statistical research on MathSciNet and MathOverflow databases. He asked whether I know how to get access to the corresponding background data, which I actually don't. I am not even sure if it is publicly accessible or free (particularly in the case of MathSciNet and Arxiv). I also suspect that there must be some non-disclosure rules and restrictions which any corresponding research along these lines should follow. It would be nice if somebody who knows how to get access to the raw material needed for any research concerning these databases, sheds some light on these issues. 

It is easy to see that for an infinite cardinal $\kappa$, the existence of a Jónsson algebra of size $\kappa$ is equivalent to the existence of a Jónsson model of size $\kappa$. By the way, there is a combinatorial large cardinal of the same name: 

Remark 1. Note that according to the definition, there are no $1$-hyperprime numbers, simply because every natural number greater than $1$ arises as the addition of two smaller natural numbers. $2$-hyperprime numbers are exactly the usual prime numbers and the set of $3$-hyperprime numbers consists of usual primes and numbers like $12$ which don't arise as the exponentiation of two smaller numbers. In general, if $p>1$ is a $m$-hyperprime number for some $m\geq 1$ then it is $n$-hyperprime for any $n>m$. Remark 2. It is intuitively clear that almost all natural numbers are hyperprime in some sense, simply because the hyperoperator $*_n$ gets violently powerful when $n$ grows. Thus for almost any natural number $p>1$ one may find sufficiently large $n$ such that even the smallest combinations of natural numbers like $2*_{n}3$ and $3*_{n}2$ exceed $p$. So based on the increasing nature of hyperoperators, $p$ could not arise as the $*_n$ combination of any smaller numbers and is a $n$-hyperprime number. The only (magical?) exception is the eternally composite number $4$ which is NOT $n$-hyperprime for any $n\geq 1$ because $\forall n\geq 1~~~4=2*_{n}2$. Now the first question is: "How many hyperprimes of any type are there?" We know that there are no $1$-hyperprimes. Also, there are very few $2$-hyperprime numbers in the sense that the natural density of the set of prime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ is $0$. Roughly speaking, the usual prime numbers are so rare among natural numbers that one may assume that there is almost no such number! But as stated, there is a promising increasing trend among hyperprime numbers of higher order. When $n$ gets larger and larger, the $n$-hyperoperator skips more and more numbers in its range (while receiving non-trivial input) leaving them as $n$-hyperprimes. Consequently, the corresponding set of $n$-hyperprime numbers gets rapidly larger by varying $n$. So one may cover almost the entire set of natural numbers this way eventually. Thus it is natural to ask: 

I work over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero. Recall that a flag variety is a projective variety which is a homogeneous space for some semisimple algebraic group. Every flag variety is of the form $G/P$, where $G$ is a semisimple algebraic group and $P$ is a parabolic subgroup. It seems to me that this data is "discrete", so I expect flag varieties to have discrete moduli. Moreover flag varieties are Fano varieties, and it is known that there are only finitely many deformation types of Fano varieties of fixed dimension. This leads to my question. 

As you already seem to know, unitary groups are classified by separable quadratic field extensions (in fact one should really work with separable quadratic algebras, i.e. also $F\times F$, corresponding to the ''trivial'' unitary group $\mathrm{GL}_n$). Thus your questions can essentially be reduced to problems about quadratic field extensions. 

I'll upgrade my comment to an answer. Any finite Galois extension of $\mathbb{Q}_l$ of degree coprime to $l$ is tamely ramified. In particular, its Galois group is an extension of two cyclic groups. This means that your specific $G$ is not realisable as a Galois group when $l \neq 2$. However, your specific group $G$ is in fact realisable over $\mathbb{Q}_2$. This is the Galois group of the splitting field the polynomial $$x^8 - 6.$$ There are a few ways to see this, and I leave most of the details to you (this can all be easily checked in sage or magma). First considering this polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$, it should be hopefully clear that the Galois group of the Galois closure $K$ is $G$ - the cyclic group of order $8$ corresponds to the radical extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[8]{6})$ and the Klein four group comes from the $8$th roots of unity acting in the way you want. There is a unique prime ideal of $K$ above $2$, hence we see that the decomposition group at $2$ is equal to $G$. Taking the completion of $K$ at this prime ideal then yields a $\mathbb{Q}_2$-extension of the required form. This construction works for many polynomials of the form $x^8 - n$, but one has to be careful. E.g. one does not obtain the required Galois group when $n=2$ or $n=14$. I'll let you have fun thinking about why this is.
