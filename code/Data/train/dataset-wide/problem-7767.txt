Edit: I forgot to mention that each orbit in $(V,F)$ must be connected in certain cases (e.g. considering the lattice family $M_n$ as graphs). For each node $t∈T$ choose a (connected) Cayley graph $C_t=(G/G_t,E_t)$ and add its edges to $F$ so that the above formula reads $$F=\{(gG_s,hG_t)\mid g,h∈G, (s,t)∈E\}∪⋃_{t∈T}E_t.$$ Addendum: Size estimation. Assuming the node are numbered by $1,…,n$, one way to assure that each node has different cardinality is to split each node $i$ into the circle $C_{(n+3)k^i}$. So we get an exponential upper bound. However, in many cases a much smaller size can be achieved as you have to split up only as many nodes as a minimal system of generators of the automorphism group has (split up nodes instead of linking them to copies in Daniels Answer). E.g., for the complete graph $K_n$ the nodes can be replaced by circles of length $4$ to $n+4$ leading to a total size of $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}+3n$ nodes, which is polynomial. This is probably not the lower bound as it should be possible to replace certain circles by smaller Cayley graphs. 

The isomorphism is encoded by the permutation of the marker graphs $G_i$. The procedure goes into recursion only, if the marked graphs are still isomorphic. Thus, an isomorphism is found whenever the largest depth of recursion is reached. At each level of recursion at most $n$ graph isomorphy tests are performed. As we have $n$ levels, the delay between the outputs of two isomorphisms is about $O(n^2)$ times the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem of the marked graph, which is polynomial as shown above. Note: There are much more effective ways of marking the nodes than in this example. Edit: It is easy to see that a polynomial delay algorithm is polynomial iff its output is polynomial. 

I think the answer to Question 1 is yes, at least for finite graphs. Lets $(T,E)$ be a graph. You can choose a group $G$ that is large enough to do the following: For each node $x∈V$ choose a subgroup $G_x$ (called stabilizer) such that the intersection of all subgroups is $\{1\}$ and each subgroup has a different cardinality. Then you can form the graph in the following way: $$ V= \dot\bigcup_{t∈T} \{gG_t\mid g∈G\}, \mbox{ and } F=\{(gG_s,hG_t)\mid g,h∈G, (s,t)∈E\}.$$ Then each node $t$ is broken up into $|G/G_t|$ pairwise unconnected nodes. And each edge is split up into a complete bipartite graph connecting all equivalent vertices. By changing the group size and the size of the stabilizer you can ensure that any two edges in $F$ have the same valency iff they belong to the same node in $T$. For more information: 

I learn from SGA4$\frac{1}{2}$ Dualité Proposition 3.4 that Tr($\phi$(u)$\cup x$)=$\phi (x)$,where $\phi$ is a homomorphism $\phi$: $H^1_c(X,\mu_n) \to \mathbb{Z}/n$ and u is the (1,1) part of diagonal class $H^2_{\Delta}(X\times \bar{X},j_!\mu_n)$ which can be proved agrees with "de son image réciproque par $f_0$:$X\to Pic_D^0(\bar{X})$"in $H^1_c(X,Pic_D^0(\bar{X})）$ . Maybe we can assume that $\phi$ is $\frac{g(X+S)}{g(X)}$ where g is the function associate with the point $T\in A[n]$ used to define Weil-pairing.My question: How to prove $\phi(u)$ is the divisor corresponding to T and the agreement of the pairing？ 

update: I had thought you just consider the Künneth case.To give the relationship between the cohomology for general closed subscheme Z and the $pr_{1*}Z$ $pr_{2*}Z$ is related to Motives and algebraic correspondences.In the case that $Z=Z_1\times Z_2$，Künneth formula can expressed in the form $H(Z)=Hom(H(Z_1),H(Z_2))$ by Poincare duality (transfer tensor to hom),When Z is not as this form and $H_C(X,A)$ corresponds to$c^!RHom(p_1^*A_2,p_2^!A_2)=RHom(c_1^*A_1,c_2^!A_2)$ by kunneth theorem (c.f SGA5 III), in the case that Z corresponds to the graph of a morphism,it is isomorphic to$RHom(f^*A_1,A_2)$,we can calculate the $H_C(X,A)$ by Fubini-like theroem in SGA5 III proposition 3.4.But I don't really know how wide can this theorem apply 

In Freitag and Kiehl's etale cohomology book p206,$H(X_e,Rj_*(\Lambda|_{X_{\eta}}))\to H(X_{es},i^* Rj_*(\Lambda|_{X_{\eta}})$is a isomorphism,where X is a proper scheme and smooth over the base scheme S at all the point of Y, the complement of the scheme $X_e$. If $X_e$ is proper,it is easily derived from the proper base change theorem.In this book,authors argue that,when F is locally constant,the $R\Gamma_Y F$ has the base change property,but I don't understand how they do this(The purity theorem is only proved in the case that X and Y are both smooth.)So how to prove this formula? 

It's well known the relationship between Poincare duality and Thom isomorphism（I mean cohomology purity $R^q i^! F=0$ if $q\neq c $ ) $\quad $ $Rf_!Ri_!=R(f|_Z)_!$ where f is $P_k^n\rightarrow k$ and Z is a close subscheme of P,i the closed immersion so Verdier duality $R(f|_Z)^! \tilde {=}Ri^!Rf^!$,and the cohomology purity can be proved by smooth base change, cohomology ring of$P^n_k$ can be calculated as well. My question is：can we bulid up Poincare duality in this way? 

In the topology case, it is the Kunneth theorem for excision pair.In the algebraic geometry(etale cohomology) case , it can be reduced to prove that for $Z_1$,$Z_2$(if $Z=Z_1\times Z_2)$and sheaf $Ri_1^! F$and $Ri_2^!G$ since $R\Gamma(Z,Ri^!F)=R\Gamma(X,R\Gamma_ZF)$.Kunneth theorem needs the projection formula and base change theorems.If we only consider the case that the base scheme is spec k,the generic base change theorem in SGA4.5 is always available。$Ri^!F$ should be locally constant sheaf due to the projection formula.If Z and X are smooth,this is from purity theorems. The case that X is smooth and Z is a divsor can be found in SGA7 XIII lemma 2.1.10. In fact the topology purity theorem is often proved by using Kunneth theorem for excision pair(c.f Milnor's characteristic class ） 

This is still not the system you are talking about, as you forbid non-proper subsets and loops must be considered separately. But this may be a starting point. If you are interested in more insights you could investigate the problem with tools similar to formal concept analysis. You can consider $(2^Γ,Γ,J)$ where $⟨V,≤⟩\mathrel J G :⇔ G\cong ⟨V,≤⟩$ as some kind of formal context. As far as I know Sebastian Kerkhoff recently developed a categorical generalisation of that framework. BTW.: You are talking about a category. Thus, maybe category theory has additional results. Edit: And that it doesn't get lost: The problem of loops is not touched by the question whether it is a strict or reflexive preorder. As the category of graphs with a loop on each node is equivalent to the category of graphs with no loop on any node (removing all nodes is a functor and adding a loop to each node is its inverse, their combination is the identity functor). Using a reflexive order considered as small catgeory each loop can be represented as non-identity loop, which turns the induced subcategory of this node into a non-trivial semigroup. So we can see: Two equivalent Graphs are either isomorphic or have injective endomporphsms. The latter means the corresponding nodes have a loop. 

The property $∀x:x≤f(x)$ is also called „extensive“, especially with respect to closure systems or lattices. In general, a closure system is defined as the image of a closure operator, which is an idempotent and extensional endomorphism of an ordered set. 

There are several approches for defining formal contexts of the form $\mathbb K(V,V,J)$ where $V=G\dot ∪M$ and $I∪I^{-1}⊆J$. Some of them are described in [1][2]. If you chose $I∪I^{-1}=J$, then the result is rather trivial: You get two oppositely ordered lattices side by side linked just by $0$ and $1$. Maybe you have something different in mind which I can't deduce from your Edit so far. We can describe the position of a concept $(A,A^{≤})$ by its supremum irreducibles below and the infimum irreducibles above it. Thus, you can take any concept of $(A,B)∈\mathfrak B(G,M,≤)$. If $at(G)$ are the objects that generate the atoms of the concept lattice $\mathfrak B(G,M,≤)$ and $coat(M)$ are the attributes that generate the coatoms of the lattice, then $(A,B)$ corresponds to the concept $\bigl(A∩at(G),B∩coat(M)\bigr)$ regarding $\tilde <$. So you have a subcontext. Whenever you remove an irreducible the corresponding chain is shortened by $1$. Francesco Kriegel has discussed this process in his diploma thesis. The aspect of adding a chain is partly considered in this article. For FCA there is no difference whether you consider preordered sets (reflexive and transitive relations) or ordered sets.[3] [1] Ganter, B.; Wille, R. “Formal Concept Analysis”, Mathematical foundations, Springer [2] Ganter, B.; Wille, R. “Formale Begriffsanalyse”, Mathematische Grundlagen, Springer [3] The only difference can be discussed looking at the context: When it is not clarified it the “order” relation is just a preorder. On the other hand the formal concepts consist of two sets so it doesn't matter wheter your relation is antisymmetric.
