The fact that π is irrational has few direct applications. However the techniques used to prove this, or rather used to prove the stronger statement that it is transcendental, have many applications. For example, Baker proved that 1 and the logs of algebraic numbers are linearly independent over algebraic numbers except in trivial cases. (This includes the fact that π is irrational as a special case because π = log(-1)/i.) Baker used his theorem to give effective bounds on the solutions of Diophantine equations and to solve Gauss's class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields, among other things. See Baker's book on transcendental number theory for more details. 

Washington's book has a table of irregular primes together with the power of p dividing the first factor of the class number. There are plenty for which the first factor is divisible by $p^2$; the first is p=157. So for these Kummer's first condition fails. 

This is false for G=SO(3). This can be generated by rotations in the two planes orthogonal to the x axis and the y axis, but not every element close to the identity can be written as a product of a rotation in the first plane and a rotation in the second plane. 

One of the best-known relations between modular forms of half integral weight and even weight is the Shimura correspondence taking certain weight k+1/2 forms to weight 2k forms. See Koblitz's book or Shimura's paper for details. By the way, η4 is indeed a modular form of weight 2 for the whole modular group SL2(Z), for a nontrivial character of this group. For half-integral weight forms one needs to use a character of the metaplectic double cover in the functional equation; this is what the funny roots of unity in the functional equation of η are doing. 

The problem you are asking about is called elimination theory ( $URL$ ), which shows how to eliminate unknown variables x, y, ... from sets of polynomial equations. One of the major tools for doing this explicitly is the resultant ( $URL$ ) of 2 polynomials, that gives polynomial conditions on their coefficients for them to have a common root. Carrying out these calculations is too messy to do by hand except for small examples, though some computer algebra systems are now quite good at it. 

"The universal cover of $SL_2(R)$ is a universal central extension" (which I believed until recently...) 

I don't think "predicative" has a generally accepted precise definition, though roughly speaking it refers to definitions of objects that only depend on previously constructed objects. For example, the axiom of replacement in set theory is impredicative because it constructs new sets, but the construction involves quantifying over all sets, including the one you are trying to construct. The Feferman-Schutte ordinal is sometimes said to be the first impredicative ordinal (though I've never really understood why), in which case predicative mathematics consists roughly of theorems that only depend on transfinite induction up to smaller ordinals. 

The paper by Conrey and Li "A note on some positivity conditions related to zeta and L-functions" $URL$ discusses some of the problems with de Branges's argument. They describe a (correct) theorem about entire functions due to de Branges, which has a corollary that certain positivity conditions would imply the Riemann hypothesis. However Conrey and Li show that these positivity conditions are not satisfied in the case of the Riemann hypothesis. So the answer is that de Branges has proved theorems in this area that are accepted, and his work on the Riemann hypothesis has been checked and found to contain a serious gap. (At least the version of several years ago has a gap; I think he may have produced updated versions, but at some point people lose interest in checking every new version.) Update: there is a more recent paper by Lagarias discussing de Branges's work. 

Use the continued fraction algorithm: repeatedly add an integer to make the real part at most 1/2, then invert if this increases the absolute value. For real numbers this usually continues indefinitely and produces a continued fraction expansion, while for non-real numbers it terminates after a finite number of steps, producing an element in a fundamental domain. 

The cohomology rings of Lie groups are not just rings but also Hopf algbras with a coproduct Δ coming from the group structure. Picking primitive (Δ(x) = x⊗1 + 1⊗x) homogeneous generators gets close to giving a canonical set of generators up to scalars (though there is still some ambiguity for Dn which can have 2 generators of the same degree). Homomorphisms of groups preserve the coproduct, so they will more or less preserve the primitive generators. 

According to mathscinet, the results of Anderson given in "Topological properties of the Hilbert cube and the infinite product of open intervals" Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 126 1967 200--216, and "Hilbert space is homeomorphic to the countable infinite product of lines" Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 72 1966 515--519 show that all infinite dimensional separable Frechet spaces are homeomorphic, and that removing any countable union of compact sets from such a space leaves the homeomorphism type unchanged. 

This is an old approach to finding models for varieties, introduced by Zariski in 1944 in his work on resolution of singularities. (See "The compactness of the Riemann manifold of an abstract field of algebraic functions", Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 50: 683–691, doi:10.1090/S0002-9904-1944-08206-2, MR0011573) He defined a Zariski topology on a space of valuations, which seems to have inspired Grothendieck's definition of Zariski topology on a scheme. Much of Zariski's work on these spaces is rather similar to Grothedieck's work on the foundations of schemes. Zariski called the space of valuations the "Riemann manifold" of a variety, though it is now called the Zariski-Riemann space. Volume 2, chapter VI section 17 of Zariski and Samuel's book on commutative algebra gives more details. 

(This is incorrect: see below) A proof of this can be extracted from Steinberg's paper "Générateurs, relations et revêtements de groupes algébriques". If Ive understood it correctly, he shows that a Cartan subgroup of the universal central extension of $SL_2(K)$ (for a field $K$ with at least 4 elements) is generated by elements $h(t)$ for $t$ a nonzero element of the field, that in particular satisfy $h(tu^2)=h(t)h(u^2)$, and the center of the universal central extension is the kernel of the map from the Cartan subgroup to $K^*/\pm 1$ taking $h(t)$ to $t$. In the case when $K$ is the reals, this kernel is generated by $h(-1)$ as every element is a square or a square times $-1$. So the center of the universal central extension is generated by $h(-1)$ and in particular is cyclic. The center is known be be at least $Z$, so the center of the universal central extension is exactly $Z$, and the universal central extension is therefore the same as the universal cover. Added later: this answer is wrong. I overlooked that the proof of $h(tu^2)=h(t)h(u^2)$ in Steinberg's paper requires that $t$ and $u$ generate a cyclic subgroup of $K^*$, which holds in the finite field case he was considering but not over the reals. 

Some neat examples of finite fundamental groups G of 3-manifolds are given by the quotients of the sphere S3 of unit quaternions by a finite subgroup G, such as the quaternion group {1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k} or order 8, or the double covers of orders 24, 48, 120 of the rotations of the platonic solids. The case of the group of order 120 gives the Poincare 3-sphere, which has the same homology of the 3-sphere but different fundamental group. 

Try the matrices of the form ${0A\choose 00}$ with A an m by n block (with |m-n|≤1 for maximal dimension). Spaces of commuting nilpotent matrices have nothing to do with maximal tori or Cartan subalgebras, which consist of semisimple matrices. 

The normalization of the j-invariant is a historical accident: it was chosen to have a zero of order 3 at a cube root of 1. There is no really good reason for this: one could equally well normalize it to have a double zero at i, or a zero at some integer of an imaginary quadratic field of class number 1. So it is unlikely that the ring structure on isomorphism classes of elliptic curves has any meaning. In any case j is not really a bijection: there is really only 1/2 or 1/3 of an elliptic curve with j invariant 1728 or 0. One can mumble something about stacks at this point. 

The Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula implies that the number of unimodular lattices of given dimension eventually starts to increase more than exponentially fast, so one might expect that they are easy to classify in small dimensions and gradually become harder to classify in higher dimensions as the mass of the SMS formula increases. In fact this is not what happens: there is a quite precise dimension where the behavior changes qualitatively and the lattices become much harder to classify. This is the jump from dimension 25 to 26. The reason is related to the existence of the Leech lattice in dimension 24, which controls unimodular lattices in dimension up to 25. (The 25 dimensional ones were classified by hand about 30 years ago, but the 26 dimensional case is so much harder that no-one has attempted it since then even with the help of modern petaflop computers.) 

One crude but effective method is to compute all the h conjugates aj numerically to high precision, from which you can find the polynomial Π(x-aj) they are the roots of using the fact that it has integral coefficients, (h=class number, and the values aj are the values of j at the imaginary quadratic integers with the same discriminant.) Alternatively see the paper On singular moduli by Gross and Zagier, which gives an explicit expression for the values of j as products of many small algebraic integers. 

There was some discussion about this on the FOM mailing list: see for example $URL$ where someone claimed Wiles needed in accessible cardinals, and Harvey Friedman essentially told them to stop being stupid. (Friedman is the guy who created the subject of reverse mathematics, which studies what axioms are necessary for any given result.) An analogy would be the claim that classifying groups of order 4 needs Grothendieck universes, because groups of order 4 form a proper class, so isomorphism classes of groups of order 4 form a 2-class of classes. This is obviously silly: it is trivial to restate the classification of groups of order 4 without using proper classes, but this makes the statement slightly more complicated: you have to talk about groups that are hereditarily finite sets or something like that, which is just an irrelevant complication. The use of Grothendieck universes is similar: for example, the collection of all etale spaces over a scheme is a proper class so in some sense uses universes to construct it, but is equivalent to a much smaller set so the use of universes is not necessary. 

The elliptic modular function j(τ) = q-1 + 744 +196884q + ... (q=e2πiτ) This is an isomorphism from elliptic curves (such as C/(1,τ)) to the complex plane. 

More generally the suspension $S\land(X\times Y)$ of $X\times Y$ is the wedge of the suspensions of $X$, $Y$, and the smash product $X\land Y$; see for example proposition 4.74 of Hatcher's book. 

Finding the number of generators for the invariants of binary forms is a classic and very hard problem in invariant theory. For forms of small degree one can find a description in Hilbert's book on invariant theory (ISBN 978-0521449038). In the 19th century it was solved for forms of degree at most 8, and it has recently been pushed to degree 10 in $URL$ using computer calculations (where one needs 106 generators). The latter link gives the history of the problem in more detail. 

Take the complex Heisenberg group of 3 by 3 upper triangular unipotent complex matrices, and mod out by a subgroup $Z\times Z$ in the center. 

Percolation theory suggests that the probability one can one can walk to infinity is 1 if the density of randomly chosen stepping stones is at least a certain critical number, and is 0 if the density is less than this number. Since the density of primes in the Ulam spiral and the density of Gaussian primes in the plane both tend to zero, the density of stepping stones is 0. This suggests that one cannot walk to infinity on either primes in the Ulam sprial or Gaussian primes, for any bounded size of step. 

Classifying spaces are widely used in algebraic number theory, but in slightly disguised form. A classifying space is really just an approximation to the classifying topos of a group. However the classifying topos is just the category of G-sets, which is exactly what one uses in defining group cohomology and so on. Or to put it another way, all the useful information in the classifying space is already contained in the category of G-sets. The comment at the end of the question is correct: group cohomology was discovered as the cohomology of the classifying space, and the topological constructions were then turned into algebraic constructions and removed from the theory. So in some sense all the group cohomology calculations are implicitly using the classifying space. 

$1/\zeta(s)=\sum_{n>0}\frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}$ where $\mu$ is the Moebius function. This series is known to converge for $s\ge 1$ and diverge for $s\le 1/2$. Its convergence is unknown if $1/2< s< 1$ (convergence in this interval is essentially the Riemann hypothesis). 

$URL$ gives the smallest cyclotomic polynomial with a given coefficient, and the paper $URL$ by Vaughan gives lower bounds for the growth of the max coefficient of the form exp(log 2 log n/log log n) 

Read any contract you sign carefully, otherwise you may lose rights you wanted to keep. In 2000, CRC Press sued Eric Weisstein because he posted free updates to the web of a mathematics book he had written and published with them. Usually non-commercial publishers like the AMS allow you to keep any rights you want, while commercial publishers often try to get the rights for themselves (but will usually allow you to keep them if you make a fuss). 

The representations of wreath products of symmetric groups are known: for example, see section 4.3 of "The representation theory of the symmetric group" by James and Kerber. 

It is straightforward to read off a presentation of $GL_n(p)$, and for that matter any group of Lie type, by representing it as a BN-pair. For $GL_n$, $B$ is the group of upper triangular matrices, and $N$ is the group of matrices with one non-zero entry in each row and column. Each of these two subgroups has an easy presentation, and the axioms for a BN pair combine these into a presentation for $GL_n$. 

Over the integers, the rational numbers Q are flat and so Tor^i(Q,M) = 0 for all M and all i>0. However Q is not projective so has projective dimension 1.
