Say I have an ind scheme $X = \cup_i X_i$ over a field $k$. I have its tangent bundle $\hom_k(k[\epsilon], X)$ which I can think of as ind scheme via $\cup_i \hom_k(k[\epsilon],X_i)$. The problem is even if $X$ is smooth it might be the case that most of the $X_i$ are not smooth. I believe this happens at least for polynomial loop groups $G[z^\pm]$. In this case the sheaf of differentials is not locally free. This seems to be an obstruction to constructing the canonical sheaf inductively. Additionally if each $X_i$ is infinite dimensional, which happens for the formal loop group, then it seems like top exterior power doesn't make much sense. And finally if you looked at say $\mathbb{P}^\infty := \cup_n \mathbb{P}^n$ then it also seems unclear what a canonical sheaf should be. If it were a line bundle it could be described as a line bundle $L_n$ on each $\mathbb{P}^n$ which are compatible under pull backs. But then each $L_n$ would have the same degree $d$. But the canonical line bundles $O(-n-1)$ have a different degree on each $\mathbb{P}^n$! So is there any sense in asking for something like a canonical sheaf or dualizing sheaf for smooth ind schemes? UPDATE: Brian Conrad shared the following with me: If $f:X \to Y$ is a map between finite type schemes over a field (or one can be much more general...) then for a relative dualizing complex $\omega_Y$ on $Y$ we have that $f^!(\omega_Y)$ is a relative dualizing complex on $X$ (for suitable functor $f^!$ at derived category level). In other words, one does have "compatibility" for relative dualizing complexes, but with respect to the appropriate "derived pullback" operation $f^!$. (One has to think about duality and "canonical sheaf" in a much broader sense than Serre duality over a field in order to define "relative dualizing object" in a derived category.) The upshot is that one has to work in derived categories (and so develop a suitable formalism of direct/inverse limits in derived categories) to make a good theory of duality on ind-schemes. 

Throughout "curve" means smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field. Motivation and Background I read somewhere that Atiyah has classified vector bundles on elliptic curves. My understanding is that the story is roughly: every vector bundles breaks up as a direct some of indecomposable vector bundles. The indecomposable vector bundles are further divided by their degree and rank. The set $Ind(d,r)$ of isomorphism classes of indecomposable vector bundles of a fixed degree $d$ and rank $r$ has the structure of variety isomorphic to the Jacobian of the curve; namely the curve itself. In fact $Ind(d,r) \cong Ind(0, gcd(d,r) )$ so its enough to consider the degree $0$ vector bundles. Now for $V,V'$ vector bundles on any curve $C$ its true that $\deg V \otimes V' = \deg V\cdot rk(V') + \deg V'\cdot rk(V)$. So in the case of an elliptic curve the set $Ind(0,r)$ is a torsor for $Pic^0(C)$. Additionally, there is a unique isomorphism class $V_r \in Ind(0,r)$ characterized by the fact that $h^0(V_r) \ne 0$ (in fact $h^0(V_r)=1$). The Question Since curves of low genus are usually "simple enough" to easily describe explicitly, I would like to see how explicit I can be with a description of the $V_r$, or at least $V_2$. So my question is simply, given an explicit elliptic curve in $\mathbb{P}^2$, say $zy^2 - x(x-z)(x+z)$can you reasonably show how to construct $V_2$; i.e. give cocyles for it $\phi_{ij} \colon U_{ij} \to GL_2(k)$, or produce a graded module for it? Initial Thoughts $V_2$ should correspond to the unique nontrivial extension in $Ext^1(\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}) \cong H^1(\mathcal{O}) \cong k$.On a curve $C$, $0 \to \mathcal{O}_C \to K(C) \to K(C)/\mathcal{O}_C \to 0$ is a flasque resolution of the structure sheaf and an element in $H^1(\mathcal{O}_C)$ corresponds to a map $\alpha \colon \mathcal{O}_C \to K(C)/\mathcal{O}_C$. Then the desired extension should be the pullback of $0 \to \mathcal{O}_C \to K(C) \to K(C)/\mathcal{O}_C \to 0$ via $\alpha$. The trouble with this is that I can't seem to pin down what $\alpha$ is. I now that, via Serre duality, it corresponds to a global section of $H^0(\omega_C)$ which I can explicitly describe as a differential on the curve. Using the example I mentioned above, on the affine patch where $z \ne 0$, it is: $\frac{dx}{2y} = -\frac{dy}{3x^2-1}$ but I guess I don't understand Serre duality well enough to determine $\alpha$ from this. Also I'm not even sure if this will lead to a reasonable way of getting at the cocylces of $V_2$. And this is so close to "just using the definitions" I have to imagine there might be a better way to go about this... 

Alan, I have been in a situation very similar to yours. After getting my Bachelor's in math (also from a small, essentially no-name school), I spent 23 years in the software industry (Silicon Valley). Boredom and frustration with my work, and an ongoing interest in math since my undergraduate days all motivated me to consider returning graduate school. Being laid off during the recession in 2002 gave me the final nudge. I immediately entered a master's degree program in math at Cal State Hayward, full time. At first, I was thinking that the master's would be my terminal degree. It was only after I gained a mentor while in the program that I learned that it was feasible to go on to a PhD program, even at my age. In particular, the vast majority of PhD grad students in math have a teaching assistantship, which pays for tuition and supplies a (very modest) stipend. One bit of advice to me was to not go to any school which did not offer a TA-ship. Working on my master's provided me recent reference letters. (Some of my best undergraduate references were deceased.) I cannot say that working on a master's before the PhD program is required, or even recommended. Be aware that many schools have programs where a student enters under a master's degree program, and then before completing the master's the student can decide, together with faculty consultation, whether to continue on to a PhD program. (My PhD school, the University of Washington, offers such a program.) In fact a few schools require all their students to complete a master's before formally being accepted into their PhD program. These programs, where master's and PhD are both done at the same school, will save some time overall since all units are guaranteed to be transferable. (None of my master's degree work at CSUH transfered to UW, but it did equip me to pass one of the preliminary exams at UW.) I finished my PhD in 2009. I was hoping to enter academia, and I did a 2-year postdoc at UBC. But as everyone has noted, the academic market is dismal at this time, and I took a position in government. So it is good that you are aware of the job market conditions and planning accordingly. As David White noted, there are several industries that hire mathematicians. He also noted that the NSA and affiliated contractors hire a great number of mathematicians, doing interesting work. I would also note that there are other government labs and agencies that also hire some number of mathematicians. In any of these, I would suggest that while it's OK to seek "math-oriented" work, you should at the same time remain open to leveraging your industry experience, especially any software skills you may have acquired. All in all, I have no regrets for pursuing a PhD. Indeed, I would have had regrets had I not. Best to you in your pursuits. 

I would add Oliver Debarre's: Complex Tori and Abelian Varieties. It does not cover the theory of Abelian functions in as great of depth as many of the other sources cited. But, compared to the others, it does begin at an elementary level, it is concrete and short. In total the book is about 100 pages and the chapters most relevant here are 4,5,6 which take up about 40 pages. For learning this subject I think this book is a good supplement to reading a more advanced source because Debarre is likely to spend more time on aspects other sources might skim over. Another book perhaps worth mentioning is Complex Abelian Varieties by Lange and Birkenhake. It is much longer and covers much more material. It is assumes some algebraic geometry background but I would say no more than Mumford's book. It also deals only with complex theory and it is fairly concrete. 

I don't know much about the theory of Hilbert spaces but a research project has me working with them a little bit. In particular requiring an operator to be Hilbert-Schmidt is a recurring condition. According to wikipedia one nice thing about H-S operators is that on a separable Hilbert space $H$ the set of H-S endomorphisms forms a Hilbert space that is naturally isomorphic to $H\otimes H^*$. So I'm wondering what else is nice about H-S operators. And what else works with H-S operators that wouldn't work for another class of operators. Fredholm operators also come up a lot. It $T$ is H-S and $S$ is Fredholm what can be said about the composition? 

I recently stumbled upon a paper (NON CANCELLATION FOR SMOOTH CONTRACTIBLE AFFINE THREEFOLDS) about the cancellation problem: If $X$ is a variety over $\mathbb{C}$ of dimension $d$ such that $X \times \mathbb{A}^n \cong \mathbb{A}^{n+d}$ when is $X \cong \mathbb{A}^d$? Apparently when $d = 1,2$ the answer is always. The paper remarked that the case $d = 1$ is trivial, but I'm having trouble coming up with an argument. The paper does reference a paper (ON THE UNIQUENESS OF THE COEFFICIENT RING IN A POLYNOMIAL RING) which proves the more general cancellation problem -when does $X \times \mathbb{A}^n \cong Y \times \mathbb{A}^n$ imply $X \cong Y$- for curves (again the answer for curves is always). However I wonder if there is a simple argument for the less general question. I can see that $X \times \mathbb{A}^n \cong \mathbb{A}^{n+1}$ implies that $X$ should be irreducible, affine and smooth. Seems like if you could show genus$(X) = 0$ you would be done, but I'm kinda stuck here. Does someone have a simple argument for this? 

I think the gap(s) outlined in the original post of this thread are inevitable since there is a limit to how many courses an undergraduate student can cram into his available time before graduating. Pertinent material for this discussion is the book "All the Mathematics You Missed But Need to Know for Graduate School" by Thomas Garrity. The goal of this book is ambitious, and so naturally it has its shortcomings. It has a number of errors, and one might dispute Garrity's particular selection of topics. But overall I like the book, and would recommend it to any undergraduate who is considering a professional career as a mathematician. The main body of the book is a series of short chapters, each a very brief introduction to a particular area of mathematics. This can be a useful read even for the mature mathematician who suspects that their mathematical experience may be a bit parochial. But one of the most useful parts of the book for me, which I read while working on my master's degree, and which I wish I had been exposed to as an undergraduate, is the introductory material that presents some of the broad patterns that are common across all branches of mathematics, and which form an outline for each of the following chapters. For example, he notes that every branch of mathematics is the study of some particular set of mathematical objects. This study includes questions such as how to tell when two objects of some class are essentially the same (isomorphic); when one is a sub-object of another; how new objects can be constructed from old ones; a notion of maps or morphisms between objects of a class that preserve the essential properties that the objects are supposed to capture; the notion of quotients; etc. As "muad" noted above, some teachers plan on students learning these principles more or less by induction, from having many concrete examples presented to them, and never mentioning them explicitly. While that may be an ideal way to learn the principles, there is no guarantee that a given student will learn them, regardless of the number of examples given. And I have met some mathematicians who, as far as I can tell, aren't aware of them. As an undergraduate, I came away with the sense that the various branches of mathematics were rather disjointed, with no real common patterns. Blame it on poor instruction, or more likely, my being dense. I think I would have benefitted a lot from someone pointing out these patterns to me in an explicit way.
