No. Let $X$ be the chain complex with $\mathbb{k}$ in degree $n$ (and all differentials zero) and let $Y$ be the chain complex with $\mathbb{k}$ in degrees $n$ and $n+1$ with the identity as differential $Y_{n+1}\to Y_n$ (I choose for my convention that the differential lowers degree). Then $X$ is not injective because there is no chain map $Y\to X$ which factors the identity on $X$ through the evident inclusion of $X$ into $Y$. To be injective over a field it is necessary and sufficient to have vanishing homology. A similar argument shows that not every chain complex is projective, and that to be projective over a field it is necessary and sufficient to have vanishing homology. 

Let $M$ be a closed compact Riemannian manifold. The exponential map $\mathrm{exp}:TM\to M\times M$ takes $(p,v)$ to $(p,\gamma_v(1))$, where $\gamma_v$ is the geodesic flow at $p$ in the direction of $v$. The exponential map $\mathrm{exp}_p:T_pM\to M$ is the projection to the second coordinate of the restriction of $\mathrm{exp}$. By the inverse function theorem, $\mathrm{exp}$ is a diffeomorphism on a neighborhood of the zero section in $TM$. So in particular there is a value $\epsilon_{\mathrm{Diff}}$ which is the supremum of values so that $\mathrm{exp}$ restricted to disk bundles in $TM$ of radius less than $\epsilon_{\mathrm{Diff}}$ is a diffeomorphism. On the other hand, the injectivity radius at $p$, $\epsilon_p$, is the supremum of $\epsilon$ such that $\mathrm{exp}_p$ is a diffeomorphism from the radius $\epsilon$ ball around $0$ in $T_pM$ onto its image. The injectivity radius of $M$ is $\epsilon_{\mathrm{inj}}=\min_p \epsilon_p$. Clearly $\epsilon_{\mathrm{Diff}}\le \epsilon_{\mathrm{inj}}$. Is the converse true? Is that obvious? If not, what can go wrong? Is there a reference? I glanced at several books and couldn't find an explicit answer anywhere. In Berger's "A Panoramic View of Riemannian Geometry" there was something somewhat parenthetical along these lines but with no argument or reference. 

You should be able to get a (perhaps unnatural) counterexample by constructing a tensor category (or algebra object) with no maps to $1$. Let's try to make the most trivial such counterexample possible. Let $C$ have two objects $A$ and $1$ with one non-identity morphism $i:1\to A$. Equip this with a structure where $1$ is the unit and $A\otimes A=A$. I believe these make $C$ unambiguously into a tensor category. There are then unique maps $m:A\otimes A\to A$ and $\Delta:A\to A\otimes A$, both of which are the identity on $A$. Then $m$ and $i$ seem to make $A$ an algebra object in $C$ which trivially satisfies the separability condition. But this can't be counital because there are no maps $A\to 1$. This is obviously a bit unnatural but the only "natural" tensor categories I know offhand where objects don't map to the unit are ones with disjoint union... But they can't supply any counterexamples because multiplication is forced to be the fold map but then you can't make a bimodule map $A\to A\sqcup A$ unless $A$ is empty. 

Suppose there is such a topology $\tau$. I'll use "open," "continuous," etc. to mean with respect to the Euclidean topology and "$\tau$-open" etc. for $\tau$. Since $\tau$ is a refinement of the Euclidean topology, there exists a point (without loss of generality $0$) and a $\tau$-open neighborhood $U$ which does not contain any open interval containing $0$. Then there is a sequence $x_i$ in the complement of $U$ converging to $0$. For convenience choose a monotonic subsequence $y_i$, without loss of generality positive, and suppose $y_1=1$. Now consider the function $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ which fixes the complement of $(0,1)$, takes $[\frac{1}{2n},\frac{1}{2n-1}]$ to $y_n$, and takes $[\frac{1}{2n+1},\frac{1}{2n}]$ to $[y_{n+1},y_n]$ linearly. This function is continuous, hence $\tau$-continuous. Then the preimage of $(-1,1)\cap U$ is a $\tau$-open subset $V$ of $(-1,0] \cup \bigcup_n (\frac{1}{2n+1},\frac{1}{2n})$ which contains $0$. There is a homeomorphism (hence a $\tau$-homeomorphism) $\phi$ of $\mathbb{R}$ which fixes the complement of $(0,2)$, takes $[1,2]$ to $[\frac{1}{2},2]$ linearly, and takes $[\frac{1}{k+1},\frac{1}{k}]$ to $[\frac{1}{k+2},\frac{1}{k+1}]$ linearly. Then $\phi(V)\cap V$ is a $\tau$-open subset of $(-1,0]$ containing $0$. But then $(-\infty,0]$ is $\tau$-open, so that $\mathbb{R}$ is not $\tau$-connected, a contradiction since then there is a $\tau$-continuous map sending $(-\infty,0]$ to one point and $(0,\infty)$ to another. 

I'll give two answers. The first one just echoes the comments and saying that there are no such semirings, and the other saying that gives the only continuous such semiring, if you take a nonstandard definition of semiring. The standard definition of a (commutative) semiring is a set $R$ equipped with two operations $\otimes$ and $\oplus$, so that $(R,\otimes)$ and $(R,\oplus)$ are commutative monoids, so that $\otimes$ distributes over $\oplus$, and so that the unit of $\oplus$ annihilates $R$ under $\otimes$. I focus on the commutative case because you always want $\otimes$ to be addition, which is commutative. Let $R$ denote the non-negative reals. 

Let me get the skeleton of an answer down here and then I can edit in more details if you want later. An arch system can be represented as a set of ordered pairs; for example, in the first example the upper arch system is $$\{(1,12),(2,11),(3,10),(4,9),(5,6),(7,8)\}$$ and the lower arch system is $$\{(1,8),(2,5),(3,4),(6,7),(9,10),(11,12)\}.$$ The numbers in each pair are always of opposite parity. Define the parity of an arch system as $$ \prod_{\text{pairs }(a,b)}(-1)^{\frac{b-a-1}{2}} $$ so the parity of the upper arch system is $-1$ and the parity of the lower arch system is $+1$. It is not hard to see that the parity of a meander $m$ (where odd is identified with $-1$ and even with $+1$) is equal to the product of the parities of its constituent arch systems and $(-1)^{\text{order}(m)}.$ EDIT: Consider a meander where the upper arch system contains two pairs of the form $(a, b)$ and $(a+1,a+2)$. Compare this to the meander where we replace these two arches with $(a,a+1)$ and $(b,a+2)$. It is evident that this swaps the parity of the meander and of the arch system. Any arch system can be reduced to $\{(1,2),\ldots,(2n-1,2n)\}$ by a finite number of these moves. (end edit) Next, let's count odd and even arch systems. Let $A_{-1}(n)$ and $A_{+1}(n)$ be the number of $-1$ and $+1$ parity arch systems respectively (formally set $A_{+1}(0)=1$ and $A_{-1}(0)=0$). Then by looking at whatever is paired with $1$ we get the recursions \begin{align*} A_{-1}(n)&=\sum_{i=0,2,\ldots} \big(A_{-1}(i)A_{+1}(n-i-1) + A_{+1}(i)A_{-1}(n-i-1)\big)\\ &+\sum_{i=1,3,\ldots}\big(A_{-1}(i)A_{-1}(n-i-1) + A_{+1}(i)A_{+1}(n-i-1)\big) \end{align*} and \begin{align*} A_{+1}(n)&=\sum_{i=1,3,\ldots} \big(A_{-1}(i)A_{+1}(n-i-1) + A_{+1}(i)A_{-1}(n-i-1)\big)\\ &+\sum_{i=0,2,\ldots}\big(A_{-1}(i)A_{-1}(n-i-1) + A_{+1}(i)A_{+1}(n-i-1)\big) \end{align*} Simple rearrangement of the sums shows that $A_{+1}(2k)=A_{-1}(2k)$, which implies that both are $\frac{C_{2k}}{2}$. EDIT: inductive argument added. The following inductive argument shows that $A_{\pm 1}(2k+1)=\frac{C_{2k+1}\pm(-1)^k C_k}{2}$. If $n\equiv1\pmod 4$ then when $i$ is odd, then one of $\{i,n-i-1\}$ is $1\pmod 4$ and one is $3\pmod 4$. By induction, the sum above, for $A_{-1}(n)$, say, is: \begin{align*} A_{-1}(n)&= \sum_{i=0,2,\ldots} \frac{C_iC_{n-i-1}}{2}\\ &+\sum_{i=1,3,\ldots}\frac{1}{4}\left( \left(C_i+C_{\frac{i-1}{2}}\right)\left(C_{n-i-1} - C_{\frac{n-i-2}{2}}\right) + \left(C_i-C_{\frac{i-1}{2}}\right)\left(C_{n-i-1} + C_{\frac{n-i-2}{2}}\right)\right) \\ &=\sum_{i=0,1,2,\ldots} \frac{C_iC_{n-i-1}}{2} -\sum_{i=1,3,\ldots} \frac{C_{\frac{i-1}{2}}C_{\frac{n-i-2}{2}}}{2} \\ &=\frac{C_n}{2} -\sum_{j=0,1,2,\ldots}\frac{C_{j}C_{\frac{n-1}{2}-j-1}}{2} =\frac{C_n}{2} - \frac{C_{\frac{n-1}{2}}}{2}. \end{align*} The other cases of the induction (for $n\equiv 3\pmod 4$ and/or if one wants an independent induction for $A_{+1}(n)$ are similar. (end edit) Then using the relationship between parity of meanders and parity of arch systems the result follows by arithmetic. I can supply more details about the recursion, the rearrangement, the inductive argument, or the final arithmetic once the $A_{\pm 1}$ have been determined, if desired. 

For the second question, you would somehow need to be able to see that the inclusions $S^i\to D^{i+1}$ are all cofibrations; I don't see how to do that starting only with the data of the cofibrant objects. All I know how to do is build things with pushouts and sequential colimits and so on. In that situation I don't see any way to obtain cofibrations $X\to Y\cong_{\text{linearly}}X\oplus Z$ such that there is a differential that goes from $Z$ to $X$. I'd love to be wrong about this! 

If your tree had no $h$ in it, then when $d$ propagated upward, it would pass unchanged through $i$ and $p$, which are chain maps, and pass as a derivation through the product so you'd get a sum of terms which would cancel with the terms that have $d$ on top. Something similar will happen when you have $h$ on the edges, but you will get extra terms. When you have $d$ below an $h$, that is equal to a sum of three terms. One is $d$ above an $h$, one is $ip$, and one is $\mathrm{Id}$. This is a local phenomenon that happens within the tree. We can take the term with $d$ above the $h$ and continue to allow the $d$ to propagate upward. At the end, the $d$s reach the top and cancel with the terms that have $d$ on top, so the sum turns out to be made up of two kinds of terms: Terms where one $h$ has been replaced by $ip$ Terms where one $h$ has been replaced by $\mathrm{Id}$ Each $h$ is passed through precisely once by a $d$ as it propagates upward, so we have this sum over all internal edges of our tree. The sum of terms of the first type is exactly the right side of your screen capture. The terms of the second type will cancel in pairs by the associativity of $\nu$. That is, there will be precisely two trees in the overall sum over $PBT_n$ that give rise to each term of the second type. 

$D$ has small limits and colimits, a smallness criterion on $L(I)$ and $L(J)$, and relative $L(J)$-cell complexes become $C$ weak equivalences under $R$. 

then you would have some hope of having a description similar in nature to that for $As$. On the other hand, if your operad were less rigid you might also be able to do something. That is, one could imagine a continuous set of colors and a larger space of operations, corresponding not only to disjoint unions of rectangles but all rectilinear isometric embeddings of the disjoint unions, then this colored operad would be closely related to the little squares operad (other versions are called the $E_2$ operad and the little disks operad. The algebraic versions of these operads are also fairly well understood, although explicitly writing down the differential for the minimal model is already significantly more complicated than for the associative case. However, it seems like your situation is much, much worse. Because you're working only with disjoint unions and integral lengths, you have some discrete set; because your space of operations is only $\mathbb{k}$, there will be many, many relations. If there were only a few generators (as in my example above), then you still might have some hope. But there are going to be many, many, generators as well. Consider this picture: 

This appears to be false. Consider $$ f(x)=\frac{\frac{x^{10}}{100}}{1+b+\frac{x^8}{2}+\frac{x^{10}}{100}} $$ for $b\in [5,10]$. In this range, $f'(x)$ has two local maxima in $(0,\infty)$. One occurs at an $x$-value less than $2$ and the other occurs at an $x$-value between $3$ and $5$. At $b=5$ the second local maximum has a greater value; at $b=10$ the first local maximum has a greater value. So for some $b$ in that range the two maxima have equal value. 

Your statement, up to the appropriate twists, is (5.9) in Getzler–Kapranov. But let me take this opportunity to advertise the framework in Ben Ward's paper Six operations formalism for generalized operads that demonstrates a slightly more general result as a coherent part of a more general theory of passing among different types of operad-like structures. One part of Corollary 8.2 implies the statement that you made. This part of the Corollary (which is also Corollary 1.4) says that the modular envelope of $BO$ is naturally isomorphic to the Feynman transform of the ``extension by zero'' of $O$ to a modular operad (taking appropriate twists into account). Using Ward's notation, your $P$ is $L^!O$ and your $FP$ is $DL^!O$ while your $BO$ is $DO$. Ward's statement, $DL^!O\cong LDO$, is at the level of modular operads, but applying the truncation ($Cyc$ in your notation, $R$ in Ward's), yields $$ Cyc(FP)=RDL^!O\cong RLDO\cong DO=BO $$ because $RL$ is naturally isomorphic to the identity. Ward also gives a statement that he considers more obvious and less interesting, that $DR\cong RD$. This statement means, in your notation, that if you start with the modular operad $P$ instead of starting with the cyclic operad, that $$ Cyc(FP)=RDP\cong DRP=B(Cyc(P)). $$ The notation for $D$ (including twists) is discussed in Appendix A.2, using the notation of this paper by Kaufmann and Ward. 

If I understand your question correctly, the answer is no. Here is a counterexample. Let $A=k\langle 1,y\rangle$ with zero differential and trivial unital multiplication (put $y$ in degree $1$ for concreteness). Let $B=k[x]\langle 1, y\rangle$ with commutative multiplication and differential induced by $d(x) = y$. Then the inclusion $f:A\to B$ and the map $g:A\to B$ which sends $y$ to zero are both dg algebra maps, and are chain homotopic by $h(y)=x$. Now let $M=k$ where $y$ acts trivially. Then $M\otimes_A^f B \cong k[x]$ with zero differential while $M\otimes_A^g B\cong B$, which is contractible. Here are two related explanations for why this fails: 1) chain homotopy is not a good notion of homotopy for algebras and 2) projective or flat chain complexes are not necessarily projective or flat algebras. 

Next, drop the annihilation condition. I'll show that is the only continuous choice for $\oplus$ in this less restrictive definition. I will not assume that the additive unit is $0$. Note that choosing for $\oplus$ (and addition for $\otimes$) does not yield a semiring structure on $R$ with this definition because $\oplus$ does not have an identity element. First, note that $a + (0\oplus 0) = (a + 0) \oplus (a+0) = a\oplus a$ for all $a$ by distributivity. This is true for the additive unit so $(0\oplus 0)=0$ and thus $(a\oplus a)=a$ for all $a$. Then define $f(a)= 0\oplus a$. Using distributivity, $(b\oplus (a+b))= f(a)+b$ for all $a$ and $b$. So $\oplus$ is totally determined by $f$. By associativity of $\oplus$, we have $f(a) = 0\oplus a=(0\oplus 0)\oplus a=0\oplus (0\oplus a)=f(f(a))$, so $f$ is a retract. Decompose $R$ as $F\sqcup G$ where $a$ is in $F$ if $f(a)=a$. If $G$ is empty, then $(b\oplus (a+b))=a+b=\max\{a,a+b\}$. This gives the answer of for $\oplus$ that we already know. Then instead we can assume that $G$ is nonempty. Now let $z$ be the infimum of $G$. $F$ is closed and contains $0$ so $z\in F$. Then $(z\oplus 2z) = z + (0\otimes z)= 2z$ by distributivity. But then by associativity $$2z = z\oplus 2z = (0\oplus z)\oplus 2z = 0\oplus (z\oplus 2z)= 0\oplus 2z = f(2z)$$ so $2z\in F$. Now assume that $f$ is continuous. We will derive a contradiction. First suppose $a\in G$ and $b\in F$ with $a < b$. Then since $f(0)=0$ and $f(b)=b$, by the intermediate value theorem there is some $c$ with $f(c)=a$. But this implies $f(a)=f^2(c)=f(c)=a$, a contradiction since $a\in G$. Then we have shown that if $a\in G$ then all $b>a$ are also in $G$. In particular, if $z>0$ then $2z$ is in both $F$ (by the explicit calculation above) and $G$ (by this paragraph, by the definition of infimum), a contradiction. The only remaining possibility is $\inf G=0$. But then the connectedness of $F$ implies that $F=\{0\}.$ But in this case, since $f(R)=F$, necessarily $f(R)=0$ which implies that $a\oplus (a+b)= a = \min\{a,a+b\}$. But $\min$ does not have a unit in $R$. 

It's basically been pointed out in the comments that with this definition, there can be no such semiring structure on $R$ with addition as $\otimes$. This is because of the annihilation condition. Let $e$ be the unit of $\oplus$; then $e+a=e$ for all $a$ in $R$, which is not possible. 

where the relation is $$(\tau_0,m_1\otimes m_2\otimes m_3)\sim (\tau_0, m_2\otimes m_1\otimes \sigma(m_3)$$ in the ungraded case and $$ (\tau_0,m_1\otimes m_2\otimes m_3)\sim (-1)^{|m_1||m_2|}(\tau_0, m_2\otimes m_1\otimes \sigma(m_3) $$ in the graded case. In both cases $\sigma$ is the nontrivial element of $\Sigma_2$, which acts on $m_3\in M(2)$. This should fit with an intuition about operads that comes from algebra, because if you have two elements $a=m_1$ and $b=m_2$ in an algebra (of whatever sort) with a binary product $\mu m_3$, then you might expect $\mu_3(a,b)$ to agree with $\mu_3^{op}(b,a)$, and since you expect this to be universally true regardless of any properties of $a$, $b$, and $\mu$, it should be true in the free operad. 

Since $C_n(G)$ (for any finite $n$ and finite connected $G$ with at least one cycle or vertex of valence at least $3$) and $\Sigma_g$ (for $g\ge 1$) are both $K(\pi,1)$ spaces homeomorphic to CW complexes, showing they have isomorphic fundamental groups suffices to show that they are homotopy equivalent. The fact that configuration spaces of graphs are $K(\pi,1)$ is due to Ghrist. This gives a criterion (probably not practical in most cases) to answer question C. Since you have calculated that $C_3(\beta_4)$ and $\Sigma_{13}$ have isomorphic fundamental groups, this answers your question A in the affirmative.
