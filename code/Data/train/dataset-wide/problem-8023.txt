then something will go wrong. My suspicion is that it's impossible to construct the "cofibration; trivial fibration" factorisation: 

I’ve had trouble finding a well-established term for the following very obvious and elementary construction on strict partial orders (i.e. transitive, irreflexive relations): Given two strict partial orders $(X,<_X)$, $(Y,<_Y)$, there is a strict partial order on $X \times Y$ where $(x,y) < (x',y')$ just if one of the following cases holds: 

The background to the following observation is standard material in categorical logic, and I thought this was was too — I don’t remember learning it, but I don’t think it is original — but I can’t now find it anywhere in the literature. Does it ring a bell to anyone? Even if it is not in print, I would be interested to know if people have heard this discussed informally, to get an idea of which communities this is folklore in. Recall: a regular formula (over a signature $\Sigma$) is a formula constructed just from atomic formulas, finite conjunction, and existential quantification. $\newcommand{\x}{{\vec x}}\newcommand{\y}{{\vec y}}$Any regular sequent $\varphi(\x) \vdash_\x \psi(\x)$ is derivably equivalent to one in regular normal form, i.e. $\varphi'(\x) \vdash_{\vec x} \exists \y.\ \psi'(\x,\y)$, where $\varphi'$, $\psi'$ are conjunctions of atomics and $\psi'(\x,\y) \vdash_{\x,\y} \varphi'(\x)$ is derivable (this is D1.3.10 in the Elephant). If $\varphi(\x)$ is any conjunction of atomic formulas, then there is a $\Sigma$-structure $\newcommand{\str}[2]{\langle\!\langle\, #1 \ |\ #2 \,\rangle\!\rangle } \str{\x}{\varphi}$, generated by elements for each variable in $\x$, and with the interpretation just enough to make $\varphi$ hold. This represents the interpretation of $\varphi$: for any other structure $A$, $\newcommand{\Str}{\Sigma\text{-}\mathbf{Str}}\newcommand{\interp}[2]{[\![\, #1 \ |\ #2 \,]\!] } \interp{\x}{\varphi}^A \cong \Str(\str{\x}{\varphi}, A)$. Then (this is the fact I’m after) a structure validates a regular normal sequent $\varphi(\x) \vdash_{\vec x} \exists \y.\ \psi(\x,\y)$ just if it is injective w.r.t. the obvious map $\str{\x}{\varphi} \to \str{\x,\y}{\psi}$. Correspondingly, being a model of a regular theory $\mathbf{T}$ is a small-injectivity condition. 

Yes, and they can be arbitrary bicategories, not strict 2-categories. There’s a tricategory Bicat of bicategories, pseudofunctors, pseudo-natural transformations, and modifications; so working in this tricategory, we can run the usual argument for uniqueness (up to an invertible higher cell) of a two-sided inverse: $$ H \simeq H \cdot 1_D \simeq H \cdot (F \cdot G) \simeq (H \cdot F) \cdot G \simeq 1_C \cdot G \simeq G.$$ If you don’t want to rely on the full theorem that bicategories form a tricategory, then you can of course just check the few specific aspects of it that are required here (i.e. whiskering, the unitors, and the associator). Edit. I realise I missed mentioning one subtlety: we’re also relying on the fact that any pseudo-natural equivalence has a pseudo-natural quasi-inverse. So if we were using strictly natural transformations, or if we didn’t want to use AC, we’d be stuck at this step. I don’t know the answer to your question if one makes either of those changes to the setup (though for the working-without-choice setting, my preferred answer would be: we should have set it all up using ana-functors). 

You may well have resolved this question offline by now, but in any case, here’s a direct constructive argument that it’s well-founded. I’ll use a few background lemmas; all are straightforward, and iirc several are in Paul Taylor’s papers on constructive ordinals. Lemma 0. If $<_1$ is a subrelation of $<_2$ on the same set, and $<_2$ is a well-order, then so is $<_1$. Lemma 1. A finite lex product of well-orders is a well-order. Def 2. A fibration of sets-with-binary-relations is a map $f:X \to Y$, not necessary relation-preserving, such that whenever $y_1 < f(x_2)$, there's some $x_1<x_2$ with $f(x_1)=y_1$. Lemma 3. If $f:X\to Y$ is a surjective fibration and $X$ is a well-order, then so is $Y$. Def 4. Given a set-with-binary-relation $(X,<)$, and $x \in X$, write $X//x$ for the strict slice $\{ y\ |\ y < x\}$, and $X/x$ for the non-strict slice $\{ y\ |\ y \leq x \}$ (where “≤” is defined as “< or =”). Lemma 5. Suppose a relation is transitive, and every non-strict slice is well-founded. Then the whole relation is well-founded. Now: back to $LA$. Instead of your relation, work directly with its transitive closure, though all we really need to note is that this contains your relation (for invoking Lemma 0), and is transitive (to use Lemma 5 later). So we define: $l_1 < l_2$ if, writing $l_2$ as $[a_1,\ldots,a_n]$, there’s a decomposition $l_1 = m_1 ; \cdots ; m_n$ (where “;” is concatenation), such that for each $i ≤ n$, either $l_i = [a_i]$ or all entries of $l_i$ are $< a_i$, and such that for some $i$, it’s the latter. Lemma 6. For any list $l = [a_1,…,a_n]$, the concatenation map $\prod_i LA/[a_i] \to LA/l$ is a surjective fibration (with the lex ordering on the product). Main Lemma. For each $a \in A$, $LA/[a]$ is well-founded. Proof. Work by induction on $a$. Suppose it holds for all $b<a$. Then the strict slice $LA//[a]$ is w-f by combining all the lemmas above: each non-strict slice $LA/l$ of $LA//[a]$ is by Lemma 6 a surjective fibrant image of a lex product of slices $LA//[b]$, with $b < a$; by IH, these are each w-f, so by Lemma 1 their lex product is, so by Lemma 3, the slice $LA/l$ is, so putting this together for all $l < [a]$, the strict slice $LA//[a]$ is w-f by Lemma 5. It follows directly that so is the non-strict slice $LA/[a]$, as required. Theorem. $(LA,<)$ is well-founded. Proof. By Lemma 5, it’s enough to show that each slice $LA/[a_1,\ldots,a_n]$ is well-founded. For this, essentially repeat the inductive step of the main lemma: it’s a surjective fibrant image of a finite lex product of slices $LA/[a_i]$, which are each well-founded by the main lemma. 

So then putting these two together, one can see why a widget defined over the dual numbers should behave like some kind of an infinitessimal deformation: a widget, together with a tangent vector at that point in the space of widgets. (This may be literally true if there's a good moduli space of widgets!) 

These are somewhat subjective, of course; I’m sure someone who prefers Bilaniuk’s definition could give some good counter-points. 

Besides the points mentioned in other answers, a theorem or proposition is usually something whose main import is reasonably clear from the statement. A lemma, by contrast, is often a statement whose interest is less obvious until one sees it used. So “if $X$ has diameter $< 1/2$, then the ring $St(X)$ is commutative” would be a theorem or proposition, depending on how important/difficult it is, since it’s clear to the reader what the statement means and why you might want to know it. But “if $X$ has diameter $< 1/2$ and the ambient braiding is sylleptic, then there is some $k$ for which all primary ideals of $St(X)$ are $k$-dense” is more likely to be a lemma. 

The interpretation of types as spaces shows that the types of plain Martin-Löf type theory can look like homotopically non-trivial spaces (unlike e.g. the sets of ZF(C), which are always homotopically discrete). However, in plain Martin-Löf type theory, you can’t prove that there must exist homotopically non-trivial types. It’s consistent that every type “is a set”, in the sense of being homotopically discrete. This follows from the fact that you can also model types as plain old sets, in ZF(C) or any similar theory. Univalence implies that there must exist homotopically non-trivial types. Specifically, once you add both univalence and higher inductive types, then (as shown in the HoTT book, and various papers on synthetic homotopy theory) you can reproduce many standard constructions of spaces from classical homotopy theory, and show that they behave how you’d expect them to in many ways: e.g. that the fundamental group of the circle is $\mathbb{Z}$, just to name the simplest non-trivial such fact. So from the point of view of the homotopy interpretation of type theory, the rôle of univalence is ensuring that enough homotopically non-trivial types exist for the world to look like a reasonable homotopy-theoretic world. One approach to making this precise is to say that univalence should force the universe (or a hierarchy of universes, or something) to be an object classifier (or classiying family, or something) in the sense of Lurie’s ∞-topos theory — though this idea hasn’t been made precise yet. This isn’t the only rôle of univalence: it’s not Voevodsky’s original motivation, for example. That was roughly, as I understand it, to allow more powerful and natural reasoning about how constructions respect equivalence, because pragmatically one often needs to use such reasoning when formalising mathematics in type theory. But it’s the essential rôle that univalence plays from the point of view of the homotopy-theoretic interpretation. 

Yes, it is possible. Precisely, we can write down a first-order theory for which a model is a pair of ETCS-models and a geometric morphism between them (am I right in thinking this is what you're asking for?). To do this, on top of axiomatising “a pair of models of ETCS”, you add some extra function symbols for the adjunction. The conditions of functoriality, etc. are easily written algebraically; the adjunction can be expressed in various ways, of which the simplest to write down is probably the triangle-inequalities form. “Preserving finite limits”, when you write it out, is also just a scheme of first-order conditions; if you want to reduce it to a finite axiomatisation, note that it's enough to ask for preservation of finite products and equalisers (by the usual proof that all finite limits can be constructed from these). This said, I disagree somewhat with an implicit premise of your question. You say: “Then one can define the category of ETCS categories…” But to do this, you don't need to show that geometric morphisms can be defined in first-order terms. To talk about “the category of ETCS categories”, you already need to be working in a meta-theory with some sort of notion of set or similar (eg types, etc.); and so don't need the definitions of the morphisms to be first-order. The foundational advantage of a first-order axiomatisation of widgets is that you can then study a single widget without needing any meta-theory. But to study the collection of all widgets (as a category or whatever else), you still need a meta-theory. 

...defined just like how, in the case of (pre)sheaves, you define a matching family of sections on a cover. A product is then the case where there's no matching condition to satisfy. An intersection (let's say of subobjects $A,B \subseteq X$) is the case where the matching condition forces all three elements to be the same (as elements of $X$), so an element of the limit is a single element of $X$ that can be seen also as an element of $A$ and as $B$. (This answer is pretty much a sub-quotient of Martin B's earlier answer, but I think it's a useful one-liner to extract.) 

$\newcommand{\C}{\mathcal{C}}\epsilon_X : \C(-,F(X)) \to [\C'](-,X)$ is injective because $\epsilon_X$ is mono, and is surjective by the definition of $[\C']$ together with the universal property of $\epsilon_X$ in the adjunction. If $\C'' \subseteq \C' \subseteq \C$ are successively right rejective, with adjoints $F'$, $F$ to their inclusions $i'$, $i$, then the inclusion $i'' : \C'' \subseteq \C$ has a right adjoint given by $F' \cdot F$, as Julian Kuelshammer says in comments. 

No, epic is not sufficient; there is a counterexample in Pos, the category of posets. Take A, B, and X each to be the discrete two-element poset $\{0,1\}$; take C, Y, and Z to be the same elements with their natural ordering. $\{ 0 < 1 \}$; and take all maps to be identities on underlying sets. On the other hand, split epic is sufficient in any category; this is a reasonably straightforward diagram chase. Trying to weaken this, I would suspect (though I haven’t checked it) that in regular categories, regular epic may well be a sufficient condition; certainly regular categories (and strengthenings like exact categories) give a natural setting for these sorts of interactions between epis and pullbacks. 

Say a widget is special if it satisfies the following axiom: if there is any element which is fixed by all $f_i$, then all elements of $X$ are equal. Now widgets are finitary essentially-algebraic structures, and specialness is an infinitary essentially-algebraic condition; so there’s an evident notion of map between widgets — i.e. a map preserving the operations whenever they’re defined — and the categories of these structures and maps are very well-behaved. Write $\newcommand{\W}{\mathbf{W}}\W$ for the category of widgets; $\W^\mathrm{sp}$ for the category of special widgets; and $\W_n$ for the category of objects like widgets, but with only the first $(n-1)$-many operations. Resolving the adjunction of the forgetful functor $\W^\mathrm{sp} \to \newcommand{\Set}{\mathbf{Set}}\Set$, I claim we get exactly the tower of forgetful functors $\cdots \to \W_2 \to \W_1 \to \Set$; and the limit of this tower is just $\W$. But now the monad of the forgetful functor $\W^\mathrm{sp} \to \W$ is not the identity — in fact, this adjunction is monadic. 

It depends on precisely how you are choosing to deal with size distinctions in the definition of category. For universe-based approaches, the answer is “no, there is universal category”. For the class-/set-based approach, I don’t know what the answer is. 

Andrew Pitts’ note “Tripos Theory in Retrospect” sheds some useful light on $\mathcal{Eff}$, from a slightly different angle than most other books do. It’s available at his publications page, and also at doi:10.1017/S096012950200364X (paywalled but potentially more durable). For my part, even as quite a toposophile, $\mathcal{Eff}$ (and realizability toposes in general) took me a while to get comfortable with — a lot longer than any of the other genres, sheaves, syntactic ones, etc. In the end it must have taken about four or five attempts to get to grips with them, over several years — spending a little time getting a little way on each attempt, understanding one step in the construction (e.g.: the tripos-to-topos step in general), then waiting a few months while that sank in, before coming back for another crack at the next step. This certainly isn’t everyone’s experience, of course, but I’ve talked to at least a couple of other people who had a similar time. 

Not weakened at all! In PA and ZFC (and a wide class of other f-o theories), every defining formula is equivalent to one with no closed subformula. Let's start with ZFC. Suppose $\varphi(x)$ is a defining formula, with $x$ free; now let $z$ be any variable not appearing anywhere in $\varphi$, and for each subformula $\psi$ of $\varphi$, define a new formula $\psi^z(z)$ (with all the same free variables as $\psi$, plus $z$) by: 

On the other hand, there are some more recent set/type theories in which equality isn’t given, or is a more flexible notion. In some versions of the Calculus of Constructions, if I remember right, there is a universe of small sets (possibly multiple universes), and an arbitrary product of sets is again a set, possibly in some higher universe (this has to be formulated carefully to avoid inconsistency); and each set has equality on it, but there’s no equality on the universe(s). So there, vector spaces wouldn’t form a set, and wouldn’t have an equality relation; but beasts would form a set (a certain product of hom-sets) so would have an equality relation. (The C of C’s is a little out of what I know, so this may need correcting by someone more knowledgeable.) Similarly, there are versions of Martin-Löf Type Theory with identity types which address this issue; roughly, identity types can represent something like an ordinary equality relation, but more generally they can also look like the sets/categories of (weak) ismorphisms in a (higher) category. So you can define an object to be 0-categorical[1] if all its identity types are just truth-values; then an arbitrary product of 0-categorical types is again 0-categorical. In this setup, the type of all vector spaces within some universe will have identity types, so equality of a sort, but not of the objectionable kind — “equality” of vector spaces will exactly be isomorphism between them. The type of beasts over this universe will now be 0-categorical: we will have equality of beasts in the simplest sense. (Also, in this foundation, all beasts will automatically respect isomorphism!)
