I am reading the paper "The category of good modules over a quasi-hereditary algebra has almost split sequences", the link is here:$URL$ In the paper, $A$ is an artin algebra, and $A$-mod the category of (finitely generated) $A$-modules. Let $\Theta=\{\Theta(1), \dots, \Theta(n) \}$ be a finite set of $A$-modules with $Ext^1_A(\Theta(j), \Theta(i))=0$ for $j \geq i$. We denote $\mathcal{F}(\Theta)$ the full subcategory of $A$-mod of direct summands of modules having a filtration with factors in $\Theta$. I have some questions about $\mathcal{F}(\Theta)$: 

Let $A$ be a left coherent ring, that is, a ring for which the kernel of any homomorphisms between finitely generated projective modules are finitely generated. $T^{\bullet}\in \mathcal{K}^b(A-proj)$ is a tilting comples over $A$ with $B = End_{ \mathfrak{D}^b(A)-mod}(T^{\bullet})$. Then we know that $\mathfrak{D}^b(A-mod)$ and $\mathfrak{D}^b(B-mod)$ are equivalent as triangulated categories. I have seen in a paper that"There is a $F:\mathfrak{D}^b(B-mod)\rightarrow \mathfrak{D}^b(A-mod) $ an equivalence of triangulated categories such that $F(B)=T^{\bullet}$. $F$ induces an quivalence $F'$ of the homotopy categories from $\mathcal{K}^b(B-proj)$ to $\mathcal{K}^b(A-proj)$". So I want to ask: 

Let A be an algebra. We denote by by A-proj the full subcategory of A-mod consisting of projective modules. An A-module T is called a tilting module if $proj.dim(_{A}T)=n < \infty$, $Ext_{A} ^{j} (T,T) =0$ for all $j > 0$, and there is an exact sequence $ 0 \rightarrow _A A \rightarrow X_0 \rightarrow X_1 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow X_n \rightarrow 0$ in A-mod with all $X_j \in add(T)$. Let T be a tilting A-module of projective dimension $n \geq 1$, then fix a minimal projective resolution of T as follows: $ 0 \rightarrow P_n \rightarrow P_{n-1} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow P_1 \rightarrow P_0 \rightarrow T \rightarrow 0$. Then can anyone tell me why A-proj =$ add(\oplus _{i=0} ^n P_i)$? Thank you. 

For instance, have a look at the book "Einstein manifolds" by Arthur L. Besse, on page 179. The action of $G_2$ on $S^6$ comes from its lowest dimension nontrivial representation, which is $7$-dimensional: the inclusion $G_2\subset SO(7)$ is realized by recalling that $G_2$ is the group of automorphisms of the real division algebra of Cayley numbers (octonions). The actions of $Spin(7)$ and $Spin(9)$ come from their spin representations. The other groups are classical and act by their standard (natural, vector) representations. 

I think the definitive work on that has been done by Hector Sussmann (Orbits of families of vector fields and integrability of distributions. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 180 (1973), 171â€“188, freely available here). Let $D$ be a smooth subbundle of $TM$ and $G$ the pseudo-group of local diffeomorphims generated by the flows of smooth sections of $D$. Sussmann proved there is a smallest $G$-invariant smooth distribution $\bar D$ containing $D$, which moreover is involutive and admits maximal integral manifolds through any point. It is important to note that the dimension of $\bar D_x$ will not be constant for $x\in M$. We have $\bar D=D$ if and only if $D$ is $G$-invariant. Sussmann paper indeed studies a more general situation, appropriate for control theory, and contains many more very interesting results about the complete integrability of distributions. In fact I would recommend it as a "classic". 

For field coefficients (say in characteristic zero), we can look at cohomology. A simply-connected compact Lie group has the homotopy type of its semisimple factor,so you can reduce to the semisimple case. Now we can pass to Lie algebra cohomology and use the second Whitehead lemma stating that $H^2(\mathfrak g,\rho)=0$ for any representation $\rho$ of $\mathfrak g$. If you are interested in the second homotopy group and likes Morse theory and theory of roots for Lie algebras, a nice alternative is the following. First, note that $\pi_2(X)\cong\pi_1(\Omega X)$ for any topological space $X$ with base point $x_0$, where $\Omega X$ denotes the space of loops in $X$ based at $x_0$. In fact elements of $\pi_2(X)$ are given by continuous maps of the square $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ into $X$ which send the boundary to $x_0$. Such a map can be viewed as a $1$-parameter family of loops in $X$, that is a map $[0,1]\to \Omega X$. Alternatively, one can consider the path fibration $\Omega X\to PX \to X$ where $PX$ is the space of continuous paths starting at $x_0$ and the arrows represent respectively the inclusion and the end-point map. The total space $PX$ is contractible to the constant path $X\to x_0$ so the homotopy exact sequence of the fibration yields that $\pi_n(X)\cong\pi_{n-1}(\Omega X)$ for $n\geq1$. If $G$ is arcwise connected, this remark also implies that any two fibers of this fibration have the same homotopy type. Next, take $X=G$ with the identity element as base point. Since $G$ is a compact Lie group, one can construct a bi-invariant Riemannian metric in $G$, that is a metric that is invariant under left and right translations (essentially by averaging with respect to a Haar measure). Consider the energy functional $E:\Omega_{e,g} G\to[0,+\infty)$, $E(\gamma)=\int_0^1||\dot\gamma||^2\,dt$, where $\Omega_{e,g}G$ denotes the space of paths joining the identity element $e$ to a regular element $g\in G$. Since $g$ is a regular, $E$ is a Morse function (and this is the reason for using $\Omega_{e,g}G$ in place of $\Omega G$, but recall that they are homotopy equivalent). Its critical points are exactly the geodesic segments joining $e$ to $g$. In the bi-invariant metric, these are segments of one-parameter groups which are exponential images of line segments in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak t$ of the maximal torus $T$ of $G$ through $g$ which join the origin to a point in $\exp^{-1}(g)\cap\mathfrak t$. This is a discrete set in $\mathfrak t$, and since $G$ is simply-connected, contains exactly one element in each connected component of the complement of the union of the singular hyperplanes (those hyperplanes where some root takes an integral value). The Morse index theorem says that the index of such a geodesic segment is the sum with multiplicities of the conjugate points along the geodesic. Finally conjugate points correspond to intersection points of the geodesic with the singular hyperplanes, and the corresponding multiplicity equals the real dimension of the root space which is always $2$. The bottom line is that $E$ is a Morse function with critical points only of even index. It follows that $E$ is a perfect Morse function and $\Omega G$ is a CW-complex with no cells of odd dimension. In particular $\Omega G$ is simply-connected. Edit: A variation of the preceding argument, perhaps shorter. For an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ and a point $p\in M$, we have that the complement of $Cut(p)$ in $M$ is diffeomorphic to an open ball $B^n$, where $Cut(p)$ denotes the cut locus of $p$ (essentially, the locus of points where geodesic rays from $p$ cease to be minimizing). A compact Lie group can be equiped with a bi-invariant metric, and if $G$ is simply-connected one shows that the cut locus and first conjugate locus of a point coincide (true for any simply-connected symmetric space of compact type), for instance by direct computation, and in fact if $p=e$ is the identity element, both loci coincide with the singular elements (with respect to the adjoint action). Again from the fact that root spaces have real dimension $2$, onde deduces that the singular set has codimension $3$. In particular, by transversality a continuous map $S^2\to G$ can be deformed to avoid the singular set and hence deformed to a point. 

Let $A$ be a k-algebra,where k is a fixed field. We denote by $\mathfrak{D}^b(A-mod)$ the bounded derived A-module category. A complex $Z^{\bullet}=(Z^i,d^i) \in \mathfrak{D}^b(A-mod)$ such that all $Z^i$ are finitely generated projective is quasi-isomorphic to the following complex $$ \cdots \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow Coker(d^{-n-1}) \rightarrow Z^{-n+1} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow Z^{-2} \rightarrow Z^{-1} \rightarrow Ker(d^0) \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow \cdots $$ So we can see $H^i(Z^{\bullet})=0$ for $i <-n$ or $i >0 $. Then how can I get that $Coker(d^{-n-1})$ is finitely presented module? And how to get the projective dimension of $Coker(d^{-n-1})$ is finite? 

$A$ and $B$ are said to be $Morita $ $equivalent$ if the category $Mod A$ and $Mod B$ are equivalent. $A$ and $B$ are said to be $derived$ $equivalent$ if $\mathcal{D}^b(Mod A)$ and $\mathcal{D}^b(Mod B)$ are equivalent as triangulated categories. Given a minimal injective resolution of $A$ as an $A$-module$$0 \rightarrow A \rightarrow I_0 \rightarrow I_1 \rightarrow \dots$$ If n is maximal with the property that all modules $I_j$ are projective for $j<n$, then n is called the $dominant$ $dimension$ of $A$. 

I'm reading the paper "the classification of algebras by dominant dimension" by Bruno J.Mueller, the link is here $URL$ In the proof of lemma 3 on page 402, there is a place I can't understand. Who can tell me what $E_R \oplus * \cong \oplus X_R$ and $_AHom_R(E,X)\oplus * \cong \oplus _AHom_R(X,X)\cong \oplus_AA$ mean? 

How to show the functor $F=D Hom(-, I_0(\Gamma)): S \rightarrow mod End_{\Gamma}(I_0(\Gamma))$ is an equivalence? If the dominant dimension of $\Gamma \geq 2$, then $\Gamma \in S$. Then how to get that $F(\Gamma)$ is a generator and cognerator of $mod End_{\Gamma}(I_0(\Gamma))$? (A module is called a generator and cogenerator if it contains all idecomposable projecitve and injecitve modules as direct summands) 

Note that this a $4$-dimensonal solvable Lie algebra and $a$, $a^\dagger$, $1$ span an ideal isomorphic to the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg algebra. So one realization is obtained by taking $$ a=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}0&1&0\\0&0&0\\0&0&0\end{array}\right),\quad a^\dagger=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}0&0&0\\0&0&1\\0&0&0\end{array}\right),\quad 1=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}0&0&1\\0&0&0\\0&0&0\end{array}\right). $$ Now the adjoint action of $H$ on this ideal has this matrices as eigenvectors with respective eigenvalues $1$, $-1$, $0$, so we finish by taking $$ H=\frac12\left(\begin{array}{ccc}1&0&0\\0&-1&0\\0&0&1\end{array}\right). $$ We can also realize the elements of this Lie algebra as vector fields on $\mathbb R^4$. Namely, we modify the standard realization of the Heisenberg algebra as vector fields on $\mathbb R^3$ (with coordinates $(x,y,z)$) by adding a fourth coordinate $w$: $$ a = e^w\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-\frac y2\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right),\quad a^\dagger = e^{-w}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\frac x2\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right),\quad 1=\frac{\partial}{\partial z},\quad H=\frac{\partial}{\partial w}.$$ 

In complex analysis of one variable, Liouville's theorem says that a bounded entire function is constant. Bernstein (1915-17) proved an analogous result in differential geometry, namely, if the graph of a function $f:\mathbf R^2\to\mathbf R$ of class $C^2$ is a minimal surface in $\mathbf R^3$, then the graph a plane. He then posed the classical Bernstein problem, namely, whether the same result also holds for real functions of $n>2$ variables. In terms of differential equations: 

I like the following theorem of Gleason and Palais ($URL$ Let $G$ be a locally arcwise connected topological group in which some neighborhood of the identity admits a continuous one-to-one map into a finite dimensional metric space. Then $G$ is a (real) Lie group. This result follows from a criterion they prove in the same paper which says that a locally arcwise connected topological group is a Lie group provided that its compact metrizable subspaces are of bounded dimension. As they put it, "the criterion is remarkable in that local compactness is not one of the assumptions."
