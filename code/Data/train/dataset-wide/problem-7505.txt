Suppose $S$ is a semigroup (or a monoid, or a category), and $X$ is an $S$-set -- that is, a set with an action of $S$. Say that a sub-$S$-set $Y$ is "downward closed" (or maybe "well-generated") if for any $x \in X$ such that $sx \in Y$ for some $s \in S$, we have $x \in Y$. Has this notion been defined before? I'm really mostly wondering because I'd like to give this a good name. Notice that if $S$ is a group, this just collapses to any sub-$S$-set since we have inverses. On the other hand, the analogous notion for a module would be the following: a submodule $N$ of $M$ is downward closed if whenever $rm \in N$, $m \in N$. This is related to the notion of a dense submodule, but distinct. 

Suppose $A$ is a differential graded-commutative algebra (in non-negative degree) over a char-0 field, with $|d| = -1$, such that $A$ is finitely generated in degree $\le 1$ with relations in degree $\le 2$. Suppose $A_0$ is finite-dimensional, so that each $A_i$ is as well. We can form the Hilbert series of its homology: \begin{equation}H(t) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \text{dim}(H_i(A)) t^i\end{equation} Is it known if $H(t)$ is rational? I've found the paper 'On the Hilbert series of the homology of differential graded algebras' by Gulliksen, which is obviously relevant, but I don't think it answers my question. Also note that I don't assume $A$ is connected. Thanks! 

There is in fact a classification of non-compact surfaces, though it is more involved; see $URL$ for a decent explanation. This classification does indeed imply that a non-compact simply-connected surface is homeomorphic to the plane. 

If $G$ is a finite group, we know the irreducible representations of $G ≀ S_n$ (over $\mathbb Q$) are classified by partitions of $n$ 'decorated' by an irrep of $G$. I'm wondering to what extent the same classification holds if $G$ is infinite: what are the indecomposable representations of $G ≀ S_n$ over $\mathbb Q$? Is there ever any kind of similar classification, or is it totally hopeless? I'm willing to impose as many conditions on $G$ as necessary: for example, what if $G = \mathbb{Z}^n$? 

This was surprising because before that point I had considered the two sides of a coproduct to be reversible, but they can no longer be considered so if the first set is designated as the collection of "normal" outputs and the second set is designated as paramaterizing an "exceptional" result. My question: are there other places where an function/arrow to a coproduct is viewed as an alternative between a normal/regular outcome on one side and an exceptional/irregular outcome on the other? Though I can't think of many right now, I'm guessing there must be computations (etc) where coproducts have an asymmetric normal vs irregular interpretation. 

First, some setup: So: given a commutative ring $R$, let $Ideals(R)$ be set of ideals of $R$ and let $IdealClosure(R)$ be the set of closure operations $cl: \mathcal{P}(R) \rightarrow Ideals(R)$. In other words, let $IdealClosure(R)$ be the set of functions $cl: \mathcal{P}(R) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(R)$ such that 

Recently I have come across the books Combinatorial Commutative Algebra by Miller and Sturmfels along with Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra by Stanley. I will soon own a copy of each. I also purchased a used copy of Multiplicities and Chern Classes in Local Algebra by Roberts. My question is about the edge of research in commutative algebra. Which books (such as the above?) represent the edge of current research? By that I mean complete comprehension of such a book would prepare one to tackle a valuable (but doable) open problem for graduate research. Perhaps this edge is better represented by articles and papers. Are there a lot of these being published and how has this varied over time? I'm trying to get at the current state of the area of commutative algebra by considering the more concrete topic of current literature on the topic, especially the literature that is spawning new open problems. 

Let us consider a function $f\in C^2$, and convex such that the Hessian $H\le LI$. We consider following minimization problem: $$\min_{x\in \mathbb{R}^n }f(x)$$ Let us consider the following iterative process for estimating the minimizer, $$x^{k+1}=x^k-A \nabla f(x^k)$$ where the matrix $A$ can be singular. It is well known, that if $A=\mu I$, a suitable Lyapunov function to use for checking convergence, is the function $f$ itself, as in that setting we have $$f(x^{k+1})\le f(x^k)-(\mu-\mu^2L/2)\|\nabla f(x^k)\|_2^2 $$ which shows descent property for $0<\mu <2/L$. My question is, 

Just an idea. I think the best way to start is to expand on the structure of the matrices $D, C$. For example, $D$ can be readily seen to be expressible in the form $$\alpha M_1\otimes I_2=\alpha\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \mathbf{0}^T\\ \mathbf{0} & J \end{bmatrix}\otimes I_2$$ where $J=diag(1,2,,\cdots)$. I think the structure of matrix $A$ can be expressed as $\beta M_2\otimes B$ where $$M_2=\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots\\ 1 & 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & \cdots\\ 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & \sqrt{3} & \cdots\\ 0& 0 & \sqrt{3} & 0 & \cdots\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots\end{bmatrix},\\B=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\\ -1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$$ Now the problem becomes finding $(\epsilon\beta M_2\otimes B+\alpha M_1\otimes I_2 )^{-1}.$ 

For example, let $g(x) = x^2$. If $x_0<1$, then we have $x_n = x_0^{2^n}\stackrel{n\to \infty}{\to} 0$, and the rate of convergence is quadratic. Note that if $g$ is Lipschitz, then I can always find an initial condition suitably so that the sequence converges to $0$ linearly. However, this estimated rate would only be an upper bound on the actual rate, as it was seen for the $x^2$ example, the actual rate is quadratic and is thus very fast. Please provide some references to relevant literature. Thanks in advance. 

More concretely, are there other cardinality related restrictions one can put on a TVS to obtain decent results, or are such pursuits apparently fruitless? Is any cardinality restriction looser than separability useful? [Note: Model Theory would have a lot to say about this, but I'm looking for additional perspectives as well. In addition, we could ask the same question about other structures, but I'd like to start with something concrete.] 

Both seem fine, but like Lee's book, they don't quite cover all the topics you'd want to have covered. Getting past all the foundation work seems to be quite a lot of work indeed. 

Given a topological vector space $V$, let its density be the smallest cardinal $A$ such that a set of cardinality $A$ is dense in $V$. Naively, it seems one of two things happen: 

Note that since the ideals of a ring form a bounded lattice, the set $IdealClosure(R)$ is also a bounded lattice. Now if $\mathcal{R}$ is some set of rings, let $IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ be the collection of functions which assign to each ring $R$ an element of $IdealClosure(R)$. Again, $IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ is a bounded lattice by defining the lattice operations pointwise, ring by ring. Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a set containing at least one representative from each isomorphism class of the finitely presented commutative rings. Then we can assume $\mathcal{R}$ is countable. It seems then that given a few more 'naturality' conditions the set $IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ would likewise countable. For example, without going to far into symbolic logic, a natural ideal closure operator would be defined by one of a countable collection of statements in FOL or ZFC. One obvious condition is this: an ideal closure operation should treat isomorphic rings equivalently, or more formally: if $R_1 \in \mathcal{R}$, $R_2 \in \mathcal{R}$, $\varphi: R_1 \rightarrow R_2$ is an isomorphism, and $cl_1 = c(R_1)$, $cl_2 = c(R_2)$ where $c \in IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ then $\varphi[cl_1(A)] = cl_2[\varphi(A)]$ for all $A \subseteq R$. What other conditions are reasonable? Are such sets of closure operations studied? 

Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ be a given function and let us consider the unconstrained problem, $$\min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n}f(x)$$ The standard iterative method for this is the gradient descent technique, where one iteratively generates the following sequence of points, $$x^{n+1}=x^n-\mu_ng(x^n)$$ where $\mu_n,n\ge 0$ is a sequence of positive stepsizes, and $g(x)=\nabla f(x)$ is the gradient operator. My question is the following: 

Any reference to literature and existing techniques will be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Edit: Another observation that I have made is that, if we have some $x^\star$ such that $\nabla f(x^\star)=0$, we can write the following $${x}^{n+1}-{x}^\star=({I-AG}({x}^\star,\ {x}^n))({x}^n-{x}^\star)$$ where $$G({x}^\star,\ {x}^n)=\int_0^1 \nabla^2f(x^\star+\tau(x^n-x^\star))d\tau$$ Then, analyzing convergence of the sequence $\{x^n\}$ is equivalent to finding suitable conditions on the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of $AG({x}^\star,\ {x}^n)$. Does the function $\|x-x^\star\|_2$ then qualify as a Lyapunov function? Even if it is true, I can not find an analog of $f(\cdot)$ which acts a Lyapunov function for the general case. I have read a few sections of the paper that @dohmatob referred in the comments, but I think I cannot find a Lyapunov function for this problem using the techniques introduced in that paper. The matrix $A$ is creating the problem. 

You can try applying gradient ascent method and run it for a few iterations to get an initial guess for $\mathbf{t}$. As the function is strongly concave, the gradient ascent is sure to converge to its unique global maxima, and so running it for a few iterations will produce a good approximation for the true global maxima. Actually, by analyzing the gradient ascent steps, you can estimate how many iterations you need to run it for the approximation to meet a prespecified approximation error required for the Newton-Raphson/Halley method to succeed. See this for such a discussion. 

Is there a method to find a tight upper bound on the given integral? Note that the integral is upper bounded by $\sqrt{\pi/2}$, and thus converges. I first thought about applying Laplace's method. However, the function $-x^2/2-a(1-e^{-x})$ is decreasing and achieves maximum at $x=0$ which is an endpoint of the domain of integration. As a result, I don't think using Laplace method is a good idea to find an upper bound. Numerical evaluation indicates an asymptotic of $\sim \frac{1}{a}$, but I am not sure how to proceed to say anything about an upper bound in terms of $a$. Any ideas? Thanks in advance. 

TVS's $V$ of larger and larger cardinality become more and more pathological / difficult / intractable or, There is a cardinal $A_{max}$ so that almost all pathological behavior exhibited in any TVS is exhibited in a TVS of density $A$ less than or equal to $A_{max}$. 

First, some background: recently in learning more about functional programming I saw one use for coproducts that surprised me a little bit: A function $f: A \rightarrow B \coprod C$ may result when considering a computation that starts with an $a \in A$ and results with an element of $B$ unless "something exceptional happens" in which case it results in an element in $C$ that describes / paramaterizes some sort of 

Does such a book exist? Perhaps a second volume such as "Topics in Smooth Manifolds" by John M. Lee would do. Alternatives to consider: 

Is there a single suitable reference to study for the smooth manifold (geometry) half of a typical Topology/Geometry PhD preliminary exam at an average AMS group I school? (Note: I know details about the presentation of these prelim tests varies, but at many schools there is a single Topology/Geometry exam, half of which is roughly smooth manifolds "Geometry" and the other half algebraic topology "Topology") Being a bibliophile, I've invested some time looking around at various qualifying exam syllabi until something stuck out: for Topology, relatively fewer books are listed. It seems quite often a book like Algebraic Topology by Hatcher is listed along with one or two others (seemingly to cover certain small gaps). Also, for Algebra, a few books often suffice... the books by Lang, Jacobson, and Dummit & Foote are often listed. One or two of these together with an outlier often suffice. Compare that to the situation with smooth manifolds. One site (which I lost track of... UCR?) I saw listed as many as 8 books as references for the topic! Many universities seem to use Guillemin & Pollack despite teaching manifolds abstractly, rather than as submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is understandable, but somewhat pedagogically suspect and in my own experience as a student, confusing. It appears that the topic of smooth manifolds needs an expository text that fills the same role for Geometry as does Algebraic Topology (Hatcher) does for Topology. Some sensible criteria: 

One observation: $$A = I+L,$$ where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with $0$ in the diagonals. This matrix $L$ can be seen to satisfy $L^n=0$, and $L^j\ne 0,\ 1\le j\le n-1$. Thus, one can write $$A^{-1}=(I+L)^{-1}=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}(-1)^jL^j$$ 

The integral converges as it is easily seen to be upper bounded by $\sqrt{\pi/2}$. However, Laplace's method does not seem to work out as the maxima of the function $S(x) = -a\sqrt{1-e^{-x}}-x^2/2$ is located at the end point $0$. This question enquires about a similar problem, however, with the major difference that the $S(x)$ function there is given by $-a(1-e^{-x})-x^2/2$. The second answer to that problem suggests using a modified form of Laplace's method as given by V. Zorich, Mathematical Analysis II Chap. XIX, Par. 2.4, Theorem 1, to tackle the issue of maxima at an endpoint. However, for the problem at hand, this method breaks down as the function $S(x)$ is not differentiable at $0$. So, Laplace's method cannot be applied here. I tried using the transformation $1-e^{-x}\to x^2$ to obtain the integral $$\int_0^1 \frac{\exp(-a x-(\ln(1-x^2))^2/2)}{1-x^2}2xdx$$ From this, intuitively, it seems to me that, at least for large $a$, the integrand is concentrated highly around $0$, and there it seems to be approximated ``well'' by $2xe^{-ax}$, which produces a $\sim\frac{1}{a^2}$ trend. However, all this is very intuitive and I don't know how to transform this intuition into rigorous statements. Also, this intuition seems to serve well for getting asymptotics, but my true intention is to obtain tight upper bounds. As Laplace's method seems not to be a suitable choice, I do not have much idea about how to proceed to say anything about an upper bound. Please help. 

Let $\{X_n\}$ be an ergodic sequence of random variables, $X_n:(\Omega,\mathcal{F})\to (S,\mathcal{S})$ where the target set $S$ is a matrix ring. My question is,
