This "tensor product" is also known as the weighted colimit in enriched category theory. The short answer is that all the isomorphisms you are interested in always exist, provided the objects you are interested in also exist – it's just a matter of choosing the right definitions. In general, given a complete symmetric monoidal closed category $\mathcal{V}$, a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category $\mathcal{A}$, a small $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category $\mathcal{C}$, and $\mathcal{V}$-enriched functors $F : \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathcal{V}$ (a.k.a. a right $\mathcal{C}$-module) and $G : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{A}$, the $\mathcal{V}$-enriched weighted colimit $F \star G$ is an object in $\mathcal{A}$ equipped with isomorphisms $$[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}, \mathcal{V}](F, \mathcal{A} (G, a)) \cong \mathcal{A} (F \star G, a)$$ that are $\mathcal{V}$-enriched natural in $a$. Dually, given $\mathcal{V}$-enriched functors $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{V}$ and $G : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{A}$, the $\mathcal{V}$-enriched weighted limit $\{ F, G \}$ is an object in $\mathcal{A}$ equipped with isomorphisms $$[\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{V}](F, \mathcal{A} (a, G)) \cong \mathcal{A} (a, \{ F, G \})$$ that are $\mathcal{V}$-enriched natural in $a$. The $\mathcal{V}$-enriched Yoneda lemma yields: 

Forgive me if this is a well-known observation/result, but I'm quite new to graduate-level algebra and I was wondering if there are generalisations of the constructions I describe below. It's straightforward to see that the functor "adjoin an indeterminate to a ring" is the unit of the adjunction $F : \mathbf{Ring} \to \mathbf{Ring}_* : U$, where $U: \mathbf{Ring}_* \to \mathbf{Ring}$ is the forgetful functor from the category of pointed rings to the category of rings. Along similar lines, the functor "disjoint-union an element to a set" is the unit of the adjunction $F : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}_* : U$, and if I'm not mistaken, the functor "coproduct with $\mathbb{Z}$" is the unit of the adjunction $F : \mathbf{Grp} \to \mathbf{Grp}_* : U$. Indeed, in general, it seems that if a category has a notion of "free object on one generator", a notion of "pointed" objects, and binary coproducts, then the forgetful functor from the category of pointed objects has a left adjoint, and the unit of the adjunction is the functor which takes objects to their coproduct with the free object on one generator. 

As pointed out, the answer is no – because we cannot hope to have fibrant replacements in general. On the other hand, by following the programme of van Osdol [1977, Simplicial homotopy in an exact category], it is possible to quickly establish a weaker result: Theorem. For any regular category $\mathcal{S}$ (e.g. an elementary topos), the category of internal Kan complexes in $\mathcal{S}$ is a category of fibrant objects where the fibrations are the internal Kan fibrations and the trivial fibrations are the internal trivial Kan fibrations. (By Ken Brown's lemma, this suffices to determine the weak equivalences.) Here, "internal" refers to the internal logic of regular categories: for example, an internal trivial Kan fibration in $\mathcal{S}$ is a morphism between simplicial objects in $\mathcal{S}$ such that the matching morphisms (à la Reedy) are regular epimorphisms. Note however that we are using the "external" notion of simplicial objects. In the special case where $\mathcal{S}$ is a sheaf topos, the internal Kan fibrations and internal trivial Kan fibrations turn out to be the same thing as Jardine's local fibrations and local trivial fibrations. (See Theorem 1.12 in [1987, Simplicial presheaves].) It follows that the weak equivalences in the sense above are the same as Jardine's local weak equivalences. 

I would like to know, can we say that the "groups of Heisenberg type" where introduced by A. Kaplan in "Kaplan, A. (1980). Fundamental solutions for a class of hypoelliptic PDE generated by composition of quadratic forms. Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 258(1), 147-153." are introduced to generalize the classical Heisenberg group $\mathbb R^2\times \mathbb R$ or else ? Thank you in advance 

Choose a Schwartz function on $\mathbb C$ of the form $f(z)=f(r e^{i\theta})= f_0(r) e^{in\theta}$. Then $$(*) \quad f(e^{i\alpha} z)= e^{in\alpha} f(z), \quad \forall z\in \mathbb C.$$ Now, let $f$ a Schwartz function on $\mathbb C^2$, Now, can we hope to find a Schwartz function $f$ on $\mathbb C^2$ who to check the analog of $(*)$ in $\mathbb C^2$ for the harmonic spherical function $Y_m^p(l)$; $l\in \mathbb S^3$, i.e., the following identity $$(**) \quad f(l. z)= Y_m^p(l) f(z), \quad \forall z\in \mathbb C^2 \, ??$$ Thank you in advance 

Any reference that we can find the following series expansion $$f_{\alpha}(a) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \, (n+a)^{^\alpha}\, L^{(1)}_{n}(a),$$ where $a>0, \alpha>0$ and $L^{(1)}_{n}(.)$ are the generalized Laguerre polynomials. Thanks 

By making use of the generating function $$\sum_{m=0}^\infty \frac{H_m(x)}{m!} t^m=e^{-t^2 + 2xt} $$ for the real Hermite polynomials $H_m$, we get easily that $$(*)\quad \sum_{m,n=0}^\infty \frac{u^m}{m!} \frac{v^n}{n!} H_m(x+\frac{y}{2}) H_n(x-\frac{y}{2}) =e^{-(u^2+v^2) + 2x(u+v)+y(u-v)} .$$ I am looking for a reference which I find the analog of $(*)$ for the complex Hermite polynomials, i.e., a formula as follows $$\sum_{??}\, ?? \, H_{m,n}(z,\bar z) H_{k,l}(w,\bar w) = ?? .$$ Thank you in advance 

The real motion group of $\mathbb R^2$, $M(2)$ is the semi-direct product of $\mathbb R^2$ with the special orthogonal group $K = SO(2)$. A well known fact is that the unitary dual $\hat{G}$, of $G$ is precisely the collection M. Sugiura: Unitary Representations and Harmonic Analysis. Kodansha Scientific books, Tokyo (1975), p: 165 $$\{\pi_\lambda,\, \lambda>0 \}\cup\{\chi_n: \, n\in \mathbb Z \},$$ where $[\pi_{\lambda}(z,e^{i\alpha})u](s) = e^{i\lambda \left<z,e^{is}\right>} u(s-\alpha)$ for $u\in L^2([0,2\pi])$ and where $\chi_n(z,e^{i\alpha})=e^{in\alpha}$. Now, any references or someone can help me to write the analog of that in the cases of the complex motion group $G=\mathbb C^2 \rtimes SU(2)$ ? Thank you in advance $$................$$ Following the remark in Dual topology of the motion groups, p: 398, I tried to construct this representation!! For each linear form $l$ on $\mathbb C^2$ and any irreducible unitary representation $\rho$ of the stabilizer $S_l$ of l in $SU(2)$, we have that $\, \sigma_{(\rho,l)}=\rho\otimes\chi_l \, $ is an irreducible unitary representation of $H_l = S_l\rtimes \mathbb C^2$ whose restriction to $\mathbb C^2$ is a multiple of the character $\chi_l$ of $\mathbb C^2$ given by $\chi_l(z) = e^{−i\left<l,z\right>}$ ($z\in \mathbb C^2$), and the induced representation $\pi_(\rho,l) := ind^{G}_{H_l} \sigma(\rho,l)$ is an irreducible representation of $G$. If $r > 0$ is the radius of the sphere, we denote by $\chi_r$ the character associated with the linear form $l_r$ which is identified with the vector $(0, . . . , 0, r)^t$ .The stabilizer $S_{l_{r}}$ of $l_{r}$ is the subgroup $SU (1)$. Let us write $\rho_\mu$ instead of $\rho$ for the representation of $SU(1)$ with highest weight $\mu$ and $\pi(\mu,r)$ instead of $\pi(\rho_\mu,l_r)$. The representation $\pi(\mu,r)$ is realized on $L^2(SU(2))$ as follows; for all $(A, z)\in G$ and all $B \in SU(2)$ $$(*) \quad \pi(\mu,r)(A,z)F(B)=e^{i\left<B l_r, z\right>} F(A^{-1}B), \quad F\in L^2(SU(2)).$$ Finally, the unitary dual $\hat{G}$, of $G$ is precisely the collection: $$\{r>0, \rho\in\hat{SU(1)} \}\cup\{\pi \in\hat{SU(2)} \}.$$ Thank you in advance for any comments or suggestions!! 

Yes. First fix an increasing sequence of natural numbers $(n_k)$ such that $\frac{k}{n_k} \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$, $\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n_i} < 1$, and $\beta_k = n_k\cdot \sum_{i=k+1}^\infty \frac{1}{n_i} \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$. Let $(x_k)$ be a countable dense subset of $[0,1]$ and let $S$ be what remains of $[0,1]$ after an open interval $U_k$ of length $\frac{1}{n_k}$ centered at $x_k$ is removed, for all $k$. The set $S$ is closed and contains no intervals of positive length, so it is nowhere dense. Let $U$ be the complement of $S$, i.e., the union of the removed intervals. Fix $x \in [0,1]$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For any $i$, the number of elements of $U_i \cap (x + \frac{1}{n_k}\mathbb{Z})$ is at most $\frac{n_k}{n_i} + 1$. So the number of elements of $\bigcup_{i=1}^k U_i \cap (x + \frac{1}{n_k}\mathbb{Z})$ is at most $n_k\alpha + k = n_k\cdot (\alpha + \frac{k}{n_k})$. Now consider $$A_k = \left\{x \in [0,1]: U_i \cap \left(x + \frac{1}{n_k}\mathbb{Z}\right) \neq \emptyset\mbox{ for some }i > k\right\}.$$ The set of $x$ for which the intersection with $U_i$ is nonempty is precisely $[0,1] \cap (U_i + \frac{1}{n_k}\mathbb{Z})$, which has measure exactly $\frac{n_k}{n_i}$ (for $i > k$), so the entire set $A_k$ has measure at most $\beta_k$. Every point outside of this set will therefore satisfy $$\left|U \cap \left(x + \frac{1}{n_k}\mathbb{Z}\right)\right| \leq n_k\cdot \left(\alpha + \frac{k}{n_k}\right)$$ by the previous estimate. That is, for every $x \not\in A_k$, the fraction of $\frac{1}{n_k}$-translates of $x$ which lie in $S$ is at least $1 - (\alpha + \frac{k}{n_k})$, and the measure of $A_k$ goes to zero as $k \to\infty$. 

I used Mayura Draw to create approximately 100 illustrations for the second edition of my book on Lipschitz algebras, and I was really happy with it. 

Yes, see T. Ando, On hyponormal operators, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 14 (1963), 290-291. His main result states that $\|T^n\| = \|T\|^n$ for any hyponormal operator, which implies the conclusion by Gelfand's spectral radius formula. 

Is that easier to follow? No doubt this is also the proof that Don had in mind. (And it's also more or less what I was thinking, but this proof is Ilijas's, not mine. So I certainly don't deserve the credit here.) 

The answer to my question is no. Let $\mathcal{A} = M_2$ be the algebra of $2\times 2$ complex matrices, let $\mathcal{B}$ be the subalgebra of diagonal matrices, let $\mathcal{A}'$ be a C*-algebra which unitally contains $\mathcal{A}$, and let $\mathcal{B}'$ be a C*-subalgebra of $\mathcal{A}'$ which contains $\mathcal{B}$. $\mathcal{A}$ contains the matrix units $e_{11}$, $e_{12}$, $e_{21}$, $e_{22}$, and hence so does $\mathcal{A}'$. So we have $\mathcal{A}' \cong M_2\otimes \mathcal{C}$ for some other unital C*-algebra $\mathcal{C}$. Also, since $\mathcal{B}$ contains $e_{11}$ and $e_{22}$, we have $$\mathcal{B}' = e_{11}\mathcal{B}'e_{11} + e_{11}\mathcal{B}'e_{22} + e_{22}\mathcal{B}'e_{11} + e_{22}\mathcal{B}'e_{22} = \mathcal{B}'_{11} + \mathcal{B}'_{12} + \mathcal{B}'_{21} + \mathcal{B}'_{22}.$$ We have $P = e_{11} + e_{12} + e_{21} + e_{22}$. There are two cases. Case 1. $\mathcal{B}'_{12}$ contains an element $x$ satisfying $\|x - e_{12}\| < 1$. Then $\mathcal{B}'$ contains the element $y = e_{11} + x + x^* + e_{22}$, and we have $$\|y - P\| = \|(x - e_{12}) + (x^* - e_{21})\| = \|x - e_{12}\| < 1.$$ So in this case the distance from $\mathcal{B}'$ to $P$ is strictly less than 1. Case 2. We have $\|x - e_{12}\| \geq 1$ for all $x \in \mathcal{B}'_{12}$. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, we can find a norm one linear functional on $e_{11}\mathcal{A}'e_{22}$ which takes $e_{12}$ to $1$ and vanishes on $\mathcal{B}'_{12}$. By the isomorphism $e_{11}\mathcal{A}'e_{22} \cong \mathcal{C}$, this yields a state $h$ on $\mathcal{C}$. Then $f\otimes h$ and $g\otimes h$ are two states on $\mathcal{A}'$ which respectively extend $f$ and $g$, but $\mathcal{B}'$ does not separate them, because they agree on $\mathcal{B}'_{11} \subseteq e_{11}\mathcal{A}'e_{11}$ and $\mathcal{B}'_{22} \subseteq e_{22}\mathcal{A}'e_{22}$, and they both vanish on $\mathcal{B}'_{12}$ and $\mathcal{B}'_{21}$. So in this case $\mathcal{B}'$ fails to separate all extensions of $f$ and $g$. 

I think (1) is constructive, but (2) is not. Thus, using classical mathematics, we deduce that every sequent in (the language of) $\mathbb{T}$ that we can verify (by any means!) in the conservative model in $\mathcal{B}$ admits a proof in $\mathbb{T}$; but non-constructiveness in (2) prevents us from actually extracting that proof. Now, maybe the problem is that $\mathbb{T}$ potentially contains axioms of infinite length. So let's restrict to the finitary fragment of geometric logic, also known as coherent logic. There we have an even stronger completeness theorem: 

Yves Diers has the notion of a Zariski category in [Categories of commutative algebras], which apparently suffices to carry out a lot of commutative algebra in an axiomatic fashion. I reproduce the definition: 

It is well known that the underlying simplicial set of a simplicial group is a Kan complex. However, the underlying simplicial set of the canonical simplicial resolution (call it $F_\bullet G$) you describe has an extra degeneracy, so it is really just a disjoint union of contractible Kan complexes. In particular, the homotopy groups of $F_\bullet G$ are all trivial, and we recover the original group as $\pi_0$. But we haven't really used the fact that we have a simplicial group. To get back group homology, we apply the abelianisation functor to $F_\bullet G$. The homology of the associated chain complex is then $H_{* + 1} (G, \mathbb{Z})$ (this seems to be folklore), and the 0th homology is the abelianisation of $G$. I suppose this should be expected, since the abelianisation of $G$ is $G \otimes \mathbb{Z}$, where $\otimes$ here is defined to be universal with respect to bihomomorphisms. 

There is no difference for $\kappa = \aleph_0$. The point is that you can build colimits for filtered diagrams using just colimits for chains. 

So, when is $\mathbf{U} \subseteq \mathbf{U}^+$ adequate for the category scheme $\mathbf{Set}$, if $\mathbf{U} \in \mathbf{U}^+$? We take it as given that $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{U}^+$ are transitive models of ZFC. The first condition implies that this extension has no new subsets, and if there are no new subsets, there are no new functions either – so (1) holds if and only if the extension preserves powersets. By considering explicit constructions, one sees that equalisers are preserved, and as soon as we know (1), products are also preserved. We may then use the monadicity of $\mathscr{P} : \mathbf{Set}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ to deduce that colimits are preserved, so (1) implies (2). In particular, directed unions are preserved, so it follows that $\mathbf{U}$ embeds as an initial segment of the cumulative hierarchy of $\mathbf{U}^+$. What about (3)? Well, take a $\mathbf{U}$-set $I$ and a map $X : I \to \mathbf{U}$ in $\mathbf{U}^+$. By replacement in $\mathbf{U}^+$, we can form the disjoint union $\coprod_{i \in I} X(i)$, and if (3) holds, the cardinal of this set is in $\mathbf{U}$. Thus, $\mathbf{U}$ must actually be embedded as a Grothendieck universe in $\mathbf{U}^+$. Conversely, if $\mathbf{U}$ is embedded as a Grothendieck universe in $\mathbf{U}^+$, then (1), (2), and (3) are easily verified. But are Grothendieck universes enough? For instance, it would be good if the following were true: 

I would like to know why we have the equivalence between the following three statements of the Wiener-Tauberian theorem: version 1: If $I$ is a closed ideal in $L^1(\mathbb R)$, such that the set $hull(I)=\{\varphi: L^1(\mathbb R)\to \mathbb C \, \mbox{homomorphism}: \varphi(x) = 0\, \forall x\in I\}=\emptyset \, $, then: $I=L^1(\mathbb R)$. version 2: Every proper closed ideal in $L^1(\mathbb R)$ is contained in a maximal ideal. version 3: If $f\in L^1(\mathbb R)$, such that its Fourier transform $\hat f$ is a nowhere vanishing function on $\mathbb R$, then the closed ideal generated by f is whole of $L^1(\mathbb R)$, i.e., $\overline{span}\{f_{\tau},\, \tau \in \mathbb R\}= L^1(\mathbb R)$. Thank you in advance 

I would like compute the following $$I_{t,x,y} = \int_{\mathbb S^2} e^{-i\left<t,\omega\right>} \, e^{-i\left< A(\omega)x,y\right>} \, d\sigma(\omega); $$ where $\mathbb S^2$ is the two-dimensional sphere, $t\in \mathbb R^3, \, x,y\in \mathbb R^4$ and $A(.)$ is the matrix given by $$ A(s_1,s_2,s_3):= \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 0 & s_{1} & s_{2} & s_{3} \\ -s_{1} & 0 & s_{3} & -s_{2} \\ -s_{2} & -s_{3} & 0 & s_{1} \\ -s_{3} & s_{2} & -s_{1}& 0 \end{array} \right)$$ for all $s_1, s_2, s_3 \in \mathbb R$. 

Any reference that we can find the following $$\Bigr[-\log(1-t)\Bigr]^x = t^x + x t^x \sum_{k=0}^\infty \psi_k(x+k)\,t^{k+1}; \quad \mbox{for all} \, x\in \mathbb R, \, |t|<1$$ where $\psi_k(.)$ are the Stirling Polynomials (Stirling Polynomials). Thank in advance 

Can someone please clarify explicitly why: "The smallest closed subspace of $L^1(G/K)$ containing $L^1(G/K)^{\sharp}$ and invariant under the (left) $G$-action, is the full space $L^1(G/K)$". Where $G$ is a locally compact group, $L^1(G/K)$ the convolution space of all complex-valued integrable functions on $G/K$ and $L^1(G/K)^{\sharp}$ denote the closed subalgebra of $K$-invariant functions in $L^1(G/K)$, such that $K$ is a maximal compact subgroup of $G$. Thank you in advance 

The motion group of $\mathbb R^2$, noted by $G=M(2)$ is the semi-direct product of $\mathbb R^2$ with the special orthogonal group $K = SO(2)$. A well known fact is that the unitary dual $\hat{G}$, of $G$ is precisely the collection [see, Sugiura, M.: Unitary Representations and Harmonic Analysis. Kodansha Scientific books, Tokyo (1975), p: 165]: $$\{\pi_\lambda,\, \lambda\in>0 \}\cup\{\chi_n: \, n\in \mathbb Z \},$$ where $[\pi_{\lambda}(z,e^{i\alpha})u](s) = e^{i\lambda \left<z,e^{is}\right>} u(s-\alpha)$ and where $\chi_n(z,e^{i\alpha})=e^{in\alpha}$. Now, the infinite dimensional, unitary irreducible representations of the motion group $M(n)$ of $\mathbb R^n$ is given by [see, N. I. Vilenkin, (1978). Special functions and the theory of group representations (Vol. 22). American Mathematical Soc]: For each $\lambda>0$, a unitary representation $\pi_{\lambda}$ of $M(n)$ realized on $L^2(S^{n-1})$ is \begin{align*} (*) \quad [\pi_{\lambda}(a,k)u](\xi) = e^{i\lambda \left<x,\xi\right>}\, u(k^{-1}\xi), \end{align*} for $(x,k)\in M(n)=\mathbb R^n \rtimes SO(n)$ and $u \in L^2(S^{n-1})$. Apart from these family, we have another family $\{\chi_m, m \in ? \}$, of one dimensional unitary representations of $M(n)$, which ? Is what it is $\chi_n(x,k)=e^{i m.k}, m=(m_1, \dots, m_n) \in \mathbb Z^{n} $ with $m.k= m_1 k_1 + \dots + m_n k_n$. Or what ? Thank you in advance
