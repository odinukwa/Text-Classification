[I originally entered the answer below in response to another question. Later other people pointed out that that question was a duplicate of this one, so I joined them in closing it.] Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$ of dimension $2^{\aleph_0}$ (e.g. $V=\mathbb{R}$) and put $G=BV$. Here we use the simplicially defined classifying space functor $B$, so $G\times G=BV\times BV=B(V\times V)$, so we can apply $B$ to the addition map $V\times V\to V$ to get a topological group structure on $BV$. By construction we have $\pi_1(G)\simeq V$, but also $G$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$ of dimension $2^{\aleph_0}$, so $G\simeq V$ as abstract groups. I don't think that you can do anything much smaller than this. 

Here are some additional details for the answer of M. Farrokhi. In the paper " On a conjecture of Hanna Neumann", B.H.Neumann constructs a certain group $G$. There are generators $a_1,\dotsc,a_4$, and additional elements defined in terms of these as follows: \begin{align*} b_{12} &= [a_1,a_2] = [a_2,a_1] \\ b_{13} &= [a_1,a_3] = [a_3,a_1] \\ b_{14} &= [a_1,a_4] = [a_4,a_1] \\ b_{23} &= [a_2,a_3] = [a_3,a_2] \\ b_{24} &= [a_2,a_4] = [a_4,a_2] \\ b_{34} &= [a_3,a_4] = [a_4,a_3] \\ c_1 &= [a_2,b_{34}] = [a_4,b_{23}] \\ c_2 &= [a_3,b_{14}] = [a_4,b_{13}] \\ c_3 &= [a_4,b_{12}] = [a_1,b_{24}] \\ d &= [a_1,[a_2,[a_3,a_4]] = [a_2,[a_3,[a_4,a_1]] = [a_3,[a_4,[a_1,a_2]] \end{align*} There are some relations implicit in the above equations. There are also additional relations as follows: 

Consider an elementary chain of models of some first-order theory $T$: $$ (M_\alpha)_{\alpha < \kappa}, M_\alpha \prec M_\beta \; {\rm for} \; \alpha < \beta .$$ Let also $(N_\alpha)$ be another elementary chain of models of the same theory. Assume, that for every $\alpha < \kappa$ ($\kappa$ a cardinal) we have an isomorphism $f_\alpha: M_\alpha \to N_\alpha$. Is there a way to extend these isomorphisms to an isomorphism $f: M \to N$, $M:= \bigcup_{\alpha < \kappa} M_\alpha$, $N:= \bigcup_{\alpha < \kappa} N_\alpha$, even if we don't assume that the restriction of $f_\beta$ to $M_\alpha$ for $\alpha < \beta$ is equal to $f_\alpha$? 

Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a model of set theory, and consider HOD (the hereditarily ordinal definable elements) of $\mathfrak{M}$. Let $K$ be any algebraically closed field in HOD of zero characteristic and any cardinality. Is there always a real closed subfield $R$ of $K$ of index 2 such that $R \in $ HOD? Under what condition $R$ is archimedean? Or rather, can we always find an archimedean real closed subfield $R$ of $K$ such that $R \in$ HOD? 

To be more precise I am interested in questions similar to the one below (I asked the question below on math.stackexchange last week but got not answer.) I have a $C^1$ function $f:[0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}$. The arclength of the graph of $f_y:x\mapsto f(x,y)$ is $$L(y)=\int_0^1 \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)\right)^2} dx$$ Deriving under the integral does not seem to be possible since it would involve a crossed derivative $\partial^2 f/\partial x\partial y$ whose existence is not assumed. Hence I do not expect L to always be a $C^1$ function of y. But so far I have not been able to find a counterexample. This question must have been already looked at. Any idea? 

In short: D is hyperbolic, C is parabolic (this is very vague, I know; there is at least one thing that makes me uneasy about all this presentation of things: that C nevertheless contains D.). Now, anytime you have an island, you have a patch that is a copy of the domain D$_i$. If you start from a point in the domain, mapped in D$_i$, and try to lift D$_i$ by f and hit a problem, is may be because you need to put a ramification point, so this increases the number of patches you need... kind of... in fact you will probalbyhave to cut your patch into smaller pieces, because of more ramification points: but then the heuristics is that it only improves things (it makes dom(f) more hyperbolic). If the problem is not due to a ramification point, then it there is an asymptotic value, and again this leads to many patches: in some sense, it is even more hyperbolic than just having ramification points. If $f$ is transcendental and some D$_i$ has only finitely many islands, then close enough to the boundary of dom(f), it is a bit like there is no islands. By the discussion above other preimages will be ramified, or worse. Now if there are enough D$_i$ with this property, then the game is to see that, on a purely combinatorial level, there must at least an exponential growth of the patches (this is idealistic but this gives an idea): this is what happens with the two examples above. Let us look at an example that works not: cos(z). Its critical points are points of $\pi\mathbb Z$, half of which get mapped to -1 the other half to 1. There is no asymptotic value (in fact, infinity is). The number of patches (whatever that means) grows linearly with the combinatorial distance. More precisely if you take D$_1$ and D$_2$ two disks about -1 and 1, their preimages are all ramified of ramification number=2. Join them by a line. Then the preimage of this picture is many disks-like domains at all the points of $\pi\mathbb Z$ all joined to the next by a line. This graph is more "euclidean" than "hyperbolic". Now if you have three domains D$_i$, take a point outside and link this point to each D$_i$ by disjoint curves, giving a Y-shaped picture with three disks attached at the tips. Ideally, the preimage of this graph contains (infinitely) many copies of this Y-shaped curve with disks at tips and to each of these disk (with finitely many exceptions) is attached at least two distinct copies of a Y. Such a graph is necessarily hyperbolic. Again, I do not know the proof of Ahlfors' theorems, and I completely forgot the proof of Bloch's theorem, so all this may be far from the actual proofs. This is just my point of view on things. 

Consider the full Solovay model $N=M[G]$ of set theory. Let HOD be the set of hereditarily ordinal definable elements of $M[G]$. It is known that in $N$ every set of reals definable from ordinals and reals is Baire measurable. My question is: In HOD, is every set definable from ordinals and reals (in HOD) Baire measurable? (i.e. is the property that a definable set is Baire measurable preserved by passage from $N$ to HOD?). If we consider also HOD(HOD) does the same remain true? Edit: I rephrase my question to be: is there a model of set theory $M$ such that in HOD$^{M[G]}$ every set of reals definable from ordinals and reals is Baire measurable? Can we find a model of set theory in which HOD, HOD(HOD) etc.. all satisfy the same property above? 

Let $T$ be a countable first-order theory, and assume that $T$ has exactly one atomic model up to isomorphism in every uncountable cardinality. (By "atomic" I mean a model which omits the non-principal types). Now let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a countable transitive model of set theory, and assume that $T$ is also (countable) in $\mathfrak{M}$. Is the above property preserved in $\mathfrak{M}$? i.e. does it hold in $\mathfrak{M}$ that there exists only one atomic model of $T$ in every uncountable cardinality in $\mathfrak{M}$? 

By chance I wrote, not long ago, the following applet (HTML5+JS+WebGL) that works at least on Firefox and Chrome. $URL$ This work is CC-BY-SA, including the code, but NOT the image by Escher, for which I have not asked permission: you can probably use it a few times in conferences (fair use) but not in a permanent publication (and I will eventually have to remove this image or to create a variant of my own, like Valdimir Bulatov). 

I cannot omit mentionning the work of Jeff Weeks, which is way more complete than mine: $URL$ Click on Kaleidotile, this program can do tilings on the sphere, the Euclidean plane and the hyperbolic plane. There is a binary for MacOS and Windows and a source code. 

Two questions were asked Concerning question I: Here's an application for my favorite bijection! Consider R the group of reals with addition and its subgroup Q of rationals. The group R mod Q has the same cardinality as R does (I guess you need the axiom of choice here). Let $\phi$ be a bijection from R mod Q to R. Let $f^t$ be the conjugate by $\phi$ of the translation by t in R mod Q. For all $t \in Q$ and all $x \in R$, $f^t(x)=x$. Concerning question II: (Corrected from my previous wrong claim) For X finite, then your assumptions imply that all $f^t$ are the same map and are a projection (a solution $p$ of $p\circ p=p$). In particular, your claim is true if $X$ is finite. Proof: let $n=|X|$, and notice that $f^t$ is for all k>1 the k-th iterate of a map $g:X\to X$ with $g=f^{t/k}$. Apply this to $k=n!$. I claim that $g^{n!}$ is a projection. Indeed consider any $x\in X$. Its orbit by $g$ consists in a tail of length $a\in\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$ followed by a cycle of length $b\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, and $a+b\leq n$. So $g^{a}(x)$ has period $b$ dividing $n!$. As $n!\geq a$, the point $y=g^{n!}(x)$ is also a $g$-periodic point of period dividing $n!$, so it is fixed by $g^b$. Since $b$ divides $n!$, the point $y$ is fixed by $g^{n!}$. This proves the claim. Hence for all $t$, $f^t$ is a projection. Now consider two positive reals $s<t$. Then $f^t=f^s\circ f^{t-s}$ so the image of $f^t$ is contained in the image of $f^s$. But the image of $f^t$ is the same as the image of $f^{t/k}$ for all $k$ because the latter is also a projection. Since there is some $k$ so that $t/k<s$, we get that the image of $f^s$ is contained in the image of $f^{t/k}$ i.e. in the image of $f^t$. Since projections are characterized by their images, we are done. 

I remember that when I wrote my thesis I was unable to find references for some quite basic facts about this that everyone knew. It is quite possible that there were references that I did not succeed in finding (there was no Google then!) or that someone has written a good exposition in the intervening time. For what it's worth, my thesis is at $URL$ and the relevant material is in Section 5.1. 

If $F$ has a basis of size $n$, then it is not hard to show that there exist nonzero alternating $k$-linear maps $F^k\to R$ if and only if $k\leq n$. Given this, it is clear that $F$ cannot have a basis of size different from $n$. I think that is cleaner than any approach involving row-reduction or tensoring with a field. To make it work in the presence of 2-torsion, you need to define 'alternating' in the right way: the function must vanish if any two arguments are equal, which is stronger than saying that the sign changes when any two arguments are swapped. 

For a year I have been giving lectures on a (probalby) new way to present an explicit sphere eversion. These lectures include a review of many other explicit eversions that have been described, as text, drawings or even computer generated movies, since Smale proved his theorem. During these lectures, I have been frequently asked the following question: are these eversions all equivalent? I suppose the meaning of this question is: can you deform one eversion into another? A more general question is: What is the $\pi_1$ of the space $I$ of immersions of $S^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$? Recall that Smale proved that $I$ is connected so that there is a path from the canonical embedding to the antipodal embedding, which is the definition of a sphere eversion. The set of all eversions up to homotopy is in (non canonical) bijection with the $\pi_1$ above. If the latter were trivial, then all eversions would be equivalent, and conversely. But as far as I have understood, it is not the case. 

This can be parametrised as $$ \gamma(t) = \frac{(a^2(c-s)^2-s^2c^2)p+2asc(c-s)(cq+sr)}{a^2(c-s)^2+s^2c^2}, $$ where $s=\sin(t/2)$ and $c=\cos(t/2)$. This passes through $p$ with derivative $q/a$ at $t=0$ and through $p$ again with derivative $r/a$ at $t=\pi$. It also passes through $-p$ with derivative $-2a(q+r)$ at $t=\pi/2$. Maple code is as follows: 

In general, I find the wikipedia maths pages to be very comprehensive and useful, and I have not found any serious errors. However, they are often not very well organized or clearly explained. I agree that it would be good if more professional mathematicians tried to help with this. I rewrote the article $URL$ a few years ago. I thought about working on some other related ones. However, it seemed to me that it would be best to do a general reorganization, deleting some pages, renaming others and redistributing material in a more coherent way. I did not know how to go about presenting such a proposal to the relevant community, and how to ensure that there was enough consensus that a lot of work would not go to waste, and how to make the changes offline so as not to leave an inconsistent mess while the work was going on. So I did not end up doing anything. 

Given two real closed fields $R_1$ and $R_2$ such that both have cardinality continuum, archimedean, but not necessarily complete. Assume further that they are back and forth equivalent (in the language of rings). Under which conditions can we get that they are isomorphic? Isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$? 

Given structures $A_i$ each of cardinality $<\kappa$ where $\kappa$ is a measurable cardinal, the cardinalities of the $A_i$ are not uniformly bounded by a cardinal $\lambda <\kappa$, and $\mathcal{U}$ a $\kappa$-complete ultrafilter over $\kappa$, what is the cardinality of the ultraproduct $\prod A_i/\mathcal{U}$? Edit: The ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ is also assumed to be normal. For all the other missing data, which I am not aware of, please let me know of the case in which the ultraproduct is only of cardinality $\kappa$ (and as a by product is not isomorphic to any of the $A_i$). 

Assume we have a countable transitive model of set theory which satisfies some set of first-order axioms $T$. Is it possible to get from this a model $\mathcal{M}$ of set theory which satisfies the following: 

There is a natural map $\mu:\text{Aut}(V)\times G_k(V)\to G_k(V)$ sending $(A,W)$ to $AW$. Differentiating this at $(I,W)$ gives a natural map $\mu_*:\text{Hom}(V,V)\to T_WG_k(V)$. There is also a natural map $\pi:\text{Hom}(V,V)\to\text{Hom}(W,V/W)$, given by $$ \pi(\alpha) = (W \xrightarrow{\text{inc}} V \xrightarrow{\alpha} V \xrightarrow{\text{proj}} V/W). $$ I claim that there is a unique map $\nu:\text{Hom}(W,V/W)\to T_WG_k(V)$ with $\mu_*=\nu\circ\pi$, and that $\nu$ is an isomorphism. To prove this, we introduce the subgroup $\text{Aut}(V,W)=\{A\in \text{Aut}(V): AW=W\}$, and check that the tangent space to $\text{Aut}(V,W)$ at $I$ is the kernel of $\pi$; the rest follows easily from this. 

I don't think it is true that this kind of construction is a pushout in the smooth category. Consider the function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x)=|x|$. This is smooth on $(-\infty,0]$ and on $[0,\infty)$. (There are some subtleties about how to define smoothness for functions on manifolds with boundary, but all possible variants are easily seen to be satisfied in this case.) If $\mathbb{R}$ were the pushout of $(-\infty,0]$ and $[0,\infty)$ along $\{0\}$ then $f$ would be smooth on $\mathbb{R}$, which is false. 

Now I feel shy because there are some people watching that really know what they are talking about, unlike me. So a word of warning: anything I am going to write here may be too optimistic (or stupid). It is certainly extremely vague. With that said, the point of view I refer to is: consider the domain of f as a Riemann surface over the target. By this I mean that you can reconstruct dom(f) by patching pieces of the target using f to understand how to glue things. A the level of critical point, you have to remove the critical value and add several copies of the pieces that you may have to cut. This is already idealistic since there are also asymptotic values (points whose preimage is "at infinity", more rigorously, points $a$ in the range such that there is a path in the domain tending to the boundary of dom(f) and whose image by f tends to $a$). The prototype of the latter is the point 0 in the range of f=the exponential map, where a preimage of a neighborhood of 0 is an infinite cover over a punctured disk. But it may be less nice. Some more heuristics: the infinity of C is small, the infinity of D is big. In fact, you can recompose D by patching many copies of a single compact patch, exponentially many as you wander off to the boundary of D, if you count the distance by how many patches you need to cross. Archetypical examples:
