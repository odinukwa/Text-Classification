Working with spaces meaning spaces, I gave a reasonably strong result along these lines in Theorem 12.7 of The Geometry of Iterated Loop Spaces $URL$ If $p\colon E\to B$ is a simplicial Hurewicz fibration such that $B$ is proper (Reedy cofibrant in more modern terminology) and each $B_q$ is connected, then $|p|\colon |E|\to |B|$ is a quasifibration with fiber $|F|$. 

Espen, I would disagree with your description of the classifying space functor. Your question starts with a diagram in Cat(Top). The standard classifying space functor is the composite of the nerve functor $N$ from there to simplicial spaces and geometric realization. Here $N$ is defined in what should be an obvious way in terms of the space of objects and the spaces (defined by source target pullbacks) of composable morphisms. Geometric realization is generally understood in the usual, not the fat, sense. Since geometric realization commutes with colimits (it is a left adjoint), it is not a problem here. The problem is the nerve functor $N$. In your special case when I is the natural numbers, I see no problem: $N$ will take your cofibrations to levelwise cofibrations and will take unions to unions, those being the colimits in that special case. However, the classifying space functor behaves quite badly with respect to colimits of general diagrams in Cat and therefore, more generally, with respect to general colimits in Cat(Top). Pushouts give a simple and central example of diagrams that behave badly: $N$ usually fails to preserve them. The key point of Thomason's paper in which he gives a model structure on Cat that is Quillen equivalent to the standard model structure on simplicial sets is to identify a class of maps, which he calls Dwyer maps, such that $N$ preserves pushouts in which one leg is a Dwyer map. Cisinski observed that a retract of a Dwyer map need not be a Dwyer map and identified an alternative notion of pseudo Dwyer maps that is closed under retracts. However, that is in Cat and I don't think that anyone has developed a theory of Dwyer maps in Cat(Top) that might help answer your general question. 

It misses the point to think of model category as a tool for proving that homotopy categories are equivalent. In the case of simplicial sets and topological spaces, that equivalence long preceded the introduction of model category theory and therefore, of course, is in no way dependent on it.* Rather the use of model category theory gives a lot more point set level structure to this and other mere equivalences of homotopy categories. There is a great deal of mathematics that cannot be thought, at least not readily, without the use of model category theory. Voevodsky's importation of the methodology of modern algebraic topology in algebraic geometry, which allowed him to prove the Milnor conjecture, is an extreme example. Examples within algebraic topology are abundant. I don't have the time or inclination to pinpoint a small elementary example, since that is not really the point. Use of model category theory in algebraic topology and in homotopical algebra (Quillen's apt term) in general is analogous to the use of category theory in mathematics. *An unoriginal direct proof is in my 1967 book "Simplicial objects in algebraic topology". 

For the questions asked here, there is no difference between orthogonal $G$-spectra, symmetric $G$-spectra of either $G$-spaces or $G$-sSets, or EKMM $G$-spectra. For the first two, the nonequivariant arguments in Mandell-May-Schwede-Shipley $URL$ generalize directly, once one corrects Lemma III.8.4 in Mandell-May $URL$ as is done in HHR. That lemma should say that for positive cofibrant $G$-spectra $X$ (in any good category of $G$-spectra), the natural map $E(G,\Sigma_n)\wedge_G X^n \to X^n/\Sigma_n$ is a weak equivalence, where $E(G,\Sigma_n)$ is the universal principal $(G,\Sigma_n)$-bundle. This implies that the homotopy categories of $E_G$-algebras and of commutative monoids are equivalent for any genuine $E_{\infty}$ $G$-operad $E_G$. As David White says, his thesis improves these equivalences to Quillen equivalences of model categories. The "canonical" choice of $E_G$ is in the eyes of the beholder: there are many different natural choices with different applications of each: infinite Steiner or little discs $G$-operads, linear isometries $G$-operads, permutativity (or Barratt-Eccles) $G$-operads, etc. There are analogous equivalences using naive $E_{\infty}$-$G$-operads, which are nonequivariant $E_{\infty}$ operads regarded as $G$-trivial. That is the weakest in the hierarchy of point-set level kinds of genuine $G$-spectra with commutative ring structures given by Blumberg-Hill,whereas commutative monoids is the strongest. 

Perhaps my very short (4 pages plus bibliography) paper ``A note on the splitting principle'' $URL$ may be illuminating. It shows that the splitting principle can be viewed as a statement about the reduction of the structural group of a $G$-bundle $\xi$ from $G$ to a maximal torus $T$, where $G$ is a compact Lie group. It applies more generally than in just the usual examples. One starts with the bundle $BT\to BG$ with fiber $G/T$. For a $G$-bundle over $X$ classified by $f\colon X\to BG$, one has a pullback bundle $q\colon Y\to X$ with fiber $G/T$ together with a reduction of the structure group of $q^*\xi$ to $T$. When $H^*(BG;R)$ is concentrated in even degrees, $q^*\colon H^*(X;R)\to H^*(Y;R)$ is a monomorphism. That is easily seen to imply the splitting theorem as usually stated, and many variants thereof. As stated and explained briefly in the paper, the argument adapts to $K$-theory. 

This is going to be a perhaps tendentious diatribe. But it is what is. Naturality, dimensional arguments, and Poincare duality give a reservoir of elementary examples such as spheres and projective spaces. In practice, to go from there to more serious examples, one uses spectral sequences to bootstrap up, and then one uses still more spectral sequences to bootstrap up to still more serious examples. The dirty secret is that modern algebraic topologists rarely if ever try to compute cup products by use of cochains, which means that they rarely if ever use cochains for serious calculations. The huge range of known calculations show how well this works. The actual diagonal map $X\longrightarrow X\times X$ can only be helpful in the very simplest examples, for the obvious reason that explicit calculations must use cellular cochains (not singular, which are far too large for explicit computation), and the diagonal map is never cellular: it takes the n-skeleton to the 2n-skeleton. To compute cup products with cellular cochains, one must find a cellular map homotopic to the diagonal map. While such a cellular approximation always exists, it is rarely an easy task to write one down explicitly. Peter May 

I haven't looked at Abbaspour's paper, but here is what is going on, in a bit greater generality. Let $N$ be a right, $M$ a left DG $A$-module. Then $B=B(N,A,M)$ is defined and it is bigraded. The grading with differentials that raise degree, which you apparently have in mind, is a bit awkward, so regrade by $A_n = A^{-n}$ and similarly for $M$ and $N$. Then we have $B_{p,q}$, where $p$ is the homological degree (via $N\otimes \bar{A}^{p}\otimes M$ and $q$ is the internal degree (add up the degrees of $n$, the $a_i$, and $m$ of an element $n[a_1,\cdots,a_p]m$). There is a horizontal (or internal) differential $d^h\colon B_{p,q} \to B_{p,q-1}$ given by the differentials on $N$, $A$, and $M$ and there is a vertical (or homological) differential $d^v: B_{p,q}\to B_{p-1,q}$. These commute. Now regrade by total degree, $B_n = \sum_{p+q=n} B_{p,q}$. Then the differential is given by $d = d^h + (-1)^p d^v$ on the summand $B_{p,q}$. 

Since adequate answers to the question asked have been given, I will address the relevant underlying theorems. There are two relevant theorems, both called ``Whitehead's theorem''. One says that a weak homotopy equivalence between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence. The other says that an integral homology isomorphism between suitable spaces, say nilpotent but it actually holds a little more generally, is a weak homotopy equivalence; I say weak because that is what comes naturally out of the proof. I observed in "The dual Whitehead theorems'', #47 on my web page, that these two theorems are word for word Eckmann-Hilton dual to each other when thought of in the right homotopical way (this was presented at a birthday conference for Hilton). The idea is that you study $[X,Y]$ by decomposing $X$ using cells to get the first theorem and decompose $Y$ using "cocells'', via (generalized) Postnikov towers, to get the second. This point of view is explained more leisurely in "More concise algebraic topology", by Kate Ponto and myself: it dominates our treatment of localizations and completions of spaces. It is an especially precise application of the intuition of model category theory, but it is best understood when worked out directly, without invoking that language. 

I didn't think this was all that hard when I wrote ``A general algebraic approach to Steenrod operations'' which appeared in 1970. It is available on my web page. The result in question is Theorem 3.4 there. As proved there, the result applies to quite general situations and not just cohomology. For example, it applies to homology spectral sequences of iterated loop spaces, with Dyer-Lashof operations replacing Steenrod operations. The proof does use some mucking around with chain level operations, but that is perhaps easier than trying to do it without such operations. 

Here are two of my favorite examples, both taught regularly to undergraduates: Galois extensions: if $L$ is a Galois extension of $K$ with Galois group $G$, then the opposite of the category of orbits $G/H$ and $G$-maps is isomorphic to the category of intermediate fields, via $G/H\mapsto L^H$. The categories of finite $T_0$-spaces and finite posets are isomorphic; the categories of Alexandroff $T_0$-spaces and all posets are isomorphic. As Tom says, trivial is subjective, but these are certainly both elementary and illuminating. The first subsumes a bunch of things usually taught as separate propositions. The second is a bridge between algebraic topology and combinatorics. 

Omitting the stars, what you have written down is a two-sided bar construction $B(M,A,N)$, unreduced since you have not assumed that $A$ is augmented. Note that in degree $n$ it is the direct sum over $p+q=n$ of the elements of the $p$th term in degree $q$. One conceptual way of thinking about it is that that we can write $B(M,A,N) = M\otimes_A B(A,A,N)$. Depending on taste and background, one can view $B(A,A,N)$ as a kind of projective resolution of $N$, a point of view that goes back to Cartan and Eilenberg, or one can view $B(A,A,N)$ as a cofibrant approximation of $N$ in model theoretic terms. For a recent exposition that explains and compares these points of view (allowing $k$ to be a general commutative ring) see $URL$ For either point of view, you want sums and not products. 

If $X$ and $Y$ are $G$-spaces for any group $G$, then the projection $\pi\colon X\times Y\to Y$ is a $G$-map, trivially: $\pi (gx,gy) = gy$. The map $\pi_2$ of your question is a very special case; note that $\mathcal M$ as I defined it is an operad as I defined operads, with $\Sigma_j$ acting on $\mathcal M(j)$. Model categories are extremely important but entirely irrelevant here, and taking cofibrant approximations of operads tends to destroy their relevant individuality: different $E_{\infty}$ operads play seriously different roles in the applications, which are what people should care about. Also, by my definition, $E_{\infty}$ operads are $\Sigma$-free rather than just locally contractible, so $Com$ is certainly not an example; $E_{\infty}$ spaces are far more general than $Com$ spaces, which of course are just commutative topological monoids. This edit is to answer Lano's clarification of his question. Lemma 3.7, p. 24, op cit shows that a local equivalence over $\mathcal M$ is necessarily a local $\Sigma$-equivalence. The statement of Corollary 3.11 follows. 

I agree with Ryan that Serre's proof can be viewed as perfectly conceptual, but here is a modern version. Accept from Serre that the homotopy groups of spheres are finitely generated. Let $k\colon S^n \longrightarrow K(\mathbf{Z},n)$ be the canonical map. We know how to rationalize spaces and maps. The rationalization of $k$ is a map $k_{0}\colon S^n_{0}\longrightarrow K(\mathbf{Q},n)$. If $n$ is odd, $k_0$ is an isomorphism on rational cohomology and therefore an equivalence. If $n$ is even, a very little cohomological calculation shows that the fiber of $k_{0}$ is $K(\mathbf{Q},2n-1)$. Since the homotopy groups of spheres are finitely generated, the kernel of the map on homotopy groups induced by the rationalization $S^n\longrightarrow S^n_{0}$ is finite in each degree. The rank of the free part is immediate from what I've said about $S^n_{0}$. Serre's theorem follows. This uses no calculation of unstable homotopy groups except maybe deep down that $\pi_n(S^n) = \mathbf{Z}$. 

$C_n(X)$ is not a monoid in any natural way; I never said it was. And the target $\Omega^n\Sigma^n X$ of $\alpha_n$ has $n$ different loop products. The question is not meaningful as posed. Nevertheless the proof of Theorem 6.1 (the approximation theorem) answers it by describing $\alpha_n$ as the fiber map of a map from a quasifibration to "the" path loop fibration $\Omega \Omega^{n-1}\Sigma^n X\to P \Omega^{n-1}\Sigma^n X \to \Omega^{n-1}\Sigma^n X$ (which one being determined by an ordering of the loop coordinates). From here, there are papers by Fiedorowicz and by Thomason that compare this $1$-fold delooping to the classifying space delooping of monoids given by Moore loop spaces. 

As usual, I apologize for excess concision. Let $A$ be a based CW complex, $X$ and $Y$ well-pointed spaces, $f\colon X\to Y$ a (weak) equivalence. The first claim in 6.9(i) is that $[X\wedge A,Z] \cong [X,F(A,Z)]$, and a proof is indicated. Since $f$ clearly induces a bijection on the right side, it must induce a bijection on the left side. By Yoneda (take $Z = X\wedge A$ to find an inverse to $f\wedge id$ in the homotopy category), that means that $f\wedge id\colon X\wedge A \to Y\wedge A$ is a weak equivalence. 

The equivalence (P) is a deep and subtle property of the smash product of spectra in modern symmetric monoidal models for the stable homotopy category. It is very unlikely to hold in other contexts. It was first found in EKMM [III.5.1] because the use of operads there visibly builds it into the smash product. It was later seen to hold for orthogonal and symmetric spectra in MMSS [15.5]. I doubt that it holds for the $\mathcal W$-spectra defined in MMSS. Perhaps this is not the place for a confession, but the equivariant version of (P) as published by Mandell and myself for orthogonal $G$-spectra in "Equivariant orthogonal $G$-spectra and $S$-modules'' and by Mandell for symmetric $G$-spectra in "Equivariant symmmetric spectra'' is incorrect. The correct version replaces $E\Sigma_n$ with the universal principal $(G,\Sigma_n)$-bundle $E(G,\Sigma_n)$. For $E_{\infty}$ $G$-operads $\mathcal C$, $\mathcal C(n)$ is just such a universal principal $(G,\Sigma_n)$-bundle. The essential point is that this is a topological result, not remotely to be expected in a general model theoretical context. 

This is a comment, not an answer, I suppose. Just a reference to Adams and Walker "On complex Stiefel manifolds''. This follow up to Adams' "Vector fields on spheres'' directly computes the $KO$-groups of complex projective spaces (see Theorem 2.2) by the methods of VFS, which computed the complex $K$-theory of complex and real projective spaces and the real $K$-theory of real projective spaces. There are no extension problems in sight in the calculation of $KO(\mathbf{C}P^n)$. Aside from the obvious, multiplication by $h_0$ in the ASS, method of detection of multiplication by $2$, there aren't a whole lot of systematic methods for detecting multiplication by $2$, let alone less simple extensions. Massey products/Toda brackets can help. 

I would like to just comment but don't see how. Christian, here's an answer to your last question. For based spaces, you can just do what you want by hand, as Fernando suggested, taking care to use disjoint basepoints to make your attaching maps of $A$ based. You are right to complain that the interplay of $h$ and $q$-model structures is not obvious. Based spaces are of course spaces over and under a point. In ``Parametrized homotopy theory'', Sigurdsson and I generalize to parametrized spaces, which are spaces over and under a give space, and then the combination of $h$, $q$, and related model structures is surprisingly delicate. In that book, the answer to your original question is axiomatized in a general model categorical context in 5.4.1 (see (v)) and the axioms are verified for parametrized spaces in 5.4.9. But that is like hitting a thumb tack with a sledge hammer. Maybe it will help to add that in the direct argument you do need to know that a wedge of weak equivalences is a weak equivalence, and that uses the well-pointed hypothesis.
