There are a fair number of papers by Beauville, Laszlo, Sorger, Kumar and others on the geometry of $LG/L^+G = G((z))/G[[z]]$ where $G$ is a simply connected and simple group over $\mathbb{C}$. In particular it is known that $Pic(LG/L^+G)$ is equal to $\mathbb{Z}$. The pull back to $LG$ of a generator $1 \in Pic(LG/L^+G)$ is nontrivial and can be chosen so it corresponds to the basic central extension of $LG$. So $Pic(LG)$ is at least $\mathbb{Z}$ and I think that should be everything. A divisor for the basic line bundle can be taken to be the complement of $L^-G\cdot L^+G$ where $L^-G = G[z^{-1}]$ so I think the claim would follow if $Pic(L^-G \cdot L^+G) = 0$; but I haven't seen this question addressed in my limited knowledge of the literature. So is it true that $Pic(LG) = \mathbb{Z}$ and what's a reference that discusses this? 

Are there any interesting cases (interesting here is interpreted rather loosely here) where you can show $X$ has property $P$ whenever all $X(K)$ have property $P$ where $K$ runs through all fields? To clarify, let me state different versions of the questions. Assume $X$ is defined over a base field $k$ and $K$ runs through all field extensions of $k$. Version 1 Consider the sets $X(K)$ as having just a topology and assume $X$ is reduced. I'm concerned with topological properties: being irreducible, being connected, counting irreducible or connected components, being an open subscheme of another scheme, being non empty,... Version 1' If $X$ is not necessarily reduced what properties are insensitive to being reduced or not? Version 2 Consider $X(K)$ as a topological space with the additional data of a sheaf of rings where for every $U(K) \subset X(K)$ we consider the ring generated by set maps $r_K: U(K) \to K$ for $r \in \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ where $r_K$ is defined by setting $r_K(\phi) = \phi^\#(r)$ for every $\phi \in U(K)$. I'm more interested in Version 1 but perhaps more can be said about Version 2. Motivation: Sometimes the field valued points of a scheme are much easier to understand than general $R$ points. For example a split reductive group $G$ you have the Bruhat decomposition of $G(K)$ which tell you the double cosets for a Borel $B \subset G$ are indexed by permutation matrices. But in general the cosets in $G(R)$ for a $K$-alebra $R$ are more complicated. 

Let $G$ be an affine algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$. It is well known that when working with principal $G$ bundles it is too restrictive to require bundles to be locally trivial in the Zariski topology. Instead $G$-bundles are defined to be locally trivial in the etale topology. The finite map $z \to z^n$ from $\mathbb{C}^\times$ to itself is a $\mu_n$ (= $n$th roots of unity) bundle that is not Zariski locally trivial. Also setting $B = Spec \mathbb{C}[s^\pm,t^\pm]$ then $\{x^2 + s y^2 + t z^2 = 0\} \subset \mathbb{P}^2_B$ is a $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle that gives rise to a $PGL_2$-bundle that is not Zariski locally trivial. However for some groups (dubbed special groups) being locally trivial in the etale topology implies locally trivial in the Zariski topology. If $G$ is semisimple then Grothendieck proved the only such special $G$ are products of $SL_n$ and $Sp_{2m}$. QUESTION I would like an example of a non Zariski locally trivial principal $G$-bundle for a simple, simply connected group $G$, e.g. $Spin(n)$ or $G_2$. My motivation is largely out curiosity. For $G$ as in the question, I study the moduli space of $G$-bundles on a curve (and although for a curve over $\mathbb{C}$ a bundle will be Zariski locally trivial it wont be in families) and I would like to have a non Zariski locally trivial bundle in my back pocket. A vague idea would be to mimic the $PGL_2$ example above by looking at some varying family of $G/P$. You could try this with $G = E_8$ because it is simply connected and adjoint and if you're lucky you might have $Aut(G/P) = G$. I have no idea if this works but even if it does it would be nice if there was a simpler example. 

If I pull back a cycle of codimension $c$ along a morphism of schemes I can easily see that the codimension can stay the same or the codimension can drop to all the way to $0$. But intuitively it seems the codimension can never increase. Is there a precise statement of this form? To state it more carefully suppose $X,Y$ are irreducible schemes and $f:X \to Y$ is a morphism and $Z\subset Y$ is an irreducible subscheme of codimension $c$. Is it always true that if $T\subset f^{-1}(Z)$ is an irreducible component then $codim(T) \leq codim(Z)$? If this is not true then are there reasonable hypothesis under which it is true, $X,Y$ Noetherian, finite type, smooth? If $f$ is flat the codimension should be preserved but the inequality above seems to be true more generally. 

Let $A = \mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(x y - z^k)$. In fact $A$ is the ring of $\mu_k$ invariants: $A = \mathbb{C}[u,v]^{\mu_k}$ where $g \in \mu_k$ acts by $g(u,v) = (g u, g^{-1} v)$. This allows one to understand vector bundles on the smooth surface $Spec\ A - (0,0,0)$ as $\mu_k$ equivariant bundles on $Spec\ \mathbb{C}[u,v]$. However I would like to understand how many of these vector bundles extend to all of $Spec\ A$. QUESTION It's well known for $k = 2$ that $Pic(Spec\ A)$ is trivial. But what about higher $k$ and higher rank? One approach is to consider the natural map $\mathbb{C}[x,y]\to A$ which is finite and flat and then (identifying vector bundles with projective modules) work with modules over $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ equipped with an endomorphism $\phi$ such that $\phi^k = x y$. But I didn't get very far with this. 

Let $G$ be a reductive group and $LG$ be the algebraic loop group of $G$; i.e. $LG(k) = G( k((t)) )$. There is a fair amount of literature on the affine Grassmanian $LG(k)/G(k[[t]])$ and its Picard group. I'm looking for reference that discusses $LG(k)/G(k[t^{-1}])$. For example, what is its Picard group? Does it have a nice stratification indexed by elements of the affine Weyl group? Acutally I am interested in $LG(k)/G(k[t^{-1}])$ but I'm even more interested in $LG(k)/\mathcal{B}^-$ where $\mathcal{B}^-$ is the subgroup of elements of $G(k[t^{-1}])$ that map to $B^- \subset G$ under the map induced from $k[t^{-1}] \to k[t^{-1}]/(t^{-1}) = k$; here $B^-$ is a Borel subgroup of $G$ 

So sometime ago in my math education I discovered that many mathematicians were interested in moduli problems. Not long after I got the sense that when mathematicians ran across a non compact moduli they would really like to compactify it. My question is, why are people so eager to compactify things? I know compactness is a great property of a space to have because it often makes other results much easier to prove. So I think my question is better stated as: what are some examples of nice/good/cool results related to a moduli spaces that were (only) able to be proved once there was a compactification of the space? 

Given a torus $T$ is there way to classify all the toric varieties it gives rise to? That is, classify all toric varieties $X$ whose torus is isomorphic to $T$. Is there a way to construct these toric varieties (i.e. give equations for them)? Remark: as has been explained in the comments and answers, this question is I'll posed. But it seems to have generated good discussion so I'm leaving the phrasing as is. 

I'm told that $\overline{\mathbb{C}P^2}$, i.e. $\mathbb{C}P^2$ with reverse orientation, is not a complex manifold. But for example, $\overline{\mathbb{C}}$ is still a complex manifold and biholomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$. This makes me wonder, if $X$ is complex manifold is there a general criterion for when $\overline{X}$ also has a complex structure? For example, it seems that if $X$ is an affine variety than simply replacing $i$ with $-i$ gives $\overline{X}$ a complex structure and $X, \overline{X}$ are biholomorphic. EDIT: the last claim is wrong; see BCnrd's comments below and Dmitri's example. Also, as explained by Dmitri and BCnrd, $X$ should be taken to have even complex dimension. Another question: if $X$ and $\overline{X}$ both have complex structures, are they necessarily biholomorphic? Edit: No per Dmitri's answer below. 

Background: a symmetric variety is a homogeneous space $G/H$ associated to an involution $\theta$ of a semisimple algebraic group $G$ and $\{g | \theta(g) = g\} = G^\theta \subset H \subset N_G(G^\theta) = \{h| hG^\theta h^{-1} = G^\theta \}$. A spherical variety is a homogeneous space $G/H$ which contains an open orbit under the action of a Borel subgroup $B$. It is known that symmetric varieties give examples of spherical varieties. Let $G = SL_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $H = S(GL_k \times GL_{n-k}) = \{(g,g') | \det g \det g' = 1 \}$. It is known that $G/H$ is spherical. $G/H$ is a non compact affine variety. In fact if I write $Gr_{k,n}(\mathbb{C}) = G/P$ then there is a Levi decomposition $P = H U$ so that $G/H$ is a $U$-fiber bundle over $Gr_{k,n}(\mathbb{C})$. QUESTION Is $G/H$ symmetric? If so, what is the associated involution? The answer to the first question seems to be yes (at least for small values of $k$) as this particular homogeneous spaces makes numerous appearances in $URL$ (see for example figures 3,4,5 starting on page 15) In fact the cited paper even gives a name to the involution (AIII) referencing a list of the possible involutions of a simple algebraic group. My confusion is that this involution seems to be a composition of usual transposition (swap across the diagonal) with a swap along the anti-diagonal and this does not seem to exhibit $G/H$ as a symmetric space. Further, I thought the rank of a symmetric variety was supposed to agree with its rank as a spherical variety. In my particular example, the rank of $G/H$ seems to be 1 as a spherical variety while the paper seems to say that the rank of $G/H$ as a symmetric variety is in general greater than 1. I'm likely missing a basic point and if it can be pointed out to me I would greatly appreciate it. UPDATE: José Figueroa-O'Farrill answered the question over the real numbers and pointed out that the rank is $\min\{k,n-k\}$ and the involution can be taken to be conjugating by the matrix $\left(\begin{array}{cc} -I_k & \\ & I_{n-k} \end{array}\right)$. The negative of this also works as Lev Soukhanov points out below. The same involution seems to work over $\mathbb{C}$ but I'm not certain the statement about ranks still holds. 

The set up is $C$ is a curve and $J$ is its Jacobian. On the $C \times J$ there is the Poincare bundle $P$ which is the universal family of degree zero line bundles on $C$. For every integer $d$ there is also a line bundle $P(d)$ on $C \times J$ which is a family of line bundles of degree $d$ on $C$. I've seen a construction of $P$ and given $P$ an example of a $P(d)$ would be $P^L:= q_1^*L\otimes P$ where $q_1 \colon C \times J \to C$ is the projection and $L$ is a line bundle of degree $d$ on $C$. If $L,L'$ both have degree $d$ you can form either $P^L$ or $P^{L'}$. I've seen $P(d)$ defined as the inverse limit of $P^L$ as $L$ ranges over all degree $d$ line bundles. I don't really know how to think of such an inverse limit. Is there a more concrete way to describe $P(d)$? It seems up to isomorphism, $P(d) = P^L$, but this is "very" non canonical which seems bad. For example does $P^L$ have a universal property like $P$ does? I have a more specific question related to this. This question is coming from Prop. 21.6 of Polishchuk's book on Abelian varieties and the Fourier Mukai tranform, if anyone is curious. If $q_2 \colon C \times J \to J$ is the projection, then apparently $q_{2*}P(g-1) = 0$. Why is this so? One argument for this (that I don't understand) is the following. 1) Embed $P(g-1) \to F$ with $F$ flat over $J$ and $R^1q_{2*}F = 0$. 2) From $0 \to P(g-1) \to F \to F/P=: E \to 0$ and cohomology we get $0 \to q_{2*}P(g-1) \to q_{2*}F \to q_{2*}F \to R^1q_{2*}P(g-1) \to 0$ 3)The restriction of $R^1q_{2*}P(g-1)$ to $a \in J$ is $H^1(C \times a, P(g-1)|_{C \times a})$ which is $H^1$ of a line bundle of degree $g-1$. This is zero outside the theta divisor and Riemann-Roch says $h^1(L) = h^0(L)$ for degree $g-1$ line bundles, so $q_{2*}F \to q_{2*}F$ is an isomorphism outside a divisor. And hence 4) $q_{2*}F \to q_{2*}F$ is injective. Part 4) is the part I don't see. I don't necessarily want to understand this line of reasoning. But I don't see why $q_{2*}P(g-1) = 0$ since it seems to be supported on the theta divisor. 

My understanding is if you have a homogeneous space $X = G/H$ for a reductive group $G$ and $X$ is normal and has an open $B$-orbit, for a Borel subgroup $B$ then you call $X$ spherical. Someone asked me where 'spherical' came from and I had no idea. I asked a few more knowledgeable people and they also didn't know. So now I ask the same question here. 

I was reading a proof that used the following result Let $C$ be a hyperelliptic of genus $\ge 3$ and $\tau \colon C \to C$ the hyperelliptic involution. If $D$ is an effective divisor of degree $g-1$ such that $h^0(D)>1$ then $D = x + \tau(x) + D'$ where $D'$ is an effective divisor. My question is, how is this result proved? It seems equivalent to showing that $|D|$ contains the unique $g^1_2$ and this made me think of Clifford's theorem but this didn't lead to much. For $g = 3$ the result holds because then $|D| = g^1_2$. But already for $g = 4$ I'm stuck. I tried playing around with the Riemann-Roch theorem but didn't get far. 

The gist: how does one produce a spherical embedding from a colored fan? The setup: $G$ is a reductive group, $B$ a borel subgroup, and $G/H$ a spherical homogeneous space; that is, it has an open $B$-orbit. A spherical embedding for $G/H$ is a normal $G$-variety with $G/H$ as an open orbit. Some Background Much like in the case of toric varieties, spherical embeddings can be described by combinatorial data: a colored fan. From $X$ you get a colored fan roughly by looking at $B$-semi invariants of $k(G/H)$. The characters of these semi invariants form a lattice; the associated vector space and its dual $N(G/H)$ are where the combinatorial data lives. There is a map you can define from divisors in $X$ to elements of $N(G/H)$ using discrete valuations. You get a fan by looking at cones generated by the images of certain $G$- and $B$-stable divisors in $X$. The colors come from keeping track of which divisors are $B$-stable but not $G$-stable. More detailed Question I've learned this from reading (some of) Knop's paper `The Luna-Vust Theory of Spherical Embeddings' and also from some very nice lectures notes of Guido Pezzini: $URL$ I have a rough understanding of how one can be given a spherical embedding $X$ and then produce a colored fan $F(X)$, and its a theorem that a map $X \mapsto F(X)$ gives a bijection from iso classes of spherical embeddings and strictly convex colored fans. I would like to understand better how to go in the other direction. I see that if you have a colored fan $F$ each cone in $F$ should correspond to a $G$-orbit. As I understand it, if you take a rational point of the interior of $C$, then this should correspond to a valuation on $K(G/H)$ and the center of this valuation should be the local ring of the generic point of a $G$-stable subvariety: the desired $G$-orbit; but this is still a little abstract to me. I can't see how to actually produce a $G$-orbit from this. Further, the colors in $C$ are the $B$-stable prime divisors; these are determined by their intersection $G/H$ so in particular you only need $G/H$ to describe them. The extremal rays of $C$ should correspond to $G$-stable prime divisors that contain $Y_C$; in particular, these don't intersect $G/H$ and live in the desired, but a present unconstructed, embedding $X$. So again, I'm not sure how I would go about producing these $G$-stable prime divisors. I would appreciate any clarifying thoughts or references to books or papers that might discuss these things in more detail.
