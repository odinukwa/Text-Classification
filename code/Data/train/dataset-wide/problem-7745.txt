I was reading this blog by Evan Chen about complex multiplication. He's discussing Sato-Tate Conjecture. We can have elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ and solve it over finite fields. \begin{eqnarray*} a_p &=& (p+1) - \#E(\mathbb{F}_p)\\ a_p &=& 2 \sqrt{p} \cos \theta_p \ \end{eqnarray*} Sato-Tate is going say that $\theta_p$ is distributed like some kind of sine measure 

I had trouble parsing the statement of this conjecture. The modular curve I can think of is $\mathbb{H}/\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ or I think it can also be written: $\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})/\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. These parameterized complex structures on a single elliptic curve. The other modular curves $X_0(N)=\Gamma_0(N)\backslash\mathbb{H}$ could parameterize other objects, I don't know. Isn't the Fermat curve a modular curve? It doesn't seem to matter either, because CM-points (otherwise known as Heegner points) are basically just the images of algebraic numbers in $\mathbb{H}$ and they have finite orbits under $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. So there are finitely many images on these various modular curves. 

Reading this paper of Masahito Yamazaki and Kazuya Yonekura, I am having trouble turning the physics jargon into mathematical statements. He is talking about Yang-Mills theory over $\mathbb{R}^4$. Perturbative expansions are ill-defined if observables suffer from infrared divergences. For example, in the vacuum energy is computed as: $$ E(\theta) \sim - \int_0^\infty \frac{d\rho}{\rho^5}(\mu \rho)^{b_1}e^{-8\pi^2/g^2(\mu) } \cos \theta $$ The paper then says this integral is divergence in the infrared scale, which is $\rho \to \infty$. That range actually has good decay, so he could possibly have meant $\rho \to 0$. Here $\rho$ is the size of the modulus of the instanton. Introducting an IR cuttoff one obtains: $$ E(\theta) = \Lambda^4 \cos \theta $$ which is still wrong because another computation (by Witten, on a possibly-related QCD theory) shows the vaccum energy is given by: $$ E(\theta) = \min_{\mathbf{e} \in \mathbb{Z}} \Lambda^4 (\theta - 2\pi \mathbf{e})^2 $$ Having read all of this I still don't know what infrared divergence is (or strong coupling), or how resurgence played a role in any of this. 

I believe Brown's kinematics is what happens when you evaluate the Feynman integral over momentum space $dp$ rather than position space $dx$. He also does something rather strange getting these cohomology theories over the fractions $\mathbb{Q}$ rather than $\mathbb{C}$. And the space of kinematic data (e.g. from convervation of momentum) he says define a scheme rather than a variety. Complicating things further, but separating it from what a day-to-day high energy physics graduate student might call a "Feynman diagram" At least now we see what the motives are and why they are appearing. If you are an expert in motives I direct you to the relevant papers and textbooks. Lastly... a great discussion on Motives (in French) 

As far as I know, renormalization in Physics works just the way it does in analytic number theory. Our problematic series: $$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n = \infty $$ can be regularized by adding only finitely many terms and seeing how the numbers increase when you add more stuff: $$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n e^{-ny} \asymp \frac{1}{y} \longrightarrow \sum_{n=0}^N a_n \asymp N $$ This is the Hardy-Littlewood Tauberian theorem. 

I know that for any Fuchsian group $\Gamma$, there is a spectral gap, which leads to $$ \left| \int_0^1 F(x + iy) \, dx - \int_{\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}} F \, \frac{dx \, dy}{y^2} \right| < C_F y^\delta $$ this is related to the equidistribution of the horocycle flow in the hyperblic plane. Possibly I need to say that $F$ is smooth ($C^\infty$) or $C^1$ or holomorphic or a cusp form. If I knew more about the theory of modular forms or dynamical systems I could say which one. In the literature the theorems often say, "for reasonable $F$..." For a particular $\Gamma$ do we know which that $\delta$ should be? Or is it even true that we can choose the same $\delta$ for a wide range of $\Gamma$? The two cases I have in mind are: 

I'd like to know more about the limit as $n \mapsto \infty$ which I've been calling "congruent non-crossing partitions of $S^1$" 

I first read about these relationships in regards to the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction. \[ r(q) = \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{q}{1 + \cfrac{q^2}{1 + \dots}}} \quad\quad\quad\quad = 1 - q + q^2 - q^4 + \dots \] However the birth and death process is rather complicated. 

I also said that on the torus $S^1 \times S^1$ as eigenvalues $a^2 + b^2$ on the basis (of characters) $e(a^2 + b^2) = e^{2\pi i(a^2 + b^2)}$. $$ \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\right) e^{2\pi i \, (ax + by)} = (a^2 + b^2 )e^{2\pi i \, (ax + by)} $$ Then I said we could write the Laplaian operator in the Fourrier basis: $$ \Delta = \sum_{(a,b) \in \mathbb{Z}^2} \big( a^2 + b^2 \big) e^{2\pi i \, (ax + by)} $$ where hopefully this could make sense using theory of distributions. 

Maybe if we do the correspondence $X \mapsto |C(\mathbb{F}_q))| $ , so the random variable is the number of points of the curve. Then $k \mapsto g$ so the genus can be read as the number of "standard deviations" away from the norm. We can even justify $\mathbb{E}[X] \mapsto q+1$ since a generic projective curve $f(x,y,z) = 0$ should have one solution for every $x \in \mathbb{F}_qP^1$ which has $q+1$ elements. 

So in gauge theory, there are line operators and sometimes surface operators. Since Chern-Simons theory is 3-dimensional, co-dimension 2 is 3-2 = 1-dimensional. Witten wants to re-derive some properties of knots using these operators instead. 

His map might be related: $$ (x,y,z) \mapsto \left\{ \begin{array}{cl} (x+2z, z, y - x - z ) & \text{if }x< y - z \\ (2y-x, y, x - y + z) & \text{if }y-z < x < 2y \\ (x-2y, x-y+z,y)& \text{if }x > 2y \end{array} \right. $$ He claims (but does not really prove) it is involution on $X = \{ x^2 + 4yz = p\}$ with exactly one fixed point - if $p$ is prime - so that involution $(x,y,z) \mapsto (y,x,z)$ is also a fixed point. 

In my own personal reading, I have been reading about similarities between random integers and random permutations, but it is still quite speculative 

It's pretty clear from the image that Broullin zones converge to a circular region as $n \to \infty$ but I can't prove as much without a definition. Picture is taken from Wave Propogation in Periodic Structures by Léon Brillouin. 

If additionally I require that $x \mapsto mx$ takes $X_i \to \{0, m, 2m, \dots, (n-1)m\}$ is there a name for this kind of partition? 

Put another way, are there variants of the ergodic theorem that work for families of maps $T_\theta: X \to X$ rather than just a single map? 

Without any regards to the physics or the geometry used to generate this result, let's examine the formula of Gukov (see p. 32): $$ \mathcal{I}_{SU(2)}(q,t) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{m \in \mathbb{Z}}\int \frac{dz}{2\pi i \, z}z^{2pm}t^{-2m} q^{-2|m|} (1 - z^{\pm 2} q^{|m|} )\times \frac{(1/t;q)_\infty (z^{\pm 2}q^{|m|}/t;q)_\infty}{ (qt;q)_\infty (z^{\pm 2}q^{|m|+1}t;q)_\infty} $$ The standard notation (for those who use it) is that $z^{\pm}$ is a shorthand: $$ f(z^{\pm 2}) = f(z^2)f(z^{-2}) $$ While there is element of sarcasm, here this is a real honest-to-goodness superconformal index computation, taken from a serious physics paper. My impression is we spend the good part of 19th century ascribing meaning to $q$-series like these and some of them turned out to have good modular properties. For now there is basic property: $$ \mathcal{I}(q,t) \in \mathbb{Z}[t]\, [[q]] $$ This is the Lens space index. Let $M_3 = L(p,1)\simeq S^3 / \mathbb{Z}_p$, this has to do with: 

and the set of $b$ not satisfying these inequality is a set of measure zero. And for any single value of $(a,b)$ we have to resort to other more specific methods. For "generic" values of $(a,b)$ we have rather broad and quick estimates. I noticed Bourgain uses Fourier series, while Margulis uses dynamical systems. $$ \text{mes} \big[ b \in [\frac{1}{2},1]: |(**)| \gtrsim \delta N\big] $$ This is also a minimax problem, except there's an additional parameter $b$. And it suggests that, short of explicitly counting every possible $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^3$, there are quicker ways to estimate these minimums if I assume the Lindelof Hypothesis. And a fairly accurate way, even if I don't. $$(**) = \frac{1}{T}\int_\mathbb{R} dt\, \left( \widehat{w}_2(\frac{t}{N^2/\delta})- \widehat{w}_2(\frac{t}{N^{1/2}})\right) F_1(t) \,\overline{F_2(2t)} \,b^{-it}$$ If one follows the Fourier analysis carefully, counting problems are approximate. An exact count, being out of reach. $$ \frac{ b x_3^2}{x_1^2 +a x_2^2 - \xi} = 1 + O(N^{-1/2}) \text{ with } x_i \approx N $$ Hopefully I have asked a question. There are two versions of his theorem: How does this counting problem "change" with the outside assumptions? And by the time he uses Chebyshev's inequality and a few other steps I am lost, because he writes it as Fourier transform. What is he counting there? 

It is known that if you choose n point at random on S1 = [0,1], the nearest neighbor spacings between the points are exponentially distributed with mean 1. For example, two of our n points could be x, x + α/n Then with probability (1 - α/n)n-2 -> e-α The remaining n-2 points avoid the interval [x, x + α/n]. For the sequence kα (mod 1) does the nearest neighbor spacings of the first n elements approach a limit? I've heard it does when α is the golden ratio $(\sqrt{5}-1)/2$, but not in general. So maybe this is only true for specific α irrational. Any readings on this problem would be appreciated, too. EDIT: Apparently this sequence arises in the energy spacings of the two dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. The equation would be $ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\left( \frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} + \frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} \right) + \frac{1}{2}m[(\omega_1 x)^2 + (\omega_2y)^2]= E \psi$ and the spectrum would be $\frac{\hbar}{2}(m \omega_1 + n \omega_2 )$. This comes from Pavel Bleher's The energy level spacing for two harmonic oscillators with golden mean ratio of frequencies 

These resources may be slightly out of date, and are obviously not what you are looking for. Thank you Kostya for correcting me. 

My impression is that the Shuffle Relations (which one might find in Kaneko-Ihara-Zagier) get lifted to something very complicated (which could be the Tannakian Category). He has two notes on Feynman Amplitudes [1, 2] which are broader than multiple zeta functions. 

The book uses a mix of the Fejer Kernel and Jackson Kernel. Can anyone comment on why this proof looks more and more like signal processing ? 

Brownian motion has what's called "independent" increments, right? So B(1)-B(0) is independent from B(2)-B(1),B(3)-B(2), etc. These increments will be Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. Instead of computing the order distribution directly, we could look for general properties. If you ignore the first coordinate or ignore the last coordinate, you should induce the distribution for $S_{n-1}$. I wonder if it's easier to take a random walk with unit steps and sample at N random times and consider the relative order of those positions. 

Boltzmann defined "entropy" as the number of microstates of a thermodynamic ensemble. And his example is the asymptotics of the multinomial distribution. A If $m = p\, n$ the binomial coefficients grow as the entropy: $$ \binom{n}{m} = e^{p \log p + (1-p) \log (1-p)} = \mathrm{exp}\, h(X) $$ where $X$ is the random variable which is $X=1$ with probability $p$ and $X=0$ with probability $1-p$. B What about just the map $T: x \mapsto 2x \mod 1$ on $[0,1]$. How many does a typical point $x$ have? $$ 2^n x \equiv a \mod 1 $$ This has $2^n$ solutions, so the entropy is $\frac{1}{n}\log |T^{-n}(x)| = \log 2$. 

Here the multiplicities mod 2πi are different. One would be (2,3) while the other would be (3,2). Could exp(L) = exp(L') in this case? 

Over a square lattice, all you have are approximations. How do you know that the discrete derivative tends to the continuous complex derivative when $\Delta z \to 0$ ? This might help us understand the limiting behavior of: 

Attempt at Discussion As typical in QFT there is a difficult Hamiltonian (this is Hartree-Fock approximation of some electric field): $$ \hat{H} = \int d^d x \; \Bigg( \sum_{\sigma, \tau \in \uparrow ,\downarrow} \psi^\dagger_\sigma h_{\sigma \tau}\psi_\tau + \Delta \psi^\dagger_\uparrow \psi^\dagger_\downarrow + \Delta^\ast \psi_\uparrow \psi_\downarrow \Bigg)$$ for reasons one might challenge this can be written in terms of creation an anihilation operators: $$ \hat{H} = \sum_{\alpha \beta} \big( h_{\alpha\beta} c^\dagger_\alpha c_\beta + \frac{1}{2} \Delta_{\alpha\beta} c_\alpha^\dagger c_\beta^\dagger + \frac{1}{2} \Delta_{\alpha\beta}^\ast c_\alpha c_\beta \big) $$ The indices instead of ranging from 1 thru N, both indices $\alpha, \beta$ range over the sites of a lattice. This Hamiltonian is tell us what happens at the edges. In layman's terms: it's too complicated! So we will approximate with random matrix ensemble. $$ \hat{H} = \frac{1}{2} ( \begin{array}{cc} \mathbf{c}^\dagger & \mathbf{c} \end{array} ) \left( \begin{array}{cc} h & \Delta \\ -\Delta^\ast & h \end{array} \right) \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{c}^\dagger \\ \mathbf{c} \end{array} \right) \equiv \frac{1}{2} ( \begin{array}{cc} \mathbf{c}^\dagger & \mathbf{c} \end{array} ) \; \mathcal{H} \;\left( \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{c}^\dagger \\ \mathbf{c} \end{array} \right) $$ This is how Altland+Zirnbauer define the "Bogliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian" $\mathcal{H}$ which acts on the space of spins at all points $\mathbf{C}^{2N} \times \mathbb{C}^2$. Then we can examine each symmetry class (A, AIII, AI, D, C, CI, etc) and check for various types of time-reversal or spin-rotation or charge-conjugation. And he will obtain various generalized GUE/GOE/GSE etc. (to be continued...) 

I was hoping to figure this one out on my own. There's this nice paper by Avila on various "subtractive" Euclidean algorithms. Here is one he attributes to Viggo Brun: $$ (x,y,z) \mapsto \text{sort}(x-y, y, z) $$ and I even read Brun's original article where he shows a periodic orbit of length 19 for the three numbers: $$ (\sqrt[3]{4}, \sqrt[3]{2}, 1) \mapsto \big(\sqrt[3]{2} \;,\; 1 \;,\ \sqrt[3]{4}- \sqrt[3]{2} \big) \mapsto \dots $$ This one repeats after 19 steps, but actually not. I checked on a computer (and checked my French) after 19 steps the three digits are proportional to that in the first step. So there is periodicity that way. 

I was reading about realizations of the "Fibonacci" fusion ring $X \otimes X = X \oplus 1$ in Fusion Categories of Rank 2 by Victor Ostrik. Apparently, there are two of them and they arise in various ways: 

I am trying to understand Kloosterman sums and their estimates (e.g. from [1], which does not prove) $$ \Big| S(m,n;c) \Big| = \Big| \sum_{(x,c) = 1} e\big( \frac{mx + nx^{-1}}{c}\big) \Big| < 2\, c^{3/4} $$ Another resource [2] has a different version of the Kloosterman sum bound: $$ \bigg| \sum_{x \in \mathbb{F}_q^\ast} \chi(x) \, e \big( \frac{ax + bx^{-1}}{q} \big) \bigg| \leq 2 \sqrt{q} $$ Yet another place has that if $m= n$ a different bound occurs. Perhaps I'm mixing up notations: $$ K(n,n; c) \leq (n,c)^{1/2} \sqrt{c} \, \tau(c) $$ where $\tau(c)$ is the number of divisors of $c$ (and $K$ is just the same as $S$). This could be a refinement of the first two. 

I want a collection of points $\{ x_1, \dots, x_m\}$ to sample a unit cube $[0,1]^n$ with $n >>1 $ in high dimensions so that summing over these points is approximate the integral over that space. $$\frac{1}{m} \sum f(x_i) \approx \int_{[0,1]^n} f(x) \ dx $$ If I broke each segment $[0,1]$ into $10$ points, I would have to calculate $10^n$ values of my function $f$ - way too many. Are there lattices I can use which become dense in $[0,1]^n$ as the mesh gets smaller, and whose points do not grow too quickly? If I knew more about lattices, I could make this more precise.
