The 3-cocycle condition ensures the pentagon axiom holds for the trivalent vertices. (This is an important exercise to do!) Since $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$ is pointed, there is only a one-dimensional space of maps $g\otimes h \to gh$, so choosing different isomorphisms for the trivalent vertices is equivalent to multiplying each trivalent vertex by a scalar $\mu(g,h)\in \mathbb{C}^\times$. This results in changing the third relation above by a coboundary: $$ \omega'(g,h,k) = \omega(g,h,k) \mu(g,hk)\mu(h,k)\mu(g,h)^{-1}\mu(gh,k)^{-1}. $$ Notice that in the second description, there's not just one simple object in each isomorphism class. For example, $g\otimes h \neq gh$. One of these objects corresponds to two oriented strands labelled g and h, and the other corresponds to one oriented strand labelled gh. However, they are isomorphic. The associator is hidden in the trivalent vertices. If one forms a skeletal category that is equivalent to the second category by choosing one representative of each isomorphism class of simple objects, one would see a non-trivial associator reemerge in the pentagon axiom. The moral is as follows. Your category can be strict, or it can have one simple object for each isomorphism class, but in general, it can't have both of these properties at the same time. As for your application, even trying to categorify a fusion ring into a strict fusion category is extremely difficult. You can think of this as parallel to constructing non-trivial planar algebras, which is highly non-trivial... 

I second what Noah says. You don't have to take mechanics first, just linear algebra. I would recommend reading Shankar's Principles of Quantum Mechanics. It's better than Griffiths' book for a math person. 

They classify principal graphs of $II_1$-subfactors with index less than $4$. The principal graph can be $A_n$, $D_{2n}$, $E_6$, or $E_8$, but $D_{odd}$ and $E_7$ do not occur. 

I remembered a few more from operator algebras: a trace is like a noncommutative integral. This has lead to: 

From the lemma, if we assume there is a $g\in Comm_G(H)$ such that $\varphi(g)=x>1$ (criteria 1 and 2), then the order of $g$ must be infinite, since $x>1$ implies $x^n>1$ for all $n\geq 1$. Since the order of $g$ is infinite, criterion 3 cannot hold since eventually $\varphi(g^n)=\varphi(g)^n=x^n>M$ for any $M>0$. Proof of the lemma: We must show $\varphi(g_1g_2)=\varphi(g_1)\varphi(g_2)$. Define the following constants: 

I don't think your claim is true. As an easy counter example, just take $p=e_{1,1}\in M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Its central support is $1$, but it is minimal, so $z(p)$ is never a sum of projections dominated by $p$. Perhaps you meant that each $p_i \preceq p$, in the sense that there is a partial isometry $u$ such that $uu^* = p_i$ and $u^*u \leq p$. Even in this case, I don't think it's true. You can consider the finite von Neumann algebra $$ M = \bigoplus_{n\geq 1} M_n(\mathbb{C}), $$ which has faithful normalized traces. Just take any strictly positive sequence $x=(x_n)\in \ell^1$ with $\|x\|_1 = 1$, and define $\tau = \sum_{n\geq 1} x_n \tau_n$, where $\tau_n$ is the normalized trace on $M_n(\mathbb{C})$. Now take a minimal projection $e_n$ in each summand $M_n(\mathbb{C})$, and let $p$ be the sum of the $e_n$. Then any finite sum of $p_i \preceq p$ will never equal $1=z(p)$. A finite sum of $N$ projections $p_i \preceq p$ can only have $N$ orthogonal projections equivalent to each $e_n$, and that won't be enough as $n\to \infty$. Now if the center of your finite von Neumann algebra is finite dimensional, then you can find finitely many $p_i \preceq p$ such that $\sum p_i = z(p)$. Just note that $z(p)$ is a finite sum of minimal central projections (minimal in $Z(M)$). So for each minimal central projection $q_n \in Z(M)$ with $q_n \leq z(p)$, there is a non-zero $e_n \leq p$ such that $e_n \leq q_n$. Now standard tricks will give you the result. (You'll need that $q_n M$ is a finite factor for all $n$, so all projections in $q_n M$ are comparable with respect to $\preceq$.) 

The "Bohrification" paper arXiv:0905.2275 may be relevant to Question 4. As I understand, they discuss the notion of $C^\ast$-algebra objects in a given topos. 

The Gelfand-Naimark theorem says that any $C^\ast$-algebra is isomorphic to a norm closed $\ast$-subalgebra of $B(H)$ for a suitable Hilbert space $H$. In order to prove this theorem, it is imperative that our $C^\ast$-algebra have states, which uses the Hahn-Banach theorem. One can also use the Hahn-Banach theorem instead of Tychonoff's theorem to construct $\beta X$, the Stone-Cech compactification of $X$. This is closely related to @Mark Meckes' answer. 

Yes, it is two dimensional, and this is allowed. It just means the planar algebra is not irreducible. I don't know of anyone that has thought about a presentation by generators and relations of this planar algebra yet. One issue here is that since $d=[M\colon N]^{1/2}=2$ is not generic ($>2$), one has to be careful about the annular multiplicities of the subfactor (arXiv:math/0105071). So I don't know if the planar algebra qualifies as "annular multiplicities $*10$" like (extended) Haagerup. 

I think your question should be as follows: Given a von Neumann algebra $M$, can we define a canonical set $S$ such that 

The answer to the first question is yes by a result of Herman and Ocneanu (MR1055223) or of Enock and Nest (MR1387518). We call an inclusion of II$_1$-factors depth 2 if $M_0'\cap M_2$ is abelian and $M_0'\cap M_3$ is a factor. (In fact, we only need to say $M_0'\cap M_3$ is a factor, and this works for arbitrary inclusions of factors, but I'll stick to the II$_1$ case.) Now for a depth 2 inclusion, Herman and Ocneanu say that the group $\Gamma$ can be recovered from unitaries which normalize $M_0$, using an extension of Proposition 1.7 of Pimsner-Popa's paper (MR0860811). But you should also check out Enock and Nest's article -- it's really very nice. Now for the second part. There is not yet a completely satisfactory notion of the dual subfactor of an infinite index subfactor. Given an infinite index inclusion of II$_1$-factors $M_0\subset M_1$, the basic construction $M_2$ is a II$_\infty$-factor. So in this sense, it doesn't make sense to call $M_1\subset M_2$ the dual subfactor. This implies, as you noted above, that you can't get a II$_1$-factor from a downward basic construction either. (However, Herman and Ocneanu have a nice notion of discrete and compact inclusions which are dual to each other. I'd recommend looking in their article.) 

The space of prime ideals of $A$ comes with the Jacobson, or "hull-kernel" topology, so we get the relative topology on $Prim(A)$. A few facts: 

This is far from the case if $A$ is NCR (there is some set theory here, such as the term "unclassifiable," that I don't want to get into as I am not a set theorist), but $Prim(A)$ is still a set, so we still get a topological space using the following fact: 

So it really depends on why you want to learn about subfactors. I'll try and give different reading lists based on different motivation. The basics of $II_1$-subfactors: If you're familiar with $II_1$-factors, then "Introduction to subfactors" (MR1473221) is a good place to start. Of course, Jones' original "Index for subfactors" (MR696688) is an enjoyable read as well. A more advanced and comprehensive treatment is Evans and Kawahigashi's "Quantum symmetries on operator algebras" (MR1642584). Classification: When mathematicians encounter a family of mathematical objects, we feel the need to classify them. Subfactors were first (and still!) classified by their principal graphs, which is the principal part of the Bratteli diagram of the standard invariant, or tower of relative commutants (see JS, EK, or Bisch's "Bimodules and higher relative commutants" MR1424954). The first classifications (index $\leq 4$) were completed by Jones, Ocneanu (MR996454) (very hard to find this source), and Popa (MR1278111). Popa showed that "amenable" subfactors of the hyperfinite $II_1$-factor (the index is the norm squared of the principal graph) are completely classified by their principal graphs. Axiomatization: There are several axiomatizations for the standard invariant of a subfactor: Ocneanu's paragroups (see EK), Popa's $\lambda$-lattices (MR1334479), and Jones' planar algebras (see section below on planar algebras). These three different axiomatizations play together nicely, and it's good to have an overview on what's really going on here. Unfortunately, there is no good unified source for this. Yet. However, you should think of it this way: The standard invariant (or "representation theory") of a finite index $II_1$-subfactor $N\subset M$ is a unitary $2$-category with $2$ $0$-morphisms called $N$ and $M$, $1$-morphisms given by various bimodule summands of the basic constructions of $N\subset M$, and $2$-morphisms given by various intertwiner spaces. This is what Ocneanu calls a "paragroup" because it resembles the tensor category of representations of a finite group. This $2$-category is unitary, has nice duals, and satisfies Frobenius reciprocity, and other cool stuff as well. In particular, we can draw planar diagrams to represent different $2$-morphisms in the spaces. So this $2$-category has the structure of a planar algebra. For this category theory stuff, see Mueger's "From subfactors to categories and topology I" (MR1966524). In many cases, we can recover the special $2$-category from connections on a bipartite graph or on a commuting square (see EK, JS, Popa). Reconstruction: Popa proved that one can start with he standard invariant of a subfactor and reconstruct a subfactor with the same standard invariant (MR1334479). In the "strongly amenable" case (a bit more technical than "amenable"), you get a subfactor of the hyperfinite $II_1$-factor. You can also do the reconstruction completely planar algebraically. This result is due to Guionnet-Jones-Shlyakhtenko (arXiv:0712.2904), and a really easy version to understand was given by Jones-Shlyakhtenko-Walker (arXiv:0807.4146) (Kodiyalam and Sunder also have a version of this). Planar Algebras: If you want to know what a planar algebra is, see Peters' construction of the Haagerup subfactor planar algebra (arXiv:0902.1294), or Morrison-Peters-Snyder "Skein-theory for the $D_{2n}$ planar algebras" (MR2559686). If you want to know how a subfactor actually gives a planar algebra, see the first section of Jones-Penneys (arXiv:1007.3173), which relies on some proofs in Jones' "Planar Algebras I" (arXiv:math/9909027). Examples: A great class of examples is the Bisch-Haagerup subfactors (MR1386923) which are just slightly harder than group-subgroup examples (see JS). Some of the most important examples rely on the above reconstruction theorems. For example, there are the exotic Haagerup and Asaeda-Haagerup subfactors (MR1686551) and the composite Fuss-Catalan subfactors (MR1437496). I'll keep updating this post. Right now I have office hours. Sections to come include: Type III, Recent results 

which are all finite, since if we have a quadrilateral of groups $L_1\cap L_2\subset L_1,L_2\subset G$, we must have $[L_1\colon L_1\cap L_2] \leq [G\colon L_2]$. Now since index is multiplicative, we have 

(I didn't have Conway's book in my office, but I looked at the preview on Google Books, and searched for "cardinal number," and I found Definition 6.3.(a). I don't know if he also uses the notation $\mathcal{A}^{(n)}$ for the $n$-fold direct sum of $\mathcal{A}$, but I can see how this could be confusing!) In what you've written, $\mathcal{A}^{(n)}$ should be the $n$-fold amplification of $\mathcal{A}$, i.e., the image of the map $$ A\mapsto \begin{pmatrix} A & & \\ & \ddots & \\ & & A \end{pmatrix} \in B(H^{(n)}). $$ So $M_n(\mathcal{A})$ is the operators on $H^{(n)}$ commuting with the diagonal action of the algebra $\mathcal{A}'$, as expected. I hope this clears up the confusion. I think it would be more clear to use lower case letters for operators and upper case letters for algebras, e.g., $a\in \mathcal{A}$. 

Notation: If $G$ is a countable group and $H$ is a subgroup, for $g\in G$, let $|\mathcal{O}_{gH}|$ be the size of the $H$-orbit of $gH$ in the $H$-set $G/H$. Does there exist a countable group $G$ and a subgroup $H$ with $[G\colon H]=\infty$ such that: 

@Meyer has provided a very good answer, so I just want to add something from my notes from Professor Rieffel's $C^\ast$-algebra class about the primitive ideal space, which is a canonical topological space associated to a $C^\ast$-algebra (in fact, it is associated to any normed $*$-algebra, but let's keep it "easy"...). Let $A$ be a $C^\ast$-algebra. 

Does there exist a fusion category with an object $X$ such that $XX^*\ncong X^*X$ (where the isomorphism need not be natural in any way)? Feel free to add adjectives such as pivotal, spherical, unitary, etc. 

This is a great question. I think about it every once in a while, but I don't have a complete answer for you. Your guess is a completely natural one, and morally I think it should be true. First, when you write $p_i * p_j \sim \sum_k p_k$, I assume what you mean is that we have $p_i*q_j = \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k p_k$ where each $\lambda_k>0$. One side of the argument is easy when the planar algebra is irreducible. First, $p_i * p_j$ is positive (it's of the form $a^*a$ for a certain $a$ with 2 strings on one side and 4 strings on the other) and non-zero (just cap $p_j$). Now if $p_i*q_j = \sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k p_k$ where all $\lambda_k>0$, we must have that each $X_k$ appears as a summand of $X_i \boxtimes X_j$. This follows since $(p_i*p_j)p_k = \lambda_kp_k \neq 0$ corresponds to a nonzero morphism $X_i \boxtimes X_j \to X_k$. The tricky part is the other direction, where you want to show that such a morphism results in a minimal projection appearing in the sum in the expression for the coproduct. I think Liu has the best results on this to date in [Section 4, arXiv:1308.5656]. There he shows that a bound is possible. The hard part is determining when $(p_i * p_j)p_k = 0$ in the planar algebra, and Liu has nice results on this as well. In more detail, he defines the rank of a positive element $x\in P_{2,+}$ to be the number of minimal projections $n$ needed to write $x=\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i p_i$ with all $\lambda_i>0$. For $x$ a projection, this is exactly the rank of the projection. 

Hochschild homology gives invariants of (unital) $k$-algebras for $k$ a unital, commutative ring. If we let our algebra $A$ be the group ring $k[G]$ for $G$ a finite group, we get group homology. There are plenty of other connections to homological algebra. If we use cyclic homology, there are connections to geometry and topology involving the Chern character. Von Neumann algebras are complex algebras, so we can take their Hochschild and cyclic homologies. When I have asked experts in the fields of von Neumann algebras and non-commutative geometry about what you get, I usually hear some approximation of the following: "There's also analysis in von Neumann algebras, so I wouldn't expect an algebraic invariant like Hochschild or cyclic homology to tell you anything useful." Although this answer makes some sense, I find it very displeasing and cryptic. Why shouldn't it tell you something? Is there some way to make "it doesn't tell you anything" quantitative? Is there an example of a von Neumann algebra with nontrivial Hochschild or cyclic homology (different from that of the complex numbers)? EDIT: After reading the responses so far, I should specify that I really want to know if there is a $II_1$-factor with nontrivial Hochschild or cyclic (co)homology.
