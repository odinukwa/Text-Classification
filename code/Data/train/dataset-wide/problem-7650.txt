Let $E_n$ be the number of isomorphism classes of groups of even order at most $n$, let $G_n$ be the number of isomorphism classes of groups of order at most $n$ and $T_n$ be the number of isomorphism classes of $2$-groups of order less than $n$. I think that it is an open problem if $\frac{T_n}{G_n}$ approaches $1$, so I figured that it is probably not so hard to prove that $\frac{E_n}{G_n}$ approaches $1$, although I was not able to do so. 

Let $F$ be a finite family of non-empty sets such that any two of them intersect. Consider the set $F'$ consisting of all sets that are a subset of at least one element of $F$. Prove $|F'|\geq 2|F|$. I conjectured this yesterday but have been completely unable to prove it. I tried doing things like inclusion-exclusion on the poset of the subsets but I was not able to solve it, I also tried things similar to Dilworth's theorem. Since this problem is so natural I think that it should have been attempted before, does anyone have any references? 

I am also interested in formulas for the expected length if the initial vertex is chosen uniformly. Thank you kindly. 

set $X$ is the big closed ball of radius $R$. Set $Y$ is the small closed ball of radius $r$. Set $Z$ is a closed ball of radius $r$ union two perpendicular line segments of length $2R$ that intersect in the center of the ball. The conjecture is that all distances are $R-r$. To achieve this distance simply place the figures concentrictly. (I think we may need that $\frac{r}{R}$ is big) In order to get lower bounds for the distances involving $Y$ one simply uses the bound $d_{GH}(A,B)\geq |\text{Diam}(A)-\text{Diam}(B)|/2$. But I am stuck calculating the distance between $X$ and $Z$. One approach is to use contradiction and try to use distortions. If we take $x_1$ and $x_2$ diametrally opposite then if $z_1\sim x_1$ and $x_2\sim z_2$ we must have $d(z_1,z_2)>r$ and so at least one of $z_1$ and $z_2$ is outside the small ball, but Im stuck after this. 

It is classically known that every positive integer is a sum of at most four squares of integers, i.e. every sum of squares of integers is a sum of four squares of integers. Now consider a symmetric $n\times n$ matrix $M$ with integer entries which can be written as $M= Q^{\rm T} Q$ for an $m \times n$ matrix $Q$ with integer entries. Can we bound $m$ in some way? I.e. is there a constant $c(n)\in \mathbb{Z}$ depending only on $n$ such that in this situation we can always find a decomposition $M= \widetilde{Q}^{\rm T} \widetilde{Q}$ for a $c(n) \times n$ matrix $\widetilde{Q}$ with integer entries? What is the smallest possible such constant (perhaps even linear growth?)? If we look at the same situation over the polynomial ring $\mathbb{R}[T]$ in one variable, we have the following: Every sum of squares in $\mathbb{R}[T]$ is a sum of two squares and one can show that $c(n)$ grows linearly in $n$: $c(n)=2n$. Thus, I hope that a similar result might hold over the integers too. Perhaps $c(n)$ even grows linearly in $n$? Is someone aware of something in that direction? 

Let $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}[x,y]_d$ be a two dimensional linear subspace of the vector space of bivariate forms of degree $d$. For each degree $d$ we can find such subspaces with the property that every element $f \in V$ has only real roots. Furthermore, these vector spaces with such a real-rooted-property can be characterized and are well understood. Now let $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}[x,y,z]_d$ be a three dimensional linear subspace. We say that $V$ has the real-rooted-property if for every two dimensional subspace $V' \subseteq V$ the common zero set $Z(V')=\{p \in \mathbb{P}^2: f(p)=0 \textrm{ for all } f \in V'\}$ consists just of real points. Now I have the following questions: 

Let $I_X\subseteq \mathbb{C}[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ be the homogeneous vanishing ideal of a set $X$ of $s$ points in $\mathbb{P}^2$. Let $d_1$ resp. $d_2$ denote the minimal resp. maximal degree of elements in a minimal set of generators of $I_X$. We always have $d_2\leq s$, but unless $X$ is contained in a line (i.e. $d_1=1$) this bound is not sharp. By Bezout's Theorem we have that $d_2\geq \frac{s}{d_1}$, so there is a lower bound on $d_2$ that is getting smaller for growing $d_1$. Is there something similar known for upper bounds, i.e. : What is the best known upper bound on $d_2$ depending only on $s$ and $d_1$? 

As a bonus question in an exam we were asked to find compact metrix spaces $X,Y$ and $Z$ such that $d_{GH}(X,Y)=d_{GH}(X,Z)=d_{GH}(Y,Z)>0$. The proposed answer is to take $\{0\},\{-1,1\}$ and $\{-1,0,1\}$. And the distances can be easily calculated by trying all appropriate correspondances and calculating distortions. However I proposed the following three sets ( there are only two radii and they are $R>r$) 

Let $X,Y$ be a bipartite graph and $X',Y'$ be two subsets of the vertices. Is there a Hall type theorem for the existence of matchings saturating both subsets simmultaneously? Clearly necessary conditions are for a saturating matching to exist in $X'\cup Y$ and $X\cup Y '$ but I don't know if this is sufficient. 

Good evening, I am currently taking a class which has combinatorial designs as the first topic, we are using Peter Cameron's book Designs, Graphs, Codes and their Links which I am finding extremely interesting. I am really interested in a rigorous study of combinatorial designs without their links now.Of course I plan to continue taking the class, but I would really like to read a textbook just on designs (I am especially interested in realizable designs (like the social golfer and Kirkman girl problem)). Thank you very much in advance. Regards. 

Let $G$ be a graph and $v$ one of its vertices. Are there any known formulas or fast algorithms for calculating the expected length of a random path in $G$ starting in $v$? In each step we choose a neighbour of the current vertex uniformly, if it has already been visited we stop the process, otherwise we move to that vertex. For example, if our graph is a path with $3$ vertices and $v$ is one of the edges, the expected length is $\frac{3+2}{2}$ 

Let $U$ be a finite set and $\mathcal O$ a set of subsets of $U$, how many subsets $\mathcal S$ of $\mathcal O$ satisfy the union of the elements of $\mathcal S$ is equal to $U$? I think the problem of finding the smallest of these subsets is called the set cover problem, I can't find any reference to this structure though. Thanks in advance. Regards. 

Edit: As Yusuf recommended, I'd like to point out that I am especially interested in the case where $y$ lies in the branch locus. Also $y$ is not necessarily a smooth point of the underlying reduced scheme of the branch divisor. 

Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group and let $A=\mathbb{C}[\Gamma]$ be the corresponding group algebra over $\mathbb{C}$. Let $X$ be the set of all maximal left ideals of $A$ and let $X_0=\{I \in X : \,\, A/I \textrm{ is finite dimensional } \mathbb{C} \textrm{-vector space}\}.$ Now consider $J= \bigcap_{I \in X} I$ and $J_0= \bigcap_{I \in X_0} I$. It is easy to see that $J$ and $J_0$ are two-sided ideals. The ideal $J$ is the Jacobson radical of $A$ and it has been proven that it is the zero ideal. My question is the following: For which groups $\Gamma$ is $J_0$ also the zero ideal? Is there some literature on this question? I am interested in necessary and sufficient criteria as well as in examples, but even more in non-examples. What I know so far: $J_0$ is the zero ideal: -if $\Gamma$ is finite (that's trivial), -if $\Gamma$ is commutative, -if $\Gamma$ is the free group in finitely many generators. 

You are right that in general this is not the case. For example let $X$ be the zero set of $x-y^2$ in $\mathbb{A}^2$ and consider the projection $X \to \mathbb{A}^1, (x,y) \mapsto x$. Perhaps you are looking for something like that: Let $f:X \to Y$ be a finite surjective morphism of real smooth varieties. Assume that the real points are dense in $X$, that the real points of $Y$ are connected and that $f$ is unramified over the real points of $X$. Then the image of the real points should be the real points of the image. 

Consider the univariate case: In general, a linear combination of real-rooted polynomials is not real-rooted: Let $f_1=(z+1)^2$ and $f_2=(z-1)^2$. Every convex combination of $f_1,f_2$ which is not $f_1$ or $f_2$ is not real rooted. Here are some positive criteria: Assume that the $f_i$ have a common interlacer and that they have positive leading coeficient, then every convex combination is real-rooted. See $URL$ for the definitions (text after Lemma 4.2). If we have just two univariate polynomials $f$ and $g$, then every linear combination is real rooted if and only if $f$ and $g$ are real rooted and interlace each other. For more than one variable you have to specify what you mean by real rooted: Every nonconstant polynomial in more than one variable has nonreal roots. 

I think the following works: Looking at the book enumeration of finite groups, We obtain that the number of groups of order $p^k$ is at least: $$\frac{p^{\frac{2m^3}{27}}}{p^{\frac{2}{3}m^2}}$$ We also obtain that the number of groups of order $n$ is: $$n^{\frac{2\mu^2}{27}}n^{\mathcal O(\mu^{3/2})}$$ where $\mu$ is the largest exponent for a prime power dividing $N$. So take a natural $N$, and suppose that $2^m$ is the largest power of $2$ not exceeding $N$, we obtain that the number of groups of order $2^m$ is at least: $$\frac{2^{\frac{2m^3}{27}}}{2^{\frac{2}{3}m^2}}=\frac{(2^m)^{\frac{2}{27}m^2}}{(2^m)^{\frac{2}{3}m}}\geq\frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^{\frac{2}{3}m}2^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}\geq \frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^m}$$ On the other hand, if $n$ is an odd integer less than $N$, clearly its $\mu$ is at most $m\log_3(2)+1$. For large values of $m$ we can just bound this by $\alpha m$, for some pre-selected $\alpha<1$. So the number of groups of odd order is : $$N(N^{\frac{2\alpha^2 m^2}{27}}N^{\mathcal O(m^{3/2})})$$. So the fraction between the number of groups of order $2^m$ and the number of groups of odd order less than $N$ for large $N$ is at least: $$\frac{N^{\frac{2m^2}{27}}}{N^mN(N^{\frac{2\alpha m^2}{27}}N^{\mathcal O(m^{3/2})})}=N^{\frac{2(1-\alpha^2)m^2}{27}-\mathcal O(m^{3/2})}$$ Which clearly goes to infinity. 

Consider a set of $n$ red lines and $m$ blue lines, suppose there are $nm$ distinct red-blue intersections. What is the minimum number of lines $L_1,L_2,\dots, L_n$ such that the union contains all $nm$ intersection points except for exactly one? A trivial construction is to take $n-1$ red lines and $m-1$ blue lines. I have not been able to find any case in which there is something better. This problem is migrated from math.se , no advances were made. Could someone point me to a more general family of problems or theory of this type? Best Regards. 

I would like to know information regarding the function $h(n)$ where $h(n)$ is the number of hamiltonian cycles the graph $K_n$ has after removing the edges that make up a hamiltonian cycle of $K_n$. Thank you very much in advance. Regards. 

I am looking for some resources that provide information on traceable graphs(paths containing a hamiltonian path). I have found a lot of information on hamiltonian graphs, but none on traceable graphs. Thank you very much in advance. Regards.
