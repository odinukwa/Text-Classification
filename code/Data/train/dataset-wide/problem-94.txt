Optimistic Note I recently asked this question, and it made me realize that it's very possible for this object to accrete matter from a passing star with a debris disk. If someone answers that question, I'll be able to tell you just how much, but I can assume that, given a close enough passing distance and a high enough density, the brown dwarf can accrete a decent amount of matter. It's doubtful as to whether it could capture enough to form a protoplanetary disk (because it's so low-mass), but it's possible 

There is a surprisingly diverse range of handheld weapons for use in combat, beyond the typical gun-related firearms. I'm looking for a cooler way to destroy enemies, and though flamethrowers are interesting, I'd like to not incinerate people, but liquefy them. The requirements: 

We have to divide this number by two to account for the fact that only one of the two beams is hitting the ship - and this is still a little inaccurate, as it assumes the ship is hit by the whole beam. Anyway, gamma-ray bursts, on average, can last from anywhere between less than a second to 30 seconds. Let's say ours lasts for 10 seconds. Because the definition of power is $\frac{E}{t}$, where $E$ is work and $t$ is time, we can say that the power here is $$P=\frac{E}{t}$$ $$P=\frac{5 \times 10^{43}}{10}$$ $$P= 5 \times 10^{42} \text{ Watts}$$ Plugging into our earlier equation for acceleration, we get $$a=\frac{\frac{E}{t}}{2 M\pi r^2c}A$$ $$a=\frac{ 5 \times 10^{42}}{2 M\pi r^2c}A$$ Assuming a mass of the ship similar to the Space Shuttle Orbiter (109,000 kilograms) which is admittedly an unlikely comparison, we make this $$a=\frac{5 \times 10^{42}}{2 \times 1.09 \times 10^5 \pi r^2c}A$$ $$a=\frac{5 \times 10^{37}}{2.18 \pi r^2c}A$$ If you want, you can plug in the area of the underside of the Space Shuttle Orbiter (a stat I can't find, at the moment) and discover that the space shuttle would take quite a hit if it was near a gamma-ray burst. Note that this is only valid for a ship traveling at a slow speed. At near-light speeds, the relativistic mass would increase (although I don't know if this is valid perpendicular to the direction of its initial motion). This would impact your calculations; I'll try to figure out the corrections later. 

The only error there is that mass is what matters, not size. Earth and this object would share a common barycenter, but neither would be dominant over the other. Not counting the Moon, the system would look like one of these configurations: I think the second is more likely, given the way the configuration was formed. Earthquakes would absolutely be triggered. Well, perhaps not absolutely, but it makes sense. After all, the Earth can trigger Moonquakes. This object should, therefore, be able to trigger earthquakes. 

There have been some objections to this, namely, that it is difficult to determine the age of Earth through this method alone (there is a difference of 100 million years). I have some responses: 

Again, this is mainly a terminology point, but it arises from the idea that massive objects become spherical under the influence of their gravitational pull. Now I'll address the specific points in your question. 

Electricity pervades our daily lives, and makes possible a lot of technological achievements. Harnessing it helps the development of any civilization. The thing is, water - especially sea water - is a great conductor of electricity. I'd like to add electricity to an underwater civilization I'm working on, but I have two problems to deal with. 

I can't give more details about the level of technology or what other technologies exist, because I have no idea how earlier fire would be discovered (or at all). So, how can an underwater civilization use fire? 

You can bend the light to any angle. So all you have to do is put a massive object somewhere in the cosmos. Position it so that the light from the Sun reflected off of Earth will bend around it and come straight to Earth (this is nearly impossible because of the motion of the Earth, but hey, perhaps there's a solution). If this was done in the past, we could "look back in time" and see the solar system in the past. If we found a severe irregularity, such as the complete lack of an image of Earth - or an actual image of Ragnarok - we could tell that something had happened. 

First, I suppose I should define what a "theory of everything" actually is. I'd describe it as a mathematical model that predicts the behavior of any object under any given set of conditions. It should be valid in all situations, and should, experimentally, match previous observations of the universe. Some would argue that such a theory should also be "beautiful", but some definition of the word. Maybe that's true; maybe it's not. At any rate, a theory of everything should explain exactly what it claims to: everything. Central to the idea of a theory of everything is the idea of unification. There are four fundamental forces in the universe: electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, and gravity. We believe that a valid theory of everything might explain how all four forces are really just manifestations of a single underlying force; this principle is called unification. At high energies, all four forces should behave the same, as components of this force. We would expect similar results when talking about the particles involved in the theory. Let's talk about an example, a partial analog to a theory of everything: the electroweak interaction. The electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces were unified successfully by a number of theorists in the mid-20th century. Now, this unification did make some predictions - some of which you might have heard about: 

In a class discussion last week, someone pointed out that a typical core collapse supernova releases $\sim10^{46}\text{ J}$ of energy in the form of (anti-)neutrinos while only radiating $\sim10^{44}\text{ J}$ in the form of photons. This then means that the energy flux from neutrinos is about two orders of magnitude higher than the energy flux from photons. If you could find a way to capture that energy, you'd have . . . quite lot of energy. I'm considering this as a possible power generation mechanism in a world of mine. The problem is, you'd need to capture a lot of neutrinos, and that's not easy. From SN 1987A, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 25 neutrinos were captured by several detectors out of a total of $\sim10^{58}$. Granted, we're about $1.5\times10^{5}$ light-years away, and so, with the same efficiency, we could capture perhaps $\sim5\times10^9$ neutrinos at a distance of $10$ light-years. But that wouldn't even get us $1\text{ J}$ of energy, assuming we captured all of the energy from each neutrino! Neutrino detection might be an implausible energy source, even given the high energies of supernovae. I currently don't think it's possible to wrest anything useful from it. However, I'd at least like to give it a shot before dismissing it. Therefore, I have one question: How efficient can a neutrino detector be? In other words, given a certain flux of neutrinos, what is the upper bound to the fraction that the detector could absorb? Some clarifications: 

This question is inspired by Green's Volcanoes in Orbit! The premise is that there is a 50-mile-high shield volcano (again, let's ignore the height implausibility) with a slope of about 2-3 degrees, at its base. In my case, this is a rare pyroclastic shield volcano. I calculated that if the mean slope is maybe 4 degrees, then the volcano should have a diameter of roughly 900 km. That is a lot of usable land - the size of a decent-sized country! I figured that people might as well as use this land for something - mainly the extreme lower slopes (i.e. up to 5,000 - 10,000 feet). You might see small towns and farming communities. The problem, of course, is that if the volcano erupts, it will likely release pyroclastic flows that will surge down the mountain, destroying or burying most things in their path. Now, people would have 2-3 hours' notice of an eruption, given the typical speed of these flows, and so they could prepare. They'd need to either evacuate or shelter in place, preferably protecting their town (or both) in some way. My current idea calls for domes about 1 km in diameter, 500 meters tall, that come up from the ground to encircle each small town (and yes, these would be very small settlements - more like villages than towns. Just to be clear, I have the above setup well-planned out. I'm not asking about any of that. There is going to be a chance that someone may be outside when the flow hits, either doing maintenance on the dome or trying to escape in vain. There's also the possibility of trying to survive if a dome collapses. I'd like to design them a survival suit that will save them from the extreme heat and forces. The person may end up buried in ash, but they can survive for a short amount of time, and maybe (just maybe) be rescued. What would be the best material to make this suit out of, using current technology? It would need to be resistant to temperatures of hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit, as well as possibly protecting the wearer from impacts from ejecta. Obviously, it does need to be wearable, flexible, and hopefully not too bulky (although bulkiness is okay, if need me). If there's no possible material, then that's also fine. 

Probably not. A direct quote from here would be nice, but I'm not sure if there's any relevant copyright on the text, so I'll just summarize. Here are the steps to forming a contact binary star system: 

Take one dollar, and set up a savings account in a back with as high an interest rate as possible. A short while later, withdraw some money - the interest gained - and place it in a new account in another bank. Repeat. After enough time, he will have plenty of bank accounts and lots of money. All thanks to just one dollar. 

It seems, then, that the obvious thing to do would be to place the planet somewhere with a higher flux of galactic cosmic rays. I don't think we can decrease antiproton loss rates without affecting production via the atmospheric collision pathway. You could try to introduce a very strong cosmic ray source into the planetary system, but I don't have any ideas what that could be. It could also be detrimental to the habitability of other planets. One problem is that we don't have a great idea of where all of the galactic cosmic rays come from. There are quite a few possibilities out there (and all of these could produce different components of the GCR flux on Earth):
