Consider the following differential $(n-1)$-form $\omega$ on $M$: for $p\in M$ and $v_1,\dots,v_{n-1}\in T_pM$, define $$ \omega(v_1,\dots,v_{n-1}) = [ \psi(p), \nu(p), d\psi(v_1),\dots,d\psi(v_{n-1})] $$ where the square brackets denote the standard volume form in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ (in other words, the determinant). A simple computation shows that $$ d\omega = n(1+H\langle\psi,\nu\rangle)dA . $$ Now the formula follows from the fact that $\int_M d\omega=0$ by Stokes. This works for any immersed orientable hypersurface. For a non-orientable one, consider the oriented double cover. Note that in the embedded case one may assume that $M$ is a submanifold and $\psi$ is the inclusion, and then the formula for $\omega$ gets simpler: just remove all $\psi$ and $d\psi$. Unfortunately I don't remember where I have read this proof, it was too long ago. (And I think that that text was only for $n=2$ anyway.) 

You don't have to define your objects as sets, in fact, you should avoid such unnatural definitions. I don't think a number theorist would be happy to see a proof referring to elements of a natural number or using the identity $1=\{0\}$. Such proofs are not acceptable because they won't survive even the slightest change in the foundations. Similarly, if you develop Euclidean geometry, you don't define a point as a two-element set whose first element is a Dedekind cut and the second one is another weird set. You rather begin with axioms (either Euclidean ones or some axiomatization of the real line) and build the geometry on these. The set theory comes in if you want to show that your theory is consistent (as long as ZF is), and you do that by building a model within ZF. In your example with men, your actually create a mathematical model of whatever you want to study, in the same way as physics does. There are always translation steps from real world to mathematics and back, they just happen to be trivial in this case. So it's not a problem that men are (modelled by) sets. Only if you like to believe that mathematical objects do exist in some metaphysical sense, you will have a problem with the counter-intuitive claim that everything is a set. But you can just remove this axiom and stay agnostic about whether everything is a set or not. You will not lose anything - the only essential use of this axiom is that you are able to define the notion of equality rather than having it built into logic. And this is hardly of any importance outside the logic itself. 

Well, I'll not say anything deeply new here - just a (hopefully correct) summary. Suppose you are given your favorite manifold, say $Q.$ Then its cotangent bundle $M=T^* Q$ comes equipped with some canonical structure (Keep in mind that the cotangent bundle $T^* Q$ and the tangent bundle $TQ$ are isomorphic as vector bundles over $Q$ (in particular their total spaces are diffeomorphic, but not canonically so), but for some miraculous reason the cotangent bundle has "more" structure). Denote by $\pi:T^* Q\rightarrow Q$ the projection, associating to a covector its basepoint. Differentiating this yields the tangent map of $\pi$, $T\pi: T(T^* Q)\rightarrow TQ$. With its help one can define a one-form $\theta$ on $T^* Q$ (usually called "canonical" or Liouville one-form). It is defined via $\theta_\alpha:T_\alpha (T^* Q)\rightarrow \mathbb{R},$ $v\mapsto \alpha(d\pi(\alpha).v)$ for any point $\alpha\in T^* Q$. To explain why the definition makes sense: $v$ is an arbitrary element of $T_\alpha (T^* Q)$, the differential of $\pi$ at $\alpha,$ $d\pi(\alpha)$ is a linear map from $T_\alpha (T^* Q)$ to $T_{\pi(\alpha)} Q$. Furthermore $\alpha$ can be interpreted as a linear form on the tangent space of its base point; consequently it makes sense to evaluate it on $d\pi(\alpha).v$. Now the symplectic form $\omega\in \Omega^2(T^*Q)$ is defined as the exterior differential of $\theta$ (some authors prefer to smuggle a minus sign in). Notice $\omega$ is defined purely intrinsically (no choice of coordinates for instance, even though one often sees expressions like $\theta=p_idq^i$). That's the reason why you can associate a symplectic manifold (aka phase space) to any manifold (aka configuration space). But to elaborate on what Jos√© Figueroa-O'Farrill already said: there are symplectic manifolds which are not of the form $T^* Q$ for some $Q$. Probably the easiest example are closed symplectic manifolds, i.e. compact ones without boundary (they occur for instance as surfaces with a fixed volume form or as nonsingular complex projective varieties together with the Fubini-Study form). You can easily show that their symplectic form can not be exact (that is, of the form $d\theta$ for some one-form $\theta$) unless they are zero-dimensional. Because if it were exact, by Stokes' theorem the integral $\int \omega^{\wedge (dim M/2)}$ would have to be zero. And it is difficult to find manifolds with zero total volume! In order to answer the second question: the Lie algebra structure on $\mathfrak{g}=Lie(G)$ induces a Poisson structure on its dual $\mathfrak{g}^*,$ as for instance explained in $URL$ 

This is true and well known. By the minimax principle, $\alpha_k$ is the minimum over all $k$-dimensional subspaces of the norm of the quadratic form $v\mapsto(v,Yv)$ restricted to the subspace. And similarly for $\beta_k$ and $(v,Xv)$. Since $(v,Yv)\ge(v,Xv)$ for every vector $v$, the same inequality holds for the norms of restrictions to subspaces and hence for eigenvalues. I think any textbook covering the minimax principle has this corollary. 

I'm afraid that the torsion is not motivated by any picture. It's just the skew-symmetric part of $\nabla$. Let $M$ be your manifold and $p\in M$. Consider two tangent vectors $v,w\in T_pM$. You can extend them to commuting vector fields $V$ and $W$ in a neighborhood of $p$. Then $$ T(v,w) = \nabla_vW-\nabla_wV , $$ so in this case $T$ measures non-symmetry of $\nabla$. In general (for non-commuting vector fields), the formula $\nabla_XY-\nabla_YX$ does not define a tensor and the term $[X,Y]$ fixes this problem. 

Since the surfaces of genus $\ge 1$ are aspherical, the homotopy types of maps are classified by their induced homomorphisms of fundamental groups. This is essentially what the final result says. (But, since the fundamental group depends on a marked point in a nontrivial way, and homotopies do not respect marked points, the precise formulation involves these equivalences.) The injectivity of $\Phi$ is covered by the "if" part of Lemma. To prove surjectivity, identify $G_1$ and $G_2$ with fundamental groups $\pi_1(X_1,x_1)$ and $\pi_1(X_2,x_2)$. Now it suffices to prove that, for any homomorphism $h:\pi_1(X_1,x_1)\to\pi_1(X_2,x_2)$ there is a map from $X_1$ to $X_2$ which maps $x_1$ to $x_2$ and induces $h$ on the fundamental group level. This can be proved as follows. Construct a cell division of $X_1$ consisting of the marked point $x_1$ (the only 0-dimensional cell), loops $\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_{2g}$ (where $g$ is the genus) as 1-dimensional cells (they generate the fundamental group), and a $4g$-gon $D$ attached to these loops as the only 2-dimensional cell. Map $x_1$ to $x_2$, then map each $\gamma_i$ to a loop representing $h([\gamma_i])\in\pi_1(X_2,x_2)$, then extend this map to $D$. There is no obstruction in the last step because the boundary of $D$ represents the identity of $\pi_1(X_1,x_1)$, hence the boundary of its desired image in $X_2$ (formed by the images of the $\gamma_i$'s) represents the identity of $\pi_1(X_2,x_2)$ and hence can be extended to a map of the 2-disc. I don't read German either, but I'm fairly sure this is what is written in the proof of Satz in the cited Hopf's paper. 

I recently learned that the answer to the question is YES, answered in the ETH preprint "H-cobordism for Hilbert Manifolds" by Dan Burghelea. I found the reference in the article "On the differential topology of Hilbert manifolds" of Eells and Elworthy. 

Let $O$ be an open subset of the separable Hilbert space H and $k\geq0$ . Consider $C_b^k(O, Sym(H))$, the space of k-times continuously differentiable maps with values in the bounded symmetric endomorphisms of $H$, bounded up to their k-th derivative. Equipped with the usual norm this space becomes a Banach space. Is this space separable, i.e. has a dense sequence? I need this result for transversality theory in Morse theory, where the space above serves as a space of suitable perturbations. The separability is needed in order to aplly the Sard-Smale theorem. 

I am looking for a list of the irreducible representations of O(2). Could someone please provide a reference? EDIT: I am particularly interested in the representations on IR^2 (irreducible or not) 

Well, one should think in term of Euclidean motions, i.e. rotations AND translations (see Cartan connections) - hence the name affine connection. The (Cartan) curvature of this (Cartan) connection splits into two parts: one measuring infinitesimal rotations (i.e. the ordinary Riemannian curvature) and one measuring infinitesimal translations ("slipping") (i.e. the torsion). Maybe one should elaborate on this in more detail. (This explanation is related to Jose's) 

Let $I$ be a bounded interval and consider a sequence $(u_k)$ in $H^{1,2}(I)$ (usual Sobolev space). Suppose furthermore, that the sequence $(u_k)$ is bounded in $H^{1,2}(I)$. Then, by Rellich, we can extract a subsequence, still denoted by $u_k,$ s.t. $u_k$ converges to some $\bar{u}$ in $C^0(I)$. Furthermore, by weak compactness of bounded sets in $H^{1,2}(I)$ we can select a subsequence, s.t. $u_k$ converges to some $u$ weakly in $H^{1,2}(I)$. Thus, $u_k$ converges to $\bar{u}$ in $C^0$ and weakly to $u$ in $H^{1,2}$. Do these limits coincide, i.e. is it true that $u=\bar{u}$?
