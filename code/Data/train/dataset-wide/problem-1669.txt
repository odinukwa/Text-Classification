"Cosmos" is the English cognate of the ancient Greek word which refers to the entirety of existence. It is equivalent to the Latin-derived word "universe;" the only difference between the two is the language of origin. 

Most targets for HST are very distant - the Deep Field galaxies are tens of billions of light-years away. The total displacement of the HST over even many days is so small as to be irrelevant at such distances. It does not cause a noticeable difference in the image alignment. Nearer objects imaged by HST generally have much higher apparent brightnesses. For example, as viewed from Earth even the brightest galaxies are much dimmer than Jupiter, which HST has also imaged. Greater brightness means a shorter exposure is needed for the same amount of light to be gathered by the sensor. Furthermore, nearby objects have well-known relative movements that can be corrected for if necessary. 

The aspect of the universe described as "flat" is the spacetime curvature. In General Relativity gravity isn't treated as a force but as a curvature of the spacetime manifold. At large scales the universe is expanding: negative curvature like the top of a hill, where things roll downhill away from each other. But mass causes a positive curvature like a bowl, where things roll together, toward the bottom of the bowl. On average the two regimes of curvature appear to be balanced - i.e. the universe is, on average, flat.

In general, the common practice is to dither exposures and fill in the gaps. The dither serves multiple purposes: 

Image from Meteors? Even More Remarkable by Bruce Maccabee at brumac.8k.com Consider the meteor path in the image above. it can be seen that, 

Another factor is the thickness of the atmosphere itself. The thickness of the atmosphere increases in path of the meteor from $H_{i}$ to $H_{m}$, and decreases from there to $H_{f}$. As the 'glowing' of the shooting star is directly dependent on the density of the atmosphere, its visibility trails of near the observer's horizon. This is another reason for the meteor looking like its falling towards the horizon. This can be seen clearly in case of meteor showers which appear to radiate from a point.

As seen from the (first) figure, the ecliptic also touches the edge of the constellation Cetus, though it in not usually included in the Zodiacal constellations. Note about Precession: Because the Earth in inclined (by $23.45^{\circ}$), it rotates like a top. This is called precession, which results in a shift in the position of the constellations relative to us on Earth. The result is that the 'Signs of the Zodiac' are off by about one month. 

The properties of the terrestrial magnetosphere vary so widely, you would need to narrow down this question. For instance, the charge states are completely different (e.g., we observe $O^{1+}$ but not $O^{7+}$) but the number densities range from ~$10^{-2}-10^{3} \ cm^{-3}$. 

We don't have any measurements near 1 AU that are at high latitudes. Some spacecraft have done out of ecliptic polar orbits with high apogees, but the heliocentric latitudes were still within ~$10^{\circ}$ of the ecliptic plane. The notes above discuss our only real measurements out of the ecliptic by the Ulysses spacecraft. 

Velocity The solar wind speed has a large range of variation, between ~250–820 km/s [e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Gopalswamy, 2006; Jian et al., 2011, 2014; Kasper et al., 2012; Maksimovic et al., 1998; Marsch, 1983; McComas et al., 2013; Schwenn, 1983; Stverak et al., 2008, 2009] near the ecliptic plane. These values are not including interplanetary shocks, which can have speeds exceeding 2000 km/s. The speed is generally higher at higher latitudes out of the ecliptic plane, tending to be over 650 km/s [e.g., McComas et al., 2008; 2013]. Number Density The number density also has a large range of values, from ~2–90 $cm^{-3}$ [e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Gopalswamy, 2006; Jian et al., 2011, 2014; Kasper et al., 2012; Maksimovic et al., 1998; Marsch, 1983; McComas et al., 2013; Schwenn, 1983; Stverak et al., 2008, 2009]. Again, these do not include interplanetary shocks or coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Charge State The alpha particle to proton number density ratio varies between ~1-5%, depending on solar cycle and solar wind speed [e.g., Kasper et al., 2012; Schwadron et al., 2014]. We have also measured the ratio of $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ and $C^{6+}/C^{5+}$, finding ~1-30% and ~20-200%, respectively [e.g., Schwadron et al., 2014]. 

"Constellations ecliptic equirectangular plot" by Cmglee, Timwi, NASA - Own work, $URL$ Licensed under Public Domain via Commons. As a result, the path of the ecliptic now officially passes through thirteen constellations: the twelve traditional 'zodiac constellations' and Ophiuchus (which was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy), the bottom part of which interjects between Scorpio and Sagittarius. 

From this answer, it seems that the Harlan J Smith telescope located at the McDonald Observatory, in Texas, with a 107-inch (2.7 m) aperture is the largest aperture telescope that was ever fitted with an eyepiece. Some independent evidence is there to indicate that this indeed had an eyepiece. 

You're correct that the tilt of the analemma varies with the latitude. Observers in the Northern hemisphere will obtain an analemma curve with the broader loop at the bottom. This reverses for observers in the Southern hemisphere, where the broader loop is on the top of the curve. At equator, the anlaemma lies on its side. At north pole, only the top of the analemma would be visible, while it is the opposite at the south pole. 

In historical astronomy, the zodiac is a circle of twelve 30° divisions of celestial longitude that are centered upon the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over the course of the year. Historically, each of these divisions were called signs and named after a constellation: Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, and Scorpius. In 1930, the International Astronomical Union defined the boundaries between the various constellations, under Eugène Delporte , who, 

The HST orbits the Earth roughly in a plane. Also, the moon orbits the Earth roughly in a plane and the Earth orbits the sun in roughly a plane, and all three of these planes are within 30° or so of each other. So there's actually a rather large slice of sky (or two slices in opposite directions, if you prefer) where there are no regular interruptions to viewing. Furthermore, without knowing the exact design of the telescope, I'd nevertheless assume that it could through means of a shutter or other methods self-interrupt during times that a known interruption would obscure the intended shot. There's no particular reason for the telescope to take a single continuous exposure, after all. As far as your concerns about targets becoming "out of alignment," keep in mind that the HST is designed to be very sensitive for imaging very distant objects (with low apparent brightness). This means one of two things, depending on which end of the distance spectrum you're considering: 

Let's say I'm floating in space with two toy tops. I spin them in opposite directions at the same speed. Each of them has angular momentum but the total angular momentum of the system is zero. On a larger scale the same thing could happen universe-wide. As stars and galaxies formed they would end up spinning every which way, but the total angular momentum would be unchanged. 

The term "superficial" means "on the surface," so "superficial gravity" is the same as surface gravity. As @pela pointed out in the comments, the author of the article is Portuguese and in that language the word for surface is 'superficie.' 

Analemma is a diagram showing the deviation of the Sun from its mean motion in the sky, as viewed from a fixed location on the Earth. Note that it says nothing about time- it can be any fixed time. Analemmas created at different times of the day have slightly different shapes. For example, see the solar analemmas taken at the same place at different times. 

The way telescopes work is pretty much the same in the optical and radio wavelengths- the telescopes collect electromagnetic radiation, rather than focusing at a point. There are multiple reasons for this, the main one being the amount of photons reaching the telescope from the region of interest is pretty low. In order to collect more photons, the telescope (or telescope array) has to 'look' into the area of interest for a long time- this is achieved in case of earth based telescopes by mechanically steering the antennae, so that they are pointed in the same direction for a long amount of time. The principle is pretty much the same in space. For looking at KIC 8462852, SETI used the Allen Telescope Arry, which is basically a set of 42 antennae scanning the skies in radio wavelengths. The problem of earth's rotation is basically solved in two steps by (radio) telescopes. 

The dither pattern varies from telescope to telescope. For example, the following image shows the dither pattern of Chandra telescope. 

Generally, waves with $f < f_{pe}$ experience damping as they propagate through a plasma. This is because the wave fields oscillate slow enough to interact with the particles, thus adding an effective inertia term to the system. ELF and VLF waves generally damp through cyclotron and Landau resonances. Note, however, that both of these resonances are also the processes responsible for wave growth in the presence of sufficient free energy (e.g., free energy from beams is often related to a Landau-like or Cerenkov-like emission). 

The solar wind ram(dynamic) pressure is typically only ~1 nPa or $10^{-9} \ J \ m^{-3}$. This is highly variable and can change in milliseconds (e.g., interplanetary shocks), but that would still only be $10^{-6} \ W \ m^{-3}$. If we make a hand-wavy argument that this drops to zero in ~3 $R_{E}$ (i.e., upper bound on thickness of magnetosheath), then the power per unit area can be up to ~20 W $m^{-2}$. However, I would not read too much into that number as the actual power dissipated per unit area is different for numerous reasons. References 

In space plasmas, ELF is used to describe waves in the frequency band ~3 Hz to ~3 kHz. Very low frequency (VLF) is used to describe waves in the frequency band ~3 kHz to ~30 kHz. Generally the cutoff frequency of the Earth's ionosphere prevents waves at such low frequencies from freely passing through it. In plasmas, this tends to be any wave at or below the local electron plasma frequency, which can be approximated as $f_{pe} \approx 8.9787 \ \sqrt{n_{e} \left[ cm^{-3} \right]}$ kHz (where the $\left[ cm^{-3} \right]$ implies that the electron number density, $n_{e}$, should be in units of $cm^{-3}$). The densities in the ionosphere are ~$10^{3} - 10^{6} \ cm^{-3}$, which corresponds to $f_{pe}$ ~ 280 kHz to ~9 MHz. Early studies found a relationship between lightning and a VLF emissions called whistlers. It is now known that high energy electron beams, associated with the lightning, escape into the magnetosphere. These beams radiate the whistlers through a plasma instability (i.e., free energy due to a fast beam streaming through an otherwise homogeneous plasma). So the free energy sources can escape the lower atmosphere, but the electromagnetic emissions at such low frequencies cannot. 

The falling star or shooting star has nothing to do with a star. If shooting stars were actual stars, we'll be burning in their atmosphere, rather than the other way around. When a meteoroid, comet or (small) asteroid (or space debris in some cases) enters the Earth's atmosphere at high speed (typically in excess of 20 km/s), aerodynamic heating produces a streak of light, both from the glowing object and the trail of glowing particles that it leaves in its wake. This is called a meteor or shooting star (or a falling star). In general, the meteors travel in a (approximately) straight path. We usually see only the large ones travel down towards the horizon while the small ones are burnt up long before that (giving the impression of coming from the horizon). 

There are thirteen modern constellations in the Zodiac. In modern astronomy, a constellation is a specific area of the celestial sphere as defined by the International Astronomical Union. In total, there are 88 constellations. Astronomy and Astrology are not the same thing. Astronomy is a science while Astrology is not. As such, I'll restrict myself to the historical and modern constellations of the Zodiac. According to Encylopedia Brittanica

Solar analemma at 1400 UTC by Anthony Ayiomamitis, from solar-center.stanford.edu The best way to understand the effect of latitude on the shape of the analemma is to consider the effect of earth's axial tilt on the shape of the analemma.
