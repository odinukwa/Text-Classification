I found the problem, and now I feel dumb but I suppose I should leave the question up so people can know the potential pitfall and prepare for it better than I did. The problem arose from me misreading (and clearly misunderstanding) the equilibrium conditions for the problem, where it states that the interest rate $r_t$ on loans issued today and paid back tomorrow is equal to $\text{rental}_{t+1}$, the rental rate on capital used tomorrow, which is of course equal to tomorrow's marginal product of capital. I had my problem set up with $r_t = \text{rental}_{t+1}$, which is incorrect. This means that yes, we should have $r_t = \text{rental}_{t+1} = F_K(K(t+1), H(t+1))$, which makes the exercise a simple algebra problem. I just had my subscripts all messed up! Here's why $r_t = \text{rental}_{t+1}$ (summarized from text): If $r_t < \text{rental}_{t+1}$, then under perfect foresight (an assumption of the basic model in the given chapter), people will attempt to borrow infinitely to capture the profit of $\text{rental}_{t+1} - r_t$, and this condition cannot hold in equilibrium. On the other hand, if $r_t > \text{rental}_{t+1}$, then nobody will want to hold capital until the next term, instead attempting to lend all of their funds out. 

Indifference is different from incompleteness. A good example is indecisiveness. Eliaz and Ok have a nice discussion. Suppose you want to buy holidays for your family. You know your wife prefers Bahamas to Florida to Paris. Since you do not care particularly about the destination, you choose trying to represent their preferences. If Bahamas and Florida are available, you will choose Bahamas. If Bahamas and Paris are available, you may choose either of the two. But if Paris and Florida are available, you may also choose either of the two (absent any intensity of preferences)!. Notice that you are not indifferent since if you strictly prefer Bahamas to Florida and you do not prefer Bahamas to Paris, you should strictly prefer Paris to Florida. 

The easiest way to prove it is using the 'old' definition of continuity. $\succ$ is continuous iff whenever $x\succ y$, there exists neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$, $B_x, B_y$, such that all $z\in B(x)$ and $z'\in B(y)$, $z\succ z'$. Suppose $x\succ y$. Because $u$ represents $\succ$, $u(x)>u(y)$. Let $2\epsilon=u(x)-u(y)$. Because $u$ is continuous, there exists some $\delta>0$ such that for all $z\in B_{\delta}(x)$, $u(z)>u(x)-\epsilon$. Similarly, for all $z'\in B_{\delta}(y)$, $u(z')>u(y)+\epsilon$. But then for all $z\in B_{\delta}(x)$ and $z'\in B_{\delta}(y)$, $z\succ z'$ as required. 

You generally set the price of "all other goods" to \$1, as "all other goods" is usually measured as "dollars worth of all other goods." Then the maximum quantity of all other goods is just the available income. Then to find the quantity of other goods Hulk buys, just find out how much money is available after he vists the gym 20 times. 

As I had hoped to learn enough macroeconomic theory to get some research ideas, my goal at the beginning of this summer was to read through and complete the problems in an introductory advanced macroeconomics text (my first-year PhD macro courses left me more stunned than enlightened). I started with The McCandless's ABCs of RBCs, and quickly found that it was above my ability level when I reached problems I didn't even know how to set up, so now I'm trying Romer's Advanced Macroeconomics. I've gotta say that after having to consult the solutions manual several times through Chapter 2 out of 12, I'm feeling rather discouraged as the solutions involve methods that are not intuitive to me and not discussed in the text. Is there even any point in someone with my skill level tackling such a task? I can't really see myself being a macroeconomic theorist after this, and it seems that the vast majority of empirical macroeconomic studies use reduced-form linear models backed by hand-waving arguments based on principles or intermediate theory, so I'm starting to doubt the utility of studying advanced theory at all. I understand this may be an an "illegal" question here on Stack Exchange, so I won't protest if it's closed. But if not, does anyone have any tips for how to proceed? 

I don't think there is right or wrong. Here is an example of what could be behind some of these arguments. Let us assume that there are two buyers in the economy: Singer and Foreman. Foreman enjoys meat but he prefers humane meat (other things equal). Let $V$ be the value that Foreman derives from a unit of humane meat and $v$ the value from normal meat. Singer is a consequentialist and has as a goal to reduce the meat consumption. Singer is willing to pay $1\$$ to reduce the total consumption of meat in unit and $\beta\$<1$$ to reduce the total consumption of humane meat. If Singer was alone, he would simply refrain from eating. Because Singer is a consequentialist he does not care who eats the meat (this simplifies the analysis). Now, suppose that there are scale economies in the production of humane meat so that the first unit costs $C$ and the second costs $C'$, while the production of normal meat has constant returns and the marginal cost is $c$. Both markets are competitive. If $V-C<v-c$, then in isolation Foreman would buy normal meat. Singer would have a disutility of $1$. If Singer buys humane meat then Foreman would do so too if $V-C'>v-c$ (which may be possible since $C'<C$). Singer would then have a disutility of $2\beta+C'$ (the price of the meat plus the total disutility of two units). If $2\beta+C'<1$, then Singer judges the world to be better if he buys humane meat and he proceeds to do so. Thus, if activists consider 'humane meat' to be much better than normal meat and there are substantial scale economies in its production, they may prefer to buy it as a way of inducing others to do the same. If they have agent-specific morality (e.g. they prefer a world in which others buy meat than a world in which they buy meat but they have the same world consumption), then participating in the humane meat market may be a less desirable option. Finally, notice that there are other ways in which Singer could improve the world. For instance, he can buy stock in humane meat consumption and swallow the losses that come from selling at a price $p=c+V-v<C$. This gives Singer a disutility of $\beta+(C-c)-(V-v)$ which is lower if $\beta$ is sufficiently high. (For simplicity I assume that Singer does not consider Foreman's consumption of utility as deserving moral praise so he does not include Foreman's extra utility in his computation. If he did, then buying humane meat would be even more desirable.) 

(How would I formalize this concept?) EDIT: Also, in Financial Asset Pricing Theory by Munk (chapter 10, p.371) it says 

"But if any of these control variables are endogenous to some omitted variable, doesn't this contaminate the unbiasedness of ALL the independent variables?" I don't want to emphasize this too much, but it's worth mentioning that this is not true in general. The following derivation will hopefully provide some understanding of the "contamination" you mention. As a simple counterexample, suppose that the data generating process is given by $$ Y = X_1 \beta_1 + X_2 \beta_2 + Z \gamma + \varepsilon, $$ where $Z$ is unobserved. Let $Cov(X_1,Z) = 0$, $Cov(X_2, Z) \neq 0$, and $Cov(X_1,X_2) = 0$. Then, it is clear that $X_2$ is "endogenous." But notice that because $Cov(X_1,Z) = 0$, our estimate of $\beta_1$ will still be ok: $$ \text{plim}\, \hat \beta_{1} = \beta_1 + \gamma \frac{Cov(X_1^*, Z)}{Var(X_1^*)} = \beta_1, $$ where $X_1^* = M_2 X_1$ and $M_2 = [I - X_2(X_2'X_2)^{-1}X_2']$. Because $Cov(X_1,X_2) = 0$, $X_1^* = X_1$. So $Cov(X_1^*,Z)=0$. "What can we do?" One of the mains challenges of doing good econometrics is thinking of potential identification strategies. In the type of situation you describe, there is probably nothing you can do but to try to approach the problem a different way. 

Short answer: Yes, the SRAS curve will shift after the LRAS shifts to return the short-run equilibrium (SRAS/AD) back in line with the long-run equilibrium (LRAS/AD). The reason the SRAS curve doesn't shift immediately with LRAS is that there are so-called "frictions" or "nominal rigidities" such as contracts and information gaps that prevent firms from adjusting supply plans instantly. Long answer: There are two simple "stories" we can tell to explain the dynamics of the elementary AS/AD model: the "inflation gap" story and the "output gap" story. Both of these stories are compatible with each other, so they're usually taught as both occurring at the same time. Inflation gap story: SRAS is modeled as shifting upward when expected price levels increase. We can consider the long-run (expected) equilibrium to occur at the intersection of LRAS and AD, and the short-run (actual) equilibrium to occur at the intersection of SRAS and AD. If you start in a long-run equilibrium where all three curves intersect, but then impose an LRAS shock on the model and shift the curve, then the expected price level and actual short-run price level will differ. This is what we call an inflation gap. As firm owners come to the realization that the supply shock is here to stay, they adjust their production processes to match and the SRAS curve shifts to bring the short-run equilibrium in line with the long-run equilibrium. Output gap story: SRAS is also modeled as shifting whenever prices of factors of production change. Thus the output gap generated by the supply shock becomes relevant, with actual short-run output out of line with the long-run sustainable level marked by the LRAS curve. For example, after a positive LRAS shock, the short-run equilibrium will have less output than the long-run sustainable level. The result is an abundance of resources, and the prices of factors of production will fall, causing firms to increase production and shift the SRAS to the right until actual output matches the long-run sustainable level. An opposite story can be told to explain why SRAS shifts left after a negative LRAS shock. 

The problems with using an energy-back currency are probably the same problems as using gold or anything else. Some of those mentioned in the link (Wikipedia article) include 

Here's a little discussion that might help. The population version has a solution because it is assumed to have a solution. You can see that this is the case from assumptions 3.1 (linearity), 3.3 (orthogonality conditions), and 3.4 (rank condition for identification). You can see the derivation of this fact from equations (3.3.3) and (3.3.4). Now, you'll notice the population version having a solution implies that $$ \text{rank}\left( \Sigma_{xz} \right ) = \text{rank}\left(\left [\Sigma_{xz} \mid \sigma_{xy} \right ]\right ), $$ as discussed in exercise 5 of section 3.3. In the hint they note that the population version has a solution when $$ \left [\Sigma_{xz} \mid \sigma_{xy} \right ] $$ is of rank $L$. If it has rank $L+1$, it will not have a solution. In the hint, they say that this is a set of "equality conditions." This is referring to the fact that one of the columns must be a linear combination of the remaining columns. This is a very hard condition to satisfy. In many models, this condition will hold with probability zero. This is because the data has to come out so that the equality condition holds perfectly. On the other hand, the condition that the sample version $S_{xy}$ of $\sum_{xz}$ be of full column rank is a set of "inequality" conditions on the matrix. Because they are inequality conditions on the matrix, they are much easier to satisfy by chance. In conclusion, $S_{xy}$ will have full column rank for sufficiently large $n$ because the conditions are inequality conditions which occur with probability larger than zero. However, to have a solution we need $\left [S_{xz} \mid s_{xy} \right ]$ to have rank $L$. But because this is an equality condition on the matrix, it only occurs with probability zero.

There was a time when they did, but it's a less common tool of monetary policy now. At any rate, altering the minimum reserve ratio at this point would be pointless due to the huge quantities of excess reserves banks have been holding since the 2008 bailouts and subsequent rounds of quantitative easing. The reserve ratio is a relevant tool of monetary policy only if banks are actually at or near that ratio, which few are at this time. 

Insofar as technology fails to substitute for all menial tasks, economic theory would dictate that those tasks pay a high enough wage to attract workers, so the wage for those jobs would likely be higher than they are in the absence of a UBI. The only serious pushes I see for a universal basic income come in response to the threat of technology advancement making many menial jobs obsolete, so this may not be as big a problem as you worry about (assuming a UBI scheme is in fact sustainable at all). In this context, the UBI is pitched as a way to more quickly distribute the "technology dividend" to displaced labor instead of letting it concentrate in the hands of capital owners. The strongest arguments I've heard for a UBI are based more on positive externalities. Consider how many intelligent people work menial jobs simply because they're the best-paying available. Perhaps if a few dozen hours of their weeks were freed up (for millions of people), they'd be able to engage in intellectual, artistic, or entrepreneurial pursuits with more long-term benefits to economic growth. This result, however, is contingent upon technology advancing fast enough to truly displace labor in the market. If capital equipment doesn't plunge in price to accompany the initial increase in tax costs, this would be a very hard sell. 

However, this is not to say that causal inference belongs only to econometrics. Wasserman, in All of Statistics, remarks at how parallel developments were made within statistics and econometrics, 

(Sufficient when (1) also adds that the good is so inferior that the income effect is greater than the substitution effect.) A Giffen good does not generate utility directly through its price. Contrast this to a Veblen good where there the user actually derives utility directly from the price. See this link for some info about empirical evidence. 

I've been meaning to post this for a long time. I came across this and thought it could add some insight. This example is from "Financial Asset Pricing Theory" by Munk. Consider the following figure. How many assets do we need to have a complete market? 

The following is a specific question that is useful for demonstrating a general idea. Consider the following autoregressive model: $$ X_{t+1} = \alpha_0 + \beta_0 (X_t - \alpha_0) + W_{t+1}, $$ where $-1 < \beta_0 < 1$ and $W_{t+1}$ is distributed as a normal with mean zero and variance one. How should I go about constructing the bivariate score process associated with the parameters $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$? How can I verify that it is a martingale? Progress: I would begin by constructing the log-likelihood process as follows (conditioning on $X_0$): $$ \ell_t(\theta \mid \textbf X) = -\frac t2 \ln(2 \pi) - \frac 12 \sum_{j=1}^t (X_j - \alpha_0 - \beta_0(X_{j-1} - \alpha_0))^2. $$ Then, the score process can be constructed as $$ s_t(\theta \mid \textbf X) = \begin{bmatrix} (1 - \beta_0) \sum_{j=1}^t (X_j - \alpha_0 - \beta_0(X_{j-1} - \alpha_0)) \\ \sum_{j=1}^t (X_j - \alpha_0 - \beta_0(X_{j-1} - \alpha_0)) (X_{j-1} - \alpha_0) \end{bmatrix}. $$ Is this correct? How do I proceed? 

I do not understand your attempt very well. Assuming that the monopolist cannot directly price discriminate (i.e. charge different prices to old and new consumers in the same period), then in the second period it is optimal to offer a price of 50 and sell to everyone, regardless of whether the old guy bought or not. Knowing this, the old guy would buy in the first period iff the price gives him a total surplus of 50 (which he can get by waiting). Hence, the initial price should be 150. If, on the other hand, the old guy has a value of only 20, then in the second period the monopoly price would still be 50. Hence, the old guy has no surplus from waiting and the monopolist should charge 40 to him in the first period. 

I am not sure which is your current level of understanding so tailoring the answer seems difficult. At a very basic level, the idea is as follows. Commercial banks and other institutions originate mortgages but have a preference for liquid assets and so they would rather sell them to third parties instead of keeping them in their portfolio until all the money is paid back. Because the market has to be thick, one cannot simply sell 'Fato's mortgage'. One pools together a bunch of mortgages with similar characteristics and then sells 'shares' on this pool. So far so good. The problem becomes more complicated because the optimal structure of these 'shares' is not simple equity. This is because (i) different investors have different preferences for liquidity and (ii) there are information asymmetries in the market. In general, these assets are structured into tranches. The prime tranche offers debt (a fixed payment unless there is default) and uses the first income that the mortgage originates. The last tranche is equity and is the most junior so they only get money if the mortgage is paid in full. In the middle, the mezzanine tranches, are some sort of combination between the two. These assets' returns are completely tied to the mortgages so that if the mortgages fail, some of these assets become junk. Notice also that, in principle, different people buy different tranches and the risk is spread. Furthermore, the bank does no longer have a stake in the mortgage. Securitization had many problems that people failed to foresee, or at any rate, failed to fully understand. First, precisely because the originators no longer had a stake in the game, they did not provide accurate monitoring and screening and the quality of the mortgages dropped (this is accurately captured in the movie). Second, because the assets pooled together similar mortgages, they failed to take into account the full correlation structure of the different mortgages. Third, many investors did not fully understand these complex securities and held extremely long positions on some of the original mortgages, although they had normal positions on each of the assets (e.g. Lehman Bros was extremely long in subprime mortgages although it was not extremely long on any particular asset). As it happened, if a mortgage in Florida for a 200k house for a guy with credit score such and such defaults, it is quite likely that others would do too. This makes the whole castle crumble. So back to the questions you raised at the beginning. First, if you buy the equity tranche of a mortgage (which is ex-ante very attractive) you only get paid at all if a large chunk of the mortgages in the pool are fully repaid. If a significant fraction defaults, then only the top tranches get anything and the rest get paid nothing. So it may be that you only get 5% of what you invested (but if things went well, you would get twice or more). Hope this helps. If you need some further clarification feel free to ask. I can also add some numerical examples and give some more advanced references. Wikipedia has a good set of articles on it too.
