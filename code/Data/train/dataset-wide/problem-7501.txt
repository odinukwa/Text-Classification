I don't really get the categorical picture of what you are asking, but it feels something very similar to the relation between finite fields of characteristic $p$ and the ring (of characteristic 0) of $p$-typical Witt vectors. You might want to have a look at Borger and Wieland work on pleythistic algebras. The "lifting of all Frobeniuses at the same time" gives you an structure of $\Lambda$-ring, so the paper The basic geometry of Witt vectors by Borger might also be useful. 

Curves and surfaces by Montiel and Ros. A modern approach to the contents of Do Carmo's, but focusing on developing and using analytical methods, particularly integration. This book is actually used for an introductory course on the geometry of curves and surfaces at my home university (Granada). 

In my experience, "messy" blackboard lectures can mostly been blamed on lack of preparation. Using beamer forces you to prepare your lecture in advance, but I think that a well prepared lecture on a blackboard is easier to digest. Some reasons for this are: 

The problem is that the category of (non necessarily commutative) rings does not have all the nice properties of the category of commutative rings. First and most obvious obstacle comes when ones tries to define the spectrum, since there are three different valid options for prime ideals (left, right or two sided); by picking two sided ideals one could define the Zariski topology just fine, but normally noncommutative rings don't have enough two-sided prime ideals to make the noncommutative spectrum interesting. Among other things it is in general not possible to reconstruct the ring out of the spectrum. As someone told me once "it doesn't matter how you define a point in a noncommutative space, there are never enough of them". More subtle problems arise at the level of localization, on the hand one need to impose the Ore conditions, but even for rings that satisfy them one still has the problem that for noncommutative rings localization functors do not commute with each other. A possible detour around this problem was taken in the late seventies and early eighties (in what could be called the origin of noncommutative algebraic geometry) by Fred Van Oystaeyen, involving mainly replacing the naive notion of prime spectrum by more subtle ones (torsion spectrum, localization spectrum). A more recent summatry of those viewpoints and their developments is in the book by Van Oystaeyen Algebraic Geometry for Associative Algebras. Edit: After Kevin's clarification, a nice survey on the history and different approaches to noncommutative algebraic geometry can be found at the entry noncommutative algebraic geometry in nLab. 

One can do (relative) algebraic geometry with respect to any symmetric monoidal category, with affine schemes corresponding to the opposite category of (commutative) monoid objects. This viewpoint is developed in the paper Au-dessous de Spec Z (in French) by Toen and Vaquie. By taking the category of $\mathbb{Z}$--modules with tensor products over $\mathbb{Z}$ one recovers usual algebraic geometry. For (cocommutative) corings, you just have to do the same in the opposite category $(\mathbb{Z}-Mod)^{op}$. The big question is: what do you take as your monoidal structure? If you just dualize diagrams, your new coproduct would be the old product, i.e. direct product of the underlying abelian groups. Or instead of this you take usual tensor products. Each of these approaches will produce a different geometry. I remember a course given by Lieven Le Bruyn on Kontsevich-Soibelman (the noncommutative coalgebra thing) and he mentioning that by the "discrete" nature of coalgebras one could never expect them to describe anything but the etale topology of a scheme, which I think is precisely what Leonid observed in his answer. 

Sorry I didn't reply before, I somehow didn't read the question till now. I think your question is a bit misguided. The main problem I see with it is: what is $\text{Spec} \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{D}]$ over F1? If you think of it as the M_0 scheme given by $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{D}]$ as a multiplicative monoid, then it is something huge (since that monoid is not even finitely generated, for starters), so none of the current notions can effectively deal with it (so far one can mostly only control schemes of finite type). If you want to make better sense of the question, one should ask: is it possible to find an algebra $A$ over F1 such that its base extension to $\mathbb{Z}$ gives $A\otimes_{\mathbb{F}_1} \mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{D}]$? If you find an answer to this question, say in CC setting where it boils down to finding a monoid (with zero) such that the reduced semigroup ring gives you back your original ring, then you might consider an approximation to your problem (the tensor with the abelian closure of F1) by taking some kind of multivariable-cyclotomic completion of your monoid, as in the papers by Manin and Marcolli. 

You can think of them as numbers with directions. Draw a line with the integers on it, adding a positive number $b$ to a given one $a$ is counting $b$ positions to the right starting from $a$ (no matter if it is positive or negative), if $b$ is negative, you count towards the left. This point of view will also help when dealing with multiplication of negative numbers, thinking as -1 as "turning around" makes easy to understand $(-1)\times (-1) = 1 $. In my experience the interpretation of negative numbers as "debts" never works well. 

When writing a beamer presentation (usually do that for short talks in conferences) it is easy to write too much or too little on a slide, I personally find very hard to find a good balance. This is no defense of a "blackboard ONLY" setup, though, my ideal framework is giving most of the lecture in a blackboard whilst having an auxiliary beamer to display graph plots, animations, and other additional material. Main part of the lecture goes to the board, nonetheless. As for Blackboard vs whiteboard that is a matter of taste. I prefer the blackboard because tend to get my hands very dirty with markers and the more consistent contrast, as opposed to struggling to find the marker that isn't almost empty, often resulting in odd color combinations, but I agree that could be solved by carrying my own set of markers :-) 

Regardless of my comment pointing out that since $k$ is not an $A$-module the groups $\text{Ext}_A^\ast(k,k)$ are not well defined, Hochschild cohomology is certainly the preferred options. Some reasons for picking it are 

Concerning Q2, $D$ and $D^* $ are in general not isomorphic as $K$-vector spaces: suppose that $D$ has countable infinite dimension as a vector space over $K$. The dual vector space $D^*$ has then uncountable dimension over $K$. If $K$ is a countable field (say, the rational numbers) it follows that $D$ has a countable number of elements, but $D^* $ doesn't, so there cannot exist a set bijection between the two, let alone a module isomorphism. 

I cannot really say anything about relations with Poincare conjecture, but the obvious references you should look at are M. Morishita. On certain analogies between knots and primes. Journ. f¨ur die reine u. angew. Math., 550 (2002), 141–167. (there is a more recent exposition also by Morishita in $URL$ ) and Manin's "The notion of dimension in geometry and algebra": $URL$ which contains abundant references inside. 

As other have mentioned, F_1 does not exist of a field. Tits conjectured the existence of a "field of characteristic one" F_1 for which one would have the equality G(F_1) = W, where G is any Chevalley group scheme and W its corresponding Weyl group. Later on Manin suggested that the "absolute point" proposed in Deninger's program to prove the Riemann Hypothesis might be thought of as "Spec F_1", thus stating the problem of developing an algebraic geometry (and eventually a theory of motives) over it. There are several non-equivalent approaches to F_1 geometry, but a common punchline might be "doing F_1 geometry is finding out the least possible amount of information about an object that still allows to speak about its geometrical properties". A "folkloric" introduction can be found in the paper by Cohn Projective geometry over F_1 and the Gaussian binomial coefficients. It seems that all approaches so far contain a common intersection, consisting on toric varieties which are equivalent to schemes modeled after monoids. In the case of a toric variety, the "descent data" that gives you the F_1 geometry is the fan structure, that can be reinterpreted as a diagram of monoids (cf. some works by Kato). What else are F_1 varieties beyond toric is something that depends a lot on your approach, ranging from Kato-Deitmar (for which toric is all there is) to Durov and Haran's categorical constructions which contains very large families of examples. A somehow in-the-middle viewpoint is Soule's (and its refinement by Connes-Consani) which in the finite type case is not restricted only to toric varieties but to something slightly more general (varieties that can be chopped in pieces that are split tori). No approach is yet conclusive, so the definitions and families of examples are likely to change as the theory develops. Last month Oliver Lorscheid and myself presented an state-of-the-art overview of most of the different approaches to F_1 geometry: Mapping F_1-land: An overview of geometries over the field with one element (sorry for the self promotion). 

the algorithm is probabilistic, based on Chebotarev density theorem, and requires some random data as input; as far as I know, the algorithm ends with probability 1 for all equations provided that the Riemann hypothesis is true. 

Let $A\in M_m(R)$ be an invertible square matrix over a noncommutative ring $R$. Is the transpose matrix $A^t$ also invertible? If it isn't, are there any easy counterexamples? The question popped up while working on a paper. We need to impose that the transpose of certain matrix of endomorphisms is invertible, and we wondered if that was the same as asking if the matrix is invertible. 

There is a short introduction by Mikhalkin: $URL$ expanded in more detail in this book: $URL$ The Oberwolfach lecture notes by Itenberg, Mikhalkin and Shustin are also nice. 

If I remember correctly, the antipode for GL_q(2) (or GL_q(n)) is a sort of "inverse matrix" defined using the inverse of the quantum determinant det_q((a, b \ c, d)) = ad - q*bc. Since the antipode is unique when it exists, restricted to GL_q (which is dense in M_q) it should coincide with this one, which is not well defined in M_q. Another way, assume the antipode is defined and take classical limit q-->1, then you would have an antipode in the bialgebra of coordinates of usual matrices, but that is not possible since M_n is not a group scheme. 

Sorry that I reply so late, I haven't been hanging much on MO recently. The quick answer to your question is no, the closure of tori appearing in the torification are in general not toric varieties. If that was the case, every irreducible torified variety would be toric (as it would coincide with the closure of the unique dense torus in the torification), examples are for instance the Grassmannian $Gr(2,4)$ which is torified but not toric. Now, what can actually help you with your problem is the following. You can initially restrict yourself to study regular torified varieties, where a torification is called regular if the closure of the tori are torified with (a subset of) the same torification: $\overline{T_i}=\bigsqcup_{j \leq i} T_j$ (where the ordering is simply "being in the closure of"). Under these conditions, the complement $\overline{T_i}\setminus T_i$ is again a torified variety (which might be disconnected, but it will surely be a disjoint union of torified varieties), with strictly smaller dimension than the one of $T_i$. It is an open problem to decide whether every torified variety can be regularly torified, but so far in the examples we worked with we have been able to find regular torifications. Your project sounds very interesting, I am looking forward to see what you come up with!
