Buyer beware. Huge printers are expensive, few places have them; you don't want wallpaper that's too skinny or paper that's not actually "wallpaper". If you check that artists work he photographs a lot of vegetables too. 

The equations for calculating the effect are straightforward but perhaps more than you wanted to know. Modelling this complex behaviour as a curved spacetime problem has yet to be done and is believed to be very difficult. If you're trying to point a camera at a distant object it's a big deal: 

The equations necessary for a correct answer are somewhat lengthy, for a web interface that accepts the location and prints a calendar try: $URL$ For a lengthy explanation of the mathematics see Wikipedia's Calculating the equation of time and Daytime webpages for information about the duration of rising and setting, along with information about the differences in solar noon and the three types of twilight. 

3cm is 10 GHz and can be received with a 10 GHz receiver. The difference between synchrotron and free-free is explained on NRAO's webpages Free–Free Radiation and Synchrotron Radiation. Acceleration by a magnetic field produces magnetobremsstrahlung, the German word for “magnetic braking radiation.” The character of magnetobremsstrahlung depends on the speeds of the electrons, so these somewhat different types of radiation are given specific names. Gyro radiation comes from electrons whose velocities are much smaller than the speed of light: $v≪c$. Mildly relativistic electrons whose kinetic energies are comparable with their rest mass $m_e⁢c^2$ emit cyclotron radiation, and ultrarelativistic electrons (kinetic energies $≫m_e⁢c^2$) produce synchrotron radiation. Acceleration by an electric field accounts for free–free radiation, the resulting emission is called free–free radiation because the electron is free both before and after the interaction; it is not captured by the ion. If the ionized interstellar cloud is reasonably dense, the electrons and ions interact often enough that they quickly come into local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) at some common temperature, so free–free radiation is usually thermal emission. 

barrycarter provided the answer: Using curl, I got 61240 lines total, but that includes some headers, so I think 61237 is correct and your browser may just be timing out. In particular, the last file on my list is "GaiaSource_999922404314639104_1000172126596665472.csv.gz", which seems correct, since the first number increases with each file and seems to finally "wrap around" with the last file. – barrycarter Apr 29 at 3:54 

You would have to make the aperture so small diffraction would wreck the view. Also, resolution of a telescope is proportional to aperture, so the telescope with reduced aperture would also have reduced resolving power. As indicated in the comments, you should NEVER look at the sun with your naked eye or any optical device without proper solar filtering, e.g. Baader solar foil for a telescope. 

Meteors are very small, typical ones are the size of a grain of sand, and bright fireballs are only a few grams. So they are nowhere near as big as "rocks" and there is no way to image them. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ But let's say you could fly next to a shooting star in a UFO and image it that way. The next problem you would face is that the meteor is incandescent and and it would be difficult to get anything but an overexposed blob in a regular camera. 

The total energy of the universe consists of the mass energy of all the matter (both normal and dark), the mass-energy of the radiation and of the dark energy plus the gravitational potential energy of the universe (which is negative). The hypotheses is that this sums to zero. As far as I know, there is no experimental evidence for this. But there is good evidence for the size of the various mass-energy terms. The best current estimates are that the mass-energy of the universe is: 

The CMB is nearly featureless, but the operative word is nearly. The tiny temperature fluctuations that we've measured should look about the same anywhere within tens to hundreds of millions of light years of Earth or so. This would allow you to get an absolute orientation relative to the CMB and thus relative to Earth. It's fairly easy to measure velocity relative to the CMB, so if you measure your velocity relative to the CMB somewhere else (within that 10-100 million lightyears of Earth, anyway) and if you know your orientation, you can compute your velocity relative to Earth. But I don't see any way to easily measure the distance from Earth except very approximately. (The CMB that you see from any point is different because it comes from a different sphere. If you move far enough from Earth, the temperature fluctuations you see are no longer the ones we see from Earth because you're sampling a different part of the 300-year-old universe.) Later: I've been thinking about the position problem and there's a solution, but it's complicated. The CMB samples the universe of 13.7 billion years ago and from any point in it see the distribution of matter in a shell that old. If we move to another point, in effect, the shell shifts also and samples different parts of the gas. The key point is that the faint ripples in the gas's temperature that we see as mottling in the CMB are three-dimensional bubbles. So if you shift a short distance in space, the CMB will shift the most in the direction of motion (both in front and behind) and the least at right angles. Furthermore, the amount of shift will depend on the angular size of the fluctuation you're looking at. Low-angular-frequency fluctuations come from physically large ripples int he gas and you need to move a long distance to move the shell you are sampling out of the bubble. High-angular-frequencies ripples come from smaller bubbles and shorter shifts in position will take the shell you observe out of one bubble and into another. Waving my hands just a tiny bit, it should be possible to use statistical methods to estimate the amount and direction of movement by comparing two detailed CMB maps. A major limitation of the method is that the finer the angular resolution, the sooner you lose all correlation between the two views fo the CMB, but the coarser the angular resolution, the coarser your measurement will be. Numbers? As long as we're not talking about jaunteing many billions of light years, we can ignore general relativistic issues. A fluctuation with an angular size of 1 degree corresponds to a CMB fluctuation which appears to us right now to be around 250 million light years across and consequently ought have a good chance to be visible for moves within roughly that distance. This suggests that the CMB method ought to be able to give you a rough position up to maybe a half-billion or even a billion light years, but will drop off rapidly in accuracy after that. Note that for shorter hops, it ought to be possible to actually recognize galaxy super-clusters and get a position that way. 

Planck's law describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature $T$. The spectral radiance of a body, $B_ν$, describes the amount of energy it gives off as radiation of different frequencies. It is measured in terms of the power emitted per unit area of the body, per unit solid angle that the radiation is measured over, per unit frequency. Planck showed that the spectral radiance of a body for frequency $ν$ at absolute temperature $T$ is given by: $$ B_{\nu }(\nu ,T)={\frac {2h\nu ^{3}}{c^{2}}}{\frac {1}{e^{\frac {h\nu }{k_{\mathrm {B} }T}}-1}}$$ where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light in the medium, whether material or vacuum. The spectral radiance can also be measured per unit wavelength $\lambda$ instead of per unit frequency. In this case, it is given by: $$B_{\lambda }(\lambda ,T)={\frac {2hc^{2}}{\lambda ^{5}}}{\frac {1}{e^{\frac {hc}{\lambda k_{\mathrm {B} }T}}-1}}.$$ The law may also be expressed in other terms, such as the number of photons emitted at a certain wavelength, or the energy density in a volume of radiation. The SI units of $B_ν$ are $W·sr^{−1}·m^{−2}·Hz^{−1}$, while those of $B_\lambda$ are $W·sr^{−1}·m^{−3}$. The "Planck Calculator for Infrared Remote Sensing" can be used to make some calculations: 

First of all, at that distance seeing the Moon and seeing the Earth amounts to the same thing. At its closest, Saturn is around 3000 times as far from Earth as the Moon is, so viewed from Saturn, the Moon is never more than about a minute of arc away from the Earth. If you can see Earth from the North Pole of Saturn, you can see the Moon, also. (Though it would be a lot dimmer.) But if you can See the Earth from Saturn's pole, then you can also see Saturn's pole from Earth. So your question can equally well be phrased as "Can Saturn's north pole be seen from Earth and if so, when?" If you look at pictures of Saturn from Earth, the rings are sometimes tilted so far that they cover one polar region, though it's also true at those times that polar region tilted away from Earth, anyway! Most of the time the rings are either not tilted enough to cover the poles or tilted to cover the south pole. So the answer is that during most of Saturn's orbit around the Sun, the rings would not obscure the sightline from Saturn's north pole to the Moon. 

I am using this index page to download GDR2 data files. $URL$ But it keeps giving a different number of links. Sometimes it shows 16,000 files, sometimes 31,000 and the max I have seen is 61,237. What is the correct number I should download? GAIA GDR2 documentation does not list the total number of files available. Interestingly, if the index lists less than 60k files, it still has the closing /html tag so it would appear I have a complete index file, but the contents are not complete. 

I understand the Moon was perhaps five Earth radii away when it first formed (assuming it was formed by a giant impact of a Mars-sized body), and Earth has since transferred its rotational energy into the moon's orbital energy. How fast would Earth have been spinning at the point the Moon was formed? Assuming it was spinning very fast (day under 10 hours) would this have caused a noticeable decrease in effective "gravity" at the equator? Presumably the Precambrian microbes could have reached equatorial orbit really easily, assuming they had a space program. 

I made an extract of GAIA DR2 data for parallaxes greater than 500mas. Surprisingly I see a very significant number of sources with parallax greater that 1000, making them much closer than Proxima. This should lead to excited newspaper headlines, but i haven't seen those yet... Am I missing something? You can see my extract of data here: $URL$ Some GAIA source_id rows to look at include: 4039503676370417664 4042946384760661504 4042338732771057920 4046453826887613696 But there are many more. The closest source I find is 4062964299525805952 with parallax of 1851mas. It has a phot_g_mean_mag of 19.63355... Would I be right in assuming this is a brown dwarf? Another thing I note is that there is a surge of vmag 19/20 sources within 10 parsecs. These are obviously so faint GAIA doe not detect similar sources beyond 10 parsecs. To give some numbers I count 1722 sources (most mag 19/20) within 10 parsecs and only 606 sources in a shell of equal volume beyond that. Again, would these all be (a very large number of) brown dwarfs? 

This is unpredictable. The solar system is a chaotic system and it's long-term behavior can't be predicted. But it's also a very stable chaotic system and the planetary orbits have been stable for 4 billion years and will remain stable for some millions of years into the future. See the Wikipedia article for an overview. When we numerically integrate the orbits of the planets into the future in an ensemble (doing many integrations, each with small differences in starting values that are still within experimental error), a small fraction of the ensemble members diverge chaotically. (E.g., Mercury is eventually flung into a wild orbit which may impact Venus.) The key point here is that it is intrinsically unpredictable more than some millions of years into the future -- we're definitely safe for much more than a thousand human lifetimes -- other than statistically. But base don those statistics, it seems likely that the solar system will be disrupted due to chaotic dynamics before the Earth's orbit decays due to tidal forces or anything like that. (Another presently unpredictable future is an interloping star coming close enough to disrupt planetary orbits. Stars pass through the Oort cloud on a regular basis -- one each million years or so -- but getting inside the orbit of Pluto is much less likely and hasn't happened yet as far as we can tell. Nonetheless, this could happen any time.)
