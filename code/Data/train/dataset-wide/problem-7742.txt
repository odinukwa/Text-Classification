This inequality does not necessarily hold, at least for $n\geq 3$. It is somehow connected with the fact that there is no Pick's formula in more than two dimensions since there exists a convex lattice polytope with a large volume but containing a small number of lattice points. So, for instance, for $n=3$ let $M$ be the convex hull of the points $(0,0,0)$, $(1,1,0)$, $(0,1,2k)$ and $(1,0,2k)$. Then $|M\cap {\mathbb Z}^3|=4$, but $(M+M)\cap {\mathbb Z}^3\supset \{(1,1,t):0\leq t\leq 2k\}$. So $K$ and $L$ can be chosen as vertical segments containing $k$ lattice points each. 

Notice that $$ (a_{11}+a_{22}+a_{12}+a_{21})^2\geq (a_{11}+a_{22})^2+(a_{12}+a_{21})^2\geq 4a_{11}a_{22}+4a_{12}a_{21}. $$ Thus, it suffices to show $$ a_{11}a_{22}+a_{12}a_{21}\geq a_0a_2. $$ Expand each permanent and perform multiplication to obtain the sums of products of $2n-2$ entries on both sides.. We will provide an injection from summands on the right to those on the left; this clearly yields the required inequality. Visualize the $(i,j)$th entry of $A$ as an edge $(r_i,c_j)$ of a bipartite graph with parts $R=\{r_1,\dots,r_n\}$, $C=\{c_1,\dots,c_n\}$. Each summand on the right corresponds to a graph where the degrees of $r_1,r_2,c_1,c_2$ are $1$, the other degrees are $2$. Its edges are colored in red (corresponding to factors from $a_0$) and blue (from $a_2$). This graph contains several cycles and two paths, which are either $r_1\to c_1$ and $r_2\to c_2$, or $r_1\to c_2$ and $r_2\to c_1$ (the starting and ending edges of each path are red, so it has an odd number of edges). Repainting the path from $r_1$, we obtain a graph correspoding to a summand from one of the products on the left hand part (in $a_{1i}a_{2j}$, we assume that blue edges correspond to the factors from $a_{2j}$). This is clearly an injection, since the inverse map is provided by the same repainting. So we are done. 

$\let\dvds\mid$Yes. By Zsigmondy's theorem, $2^{12}-1$ has some prime divisor $p_s$ not dividing $2^i-1$ for $i<12$ (in fact, $p_s=13$). Now, if $2^n-1=p_1p_2\dots p_k$ with $k\geq s$, then $p_s\dvds 2^n-1$, so $12\dvds n$ and hence $3^2\dvds 2^n-1$, which is impossible. Thus only the cases with $k<s$ are left. 

Finally, substitute $\alpha=\frac{2n-1}{2n}$. We get exactly what we need, and even a bit more: $$ 1\geq \max_{a\in F}\sum_{x,y\in F^n\colon \langle x,y\rangle=a}\prod_{i=1}^n X_i(x_i)^\alpha Y_i(y_i)^\alpha. $$ 

Surely yes. Firstly, we may achieve $\max\{w(j)\colon j\in M\}=|\mathcal A|$ for free. Just take any union-closed family of subsets on $[n-1]$, and add $n$ to every set. So it suffices to make $\min\{w(j)\colon j\in M\}$ small compared with $\mathcal A$. To make this, take $2^{[n-2]}\setminus\{\varnothing\}$ and add to it $[n-1]\setminus\{1\}$ and $[n-1]$; we get a union-closed family.. Then $[n-1]\setminus \{1\}$ is minimal, and $w(n-1)=2$. 

As for $triR_k(K_{3,3})$, I would assume that the usual `averaging' approach should give an estimate not far from the optimal one. Take three colors with the maximal number of edges in them and estimate the number of triples of vertices having a common neighbour by these colors. If this number exceeds $2{n\choose 3}$, we are done. [EDIT] This seems to be covered by the Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem, see $URL$ [END EDIT] Exactly on the described situation, it seems that you have no chance for finding $K_{3,3}$ even in a complete graph with $n$ vertices and $n$-colored edges. Indeed, if we take a regular $(6k+1)$-gon and paint all parallel edges in one color, then the resulting graph would not contain a trichromatic $K_{3,3}$. Moreover, it seems that here we have some regularity which helps finding such $K_{3,3}$... 

If $n\geq 3$, then there are three sets (say, $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$ --- some may coincide) containing the edges of some triangle $v_1v_2v_3$. Then any collection of $S_i$ containing $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$ gives a non-bipartite graph. On the other hand, for $n=1,2$ this is possible. An example for $n=1$ is trivial; for $n=2$ it is provided by $S_1=\{12,34\}$, $S_2=\{13,24\}$, $S_3=\{14,23\}$. 

If $m=0$, ths simplifies as $$ b_{n,0}=-{n\choose \lfloor \frac{n}2\rfloor} +2\sum_{0\leq k\leq n/2}2^{2k}{n-2k\choose \lfloor \frac{n-2k}2\rfloor} +2\sum_{0\leq k\leq (n-1)/2}2^{2k+1}{n-2k-1\choose \lfloor \frac{n-2k-1}2\rfloor}. $$ Recall that ${2a\choose a}=2{2a-1\choose a-1}$, so these sums are almost the same. Say, if $n$ is even, then $$ b_{n,0}=-{n\choose \frac{n}2}-2^{n+1} +4\sum_{0\leq k\leq n/2}2^{2k}{n-2k\choose \frac{n-2k}2} =-{n\choose \frac{n}2}-2^{n+1}+4\frac{(n+1)!}{\frac{n}2!^2} $$ (for the last sum, see Philippe Deléham's comment at $URL$ Simplifying a bit, we get $$ b_{n,0}=(4n+3){n\choose \frac n2}-2^{n+1}, $$ which agrees with Per Alexandersson's formula. The computation for odd $n$ is similar (one needs to separate the first term in the first sum of the general formula for $b_{n,0}$). 

Let $S^2=\{(x,y,z)\colon x^2+y^2+z^2=1\}$, and set $f(x,y,z)=(x,\sin 1000x)$. Then the set $A$ consists of many components, and only one of them contains opposite points. You may choose whatever more interesing function instead of $\sin 1000x$... 

$\def\sign{\mathop{\rm sign}}$First of all, it is enough to prove the statement when $p=u/v$ is rational, $u$ is even and $v$ is odd (such numbers are dense on the real line). We need this to simplify the last argument. Let the equation of the ellipse be $f(x,y)=ax^2+2bxy+cy^2=1$; one may assume that $b\neq 0$ (either by a small variation argument, or by considering it directly --- this case is easy). Let us bound the number of local extrema of $f(x,y)$ on $|x|^p+|y|^p=1$; if there are at most 8 of them, then we are done: between every two, there is at most one intersection point. Since $b\neq 0$, the points where one of the coordinates vanish are not extremal (the ellipse passing through such point has a tangent not parallel to the coordinate axes). The extremal points satisfy the system of Lagrange equations $$ 2(ax+by)=p\lambda|x|^{p-1}\sign x, \quad 2(bx+cy)=p\lambda|y|^{p-1}\sign y; $$ obviously, $\lambda\neq 0$, so this system yields $$ \frac{at+b}{bt+c}=|t|^{p-1}\sign t, $$ where $t=x/y$. So, it suffices to show that there are at most four such values of $t$ (each corresponds to two symmetrical extremal points). Notice that $|t|^{p-1}\sign t=t^{(u-v)/v}$ by our assumptions on $u$ and $v$. Now, substituting $t=s^v$ we obtain $$ as^v+b=bs^u+cs^{u-v}. $$ The last polynomial equation has at most four roots by an easy application of Descartes' rule of signs. ADDENDUM. By the way, you have mentioned on MathSE that in your case the minor axis is in the positive quadrant, and you were interested in the intersection points lying in this quadrant as well. In this case we may assume that $a,b,c>0$, and we are interested in positive values of $t$. The rule of signs shows that there is at most one $t$ whenever $u-v>v$, that is --- if $p>2$. Otherwise it claims that there is at most one $t$ in the adjacent quadrant. ADDENDUM2. Here is the explanation about the limiting case. Assume that you have more than 8 common pointsof an ellipse and an $\ell_p$-circle. Blowing up or away your ellipse a bit, you may reach the situation when there are more than 8 points of transversal intersection. Then you mark a point on the ellipse between every such neighboring points (or simply mark 10 of them); these marked points are alternately inside and outside the $\ell_p$-circle. Finally, if you change $p$ a bit, all these 10 points will still be alternating, guaranteeing 10 intersection points. The same method works for $b=0$. Finally, if it is easier for you, you may pass to rational $p$ of a desired form AFTER writing down the (almost) polynomial in $t$ --- in this case the statement is more visible... And, even more finally, you may just repeat the proof of the Descartes' rule for an `almost polynomial' --- all you (perhaps) need is that all the powers differ by at least one, which can be reached by an appropriate substitution. ADDENDUM3. Just to mention. The same method allows to prove that the affine images of $\ell_p$- and $\ell_q$-circles also have at most 8 common points, if they have the same center. 

If a matrix $M$ is not Galois-irreducile, then its minimal annihilating polynomial $\mu_M(x)$ factors as a product of two coprime non-constant polynomials, $\mu_M(x)=p_1(x)p_2(x)$. Then $\mathbb Q^n=\mathop{\rm Ker} p_1(M)\oplus \mathop{\rm Ker} p_2(M)$, both subspaces being $M$-invariant, which leads to the required representation. 

It seems that $n(\theta)$ should depend on the occurrence of some relatively long runs of 0s (and perhaps of 1s) in the decimal representation of $\theta$; at least, if there are no such runs, $n(\theta)$ should not exist. To see this, let $w_k(\alpha)$ be the word of length $k$ defined as the Sturmian word for our $\theta$, but starting at position $\alpha$ of the circle. What does it mean that $w=w_1w_2$ is bad? We have $w_1w_2=w_{2^n}(\alpha)$ and $w_2w_1=w_{2^n}(\beta)$ for some $\alpha,\beta$. We definitely need that $\beta\approx \alpha+2^{n-1}\theta\pmod 1$ and $\alpha\approx \beta+2^{n-1}\theta\pmod 1$, but $\alpha\not\approx \beta\pmod 1$, so that $2^{n-1}\theta\approx 1/2\pmod 1$. This already settles the question about the limit as $\theta\to1/2$ in the affirmative. Which approximation error suffices for the formulas from the previous paragraph? Consider the numbers $k\theta\mod 1$ for $k=1,\dots,2^{n-1}$. They split the unit circle into seveal arcs, and it is well-known that these arcs have at most 3 distinct lengths $x_n$, $y_n$, and $z_n=x_n+y_n$ ($z_n$ may be absent). Then the error of the approximation should definitely be not greater than $z_n$. So, if $2^{n-1}\theta\mod 1$ is always separated from $1/2$, then $n(\theta)$ should not exist. To construct such $\theta$, it suffices to write its binary notation using, say, $01$ and $011$ in an aperiodic manner (perhaps, some more careful start is needed). Sorry for some vagueness; hope it is clear what is happening. 

Color each vector $(x_i)$ in any $k$ such that $x_k=\max\limits_{1\leq i\leq n} x_i$. Then there is no dominating monochromatic set: if it had color $k$, then there is no $S$-dominating bector for $k\notin S$. 

$\def\ord{\mathop{\rm ord}}\def\dvds{\mathrel{|}}$Yes, this is true. The argument is similar to your `maximal order' argument; this shows again that it is helpful to provide your thoughts in the question. For $H<G$, denote by $f(H)$ the minimal $k$ such that $H=\{a^k\colon a\in G\}$. We notice that if $H_1<H_2<G$ then $k_1=f(H_1)$ is divisible by $k_2=f(H_2)$. Indeed, for every $a\in G$ we have $a^{k_1},a^{k_2}\in H_2$, so $a^{\gcd(k_1,k_2)}\in H_2$, and $H_2\supseteq \{a^{\gcd(k_1,k_2)}\colon a\in G\}$. The converse inclusion is obvious, thus $H_2=\{a^{\gcd(k_1,k_2)}\colon a\in G\}$ and hence $\gcd(k_1,k_2)\geq k_2$, as required. Now, we have an alternative: either (i) there exists an infinite chain $H_1<H_2<H_3<\dots<G$ or (ii) each cyclic subgroup is contained in a maximal cyclic subgtoup. The case (i) is ruled out since we should have then $\dots \dvds f(H_3)\dvds f(H_2)\dvds f(H_1)$ which is impossible. In case (ii), consider a maximal syslic subgroup $H=\langle a\rangle$. If $H=G$ we are done. Otherwise $k=f(H)>1$, and $a=b^k$ for some $b\in G$. If $b\notin H$ then $\langle b\rangle > H$, which contradicts maximality. Thus $b=a^\ell$; this means that $\ord a$ is finite (denote $n=\ord a$) and $\gcd(n,k)=1$. For every $g\in G$, we have $g^{nk}=e$. Thus we see that the orders of elements are bounded, and we may assume that $\ord a$ is maximal (then $\langle a\rangle$ is still a maximal cyclic subgroup). If for every $g\in G$ we had $g^n=e$ (and $g^k\in H$) then we would have $g=g^{\gcd(n,k)}\in H$, which would imply $H=G$. Thus there exists some $g\in G$ with $g^n\neq e$ (and $\ord g\dvds nk$). Then $1<\ord g^n\dvds k$. Both cyclic subgroups $H$ and $\langle g^n\rangle$ are normal (due to the initial condition), and their orders are coprime, so they form a direct product, which contains an element of order $n\cdot \ord g^n>n$. A contradiction. 

The answer is no. I assume that the degree of a rational function is the maximum of degrees of its numerator and denominator (in the irreducible form). Consider any interval $(x_i+j,x_i+j+1)$ with $0\leq i\leq g-1$ and $0\leq j\leq g-2$. If the denominator of $R(x)$ has no roots on this interval, then $R'(x)$ should have a root on it. Let $d$ be the degree of $R(x)$. Then there are at most $d$ roots of the denominator, and at most $2d-2$ roots of the numerator of $R'(x)$, since this numerator has degree at most $2d-2$. Thus $g(g-1)\leq d+(2d-2)$, so $d\geq \frac{g(g-1)+2}3$.
