$SO_3$ acts with cohomogeneity one on $CP^2$, where we view $SO_3$ inside $SU_3$ (the identity component of the isometry group of $CP^2$, up to a $Z_3$-kernel) by the standard inclusion. If the metric in $CP^2$ is normalized to be the quotient metric given by the Hopf fibration $S^5(1)\to CP^2$, then the orbit space of $CP^2$ under the $SO_3$ action is a segment of length $\pi/4$. In fact, $\gamma(t)=[\cos t:i\sin t:0]$ is a unit speed geodesic everywhere orthogonal to orbits, and it meets each orbit exactly once if $t\in[0,\pi/4]$; here the endpoints correspond to the two singular orbits: the orbit through $\gamma(0)=[1:0:0]$ is a totally geodesic $RP^2$ (with corresponding isotropy group $S(O_1\times O_2)$), and the orbit through $\gamma(\pi/4)=\frac1{\sqrt2}=[1:i:0]$ is the quadric $CP^1=S^2$ with equation $z_0^2+z_1^2+z_2^2=1$ (and corresponding isotropy group $SO_2$, embedded in $SO_3$ as rotation in the first two coordinates). The principal isotropy group is the $Z_2$-subgroup of $SO_3$ generated by $\mathrm{diag}(-1,-1,1)$, so the principal orbit is $SO_3/Z_2$. The $SO_3$ action on $CP^2$ lifts to a $SO_3\times SO_2$ action on $S^5$ which is the restriction of the representation $R^3\otimes R^2$. This is the isotropy representation of the Grasmann manifold $G_2(R^5)=SO_5/(SO_3\times SO_2)$ of oriented $2$-planes in $R^5$. Such orbit structures are well studied and well described. Alternatively, we can write $C^3=R^3\oplus R^3$ and let $SO_3$ act on $S^5\subset R^3\oplus R^3$. Denoting the coordinates by $(x,y)\in R^3\oplus R^3$, we have that a complete set of invariants is given by $a=||x||^2$, $b=||y||^2$, $c=x\cdot y$. Cauchy-Schwartz says $c^2\leq ab$, which is the solid interior of a cone, and restricting to the unit sphere gives $a+b=1$, so the orbit space $S^5/SO_3$ topologically is a $2$-disc (but metrically is a hemisphere of radius $1/2$). Now the (right) action of $SO_2$ on $R^3 \oplus R^3$ preserves $c$ and so is easily seeen to be the rotation around the pole. We recover the orbit space $CP^2$ under $SO_3$ as the segment of radius $\pi/4$ and can also figure out the isotropy groups this way. 

I have a partial answer (thanks to Uriel Feige for pointing this out), but the main problem is still open. According to Feige (1998), it is quasi-$NP$-hard to approximate Set Cover within a ratio of $(1-o(1))\ln n$ and, in all the hard Set Cover instances, $n>m$ holds. Hence, after the reduction to Dominating Set, the number of vertices is at most $2n$, which implies once again an $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound. Of course, this does not completely answer my question, because it only shows quasi-$NP$-hardness (i.e., the approximation ratio is not achievable in polynomial time unless $NP\subset TIME(n^{{\rm polylog}\ n})$), as opposed to $NP$-hardness. The current state of the art for Set Cover, obtained by Alon, Moshkovitz, and Safra (2006), is that it is $NP$-hard to approximate within a $c\cdot \log n$ factor. Even after inspecting their construction, it is not clear to me if $n>m$ can be inferred for all hard Set Cover instances, as well. Actually, even $n^\lambda >m$ would suffice, for some $\lambda\geqslant 1$. A related paper by Raz and Safra (1997) claims a similar result, but with a lower constant factor $c$. However, I cannot find any proof of this claim. If anyone can find it, it can be checked if $n^\lambda >m$ at least there. 

For instance, have a look at the book "Einstein manifolds" by Arthur L. Besse, on page 179. The action of $G_2$ on $S^6$ comes from its lowest dimension nontrivial representation, which is $7$-dimensional: the inclusion $G_2\subset SO(7)$ is realized by recalling that $G_2$ is the group of automorphisms of the real division algebra of Cayley numbers (octonions). The actions of $Spin(7)$ and $Spin(9)$ come from their spin representations. The other groups are classical and act by their standard (natural, vector) representations. 

Recall that a hypersurface in $\mathbf R^{n+1}$ is defined to be minimal if its mean curvature vanishes, where its mean curvature is simply the sum of the principal curvatures (sometimes divided by $n$). Equivalently, the hypersurface is a critical point for the $n$-volume with respect to compactly supported variations. The equation above is the condition that the mean curvature of the graph of $f$ vanishes everywhere. Part of the importance of the Bernstein problem is that it has a direct bearing on the existence of minimal cones and singularities of minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbf R^{n+1}$. The answer to the problem was proved to be affirmative in the cases $n=3$ by de Giorgi (1965), $n=4$ by Almgren (1966), and $n\leq7$ by Simons (1968), and apparently there was some hope to extend the result to all dimensions. However, in 1969 Bombieri, de Giorgi and Giusti constructed a counter-example for $n=8$, which yields a counter-example in each dimension $n>8$ by a standard construction, closing the problem. The complete solution of the Bernstein problem turned out to involve a good deal of geometric measure theory and non-linear analysis. 

I had a private conversation with Dana Moshkovitz (whom I thank), who confirmed that, in Alon, Moshkovitz, and Safra (2006), the hard instances of Set Cover resulting from a rather involved gap-preserving reduction are all such that $m\leqslant {\rm poly}(n)$. Hence, after the L-reduction to Dominating Set, we have graphs on $|V|$ vertices, such that $|V|=n+m\leqslant a\cdot n^k+b$, for some constants $a>0$, $b\geqslant 0$, $k\geqslant 1$. It follows that, since Set Cover is $NP$-hard to approximate within a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$, Dominating Set is $NP$-hard to approximate within a factor of $$\Omega(\log n) = \Omega\left(\log\left(\frac{|V|-b}{a}\right)^{\frac 1k}\right)= \Omega\left(\frac{\log(|V|-b)-\log a}{k}\right)=\Omega(\log |V|).$$ Determining optimal values for $a$, $b$, $k$ remains open. It is my understanding that these matters have been overlooked by most authors, as no explicit mention to them is ever made, to the best of my knowledge. Usually it is just stated that Set Cover and Dominating Set are "equivalent" under L-reductions, hence the $c\cdot\log n$ hardness carries over to Dominating Set. Even the observation of the crucial inequality $m\leqslant {\rm poly}(n)$ resulting from the reductions to Set Cover has often been neglected by most authors (Feige being an exception), as well as the determination of an optimal constant factor for the hardness of approximation of Dominating Set. 

In general, the ball $B^n$ with the Bergmann metric is isometric to the Hermitian symmetric space $SU(1,n)/S(U(1)\times U(n))$ where $SU(1,n)$ denotes the special pseudo-unitary group with respect to the indefinite Hermitian inner product with signature $(1,n)$ and $S(U(1)\times SU(n))$ denotes the subgroup of block matrices of sizes $1\times 1$ and $n\times n$. Note that this subgroup is the fixed point set of the involution of $SU(1,n)$ given by conjugation by the diagonal matrix with entries $(-1,1,\ldots,1)$. For an arbitrary Hermitian symmetric space given as $G/K$ where $G$ is connected and $K$ is a symmetric subgroup (i.e. open subgroup in the fixed point set of an invoutive automorphism of $G$), the identity components of the isometry group and the group of holomorphic automorphisms both coincide with $G$. Hence in the case of $B^n$ this group is $SU(1,n)$. Next, the $n$-polydisc is the product $B^1\times\cdots\times B^1$ ($n$-times) and it carries the structure of a Hermitian symmetric space, product of $n$ copies of $SU(1,1)/S(U(1)\times U(1))\cong SL(2,\mathbb R)/SO(2)$, the unit disk in $\mathbb C$. As such, the identity component of its group of holomorphic automorphism is $SU(1,1)\times\cdots SU(1,1)$ ($n$ copies). It is readily seen that this group is not isomorphic to $SU(1,n)$ if $n>1$ (for instance, they have different dimensions, $3n$ and $n^2+2n$). 

It is stated throughout the computational complexity literature that the Dominating Set problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$. To my knowledge, the first and only proof available (Lund and Yannakakis, 1994), relies on a well-known L-reduction from Set Cover to Dominating Set (also reported on Wikipedia), which implies that the two problems are equivalent in terms of approximation ratio. Because Set Cover is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$, the same holds for Dominating Set. I have reasons to believe that this may be an incorrect deduction. Recall that, in Set Cover, the parameter $n$ is the size of the universe set. In contrast, the number of sets given as input, $m$, could be exponentially larger than $n$. Because the L-reduction from Set Cover to Dominating Set constructs a graph on $n+m$ vertices, this graph may have size exponential in $n$. Now, in Dominating Set, the "$n$" that is used in approximation bounds is in fact the number of vertices. It follows that, using this reduction, only a ratio of $O(\log \log n)$ can be deduced for Dominating Set, as opposed to $\Omega(\log n)$. Can this proof be fixed in some easy way (or is my reasoning incorrect)? 

Compact Lie groups with bi-invariant metric have nonnegative sectional curvature. In fact, there is an explicit formula $K(X,Y)=c\cdot ||[X,Y]||^2$ for some positive constant $c$ and orthonormal $X$, $Y\in\mathfrak g$. It follows that the Ricci curvature $Ric(X,X)=c \cdot \sum_i ||[X,E_i]||$ where $(E_i)$ is an orthonormal basis of $\mathfrak g$ containing $X$. From this formula you can see that $Ric(X,X)\geq0$ and $Ric(X,X)=0$ if and only if $X$ lies in the center of $\mathfrak g$. In particular, if $G$ is semisimple, the center of $\mathfrak g$ is zero and $Ric(X,X)>0$ for $X\neq0$. By compactness, you can find a constant $\kappa$ such that $Ric(X,X)\geq\kappa||X||^2$. 

Motivation: If true, it would imply that the all invariants of $V\oplus V^*$ as a representation of $\mathbb C^\times\times E_6$ would be pull-backs of coadjoint invariants under the moment map. Some details: The roots of $E_6$ are (we use Bourbaki conventions) $$ \pm\epsilon_i\pm\epsilon_j\quad1\leq i<j\leq5\quad\mbox{(for $Spin(10)$)} $$ and $$ \frac12(\epsilon_8-\epsilon_7-\epsilon_6+\sum_{i=1}^5\nu_i\epsilon_i)\quad\Pi_{i=1}^5\nu_i=1\quad\mbox{(for the half-spin representation)}. $$ The $27$-dimensional irreducible representation $V$ of $E_6$ and its contragredient $V^*$ have respectively highest weights $$\lambda_1 = \frac23\Omega\quad\mbox{and}\quad\lambda_6=\frac13\Omega+\epsilon_5 $$ where $\Omega=\epsilon_8-\epsilon_7-\epsilon_6$. These are minuscule weights, which means that the Weyl group $W$ acts transitively on the weights of $V$ (resp. $V^*$); in particular they all have multiplicity one. The weights of $V$ can be listed as $$ \frac23\Omega,\ \frac16\Omega-\frac12\sum_{i=1}^5\nu_i\epsilon_i\ (\Pi_{i=1}^5\nu_i=1), -\frac13\Omega\pm\epsilon_i\ (1\leq i\leq5).$$ In particular, $$ \lambda_1,\ -\lambda_6,\ -\lambda_1+\lambda_6 $$ are weights of $V$; the longest element in $W$ maps the highest weight $\lambda_1$ and the lowest weight $-\lambda_6$ one to the other and thus fixes $-\lambda_1+\lambda_6$. One can indeed find elements in $W$ permuting $\lambda_1$, $-\lambda_6$, $-\lambda_1+\lambda_6$. The angle between $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_6$ is $60^o$. Now it is not difficult to see that $\Gamma$ is the Coxeter group of type $A_2$. Edit: Here is a naive argument which appears to give an answer. Suppose $w\xi_1=\xi_2$ where $w\in W$ and $\xi_1$, $\xi_2\in\mathfrak a^*$. Since the action of $W$ preserves the real span $\mathfrak a^*_{\mathbb R}$ of $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_6$, we may assume $\xi_1$, $\xi_2\in\mathfrak a^*_{\mathbb R}$. Since $\Gamma$ is a subquotient of $W$ and the action of $\Gamma$ on $\mathfrak a^*$ is generated by reflections on the real lines through $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_6$, we may replace $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ by suitable $\Gamma$-conjugates and assume both are linear combinations of $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_6$ with non-negative coefficients. Now $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_6$ are fundamental weights of $E_6$, so this implies that $\xi_1$, $\xi_2$ belong to the positive Weyl chamber of $E_6$ and thus $w=1$. Update: The argument in the first edit seems OK, but about the above motivation, it is not true that it implies that the invariants are all pull-backs of coadjoint invariants.
