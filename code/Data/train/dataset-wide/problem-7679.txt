Here is a necessary and sufficient condition for $G^{-}(f)$ to be non-empty, taken from [1, Exercise 6.21]: 

If $\mathbb{Z}1_R \simeq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ for some $n > 1$, then the condition $\text{gdc}(k, n) = \text{gdc}(k^2, n)$, or equivalently $\text{gcd}(k, \frac{n}{\text{gcd}(n, k)}) = 1$, implies $kR = k^2R$. This is certainly a necessary condition when $R = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. YCor outlined the fact that every module over $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$ is projective. He further extends this remark by mentioning below that every module over a commutative ring $R$ with identity is projective if and only if $R$ is the direct product of finitely many fields, see this MO post for references and a more general statement. 

This answer presents an alternate proof of users' negative answer by proving directly that a finite ring whose only unit is its identity must be a Boolean ring, hence commutative. The proof given below is based on a result by Melvin Henriksen. It doesn't rely on the Artin-Wedderburn Theorem and turns out to be fully elementary. Following Melvin Henriksen, we call $R$ a UI-ring if $R$ has an identity element $1$ and $ab = ba = 1$ for $a,b \in R$ implies $a = b = 1$. We have 

Does Hochschild cohomology of a cocommutative Hopf algebra over a field of positive characteristic have a natural divided power structure? If not, perhaps a certain natural extra structure on the Hopf algebra would yield one? 

Is every vector bundle on an algebraic torus $T=({\mathbb A}^1\setminus \{0\})^n$ over an algebraically closed field trivial? I am primarily interested in the case of a characteristic zero base field. 

Is there a theorem (or theorems) that can be thought of a real analogue of Weil conjectures? One can replace the finite field by real numbers and Frobenius by complex conjugation; counting points can perhaps be replaced by Euler characteristic or a more refined invariant of the set of real points. Of course, Lefschetz fixed point formula can be applied here, but is there something more specific one can say? 

You may turn the above proof into a one-liner if you refer to this more general result of Irving Kaplansky [1, Theorem 9.3]. 

The answer to the first part of OP's question is "no", but possibly with a finite number of exceptions. Indeed [Theorem 1.8, 4] established that the number of $T_2$-systems of a non-abelian finite simple group $G$ tends to infinity as the cardinality of $G$ tends to infinity. A $T_2$-system in the sense of B. H. Neumann and H. Neumann (T-system stands for transitivity system) is an orbit of $\operatorname{Aut}(F_2) \times \operatorname{Aut}(G)$ acting on the set $\operatorname{Epi}(F_2, G)$ of the epimorphisms $\pi: F_2 \twoheadrightarrow G$ in the following way: $\pi \cdot (\psi, \phi) = \phi^{-1} \circ \pi \circ \psi$. An orbit of $\operatorname{Aut}(F_2)$ is called a Nielsen equivalence class and clearly the number of such classes is bounded from below by the number of $T_2$-systems. This result was already proved by M. Evans, R. M. Guralnick and I. Pak for the sequence $(PSL_2(\mathbb{F}_q))_q$ with $q$ the power of a prime, and was refined in [5], as noted in OP's question. I. Pak also proved in [Proposition 2.5.2, 1] the result for the sequence $(A_n)_n$ of the finite alternating groups and he conjectured with Guralnick the aforementioned general result in [2]. Estimates for the number of $T_2$-systems of these groups, and for the Suzuki groups as well, are collected in [Theorem 2.1, 3]. I don't know of any non-abelian finite simple group with exactly one $T_2$-system. In contrast, Wiegold's conjecture asserts that the number of $T_3$-systems should always be $1$ for such groups. Regarding the second part of OP's question, I don't have any heuristics at hand. Stating the obvious, I would definitely try to know more about the classification of finite simple groups. If the second part of the question concerns also two-generated finite groups which are not necessarily simple, then the following observation may help: the class of the finite groups $G$ for which $\operatorname{Aut}(F_2)$ acts transitively (the same holds if we require the determinant to be $1$) on $\operatorname{Epi}(F_2, G)$ is stable under quotient. This follows from Gaschutz'lemma [Lemma 2.1.5, 1] and imposes for instance that the order of the first invariant factor of $G_{ab} = G/[G, G]$ lies in $\{2, 3, 4, 6\}$ when $G_{ab}$ is not cyclic. 

Let $X$ be a complete smooth curve over $\mathbb C$ and $A=Jac[2]$ be the group of 2-torsion elements in the Jacobian of $X$. Is their a relation between: 1) The $A$-torsor of $\theta$-characteristics and its decomposition into odd and even parts. 2) The projective action of $A$ on sections of ${\mathcal O}_{Jac}(2\Theta)$, where $\Theta$ is the $\Theta$-divisor, lifting to a Heisenberg group action. 

The paper by Kazhdan and Lusztig "A topological approach to Springer representation" may provide an answer to the question at the end of the post on an explicit form of Springer representation. Also, I think this question is related to Lusztig's homomorphism from the Hecke algebra $H$ to the asymptotic Hecke algebra $J$. To simplify the statement, assume $G=SL(n)$ (as the author of the question does). Then the matrix of the Springer representation in the canonical basis in the top homology of Springer fiber can be read off that homomorphism (specialized at $q=1$): the algebra $J$ in this case is a sum of matrix algebras, taking the summand corresponding to the given nilpotent we get the answer. The homomorphism is rather explicit, so this answer is as explicit as the canonical basis is. 

An ideal is said to be quasi-primary in the sense of Laszlo Fuchs and Edward Mosteig if its radical is prime. 

The question as to whether $L(R)$ is distributive for more general rings $R$ was also tackled by Robert Blair in [1, Section 5]. Here is one of Blair's results. 

Our last claim establishes that no counter-example to OP's condition can be found in a Dedekind domain.

It follows from Claim 3 that the presentation $\langle a,b \, \vert r_i = 1,\, i = 1,\dots, n \rangle$ is minimal in the sense that removing any defining relations yields a non-isomorphic extension. Moreover, any presentation of $G_n$ must involve at least $n$ relators. 

A commutative analogue of the conjecture that the only projective D-affine varieties are homogeneous spaces is a generalization of Harthshorne conjecture. The latter (famously proved by Mori) characterizes projective spaces as the only smooth projective varieties with ample tangent bundles. It is expected that the only smooth projective varieties whose tangent bundle is big and nef are homogeneous spaces of reductive groups, this conjecture is apparently due to Demailly and Campana-Peternell. 

Let $X$ be a smooth closed subvariety in a complex projective space and $Z\subset X$ be a generic hyperplane section. Lefschetz hyperplane section Theorem says that the restriction map $H^i(X)\to H^i(Z)$ is an isomorphism for $i<dim(Z)$ and injective for $i=dim(Z)$. I am interested in examples when it's also an isomorphism $i=dim(Z)$. This is equivalent to saying that Fourier-Deligne transform of the intersection cohomology sheaf of the cone over $X$ has less than full support in the dual space (then this support has to be the cone over the projectively dual variety $X^*$). This is so when $X$ is an even dimensional quadric; are there other examples?

In particular the set of primes $p \in D$ such that $Dp$ is a maximal ideal of $D$ is a submonoid of $D \setminus \{0\}$ contained in $i(D)$. Using the above rewording, we can quickly check why js21's comment answers the question in the negative. If $k$ is field, we have $k[x, y]/(x) \simeq k[y]$ which is a principal ideal domain whereas $k[x, y]/(x^2) \simeq (k[x]/(x^2))[y]$ is not a PIR (the ideal generated the images of $x$ and $y$ is readily seen not to be principal). Therefore, we have $x \in i(D)$ whereas $x^2 \notin i(D)$. Let us give another example for which multiplicative closedness of $i(D)$ fails dramatically. Consider a regular local ring $D$ (this is necessarily a domain) of Krull dimension $2$ with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$. Then $i(D) = (D \setminus \mathfrak{m}) \cup (\mathfrak{m} \setminus \mathfrak{m}^2)$, but no product of two non-units in $i(D)$ belongs to $i(D)$. Now comes the good part 

There are various definitions of boundary of a hyperbolic group. Which of those generalize to semi-hyperbolic groups (in the sense of Alonso and Bridson)? The example I have in mind is a semisimple group over a nonArchemedian local field.The answer I'd like to get is something like a nonHausdorff space which is a union of partial flag manifolds $G/P$ (which can be described as the quotient of the complement to $G$ in the De Concini-Procesi compactification by the right action of $G$). 

The previous answer may be all you need, but, say, in question one one can also proceed by induction in q, to make the step of induction embed your complex into an acyclic complex of injective objects. 

It's a toric variety, for which intersection cohomology is computed algorithmically, see e.g. De Catldo's lectures. 

The following seems to be implied by most of the direct comments to OP's question, but I prefer to voice it, loud and clear:

[1] H. Bass, "Projective modules over free groups are free", 1964. [2] P. M. Cohn, "On the structure of the $GL_2$ of a ring", 1966. 

The commutative case mentioned in OP's question was solved by P. M. Cohn [2, Theorem 3], should $R$ be finite or infinite: 

The answer is yes. Indeed, free associative algebras over a field are more generally $GE$-rings [Theorem 3.4, 2]. This fact has been used by Bass [1] to prove that a finitely generated projective module over a free algebra with coefficients in a PID is free. By contrast, free commutative algebras over a field, i.e., polynomial rings over a field aren't $GE$-rings if the number of indeterminates exceeds $1$ [Proposition 7.3, 2]. (I have made this remark in another MO post). We recall below the definition of a $GE$-ring in the sense of P. M. Cohn and we give subsequently a proof of the claim. Let $R$ be an associative ring with identity and let $E_n(R)$ be the subgroup of $GL_n(R)$ generated by matrices obtained from the identity matrix by replacing an off-diagonal entry by some $r∈R$. Let $D_n(R)$ be the group of invertible diagonal matrices; note that it normalizes $E_n(R)$. A ring $R$ is termed a $GE_n$-ring if $GL_n(R)=E_n(R)D_n(R)$. The ring $R$ is a $GE$-ring in the sense of P. M. Cohn if it is a $GE_n$-ring for every $n > 1$. Let us turn to the proof of the claim. Let $S$ be the free monoid on $\{x, y\}$ endowed with the shortlex order, i.e., words are ordered according to word length and words of the same length are ordered lexicographically. Then $S$ is a bi-ordered monoid and it is not difficult to show that $F\langle x,y \rangle = F[S]$ is an integral domain with unit group $F^{\times}$. Let $\varphi: S \rightarrow \omega$ be an order-preserving bijection. The following lemma is instrumental. 

The group $SL(2,F)$ where $F$ is a local nonArchemidian field is hyperbolic. Various generalizations of the notion of hyperbolicity have been studied in the literature (I've seen terms like "hierarchically hyperbolic", "relatively hyperbolic" etc.). Which of those classes do groups of the form $G(F)$ where $G$ is semi-simple of higher rank fall into? 

Let $G$ be a complex simple simply connected algebraic group and $Gr_G$ be the corresponding affine Grassmannian (it is well known that $Gr_G$ is homotopy equivalent to the base loop space $\Omega K$ of the maximal compact subgroup $K\subset G$). Let $H=H^*(Gr,k)=H^*(\Omega K,k)$ be the cohomology ring where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p>0$. The computation of $H$ by Yun and Zhu in their paper "Integral homology of loop groups..." shows that the commutative $k$-algebra $H$ has a divided power structure, at least when $p$ is not too small. Can this be seen from first principles? In particular, is it related to Cartan's divided power structure on homology of a commutative simplicial $k$-algebra?

The authors define the Kummer condition, or condition $(K)$, as $k(R) = R \setminus \{0\}$. According to the references of [1], Condition $(K)$ is at the core of Ernst Kummer's error in his proof of that Fermat's last theorem holds for regular primes. Kummer would have assumed that $k(R) = R \setminus \{0\}$ holds for $R = \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$ with $\zeta_n = e^{\frac{2i\pi}{n}}$ or $R = \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n][X]$. It is nowadays well-known that any of the two previous Noetherian domains can fail to be a UFD, e.g., for $n = 23$. The following remarks will come soon in handy. 

The answer is no: it is not possible, in general, to reduce a matrix over a principal ideal domain (PID) to a diagonal (or trigonal) matrix by means of elementary row and column operations. (This topic has been discussed in this MO post). The following example is a result proved by P. M. Cohn [1, Theorem 6.1 and subsequent discussion] in 1966 and doesn't rely on some $SK_1$ obstruction.
