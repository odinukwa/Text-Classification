What are the various values of metallicity of various known galaxies, like Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, Andromeda and so on? 

I hope you mean if a sun was 'rotating around' another sun, how long it would take to complete a revolution. There is this thought process. Since they both have equal mass, they would definitely rotate around their center of mass. So now, many factors come into the picture. 

There have been many questions and answers about finding the distance of a star from the earth. But as I did some research on the net, I found that we have specific approaches for finding the distances of different types of stars. So, my question is more specific now. How to determine how far a Classical Cepheid is? What if the Cepheid is extra-galactic? Is there a good method to finding the solution? Can anybody suggest how to make a start at deriving a relation at finding the distance of a Cepheid from us? There is this Period-Luminosity-Color relation. Can anyone at least enlist the journal articles where I can make a study to get closer to finding the answer to my question? 

Kepler has found some systems with multiple planets and shown that it's likely that 7% of sun-like stars have Earth-like planets (video). I don't think we know enough about extra solar planets to know how planetary systems are organized on average, but the multiple-planet systems are few and would be ones where the orbits of the planets are close to the star and/or flat. In our own solar system for instance in the small strip of the sky where an observer could see the Earth transit, there are only two small sections where they could also see Venus transit, and if they did happen to see both the Earth and Venus, they would not be able to see any of our other planets transit (up to Saturn at least). I wrote a small program to show roughly the visible area of sky where each planet could be seen to transit. Shown is 4 degrees above or below the ecliptic: 

Is there just not enough known about the variability of inclinations in orbits of planets in general to speculate about what percent of confirmed candidate planets might have siblings with different inclinations that we cannot see? If other planetary systems had varying inclinations in their orbits like ours, it looks like for every 'Earth' they found, any other planets would only have about a 7% chance of also being visible. Is there any reason to think that other systems with multiple planets might have less or more variability in the inclinations of the orbits of their planets? 

Study as much physics and mathematics as possible. Astronomy is essentially a branch of physics. If you're still in school, then take classes in these areas. If you're not in school anymore, then there are plenty of online resources to continue your education. This will allow you to understand what people are talking about when they discuss technical things. Decide what exactly you're interested in. There are lots of different areas of study within astronomy. Decide what appeals to you the most. Do you like planets? Galaxies? Cosmology? All of these different focuses require more specialized knowledge. Your skills are already marketable. Being an astronomer can mean lots of different things. There are some astronomers who hardly ever look through telescopes, and spend most of their time reducing data. A large part of astronomy is computer programming. As a software engineer, you may already have the skills you need to work with astronomy research. Keep an open mind. There are lots of jobs in astronomy research where you might not be called an "astronomer". For example, as a software engineer, you could find work with NASA supporting space research. Your job title might not be "Astronomer", but you'll still be in the field. Be prepared for hard work. Being an astronomer can be difficult, not just because of the subject matter, but also because of the effort you have to put in to get a job. It can be relatively difficult to find an employer looking for people with your particular skillset. My recommendation would be to keep an eye on the NASA Jobs website to see when they're hiring. You can also search for internships on NASA's OSSI site. Try some amateur astronomy. There are lots of ways you can get involved in astronomy without having it as a job. A quick Google search for "Amateur astronomy projects" yields many different results. Join a local astronomy group. If you live in a reasonably sized city, there should be an astronomy group near you. Find them and join them. Don't give up! Having astronomy as a profession can be difficult, but it is also rewarding. If you truly want to do this, you'll need to work at it. Just don't give up! 

[some spoilers] If you were in the ISS and orbiting the Earth roughly every 90 minutes, would it be possible for debris to be orbiting such that it passes you every 90 minutes? While Neil DeGrass Tyson pointed out scientific flaws in the movie on twitter, he praised many things the movie got right in interviews, including "The 90-minute orbital time for objects at that altitude." I think I recall an interview on a podcast that I can't remember where he specifically said that referring to the debris recurring every 90 minutes. In reality wouldn't the debris have to be in a different orbit? If the ISS orbits every 90 minutes (92.87 really but I'm saying 90) then after 90 minutes they would be in the same relative position. The Earth would have rotated in the mean time so they wouldn't be over the same point on Earth, but they would be in the same position in orbit about the Earth. Is there an orbit that would allow the same debris to cross the same spot in their orbit every 90 minutes? Would it be nearly the same orbit, just inclined slightly? Would that explain why the debris was moving so slowly relative to the ISS as well? note: There are problems with the orbits and location in the movie, I simplified my question to ask about the particular orbit of the ISS. 

We can use Newton's law of gravity to calculate the force the Earth feels from the moon: $$ F_g = \frac{GM_{Earth}M_{Moon}}{r^2} $$ Where G is the universal gravitational constant, $6.62*10^{-11}$ $m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$, $M_{Earth}$ and $M_{Moon}$ are the masses of the Earth and Moon in kilograms, and $r$ is the distance between their center s in meters. We can rearrange this equation to solve for a distance like so: $$ r = \sqrt{\frac{GM_{Earth}M_{Moon}}{F_g}} $$ Now we can input any force we like to see how far away the Moon would have to be in order for us to feel that force. If we want the force of gravity to go to zero, we can take the limit as $F_g\rightarrow 0$. When we do this, we see that for the Earth to feel zero gravitational force from the Moon, it would have to be infinitely far away. However, infinity is not a very useful number; why don't we look for something a little more practical? Let's say that we want the Earth to feel exactly 0.01 Newton of gravitational force from the Moon. That's about the weight of 1 gram of matter at the Earth's surface. In that case, we will have $r=5.411*10^{19}$ meters or $3.4*10^{14}$ miles, about $1.4*10^{11}$ times further away. Keep in mind, though, that this is still not zero force. It's small enough that we probably wouldn't be able to detect it, but it is nonzero.
