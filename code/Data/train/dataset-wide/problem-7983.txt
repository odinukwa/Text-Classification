We have a graph G with maximum degree $\Delta$. The induced subgraph on vertices with degree equal to $\Delta$ is a bipartite graph (while the original graph is not). Prove that G has a matching that covers all vertices with degree $\Delta$. For example consider $K_{3,3}$ and add a vertex on one edge. So the graph has 7 vertices and 10 edges. The graph is not bipartite, but the induced subgraph on vertices with degree $\Delta(G) = 3$ is a bipartite subgraph. You can easily find a matching that covers all of the 6 vertices with degree 3. 

As @GordonRoyle said in comments, the statement is not true. In $K_n$ you have a star spanning tree with $n-1$ leaves and you have a path spanning tree with just 2 leaves. In fact most of the time two graph search algorithms DFS and BFS, give us two trees with different number of leaves. 

I was wondering if there is a simple method to decompose $K_{2n}$ into one matching (1-factor) and $n-1$ hamiltonian cycles (connected 2-factors)? I tried to read some papers. The [Lucas 1892] paper was french! The [Alspach 2008] was printed in Bulletin of ICA, which does not have a digital version. And the [Bryant 2007] survey was too long and had a more general theorem about decomposition of $K_n$ or $K_n-I$ into m-cycles, depending on the relation of n and m. As you may know, decomposition of $K_{2n}$ into matchings (1-factor decomposition) and decomposition of $K_{2n+1}$ into hamiltonian cycles have very simple geometric-ish methods (form a regular polygon with a vertex inside and each turn consider edges parallel or perpendicular to some line). Have you heard of any simple method to decompose $K_{2n}-I$ ($K_{2n}$ minus a matching) into hamiltonian cycles? 

We know that a k-factor of G is a k-regular spanning subgraph of G. And if G is 4-regular (or 2k-regular), it can be partitioned into 2 (k) edge-disjoint 2-factors (Petersen 1891). My question is in a graph G with $\delta \geq 4$ which already has a 2-factor, can we say it has another 2-factor (different in at least one edge, not distinct)? 

This proof is credited to Kamyar Khosravi. We can orient the edges of graph $G$ such that $d_G^-(v), d_G^+(v)\geq 2$ for each $v\in V(G)$ and any cycle of the given 2-factor $F$ will become directed cycles. (We just orient the cycles of the given 2-factor and then orient the remaining edges, using one (or some) eulerian circuit for $v+G\backslash E(F)$ which $v$ is a new vertex connected to odd vertices of G). Then we construct a bipartite graph $H$, each part $X$ and $Y$ having a copy of $V(G)$ and for any directed edge $e=uv$ in directed version of $G$ we add an edge from $u_X$ to $v_Y$. Each matching in H corresponds to a directed 2-factor in directed G. So by using edges of F, we can say H has a matching and satisfy Hall's condition. Then by an extended version of Hall's Theorem, we can say H has at least $\delta(X)!$ (if $\delta(X) < |X|$) which is $2!$ or simply $2$. So $G$ has at least two 2-factos. $\blacksquare$ For the case of $\delta(G)=3$ we can construct a counterexample graph with 18 vertices shown below. This graph has a cut edge $e=uv$, thus $e$ cannot be in any 2-factor. $u$ and $v$ must be in a triangle. We can then say other cycles of 2-factor are uniquely determined. 

Surely you can draw the 2-D image in the XY plane so it consists of points of the form (x, y, 0) and then give each point in it a random non-zero Z co-ordinate. So it should look like a mess except viewed looking in along the Z-axis. 

The answer to A is no. The topological bundle is determined by a continuous homotopy class of maps into the classifying space. Choosing a compatible smooth structure means picking a smooth map in that class. Any two such choices are smoothly homotopic. B however is true. Look up the Jacobian of a Riemann surface. How are you going to grade in C ? Where are the forms on $E$ of degree higher then the dimension of $B$? 

If you work out how the circle group acts on the fibres then the connection form has to pull-back to the Maurer-Cartan form on the circle group. That will fix the multiple. 

Has anyone tried one of these Logitech conference cameras with Skype $URL$ as a collaborative tool. I saw one report on-line of someone trying to use it to look at a whiteboard and claiming it didn't work because of reflections of the shiny surface. Thanks - Michael 

Rummikub ? It encourages some logical thought and analysis. It seems to have at least one mathematical paper on it $URL$ and it's popular and fun. 

Maybe R.O. Wells' book ? $URL$ Sorry I'm not in the office so I can't check. I don't think it's particularly difficult. Certainly if the bundle is holomorphic you can construct the Dolbeault operator by just acting on the components of a section written as a linear combination of holomorphic sections. This patches to give a global Dolbeault operator because the clutching functions are holomorphic. To go the other way you need an integrability theorem such as Newlander-Nirenberg to show there are enough sections in the kernel of the Dolbeault operator to span the fibre of the bundle and trivialise it locally. 

I'm not an algebraic geometer so let's call $X$ a real manifold. I don't think that really matters it could be a topological space or even a set for what I am about to say. Assume that $E \to X$ is a rank $n$ real vector bundle. For any $x \in X$ let $E_x$ be the fibre of $E$ over $x$. The natural structure you have in this situation is that if $f \colon E_{x} \to E_{y} $ and $g \colon E_{y} \to E_{z}$ are isomorphisms then you can compose to get $g \circ f \colon E_{x} \to E_{z}$ also an isomorphism. From this follows the fact that you have a groupoid whose objects are all $x \in X$ and whose morphisms from $x$ to $y$ are $Isom(E_x, E_y)$ (or $Isom(E_y, E_x)$ depending on how you like to compose morphisms.) (1) $Isom(E, E)$ is a perfectly reasonable object, it's a bundle of groups over $X$. But it doesn't capture all the information such as isomorphisms from $E_x$ to $E_y$ where $x \neq y$. (2) $Isom(p_1^*E, p_2^*E) $ is the union over all $x, y \in X$ of $Isom(E_x, E_y)$ and if $f \in Isom(E_x, E_y)$ then the two maps are $f \mapsto x$ and $f \mapsto y)$. (3) I am not sure of the answer to this but it seems reasonable to me that this groupoid captures information about the symmetries of $E \to X$. I don't think that $Isom(p_1^*E, p_2^*E) $ being a principal $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$ bundle is correct. I don't see any reason why $Isom(E_x, E_y)$, for example, is acted on by $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$.
