The simple answer to your question is "yes" - the universe expanded at much greater speeds than $c$ during the inflationary epoch. This period of time was very quick but very dramatic, lasting from about $10^{-36}$ to $10^{-32}$ seconds. The universe expanded, in this very short period, by a factor of $10^{26}$. That's pretty incredible, when you think about it. Inflation was originally proposed to solve, among other things, the horizon problem - that is, why the universe is isotropic and homogenous (on a large scale). This would mean that all the parts of the universe were in "causal contact" at one point in time. Inflation is the explanation for this. Now, what does this all have to do with the CMB? Well, the temperature of the CMB is the same throughout the universe - a toasty 2.7 Kelvin. For the temperature to be uniform, all the regions of the universe would have had to be in causal contact in some point in time; hence, inflation explains the uniform temperature of the CMB. However, the CMB was not around during the inflationary epoch. Far from it. It formed a lot later, when the universe was at the ripe old age of $379,000$ years. But the reason that it was formed (photon decoupling) equally throughout the universe is because the conditions were roughly equal, because of inflation. The CMB was, and still is, everywhere. It was never around during inflation, and as such was not otherwise affected by it. I hope this helps. 

The dust is not the key to the B(e) phenomenon, though it can change the spectrum slightly. HAeB(e) stars are a class of stars (and a subclass of B(e) stars) related to Herbig Ae/Be stars, which have not yet left the main sequence. There are additional criteria that a star must satisfy to be considered an HAeB(e) star, too. These stars can be of spectral type A, meaning that you can have B(e) stars that are not of spectral type B, if you use a certain definition. This answer is based largely on Lamers et al. (1998), a fascinating paper on the classification of B(e) stars. 

I was reading Unfolding the Laws of Star Formation: The Density Distribution of Molecular Clouds by Kainulainen et al., which discusses star formation rates and efficiencies. One variable used is $\varepsilon_{\text{core}}$, the core-to-star efficiency, describing how much gas above the critical value of $s$, the logarithmic mean-normalized density, forms a star. I'm using this parameter in some calculations, but I'd like to use an average value, as opposed to a value for a given molecular cloud. What is a typical value for $\varepsilon_{\text{core}}$? 

Both the temperature and the density of a toy universe can, in a way, be linked to the age of the universe ($t$). Certain properties of the universe are dependent upon a scale factor $a(t)$ that is a function of time. The expansion of such a universe can be written in the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, generally written as $$ds^2 = dt^2 - a(t)^2(d\Sigma^2)$$ where, in spherical coordinates, $d\Sigma$ is given by $$d\Sigma^2 = \frac{dr^2}{1-kr^2} + r^2d\theta^2 + r^2\sin^2\theta d\phi^2$$ where $k$ is a constant. This shows that, in a toy universe, $r$ and $dr$ is proportional to $a(t)$, and so in a perfectly spherical toy universe, you could relate the volume to $t$. We know that, for a sphere, $$V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$ and because $d\Sigma^2$ (and by extension $r^2$) is related to $a(t)^2$, we can relate volume to time. If you knew the mass-energy of the universe, you could then relate the change in density to $t$. Unfortunately, our universe does not appear to be perfectly spherical, and so this may not apply. You can relate something else to the age of the universe: the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. It has cooled over time, and is presently at about 2.7 Kelvin. While the temperature of the CMB may not be governed by the scale factor $a(t)$, it is certainly governed by time, and thus one you could in fact write the temperature of the universe as function of time. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find data on the evolution of the CMB, but I can try, and perhaps this will lead you to an answer. To summarize: In a perfectly spherical universe, assuming you know the matter-energy content and the scale factor $a(t)$, you could write an equation for the density of the universe. In any universe, you can also write an equation for the temperature of the CMB - the "temperature of the universe". I hope this helps. Source for FLRW metric: $URL$ 

Why is this? Is it an artifact of detectors simple not observing that part of the sky, or is there some underlying astronomical reason? 

Earlier this year (2016), scientists used the radial velocity method to discover a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri: Proxima Centauri b. It was announced in Anglada-Escud√© et al. (2016). Here are some of its basic properties, as reported by the authors of the paper and known as of August 2016: 

According to JPL, CSS and Pan-STARRS are responsible for 90% of new Near Earth Object (NEO) discoveries. LINEAR is responsible for detecting objects one kilometer in diameter or greater, while NEOWISE provides additional measurements from previous WISE targets, so it isn't making new detections, merely follow-up observations. NASA's statistics show that over 15,000 Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) have been discovered so far, from all programs scanning the sky. In each of the past three years, about 1,500 NEAs have been discovered, most by the five programs listed above. That's roughly consistent with the five-per-day claim. However, it's not yet near 2,000 per year. 

From experiment There are hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way alone. Clearly, we don't know all of them - and the Gaia spacecraft will only observe (still astonishingly many) one billion of them - but we do have observations for a number of stars like the Sun and stars that are somewhere along evolutionary tracks very similar to the one it is predicted the Sun will take. Data from these stars confirms many models (while showing that others need modification). Thanks to repeated comparisons of theory and simulation to real life, the models have been refined over time, and more and more evidence has been garnered in their favor. There is always a strong interplay between theory and experiment, and the model predictions match what we see in the sky, while the things we see in the sky give us better and better data for making newer, even more accurate, models. 

The fission hypothesis is no longer favored. It cannot explain the existence of systems with certain mass ratios or separations. The fragmentation hypothesis, however, can, and is accepted. It is also possible for a binary system to form through the capture of one star by another, but that requires a third body, and probably cannot explain the high fraction of binary systems in the galaxy. Basically, then, the main theory to date is that the protostellar nebula breaks up, and then both fragments collapse independently. 

I would expect it to be fairly dense because of the extreme conditions at the center, primarily the force of gravity pushing in on it. The "15 times the density of lead" is not constant throughout the Sun, and only applies in the very center of the core. 

Obviously, though, we can detect gamma-rays from distances farther than 8 parsecs! The closest GRB detected so far, GRB 980425, is likely the result of SN 1998bw, and thus originated 140 million light-years away - over 42 million parsecs away. The radiation from it was nowhere near high enough to harm life on Earth. Your second explanation, therefore, is the correct one. The intensity of the signal decreases according to the inverse-square law - that is, $I(r)\propto r^{-2}$ - so at large distances, the flux is small enough that there is negligible impact on Earth's atmosphere. Phiteros also raised a good point: To cause severe problems from Earth, the gamma-ray emission from a GRB - which is often along an axis from both poles of the progenitor - would have to be pointed nearly directly at Earth. For example, there was once a scare that a supernova by either of two stars in the WR 104 system could cause problems for Earth, but the odds that the beam would hit Earth full-on are slim. 

Given that the article seems to be referring to NASA's Near Earth Object Program, it appears that there are five subprograms scanning the skies: 

This can best be described by two slides from this presentation. "Forward-facing" implies looking towards Earth in the spacecraft's orbit, in the direction of the spacecraft's velocity vector: 

All that said, the authors believe that the TRAPPIST-1 planets may have migrated in from further out, thus entering the resonances. Without more information, we can't know whether this is the case, but if so, it is not, then, an example of planets forming close to each other. 

There are a variety of models of stars collapsing into black holes without proper supernova explosions. These are often called failed supernovae or direct collapse black holes - although the former seems more common. Failed supernovae can happen if the initial shock wave rebounding from a collapse loses enough energy, causing it to fizzle out. Neutrinos produced in the core often supply this energy, but a small enough burst may not be enough to keep the shock going. There might then be a simple collapse. The minimum mass for the progenitor of a failed supernova is unknown (and as Rob Jeffries pointed out, this is metallicity-dependent). Some early models (e.g. Fryer (1999)) found that stars above $40M_{\odot}$ could produced failed supernovae, while newer ones suggest that this could be as low as $25M_{\odot}$. This lower limit would include a sizable portion of red supergiants - which could be a possible solution to the red supergiant problem. A number of searches, largely targeting supergiants, have been carried out. Just a few are
