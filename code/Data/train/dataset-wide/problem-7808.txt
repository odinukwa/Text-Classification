Let $G$ be a connected, simply-connected complex semisimple linear algebraic group, and denote by $\mathcal{G}$ its affine Grassmannian. Fix a maximal torus $T\subseteq G$. We know that $\mathcal{G}$ has a natural stratification $\{\mathcal{G}^{\lambda}\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda^+}$, where $\Lambda^+$ is the collection of dominant coweights of $T$. I am looking for a detailed formulation of the result that $\mathcal{G}^{\lambda}$ is an affine bundle over a partial flag variety. I would appreciate any and all references. 

I am not sure if I am providing a characterization of the sort you seek. Nevertheless, the Lie group $SU(n)/\mathbb{Z}_n$ is called the projective special unitary group, $PSU(n)$. Note that this group has a natural action on $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. In fact, it is precisely the group of holomorphic isometries of $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. 

I think the representations are equivalent if and only if $\lambda$ and $\lambda'$ are conjugate under the Weyl group. To see this, note that the irreducible representations of $G$ can be parametrized by dominant weights, or equivalently, Weyl-orbits of weights. 

Let $\frak{b}\subseteq\frak{g}$ denote the Lie algebra of your Borel $B$. There is a natural $G$-equivariant isomorphism $\tilde{\frak{g}}\cong G\times_B\frak{b}$ of vector bundles over $G/B$, where $G\times_B\frak{b}$ is the associated bundle arising from the adjoint representation of $B$ on $\frak{b}$. Let us take $B$ to be the standard Borel of upper-triangular matrices of unit determinant, and consider the maximal torus $T\subseteq B$ of diagonal matrices. Under the adjoint representation restricted to $T$, $\frak{b}$ decomposes into irreducible subrepresentations of weights $0$ and $2$. Conjecturally, anyway, I would not be surprised if you could use this to show that $\tilde{\frak{g}}\cong\mathcal{O}(0)\oplus\mathcal{O}(2)$. Still, I am not sure about this, and there are a few details to be resolved. I hope this is useful. 

I believe the only way to deduce the self-intersection or self-avoiding nature of a walk based on relative moves of {turn left, move forward, turn right} is to turn them into a sequence of absolute moves and simulate them on the square lattice. The reason for this is that the self-intersection may occur in two squares as the sequence (move forward), (turn left | turn right)${}^3$, (move forward). It may also occur $n$ steps later, with $n>1$, as in ( (move forward)${}^{10}$, (turn right) )${}^4$ which self intersects as a square of width $10$ after eighty relative moves $=$ forty absolute moves. If you were to look at a series of relative moves or turtle-graphics-moves as a series of symbols, and attempt to apply some symbolic dynamics rules such as replace a (forward)(turnaround)(forward) $\to$ (INTERSECTIONFOUND), or (turn right)${}^3 \to$ (turn around), etc., then it would not be possible to create enough rules to keep track of state of each possible lattice point in the square lattice. You have to keep track of the state of the lattice points as having been "visited" or "not visited" and simulate the entirety of the walk or at least enough of the walk until an intersection first occurs in order to determine that the walk is self-intersecting. 

Let $G$ be a complex linear algebraic group acting on a smooth complex projective variety $X$ with finitely many orbits. Note that each $G$-orbit is a smooth locally closed subvariety of $X$. For a non-negative integer $n$, define $X_n$ to be the union of all $G$-orbits of dimension $\leq n$. I am looking for a reference addressing the following question. Under what additional hypotheses (on $G$, $X$, the action, etc.) can we conclude that $X_n$ is a smooth submanifold of $X$? 

Let $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ be a contractible complex analytic space. Suppose that $\mathcal{F}$ is a coherent sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. Can we invoke the fact that $X$ is contractible to conclude, in some cases, that $\mathcal{F}$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_X^{\oplus n}$ for some $n$? If you like, you may take $X$ to be the analytic space associated to a complex affine variety. I ask because contractibility is often a useful condition when attempting to prove a fibre bundle is trivial. 

Let $\Omega SU(2)$ denote the based loop group of $SU(2)$, and consider the action of $S^1$ on $\Omega SU(2)$ as a maximal torus of $SU(2)$. (This is not the "loop rotation" action.) Is there an explicit statement in the literature of the $S^1$-equivariant Poincare series of $\Omega SU(2)$? 

For the example distance matrix which you have given, setting the threshold $20 \le d \lt 40$ will give you what looks like a correct result. Setting $d$ too low results in more isolated components to the graph, setting $d$ too high leads to larger components. 

Suggestion: consider using some sort of k-means segmentation or other clustering method to segment your user or subject population into groups with similar preferences. Then, in these specific subsets of your user population, it might be possible to average or coalesce the rankings provided. 

Presume that you've set the scoring correctly so that the distribution of $a$ is 15% = | (-1) | , 70% = | (0) | , and 15% = | (+1) |, of $b$ is 15% = | (-1) | , 70% = | (0) | , and 15% = | (+1) }, and of $c$ is 15% = | (-1) | , 70% = | (0) | , and 15% = | (+1) |. There are now 27 categories for the ordered triplet $(a,b,c)$; each of these 27 categories is $c_i \in$ {$-1, 0, 1$}$^3$. Calculate the distributions of each category. Draw as a histogram. Select the score ($85$th percentile) such that $15$% of your group exceeds it as the leading category. Select the score ($15$th percentile) such that 70%+15% of your group exceeds it as the lower-most value of your performing category, and use the score of the leading category as the upper-most boundary of your performing category. Use the $0$th to $15$th percentile as your bounds for your developing category. Rescale the scores to {1, 2, 3} from {-1, 0, 1} which I used in this example to get the answer which you want. If this really is not homework, you won't have a problem doing that. If this is homework, you really should have asked somewhere else. 

I'm not sure you will find this answer to be satisfactory, as it addresses only a special case. Nevertheless, a unipotent conjugacy class in $SL_n(\mathbb{C})$ is the same as a conjugacy class of a nilpotent $n\times n$ matrix. The latter classes are indexed by Jordan canonical forms, and hence also by the partitions of $n$. So, there are as many unipotent conjugacy classes in $SL_n(\mathbb{C})$ as there are partitions of $n$. I do not know of a nice formula for the partition function, but I believe it has a nice generating function. 

The action of $GL_k$ on $Mat_{k\times n}$ is linear. Therefore, the scaling retraction of $Mat_{k\times n}$ to $\{0\}$ is $GL_k$-equivariant. It follows that the restriction map $$H^*_{GL_k}(Mat_{k\times n})\rightarrow H^*_{GL_k}(\{0\})$$ is an isomorphism. That you obtain an isomorphism $H^*_{GL_k}(Mat_{k\times n})\cong\Lambda_k$ then follows from the general fact that $$H_G^*(pt)\cong H_T^*(pt)^W,$$ where $T\subseteq G$ is a maximal torus and $W$ is the Weyl group (and also that $H_T^*(pt)$ is a polynomial ring in $\dim(T)$ indeterminates). I hope this helps answer your question. 

Let $G$ be a compact connected semisimple Lie group. The algebro-geometric definition of the affine Grassmannian is the coset space $$\mathcal{G}r=G_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathcal{\mathbb{C}((t))}/G_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathbb{C}[[t]]).$$ Technically, $\mathcal{G}r$ is an ind-scheme over $\mathbb{C}$, realized as an inductive limit of schemes. On the other hand, we have a differential-geometric version of the affine Grassmannian described in Chapters 7 and 8 of Pressley-Segal. In particular, they construct $\mathcal{G}r_0^{\mathfrak{g}}$. This is homotopy-equivalent to $\Omega G$. I am looking for a reference that explicitly relates these two notions of the affine Grassmannian. In particular, I am seeking answers to some of the questions below. 

($x_1, y_1) = ( f_1(t), g_1(t)$) and ($x_2, y_2) = ( f_2(t), g_2(t)$), allowing you to create the weighted average line $$(x_a, y_a) = (p f_1(t)+(1-p)f_2(t), p g_1(t) + (1-p) g_2(t) ), $$ where $p=0$ gives all of the weight to line 1 defined by $N_1$ and $p=1$ gives all the weigth to line 2 defined by $N_2$ Even if the two sets have the same number of points in them, the order in which the points are specified, and the order in which they are mapped to each other, will modify the "average" line between them and thus change the definition of the "interpolated" weighted average between them. If you do not bother to specify rigorously the domain and range of your question, I don't think that you can really complain that 

I like Jonah Ostroff short and sweet proof, but the key to it lies in the fact that there is not a bijection between the set $S_1$ of connected graphs and the set $S_2$ of disconnected graphs over $n$ labeled vertices for $n \ge 4$, as follows: 

David, your question makes the assumption that players will stochastically pick a move in the current possible set of branches, and does not say anything about the current depth of the tree. I believe that for certain states, particularly those labeled "end-games", it is possible for an astute player (or an experienced player) (the set of astute and experienced players are not equal) to have a higher $W$ percentage against an equally skilled or worse opponent. Thus I believe that $W$ and $D$ are not just functions of one player $P_1$, but also of - the opponent $P_2$ and of - the current-depth of the game tree (= the number of moves played thus far), and - the current-state (global and local) of the game board. $P_1$'s $W$ may change for a different opponent and for certain opening sequences or end-games with which they are familiar. Now if you allow the assumption that you do not have an oracle evaluation function, but do have the win and draw percentages for two players, $P_1=(W_1, D_1)$ and $P_2=(W_2,D_2)$, your question in the second paragraph asks if that is sufficient to allow for calculating the probabilities of one player dominating over the other. I do not believe that there is a way to calculate this, as the $W$ and $D$ ratios are going to have to be calculated as a measure over all possible game board states, and the finite sampling of win and draw ratios for a finite number of games and board positions will not be sufficient to allow for such an extrapolation to be made. Back to my first ruminations: the $W$ and $D$ will depend on the depth of the game tree and the relative experience of the players. If a player picks a bad move but has better experience, she could still recover and win at a later point in the game. If a player picks a bad move but does not have much experience, they are less likely to be able to recover and get to a position of advantage. An experienced player recognizing classic openings may play by rote for a few moves, or may in fact feint and play slightly askew to see how her opponent responds. This type of psychological repertoire and skill cannot be encoded and captured in a two parameter model, and is also why I think $W$ and $D$ ratios are not just a function of the player $P_1$ but also of the opponent. 

No, I think this need not be the case. Consider the usual action of $S^1$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The symplectic quotient is $\mathbb{P}^1$, which is not hyper-Kahler for dimension reasons. 

Let $G$ be a compact Lie group and $\mathcal{C}_G$ the category of $G$-spaces (ie. topological spaces endowed with continuous left $G$-actions). Is there a model category structure on $\mathcal{C}_G$ for which (i) weak equivalences are the morphisms $f:X\rightarrow Y$ such that for all closed subgroups $H$ of $G$, $f^{H}:X^H\rightarrow Y^H$ is a weak homotopy-equivalence, and (ii) cofibrations are the morphisms $f:X\rightarrow Y$ that have the expected $G$-homotopy extension property? What I have read thus far strongly suggests that this is the case. Nevertheless, I would appreciate a reference that makes this explicit. 

Let $X$ be a smooth complex affine variety. Suppose that $\{X_{\beta}\}_{\beta\in B}$ is a finite stratification of $X$ into smooth locally closed subvarieties. Let $T$ be a complex algebraic torus acting on $X$, and suppose that our stratification is $T$-equivariant (ie. that the strata are $T$-invariant). For fixed $\beta\in B$, there is a $T$-equivariant Thom-Gysin sequence of the form $$\ldots\rightarrow H^{i-d(\beta)}_T(X_{\beta};\mathbb{Q})\rightarrow H^i_T(\bigcup_{\gamma\leq\beta}X_{\gamma};\mathbb{Q})\rightarrow H^i_T(\bigcup_{\gamma<\beta}X_{\gamma};\mathbb{Q})\rightarrow\ldots,$$ where $d(\beta)$ is the real codimension of $X_{\beta}$ in $X$. Furthermore, if the $T$-equivariant Euler class of the normal bundle of $X_{\beta}$ in $X$ is not a zero-divisor in $H_T^*(X_{\beta};\mathbb{Q})$, then the Thom-Gysin sequence splits into short-exact sequences. $\textbf{Question}$: To what extent can we make sense of the above if $X$ is allowed to be singular? It occurs to me that there are two natural impediments to our proceeding when $X$ is singular. Firstly, is it clear that $d(\beta)$ will be well-defined? Secondly, will the normal bundle of $X_{\beta}$ in $X$ be well-defined so as to give a $T$-equivariant Euler class? I would appreciate any and all references/suggestions. 

Now, drawing the graph structure of this binary matrix leads to a three component graph composed of these three graphs (which all happen to be $K_4$, the complete graph on 4 vertices) with vertex sets composed of 

A distance threhold of 50 does not break the dataset into disjunct sets, as when you follow the linkages all of the elements are effectively connected by certain bridging elements. If you draw this as a graph structure, you will see that there are subgraphs 

CAML by definition is Categorical Abstract Machine Language, however I am not cetain that you can say that an language explicitly uses category theory. Perhaps you are asking "Are there languages that allow Category Theory Concepts to be easily represented?" or perhaps you are asking if the compilation or interpretation of a particular programming language uses Category Theory in its implementation? While technically, all Turing-complete capable languages should be equivalently able to express the same set of computations, some languages do so more elegantly than others, allowing the programmer or mathematician to be more eloquent. I would say LISP and SCHEME, even though based on lambda-calculus, are more connected to the spirit of category theory in concept. While the numbers and integers are conceptually defined as atomic and can be built up from primitives in concept and in theory; in practice, the implementations of SCHEME and LISP and (CLU) tend to take shortcuts to speed up implementation. The hierarchical ability to pass functions and functions of functions (etc.) as first-class parameters to functions in LISP and SCHEME let you be able to emulate the actions or morphisms of category theory better in that language than others. You just have to start from the ground up, as I have not yet seen a library or package in LISP or SCHEME for category theory. 

Let $G$ be a complex Lie group (not necessarily connected) with reductive Lie algebra $\frak{g}$. (We may assume that $G$ has finitely many connected components and is linear-algebraic.) Of course, $G$ need not be the complexification of a compact Lie group (ex. $G=\mathbb{C}$). To what extent, however, is $G$ "close" to being the complexification of a compact Lie group? Does $G$ belong to some kind of extension involving the complexification of a compact Lie group? Is $G$ some reasonably nice quotient of the complexification of a compact Lie group? I would appreciate any answers to questions of this nature. Also, I would appreciate any and all references. Thanks! 

Presumably, your field $k$ must be a topological field. To the extent that a $k$-manifold is defined in terms of analytic ideas, this would seem to be necessary. As you have suggested, the best-developed ideas arise when $k=\mathbb{C}$. I would suggest having a look at Serre's paper GAGA. There, he introduces the analytification functor from complex varieties to complex analytic spaces. From reading this, you might gain some insight into those properties of $\mathbb{C}$ that give such a nice functor. 

The problem seems to be one of systematically extending $z=(z_1,z_2,z_3)\in S^5$ to an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{C}^3$. To this end, let $e_1,e_2,e_3$ be the standard basis vectors for $\mathbb{C}^3$. For $j\in\{1,2,3\}$, let $$U_j:=\{z\in S^5:\{z,e_1,e_2,e_3\}\setminus\{e_j\}\text{ is a basis of }\mathbb{C}^3\}.$$ This is an open cover of $S^5$. Taking determinants, we find that $U_j=\{z\in S^5:z_j\neq 0\}$. Perhaps we can trivialize your bundle over the three open sets $U_j$. For $z\in U_j$, I would suggest using Gram-Schmidt on the basis $\{z,e_1,e_2,e_3\}\setminus\{e_j\}$ to obtain $\varphi_j(z):=[z\text{ }f_{1j}(z)\text{ }f_{2j}(z)]\in SU(3)$, where $f_{1j},f_{2j}:U_j\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^3$. The sections $\varphi_j$ should be computable and they should allow you to trivialize the bundle over the open sets $U_j$. I realize that I have not given local trivializations over the complements of the north and south poles. Still, it is some local trivialization. 

John Conway initially thought that his cellular automata game of Life could not lead to an unlimited number of active cells starting from a finite number of cells. Computer experimentation by Bill Gosper led to the discovery in 1970 of the Gosper Glider Gun, a finite collection of cells which leads to a recurring state which continues to emit "spaceships" or "bullets" which continue out into the periphery infinitely. I can't find a link to the specifics of the discovery beyond the remark that Gosper won a 50$US reward from Conway for making this finding. The glider gun was also used in constructions involving the manipulations of the "bullets" in such a way as to form a computational apparatus, ultimately proving the Turing-completeness of Conway's Life. I do know that a lot of random configuration discovery was done for the Life cellular automaton and for other CA by creating random patterns, then masking the lattice with a pattern which blanked out the peripheral cell values and left the random pattern alone in the center of the screen, and then allowed the CA rules to run. Escapees such as gliders would continue their motion into the blanked areas and be easily discerned in a simulation. The first glider-type pattern was discovered by tracing the evolution of the finite starting patterns. David Eppstein also appears to have written a program that helps in finding these spaceship types of pattern, which should also count as mathematical discoveries and exploration via computer programs.
