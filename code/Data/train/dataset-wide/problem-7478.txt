The following are subgroup embedding properties introduced by Bah and Borevich. Definition 1: A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is said to be paranormal if for each $g \in G$, we have that $H^{\langle H, H^g \rangle}= \langle H, H^g \rangle$. Proposition 1: A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is paranormal if and only if, for any $K \leq G$ containing $H$, all conjugates of $H$ lying in $K$ also lie in $H^K$ i.e., the normal closure of $H$ in $K$. Definition 2: A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is said to be polynormal if for each $g\in G$, we have $H^{\langle g \rangle} = H^{H^{ \displaystyle \langle g \rangle}}$ Proposition 2: A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is polynormal if and only if $H^K = H^L$ for any subgroups $K$ and $L$ such that $H \leq K \unlhd L \leq G$. 

Now $X'^{\langle x_i \rangle} = X'$. Also $\bar\omega(G) \unlhd G$ and $\bar\omega(G) \subseteq P_G(X')$. Letting $H = X'$ and $K = \langle x_i \rangle$ in Lemma 2, we deduce that $\bar\omega(G) \subseteq P_G(\langle x_i \rangle X' = P_G( \langle x_i, X' \rangle)$ 

Let $G = A \times B$. Suppose that $H \leq G$ such that $N_G(H) = N_A(\pi_A(H)) \times N_B(\pi_B(H))$ where $\pi_A$ and $\pi_B$ are the respective projection homomorphisms For simplicity and convenience, we can identify $G$ as being an internal direct product of $A$ and $B$ Proposition 1: $N \unlhd A \times B$ if and only if $[N, X] = [\pi_X(N), X] \leq N \cap X$ for $X = A, B$ Definition For $H \leq A \times B$, we define $C_X = \{x \in X \,|\, [\,x, \pi_X(H)\,] \leq X \cap H \}$ for $X = A, B$. Proposition 2: If $H \leq A \times B$ then $N_G(H) \cap X = C_X$ for $X =A, B$. 

With the objects satisfying a universal property the comparison isomorphisms between them are unique, so that the groupoid of objects satisfying the universal property is codiscrete, i.e. there is exactly one morphism between any two objects, so in particular the vertex groups of this groupoid are trivial. For an object A in a concrete category (or in a category with a chosen class of 'embeddings') there is a groupoid of injective hulls of A that is not in general codiscrete, and so it can have non-trivial vertex groups. But this groupoid, though not codiscrete, is still connected, so that each vertex group is (non-uniquely!) isomorphic to every other via conjugation by a morphism (necessarily invertible) of injective hulls. Edit: The fundamental group of a space, as in JSE's analogy, bears much the same relationship with the fundamental groupoid of the space -- in particular, $\pi_1$s at points in the same path-component are isomorphic via conjugation in the same way. 

Have you tried nLab again? I'm not sure continuous functors are what you're looking for, incidentally. It seems more likely that a 'Scott-continuous functor' should be one that preserves filtered colimits. Replacing the preorders (and metric spaces) of domain theory with (enriched) categories is not a new idea. Have a look at Categories for fixpoint semantics (1978) by Daniel Lehmann, and Solving recursive domain equations with enriched categories (1994) by Kim Ritter Wagner. 

The following is Theorem and proof of a research paper which I am having a problem trying to understand: Theorem: Let $G$ be a finite solvable group. Then $P(G) = \bar \omega(G)$ I have managed to show the inclusion $P(G) \subseteq \bar \omega(G)$. The reverse inclusion goes like this 

Definition: Let $G$ be a finite solvable group and $\Sigma \in \text{H}(G)$, the set of Hall systems of $G$. The normaliser of $\Sigma$ is defined as $$ N_G(\Sigma) = \{ g\in G \,|\, H=H^g \text{ for all} H \in \Sigma \}.$$ A system normaliser of $G$ is a subgroup of the form $N_G(\Sigma)$ for some $\Sigma \in \text{H}(G)$. I have shown that a system normalizer of a finite solvable group covers the central chief factors and avoids the eccentric chief factors of $G$. Lemma: Let $U$ be a subgroup of a finite group $G$. Let $W \leq V \leq G$. Then $V/W$ is covered by $U$ $\iff$ $[U \cap V: U \cap W]=[V:W]$ 

Now $\langle x_i, X' \rangle \unlhd X$ since it contains $X'$. Using Lemma 1, $\bar \omega(G) \subseteq P_G(\langle x_i, X' \rangle) \cap X\bar \omega(G) = P_{X\bar \omega(G)}(\langle x_i, X' \rangle)$ Furthermore, $\langle x_i, X' \rangle \unlhd X$ implies that $\langle x_i, X' \rangle \,\text{prn}\, X $ so that $X = P_X(\langle x_i, X' \rangle) = P_{X\bar \omega(G)}(\langle x_i, X' \rangle) \cap X$. From this we obtain $ X\bar \omega(G) = P_{X\bar \omega(G)}(\langle x_i, X' \rangle)$ i.e $\langle x_i, X' \rangle \,\text{prn}\,X\bar \omega(G)$. I am sorry for the long post but I have been battling with this for a few days now. If someone could please try to help me with the questions that I have posted, it will be much appreciated. 

Let $n$ be the input size, i.e. the number of input digits in some base, or the sum or max of the logs of the magnitudes of the input numbers-- these are all equivalent for the purposes of big-O. Strategy: apply at most $O(n)$ shears (area preserving linear transformations leaving one coord axis fixed) to get an easy problem, solve the easy problem, and then apply the inverse sequence of shears to get the solution back in the original coordinate space. EASY PROBLEM #1: when at least one of the two bounding rays is axis-aligned. EASY PROBLEM #2: when the two bounding ray directions point into the interiors of different quadrants of the plane. Details of the easy problems are omitted, since they are straightforward and not the interesting or challenging part of this problem. So assume we have a non-easy case of the problem: that is, both bounding ray directions point into the interior of the same quadrant; w.l.o.g. both point into the first quadrant. Choose one of the two bounding rays and call it "primary" and the other "secondary". If the primary ray has slope $< 1$, swap the coordinate axes, so that the primary ray has slope $\ge 1$. Let $a/b \ge 1$ be the slope of the primary bounding ray, with $a \ge b \gt 0$ taken directly from the input equations. Let $q,r$ be the quotient and remainder of dividing $a$ by $b$. That is, $q=\mathrm{floor}(a/b), r=a-q b, a \ge b \gt r \ge 0$. Apply to the problem geometry the shear that leaves the $y$ axis fixed and takes $(1,q)$ to $(1,0)$; in other words, the linear transformation that leaves $(0,1)$ fixed and takes $(1,0)$ to $(1,-q)$. Maintain the designation "primary" on the image of the primary bounding ray. This shear transformation decreases the primary ray's slope to r/b, either keeping its direction into the first quadrant (if $r>0$), or parallel to the $x$ axis (if $r=0$). Note that the solution before this shear transformation can be described by any of the following equivalent characterizations (equivalent because both bounding ray dirs point into the first quadrant): 

It is clear that paranormality implies polynormality. However, the converse does not hold in general. An example showing this is given by V. I. Mysovskikh in here. But he uses an algorithm based on the table of marks (Burnside matrices). I'm looking for an intuitive counterexample to show that polynormality does not imply paranormality. Any help will be greatly appreciated. 

I can't seem to reason why this is the case. The author says that it should follow easily from the lemma but I don't understand how. 

Definition: A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is said to be pronormal in $G$ if for all $g\in G$, there exists $x \in \langle H, H^g \rangle$ such that $H^x =H^g$. Definition: A subgroup $H$ of $G$ is said to be weakly pronormal in $G$ if for $g \in G$, there exists $x \in H^{\langle g \rangle} := \langle g^nHg^{-n} \, |\, n\in \mathbb{Z} \rangle$ such that $H^x =H^g$. By the inclusion $\langle H, H^g \rangle \leq H^{\langle g \rangle}$, we have that pronormality implies weak pronormality. It is also known that they coincide for finite solvable groups. However it does not hold in general according to the paper 

I have managed to show that (a) implies (b) and (c) implies (a). I am having a problem showing that (b) implies (c). Asumme that $H \leq K \unlhd L \leq G$. We will show that $H$ is weakly pronormal in $G$. It suffices to show that $L \leq N_L(H)K$. 

According to the Elephant, and these notes, an object X in a category C is indecomposable if given an isomorphism $X \cong \coprod_i U_i$ there is a unique $i$ such that $X \cong U_i$ and $U_j \cong 0$ for $j\neq i$ where 0 is the initial object. If C is extensive, then X is indecomposable iff it is connected (proof and details here). Lambek and Scott give a different definition: they say that X is indecomposable if given an epi $[k,l] \colon U + V \twoheadrightarrow X$, one of k or l is epi. I suppose this can be generalised to say that X is indecomposable if any jointly epic family into X contains at least one epi. Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, but I can't see that either definition implies the other. So my question is 

I'm not sure whether you're working in Cat or 2-Cat; I'll assume the latter. If B is an object of a finitely (2-)complete 2-category K, then the 2-category Fib(B) of fibrations over B is monadic over K/B, where 'fibration' is meant in Street's sense (see nLab or Street's Fibrations in bicategories in the Cahiers or the paper cited by Buschi Sergio above). The monad takes $f \colon E \to B$ to the projection $B/f \to B$. So Fib(B) has the universal property of an Eilenberg--Moore object, i.e. it's a lax limit. So if K is 2-Cat, then as long as your definition of fibrations matches this one, you have your universal property.
