A theorem of Clemmens and Griffiths states that a smooth hypesurface in $\mathbb CP^4$ of degree three is not rational. I would like to know if nevertheless it is diffeomorphic (as a smooth real $6$-dimensional manifold) to a rational complex three-dimensional variety? 

Let $M_1^n$ and $M_2^n$, $n>4$ be two smooth compact manifolds that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic. Suppose that a finite group is $G$ acting faithfully on $M_1^n$ by diffeomorphisms. Is it true that $G$ admits as well a faithful action on $M_2^n$ by diffeomorphisms? If no, what would be the a (relatively) simple example? For example, can one differentiate exotic structures on $S^7$ this way? 

I first got concious of the notion of normal varieties around 3 years ago and despite the fact that by now I can manipulate with it a bit, this notion still puzzles me a lot. One thing that strikes me is that the definition of normality is so entirely algebraic. From my common sense understanding the notion of normal varieties restricts the class of spaces that we consider to more-less reasonable ones. It looks to me that this definition is analogous to the definition of pseudo-manifold. At least the obvious similarity is that in both cases the set of non-singular points is connected. Normality pops up everywhere and its definition is very short. But it is hard for me to imagine that a differential topologist or differential geometer could come up with such a definition. Why is the notion of normatilty is so omnipresent? What is "geometric" meaning of normality? Maybe a more concrete question would be like this. Suppose $X$ is an irreducible algebraic subvariety in $\mathbb C^n$ with singularities in co-dimension $2$. Can one somehow looking on singularities, their stratification and the way $X$ lies in $\mathbb C^n$ say if it is normal or not? Added. Who was the person who invented this notion? I would like to thank everybody for useful comments and links. 

Let $\mathbb {\overline B}^n\subset \mathbb R^n$ be a closed unit ball in and let $\mathbb B^k\subset \mathbb R^k$ be a open unit ball. Suppose $F$ is a smooth function on $\mathbb {\overline B}^n\times \mathbb B^k$ that has the following properties. 1) $F(x,y)$ tends to $-\infty$ when $|y|\to 1$ for $(x,y)\in \mathbb {\overline B}^n\times \mathbb B^k$. 2) For any $y_0\in \mathbb B^k$ the strict minimum of $F$ on the ball $\mathbb {\overline B}^n\times y_0$ is attained in the interior of the ball. (Here by strict I mean, that the minimum of $F$ on the boundary of $\mathbb {\overline B}^n\times y_0$ is larger than the minimum of $F$ over the whole ball.) Question. Is it true that $F$ has a critical point $(x_0,y_0)$ in $\mathbb {\overline B}^n\times \mathbb B^k$ such that $F$ restricted on $\mathbb {\overline B}^n\times y_0$ has a minimum at $(x_0,y_0)$? If yes, I would like to know if there are some natural generalizations of this statement. If no, could one impose some additional conditions that guarantee a positive answer? 

Consider the full flag variety $F_n$ consisting of full flags in $\mathbb C^n$. There is a collection of tautological bundles on $F_n$: $0=U_0\subset U_1\subset ...\subset U_{n-1}\subset U_n=\mathbb C^n\otimes O_{F_n}$. Recall that for $i=1,...,n-1$ the classes $\sigma_i=c_1(U_i^*)\in H^2(F_n)$ form a base in $H^2(F_n)$ and moreover generate multiplicatively the cohomology ring of $F_n$. Question. Is it true that the cohomology classes $(\sigma_1\cdot\sigma_2\cdot...\cdot \sigma_{n-1})^k$ and $(\sigma_1\cdot\sigma_2\cdot...\cdot \sigma_{n-2})^k$ are non-zero for $k$ small enough with respect to $n$ (say for $k<\log(n)/100$)? Or at least, say for $k\le 10$ for large $n$? 

I just found one more classical consequence which is quite nice. It is described in the book of Harris "First course in algebraic geometry". Namely, one can prove that all projective automorphisms of $\mathbb CP^n$ are projective transformations. In order to prove this one shows that any hyperplane in $\mathbb CP^n$ is sent by any automorphism to a hyperplane (otherwise it would intersect the image of the line in more than one point). From this the statement follows rather directly. 

Using two-adic valuation Monsky coloured $\mathbb Q\times \mathbb Q$ in red, blue, and green, so that on each line points of at most two colours are present. Question. I would like to know if there is some kind of classification of three-colourings with this property, or some structure theorem about them. How rare are such colouring? (I would like to exclude "degenerate" colourings that use almost only two colours) The colouring of Monsky is as follows: $(x,y)$ is coloured blue if $|x|_2\ge |y|_2,\, |x|_2 \ge 1$, green if $|x|_2< |y|_2,\, |y|_2 \ge1$, red if $|x|_2< 1,\, |y|_2 < 1$. 

Question 1. Is there a classification of smooth $S^1$-actions with isolated fixed points on the standard $\mathbb CP^3$? Question 2. What if one additionally imposes the condition that the action preserves an almost complex structure homotopic to the standard one? (here we consider almost complex structures up to homotopies through $S^1$-invariant almost complex structures). Note that non-linear actions on $\mathbb CP^3$ do exist, as is proved by Ted Petrie, see for example section 4: Smooth $S^1$ actions on homotopy complex projective spaces and related topics $URL$ I tried to check the articles that cite this article, but was not able to understand if the answer to my questions are known. 

Suppose $\Gamma$ is a finitely presented group that has a torsion element. Can the classifying space $K(\Gamma,1)$ be homotopic to a finite-dimensional manifold? If yes, what is the simplest example? 

Recall a definition. Let $V\subset \mathbb CP^n$ be a projective variety and $E$ be a holomorphic vector bundle on it. We call $E$ linearly trivial if the restriction of $E$ to any projective line in $V$ is trivial. It is well known that any linearly trivial bundle on $\mathbb CP^n$ itself is trivial (see Okonek, Schneider, Spindler). Question 1. I think that I have an idea of a generalization of this statement and would like to ask you if this generalization is known? Generalized statement. For any integer $n>0$ any linearly trivial bundle on any smooth degree $n$ hypersuface $V_n\subset \mathbb CP^{4n}$ is trivial. Idea of the proof. One can easily see that on $V_n$ any two points can be joined by a chain of two projective lines. Moreover for two points $x,y$ the set of such two-lines paths from $x$ to $y$ is a connected projective variety. So let us trivialize the bundle at one point $x\in V_n$. Then extend this trivialization along each connected chain of $2$ lines on $V_n$ starting at $x$. I think that the extension will be independent of the choice of a chain since the space of all chains from $x$ to $y$ is a connected projective variety, while all trivialization of $E$ over $y$ is an affine variety. Question 2. Does this reasoning sound plausible? 

It seems to me, unfortunately, that I found my own very simple counterexample to the claim (as Fedja was suggesting) Counter-example. Instead of $\mathbb B^n$ we will consider the square $[-2,2]\times [-2,2]\subset \mathbb R^2$. And $\mathbb B^k=[-2,2]\subset \mathbb R^1$. The map $\varphi$ is just the projection (on the $x$ axis). The function $F$ has the following shape: $$F(x,y)=(y-1)^2(y+1)^2+xf(y).$$ Hence, $F(x,y)$ is affine on each horizontal interval. Let us define by $f(y)$ a monotonous $C^{\infty}$ function, that has the following properties: 1) $f(y)=-1$ for $y\in [-2,-1]$. 2) $f(y)=1$ for $y\ge 0$. 3) $f(y)$ is strictly increasing on $[-1,0]$, attains its single zero at $y=-\frac{1}{2}$ and $f'(-\frac{1}{2})=f''(-\frac{1}{2})=0$. It is not hard to check that all the required conditions hold, and $F$ doesn't have any critical point in $[-2,2]\times [-2,2]$. What happens here, is that $F$ has two local minima on each interval $x=const$ at points $y=\pm 1$. One of these minima is global for $x\le 0$ and the other for $x\ge 1$... 

Let $S$ be a simply connected surface, possibly with boundary components, with a smooth complete metric of non-positive curvature. Let $X\subset S$ be a closed connected subset. I would like to know if the following procedure produces a convex subset of $S$ that contains $X$: Construction. For any two points $x_1,x_2\in X$ let $[x_1,x_2]$ be the length minimizing path connecting $x_1$ and $x_2$. Now define $\Omega(X)$ as the union in $S$ of all such paths $[x_1,x_2]$ over all $x_1,x_2\in X$. Question. Is $\Omega(X)$ convex in $S$? PS. I have to add some information. A set $C$ is convex if for any two $x_1,x_2\in C$ and any minimizing path $[x_1x_2]$ $C$ contains it. 

What about taking the following example: consider $\mathbb P^1$ bundle over $\mathbb P^2$ given by the projectivisation of $\mathbb P(O\oplus O(-3))$ over $\mathbb P^2$. The linear system $-mK_X$ contracts $\mathbb P^2$ to a point. 

Here is one example - take an elliptic curve without an automorphism of order $4$ with a fixed point. Note at the same time that any torus $T^2$ with an area form has an area preserving automorphism of order $4$ with a fixed point. 

This statement about blow ups of torus is not correct. Take any aglebraic $2$-torus with a smooth curve $C$ of genus $>1$. Blow up $C^2+1$ points on $C$ and apply Theorem 1 here: $URL$ 

I am certain that the following result holds, but was not able to find a reference. Do you know one? Or maybe you can give a short proof? Statement. Let $(M^4,\omega)$ be a compact symlectic manifold and let $J_t$ be a smooth family of compatible almost complex structures, $t\in(-1,1)$. Suppose that $S_0$ is a smooth $J_0$-holomorphic sphere in $(M^4,J_0)$ with zero self-intersection. Consider now $M^4\times (-1,1)$, introduce $J_t$ on each fibre $M^4\times t$, and take in it the surface $S^2_0\times 0$. Then there is a neighbourhood $U$ of $S^2_0\times 0$ such that for any $(x,t)\in U$ there is a unique $J_t$-holomorphic sphere passing through $(x,t)$ contained in $U$. In other words $J_t$-holomorphic spheres produce on $U$ a structure of a smooth $S^2$-fibration (over a $3$-ball). 

Suppose that $M^n$ is an orientable connected (thanks to Greg) manifold and $Z^k$ with $Z^{n-k}$ are two real cycles in $M^n$ with zero index of intersection $Z^k\cdot Z^{n-k}=0$ (for me these cylces are manifolds if this helps). Is it true that the cycles can be replaced by homologous ones that does not intersect at all? How one usually proves this? Note that we don't put any restriction on cycles by which we replace $Z^k$ and $Z^{n-k}$ (they are not asked to be connected). I am mainly interested in positive statement, like the one given by Elisabeth in her comment. But if the answer is still "no" in general situation I would like to know this. One more detail, in my case $Z^k$ is two dimensional (if this helps). 

I would like to understand if the following statement is actually proven in Shafarevich's book "Basic algebraic geometry" (or just learn its proof in the spirit of Shafarevich's book). Statement. Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field and let $X, Y$ be irreducible projective subvarieties in $\mathbb P_K^n$. Suppose that $dim X+dim Y\ge n$. Then $X\cap Y$ is non-empty. It is proven in section 1.6, Theorem 5, that provided a form $F$ is non-vanishing on $X$, all irreducible components of $X\cap F=0$ have dimension $dimX-1$. So if $Y$ were a complete intersection the statement $X\cap Y\ne \emptyset$ would immediately follow from this theorem. At the same time $Y$ need not be a complete intersection... A few lines after Theorem 6 in the same section Shafarevich mentions that the statement holds. But I can not find the proof in the book. So, is the proof really missing or I just miss something simple? 

Let $A_r$ be a complex annulus of modulus $r>0$ obtained from a $1\times r$ rectangle in $\mathbb C$ with vertices $A=0$, $B=r$, $C=r+i$, $D=i$, by identifying isomterically $AB$ with $DC$. Let us now chose $0<s<r$ and make a cut of the cylinder $A_r$ along the segment $[0,s]$ (if $s=r$ we get back the rectangle). Denote the obtained annulus by $A_r(s)$. Clearly, the modulus of $A_r(s)$ is less than $r$. Question. Is there a reasonably looking estimation from above of the modulus $M(A_r(s))$ of cylinder $A_r(s)$? More precisely I wonder if there is a relatively simply looking continuous function, $f(r,s)$ defined on the domain $0\le s\le r$ such that $$f(r,s)\ge M((A_r(s)),$$ $$f(r,0)=r,\;\;f(r,s_1)>f(r,s_2)\; if \;\; s_2>s_1,\;\; f(r,r)=0.$$ 

Suppose $M^4$ is a compact hyperbolic (i.e. curvature $-1$) $4$-manifold and $\Gamma\cong\pi_1(M^4)$. Is there any expectation whether $\Gamma$ acts properly and co-compactly on a $\rm CAT(0)$ cube complex? Note that by work of Bergeron Wise based on work of Kahn-Markovic the answer to the question is always positive for $\Gamma=\pi_1(M^3)$, where $M^3$ is any hyperbolic $3$-manifold. However, if instead $\Gamma$ is a co-compact lattice in $U(2,1)$, the answer is always negative (by Delzant Py (I guess)).
