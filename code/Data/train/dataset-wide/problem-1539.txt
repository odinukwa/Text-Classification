The word we use to refer to what's inside the cosmic horizon is the 'universe', so what would you call the empty space outside of the horizon? 

Recently I bought a couple of books on cosmology from a second-hand bookshop. One was published in 1993 and the other is from the 1970. I know, from a recent book, that the inflaton theory is probably newer than both books and that the Higgs Boson has been discovered, but that is all that I know has changed recently in the field of cosmology. Has anything else changed since then? Which topics of the books should I understand are considered outdated? 

However, this article sources its information from the website Physics Astronomy, a blog-type website which posts various articles on astronomical topics. Since Physics Astronomy doesn't seem to be a particularly reputable source, I will take this information with a pinch of salt. So, is this article true? Will you be able to see the Perseids in the daytime with the naked eye this year? 

My telescope's sidereal tracking is lousy: it just doesn't work. To overcome this, when taking long-exposure photographs through it, what's the best way to reduce star trailing? 

I am wanting to plot a velocity profile (a plot of velocity against the star's distance from the galactic core) from the Gaia DR2, but so far my efforts have been disappointing. The information I have for each star are the declination ($\delta$), right ascension ($\alpha$), radial velocity ($v_r$), parallax ($\theta_\text{parallax}$) and proper motion ($\mu$) (ra and dec). I tried to calculate the star's distance from the galactic core using the cosine rule: $$ d = \frac{1000}{\theta_{\text{parallax}}}$$ $$\theta = \arccos{[\sin{\delta_\text{star}}\sin{\delta_\text{core}} + \cos{\delta_\text{star}}\cos{\delta_\text{core}}\cos{(\alpha_\text{star}-\alpha_\text{core})}]}$$ $$ r = \sqrt{d_\text{core}^2+ d^2 - 2d \times d_\text{core} \times \cos{\theta}} $$ Where $d$ is the distance from the Sun to the star. $d_\text{core}$ is the distance from the Sun to the galactic core. $\theta$ is the angular separation of the star and the galactic core. $r$ is the distance from the star to the core. And the star's speed using the equations: $$\mu = \sqrt{\mu_\text{dec}^2 + \mu_\text{ra}^2}$$ $$ v_t = 4.7 \mu d $$ $$ v = \sqrt{v_r^2 + v_t^2} $$ But the plot doesn't show any kind of trend (just a kind of blob). Have I calculated correctly and, if not, how could I calculate the tangential velocities and radius from the galactic core? Basically, I want to make the kind of plot that helps us identify dark matter in galaxies. 

It's true that since the Earth is not a point, an observer in the upper atmosphere directly above that point on the surface would not be at exactly the same radius from the Sun as the radius of Earth's orbit (defined in terms of the position of the center of the Earth), but if you actually do the calculation of the solar constant at the radius of Earth's center vs. the radius of the point on the surface that's closest to the Sun, the difference is very small so it can be ignored if you're only stating the solar constant to nearest Watt/meter^2 or even the nearest tenth of a Watt/meter^2. The nominal solar luminosity is defined to be $3.828 \times 10^{26}$ and 1 AU is defined as 149597870700 meters, and if you use the formula you mentioned to calculate the solar flux at 1 AU it works out to 1361.1664654 watts per square meter. The radius of the Earth at the equator is about 6378 meters, so at an equinox when the Sun is directly overhead at the equator, an observer seeing the Sun directly overhead should be at a distance of 149597870700 - 6378 = 149597864322 meters, if you use the same formula to calculate the solar flux at this radius you get 1361.1665815, so it only makes a different if you want precision beyond the second decimal place. 

So apparently the "covariant entropy bound" (also known as Bousso's holographic bound) is the thing to look into when considering the maximum entropy of the universe (and I assume you just mean the observable universe here rather than whatever may lie beyond it). This set of lecture slides by Raphael Bousso, the physicist who originally proposed the covariant entropy bound, says that this bound is "conjectured to hold in arbitrary spacetimes, including cosmology." But it also says "If correct, origin must lie in quantum gravity", probably meaning one can't derive this fact in a non-conjectural way from basic laws of physics without having a complete theory of quantum gravity. For an introduction to this stuff, I recommend this Scientific American article that discusses various holographic bonds, including the Bekenstein bound along with Bousso's conjectured more general bound (the article was written by Bekenstein himself). Though it is from 2003 so I'm not sure what kind of theoretical progress has been made since then. Anyway, here's what it says about Buosso's entropy bound: 

It's almost 100% stars. In good conditions, you can see perhaps 2000 stars. (There are about 6000 naked-eye visible stars; of these, 3000 are above the horizon at any time, and about 1000 are hidden because they're too close to the horizon and blocked by the atmosphere.) The number of non-star objects you can see without assistance is tiny in comparison: 

During a solar eclipse seen from Earth, an observer on the Moon would see the Moon's shadow on the surface of Earth. I don't know of any photos of such a shadow as seen from the Moon, but here's a photo of a solar eclipse seen from the Mir space station in 1999. 

No. Let's say we want to see Earth as it was 1000 years ago. Assume that someone has set up a perfect mirror 500 light-years away, so that we can actually see the light that left Earth 1000 years ago. (That's a really big assumption.) The best telescopes in the world can't see the Apollo landing sites from Earth. We didn't get decent images of the descent stages, which were left on the surface, until the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter sent back photos it took from Lunar orbit. See $URL$ 1000 light-years is about 20 billion times as far away as the Moon. There's no way we could see people's faces at that distance with current technology -- or with any reasonable future technology. (There are physical limits on the resolution of an optical telescope of a given size.) And all this assumes that we have that perfect mirror out there. As far as I know, nobody has set up such a mirror for us, and all the light that left Earth 1000 years ago is now 1000 light-years away, badly faded, and beyond our reach. It's conceivable that we could develop faster-than-light travel (which may or may not be physically possible), go out there, build a telescope with a really big aperture, and point it back at Earth. But that's not likely to happen any time soon, and I wouldn't know how to determine how good an image we might be able to get. And going back millions of years just makes the problem worse. 

The solar constant is defined to be the power you get on such a surface of unit area if it's not being obstructed by atmospheric particles, and if it's oriented perpendicular to incoming rays so that it receives the maximum possible power at that location. One aspect of the orientation issue that's important to understand is that if you orient your solar collector so that it's parallel to the ground (so that it would be lying flat if it was actually at ground level), then it will only receive the maximum power if the surface of the Earth is itself perpendicular to incoming rays from the Sun at that point, which is not true in the above diagram. It would only be true at the point on Earth that's the dead "center" of the Earth as seen by an observer looking at it from the Sun's position, or the point where the gray line connecting the centers of Earth and Sun intersects with surface of the Earth on this diagram: 

That is also the only point on Earth where an observer on the surface would see the Sun "directly overhead", at the very top of the apparent dome of the sky. So even if you stripped away the Earth's atmosphere, only at this point on the Earth would the power reaching a square meter of the surface be equal to the solar constant, the average power per square meter over the entire illuminated half of the Earth's surface would be less than the solar constant since most of the surface is at an angle relative to incoming rays. Incidentally, the angle of the surface relative to incoming rays is also the main reason why at Northern latitudes, it's warmer in the summer (when the surface at a Northern latitude is closer to being perpendicular to oncoming rays) than in the winter (when the surface is at a more inclined angle relative to incoming rays), as illustrated in a diagram from this page: 

I suspect you're thinking that we'd have a summer when the northern hemisphere, for example, is tilted toward the Sun, and a second summer during the perihelion, when the Earth is closest to the Sun. For one thing, the timing doesn't work; the perihelion takes place in early January, close to the northern midwinter. That probably moderates the effects of axial tilt for the northern hemisphere (and amplifies them for the southern hemisphere), but it's not enough to override them. The other answers have said that the axial tilt is a more significant factor than the variation in distance from the Sun, but they haven't explained why. The following is a rough back-of-the-envelope guesstimate. The difference in illumination caused by the varying distance from the Sun can be computed from the ratio between the perihelion and aphelion distance, which is about a factor of 0.967. Applying the inverse square law indicates that amount of sunlight at aphelion is about 93.5% of what it is at perihelion. Reference: $URL$ At my current location (about 33Â° north latitude), at this time of year (close to the northern winter solstice), we're getting about 10 hours of sunlight and 14 hours of darkness each day. (Reference: the weather app on my phone.) That's about 83% of what we'd get with 12 hours of daylight during either equinox, and about 71% of what we'd get with 14 hours of daylight and 10 hours of darkness per day during the summer solstice. The effect is greater at higher latitudes. In addition to that, the sun is lower in the sky during the winter than it is during the summer, meaning that a given amount of sunlight is spread over a larger area of the Earth's surface, which makes the ratio even larger. I don't have the numbers for that, but it's enough to show that the effect of the axial tilt is substantially greater than the effect of the varying distance between the Earth and the Sun. 

Imagine you have a solar collector measuring one square meter, which can directly measure the power (energy per unit time) striking it. If there are layers of atmosphere above the collector, some of the incoming light is absorbed or reflected by particles in the atmosphere, so you won't measure as much power as if you place the collector in space at the distance of Earth's orbit, with no atmosphere between you and the Sun. But if you place the collector in the upper atmosphere of the Earth, the density of atmospheric particles above you is so small that they absorb/reflect only a negligible amount of power. Orientation is also an issue--you'll get the maximum power if you orient the plane of the collector so that it's perpendicular to the direction of the incoming rays. If it's not perpendicular, then if you approximate the incoming radiation as a set of parallel rays which each carry an equal amount of power (a standard approximation in optics) then fewer rays strike the collector when it's at some angle that's not perpendicular to the rays. All this is illustrated in the following diagram (from this page), with the two possible orientations of the solar collector illustrated in gray, and the light rays illustrated as black lines: 

But again, this bound should be the upper limit on the entropy of a given region, not necessarily the actual entropy in that region, so this type of holographic bound shouldn't imply that when we increase the entropy of the universe, the universe needs to grow. This paper specifically discusses how most matter-containing regions in cosmology apart from black holes would fail to "saturate" the covariant entropy bound, meaning that the actual entropy in the region is smaller than the maximum possible according to the bound.
