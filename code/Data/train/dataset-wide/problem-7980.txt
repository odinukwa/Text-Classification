Given a field $F$ of subsets of $\Omega$, we can define full conditional probabilities to be a function $P:F\times (F-\{ \varnothing \}) \to [0,1]$ such that: 

A more specific question then is whether the first or the third fact has a true converse? (The second doesn't, since there are right-orderable groups that have a non-indicable subgroup.) Or at least a converse given some nice assumptions? A related question: Are there non-trivial sufficient conditions for having a right-orderable quotient? 

Stipulate that the Axiom of Probabilistic Choice (APC) says that for every collection $\{ A_i : i \in I \}$ of non-empty sets, there is a function on $I$ that assigns to $i$ a finitely-additive probability measure $\mu_i$ on $A_i$. Then Hahn-Banach (HB) implies APC, since HB is equivalent to the existence of a finitely-additive probability measure on every boolean algebra, and hence implies the existence of such a measure on the direct sum of the powerset algebras $P(A_i)$. APC is non-trivial in that it implies the Banach-Tarski paradox and the existence of nonmeasurable sets (the proof Foreman and Wehrung use to show that HB implies Banach-Tarski works). Question: Does APC imply HB? (When I think about this, I find I keep on wanting to use Stone representation, but of course to do that would be to assume Boolean Prime Ideal, which is stronger than HB or APC.) 

The probability part is easy. When the $B_i$ are all finite and $I$ is finite, one just needs to define the probability measure for meets of atoms, and that's easy. And the resulting measure is clearly unique. But the infinite case then follows from the finite case. To define the probability of some element $a$ of the direct sum, just take a finite subset $J$ of $I$ and finite subalgebras $B'_i$ of the $B_i$ such that $a$ is in the direct sum of the $B'_i$ as $i$ ranges over $J$, and use this to define the probability of $a$. By the uniqueness in the finite case, this is well-defined. Still, a reference would be nice. 

Regarding the part of your question about involutions. I don't think it's always possible to find a maximal order stable under a given involution. For instance, take $F=\mathbb Q$, $A = \mathbb Q^{2\times 2}$ and the involution $$ \sigma: A \longrightarrow A: X \mapsto M\cdot X^\top \cdot M^{-1} $$ with $$ M=\left(\begin{array}{cc} 2&0\newline 0&1\end{array}\right) $$ Now any maximal order $\Theta$ in $A$ is conjugate to $\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$, and therefore all $\Theta$-lattices in $\mathbb Q^{1\times 2}$ are of the form $n\cdot L$ for dome $n\in \mathbb Q$ and some fixed full $\mathbb Z$-lattice L in $\mathbb Q^{1\times 2}$. Note that the determinant of a basis matrix for $n\cdot L$ is well-defined up to sign (since two basis matrices differ only by an element of ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb Z)$), and $\det(n\cdot L) = \pm n^2\cdot \det(L)$. In what follows assume $\Theta$ is a maximal order such that $\sigma(\Theta) \subseteq \Theta$. This will lead to a contradiction. For any $S\in{\rm GL}(2,\mathbb Q)$ we can replace $M$ by $M' = S M S^{\top}$, $\Theta$ by $\Theta'=S\Theta S^{-1}$ and $\sigma$ by $$ \sigma': A \longrightarrow A: X \mapsto M'\cdot X^\top \cdot M'^{-1} $$ So assume that $\Theta'=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$, $L'=\mathbb Z^{1\times 2}$ and $\sigma'(\Theta') \subseteq \Theta'$. Note that the determinant of $M'$ will be $2\cdot \det S^2$, which is not a square in $\mathbb Q$. Now here's the problem: $L'\cdot M'$ is not of the form $n\cdot L'$, since $\det M'$ is not a square in $\mathbb Q$. Therefore $L'\cdot M'$ cannot be stable under the action of $\Theta'^\top = \Theta'$. Hence $$ L' \cdot M' \cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \neq L'\cdot M' $$ which implies $$ L' \cdot M' \cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \cdot M'^{-1} \neq L' $$ which tells you that $$ \sigma'(\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}) = M'\cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \cdot M'^{-1} \nsubseteq {\rm End}_{\mathbb Z}(L')=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2} $$ which is a contradiction (as $\Theta'=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$ was assumed to be stable under $\sigma'$). 

If one replaces $2^\Omega$ in FCU with an arbitrary boolean algebra, then FCU becomes equivalent to BPI, and FCP comes to imply HB. 

Negative to the first question, so the others are moot. Let $G_1$ be the isometries of $\mathbb R$. First note that no finite number of translates (or reflections, but that doesn't add anything) of $(1/2)C$ covers $C$. This can be seen by playing around with base three expansions. Let $I$ be the ideal in $\mathcal P(\mathbb R)$ generated by $(1/2)C$ and its translates. Let $\mathcal B$ be the quotient boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb R)/I$. Because $C$ isn't covered by translates of $(1/2)C$, $[C]\ne 0$. The action of $G_1$ on $\mathbb R$ induces an action of $G_1$ on $\mathcal B$. Since $G_1$ is supramenable (i.e., doesn't have nonempty paradoxical subsets), it follows from a theorem of Mycielski ("Finitely additive invariant measures. I", Colloq. Math. 42 (1979), 309–318) that there is a finitely additive measure $\mu_1$ on $\mathcal B$ invariant under $G_1$ with $\mu_1([C])=1$. Let $\mu(A)=\mu_1([A])$ for $A\subseteq\mathbb R$. Then $\mu(C)=1$ and $\mu((1/2)C)=0$ and the answer to Question 1 is negative for $a=1/2$. This uses the Axiom of Choice. 

Consider the standard completed product measure $P$ on $\Omega=\{0,1\}^\omega$ corresponding to an i.i.d. sequence of fair coin-flips. Given $n\in\omega$, let $\rho_n$ be the bijection of $\Omega$ to itself given by flipping the value of the $n$th coordinate. Say that a subset $A$ of $\Omega$ has property $H$ iff there is an $n$ such that $\rho_n(A)\cap A=\varnothing$ and $\rho_n(A)\cup A=\Omega$. Assume AC. Question: What can we say about the existence of (countably-additive) extensions of $P$ that assign measure $1/2$ to all subsets with property $H$? Are there any? If so, are there any with nice invariance properties, like invariance under $\rho_n$ and/or under bijections of $\{0,1\}^\omega$ induced by permutations of $\omega$? Remarks: Intuitively, the probability of $A$, if $A$ has property $H$, should be $1/2$. This is true with respect to $P$ if $A$ is $P$-measurable. But given AC, there are $P$-nonmeasurable $A$ having $H$. Say that $\alpha\sim\beta$ iff one can get $\beta$ from $\alpha$ by applying an even number of the $\rho_n$. Given a $\sim$-equivalence class $U$, let $U' = \rho_1 U$. Now take a set $B$ of equivalence classes that contains exactly one member of $\{ U,U' \}$ for every $U$, and let $A$ be the union of the members of $B$. Then $A$ has $H$ with respect to every index $n$, and hence is non-measurable by Lévy's zero–one law. 

I believe the answer to your question is yes. The Reynolds operator $$ R: k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n] \longrightarrow k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n} $$ is $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n}$-equivariant, and therefore in particular $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n\times S_n}$-equivariant. Also, $R$ is a projection, and therefore the image of $R$ is a direct summand of of its domain of definition. It follows therefore that the $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n\times S_n}$-module $ k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n}$ is a direct summand of the free $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n\times S_n}$-module $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]$. Now since the action of $S_n\times S_n$ is generated by reflections, its invariant ring is a polynomial ring, and therefore any direct summand of a free module over this ring is again free (this is the Quillen–Suslin theorem). 

There really isn't any need for character theory over non-algebraically closed fields. The Grothendieck group of $KG$ embeds into the Grothendieck group of $\bar K G$ (i.e. of the group ring over the algebraic closure). Therefore all information about a $KG$-module $M$ you could possibly hope to recover from any type of "character of $M$" is already contained in the Brauer character of the $\bar K G$-module $\bar K \otimes M$. Also, the values of the Brauer character of $M$ will lie in the ring of Witt-vectors over $K$. 

Actually the answer seems to be in the paper of Wildon you linked. Right after Lemma 1.3.7. he shows that $Br_P$ coincides with the Green correspondence on indecomposable direct summands of $1\uparrow _P^G$ (which are exactly your modules $M_i$). Since Green corrensondence establishes a bijection between isomorphism classes of $kG$-modules with vertex $P$ and isomorphism classes of $kN_G(P)$-modules with vertex $P$, injectivity of $Br_P$ follows (surjectivity doesn't follow immediately from this argument, because we restricted the domain of definition of the Green correspondence to trivial source modules). 

Is it consistent with ZFC that there is a subset of $[0,1]$ whose cardinality is less than that of the continuum but which has positive Lebesgue measure? Obviously not given CH. And, given ZFC, there is such a subset iff there is a subset of full measure that has cardinality less than that of the continuum. Moreover, I think it follows from the consistency of ZFC with the non-existence of Sierpinski subsets of $[0,1]^2$ that it is consistent with ZFC that there is a subset of $[0,1]$ whose cardinality is less than that of the continuum and which has positive outer Lebesgue measure. 

I couldn't find anything in the literature either, but the answer to the first question is positive. Let $G$ be a group acting on a space $X$. Say that $G$'s action on $X$ has the invariant order-extension property provided that every $G$-invariant partial order on $X$ (i.e., partial order $\le$ such that $x\le y$ iff $gx\le gy$, for each $g\in G$) extends to a $G$-invariant linear order on $X$. I managed to show: Theorem. The following are equivalent for an abelian group $G$: 

The answer is positive, given Choice. It turns out that whenever $G$ is an abelian group acting on a set $X$, then there is a $G$-invariant preorder $\le$ on $2^X$ such that if $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, then $A<B$. The proof uses the fact that $G$-invariant partial orders on $\Omega$ extend to $G$-invariant linear orders, provided that $G$ is abelian and no element of $G$ has a finite orbit of length greater than one. While $2^X$ in general won't satisfy the orbit condition, one can instead take $\Omega$ to be a quotient of $2^X$ by the relation $A\sim B$ iff there is a $g\in G$ and $n\in\mathbb N$ such that $gB=A$ and $g^nB=B$. A writeup is here. 

Sorry in advance for responding to an old question, especially since this isn't even a solution. In my defence, this is my first post and I haven't seen anything in the FAQ for etiquette forbidding answering old posts? I've been thinking about very similar questions lately, and stumbled upon this post during a Google search for ways of solving the Beltrami equation. There is currently a construction (attributed to Gauss) detailed on the "Beltrami equation" Wikipedia entry for locally solving the Beltrami equation at a point (the default is $z=0$) when $\mu$ is (locally) expressible as a power series in $z$ and $\bar{z}$. I've tried the procedure but it hasn't quite produced a correct function, and this has prompted me to try to solve it myself. I believe that I have a working algorithm for finding general solutions to the Beltrami equation for a sufficiently nice $\mu$ - such as the one you've specified. Caveat: I realize that you're not simply wanting to solve the Beltrami equation, but would like to find the unique normalized solution $f$ such that $f$ is a homeomorphism of the upper half plane, but all that I'm able to furnish is an (explicit) family of solutions which probably contains the desired guy. I have no idea how you might be able to track down the unique normalized quasiconformal solution in this haystack. A pretty simple non-zero solution to the Beltrami equation for your specified coefficient is: $$f(z):=z-\frac{\epsilon}{2\pi i}\exp(-2\pi i\bar{z})+\frac{\epsilon}{2\pi i}.$$ Note that although $f:0\mapsto 0,1\mapsto1,\infty\mapsto\infty$ and is smooth, it doesn't satisfy that $f(\bar{z})=\bar{f(z)}$ and isn't the quasiconformal map we want. First observe that $f(z)$ satisfies the Beltrami equation over all of $\mathbb{C}$ (not just the upper half plane). Next observe that post-composing $f$ by a holomorphic function $\varphi(z)$ also results in a solution $\varphi\circ f(z)$ that also satisfies the Beltrami equation. Equivalently, any power series of $f$ is also a solution over its domain of convergence. Since $f(z)$ contains a $z$ term, it should be reasonably easy to show that any solution to the Beltrami equation defined at $z=0$ that's also expressible as a power series in $z$ and $\bar{z}$ will agree with some power series in $f(z)$ in a neighborhood around $z=0$. This results in a (countably) infinite dimensional family of solutions to the Beltrami equation, but it's not clear to me how one might be able to extract the quasiconformal solution. In fact, I'm not familiar enough with quasiconformal maps to know if the desired solution can be written as a power series in $z$ and $\bar{z}$ around $z=0$, although this is not, I feel, an unreasonable expectation. Being overly optimistic, I feel that the $f(z)$ above isn't a terrible approximation for the actual quasiconformal solution, especially if one simply wanted some growth-rate intuition. In particular, the approximation behaves best where the imaginary value of the input is large, which is somewhat unsurprising because the Beltrami coefficient is nearly $0$ when the imaginary part of $z$ is high, so the solution should be roughly the identity map around these parts - the identity function, of course, is the dominant term in $f(z)$ for $\mathrm{Im}(z)\gg0$. Just in case you want a way of constructing a solution to a given Beltrami equation that is "generative", in the sense that any other solution defined at $z=0$ should be a power series of this one, I believe that the following procedure should work: Step 1: We adopt the notation that the Beltrami coefficent $\mu(z)$ - which by assumption can be written as a power series in $z$ and $\bar{z}$, is written as $\mu(z,\bar{z})$. Then solve for $$\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}(z,w)=-\mu(w, F(z,w)),\; F(0,w)=w.$$ This is purely motivated by the aforementioned Wikipedia entry, although the order of the inputs for $\mu$ do differ from Wikipedia's. Step 2: Find $G(z,w)$ such that $G(z,F(z,w))=w$. That is, the functions $$(z,w)\mapsto (z,F(z,w))\text{ and }(z,w)\mapsto (z,G(z,w))$$ are inverse to each other. I'd be surprised if $G(z,w)$ always exists over the entire domain of $\mu$, but it should for "nice" examples of $\mu$ (It's existed for all the examples that I've checked by hand, perhaps something along the lines of $\mu$ being defined over a simply connected domain and expressible as a power series in $z$ and $\bar{z}$ might suffice)? Step 3: A "generative" solution is given by: $$f(z)=G(\bar{z},z).$$ Here's hoping that someone'll take this mess and figure out how to build the normalized quasiconformal map. =) 

I assume you are referring to page 78 here. I think the author is only implying that you may drop the condition of $A$ being an integral domain (in favor of it being a ring without nilpotent elements). You should still assume that $A$ is noetherian and local with maximal ideal $I$ (since in the formulation of the corollary left to the reader, the author still refers to the field $k=A/I$, which would be ambiguous otherwise; also there are conditions on $A$ and $I$ in place throughout the entire section which prohibit you from working with an arbitrary ring). So you can apply the criterion for flatness given in Corollary 4.4 to the $A/{\mathfrak p}$-module $M/{\mathfrak p} M$ for each minimal prime $\mathfrak p$ of $A$ (since $A/\mathfrak p$ will be an integral domain again). What you want to show then is that $M$ is flat as an $A$-module if and only if $M/{\mathfrak p}M$ is flat as an $A/{\mathfrak p}$-module for each minimal prime $\mathfrak p$. By the foregoing Corollary 4.3, this is the same as showing that $M$ is free if and only if $M/\mathfrak p M$ is free for any minimal prime $\mathfrak p$ (however, the "and only if"-part is trivial). Here is how I think the proof goes: Since $A$ is local, we may lift a $k$-basis of $k\otimes M$ to a minimal $A$-generating set of $M$ (by Nakayama's lemma). We get an exact sequence $$ A^i \stackrel{\varphi}{\longrightarrow} A^{dim_k k\otimes M} \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow 0 $$ for some $i\in\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$ and some $\varphi\in A^{dim_kk\otimes M \times i}$. If $\varphi$ is zero then $M$ is free. So assume $\varphi$ is not zero and $x$ is some non-zero entry of the matrix. Because $A$ has no nilpotent elements there is some minimal prime $\mathfrak p$ such that $x \notin \mathfrak p$. Now, by tensoring $$ (A/\mathfrak p)^i \stackrel{\varphi}{\longrightarrow} (A/\mathfrak p)^{dim_k k\otimes M} \longrightarrow M/\mathfrak p M \longrightarrow 0 $$ with the fraction field $K$ of $A/\mathfrak p$, we see that $dim_K K\otimes (M/\mathfrak p M) < dim_k k \otimes M= dim_k k\otimes (M/\mathfrak p M)$, i.e. $M/\mathfrak p M$ is not flat/free/projective by Corollary 4.4 (i.e., we have shown: $M$ not free $\Longrightarrow$ $M/\mathfrak p M$ not free for some minimal prime $\mathfrak p$).
