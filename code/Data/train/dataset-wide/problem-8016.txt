Let $X$ be a non-singular projective variety over a field $k$ (perhaps not of characteristic $2$), and let $\pi:Y\to X$ be a conic bundle over $X$ i.e. a proper morphism all of whose fibres are isomorphic to plane conics. Let $Z \subset X$ denote the discriminant locus, i.e. the closed subset of $X$ consisting of those point whose fibres are singular (this is a divisor on $X$). Finally let $U = X \setminus Z$. Then, $\pi$ restricts to give a smooth morphism over $U$, which locally for the étale topology is a trivial bundle of $\mathbb{P}^1$'s, hence we obtain an element $A \in H^1(U,PGL_2)$ associated to $X$. A standard argument using the exact sequence defining $PGL_2$ gives rise to an injective map $H^1(U,PGL_2) \to H^2(U,\mathbb{G}_m)=\mathrm{Br}~U$ by which we obtain an element of $\mathrm{Br}~U[2]$ (which by abuse of notation we also denote by $A$). For any discrete valutation $v$ of the function field $k(U)$, we have a residue map $$\mathrm{res}_v:\mathrm{Br}~U \to H^1(k(v),\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}).$$ My first question is about how the geometric properties of $\pi$ are related to the algebraic properties of $A$. 

Yes. First if there are no solutions in $\mathbb{R}$ or in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for some prime $p$, then there are no solutions in $\mathbb{Z}$. This condition is not sufficient in general; there could be a Brauer-Manin obstruction to the Hasse principle. For more about the Brauer-Manin obstruction for integral solutions to quadratic equations, see: $URL$ 

I'll upgrade my comment to an answer. Any finite Galois extension of $\mathbb{Q}_l$ of degree coprime to $l$ is tamely ramified. In particular, its Galois group is an extension of two cyclic groups. This means that your specific $G$ is not realisable as a Galois group when $l \neq 2$. However, your specific group $G$ is in fact realisable over $\mathbb{Q}_2$. This is the Galois group of the splitting field the polynomial $$x^8 - 6.$$ There are a few ways to see this, and I leave most of the details to you (this can all be easily checked in sage or magma). First considering this polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$, it should be hopefully clear that the Galois group of the Galois closure $K$ is $G$ - the cyclic group of order $8$ corresponds to the radical extension $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[8]{6})$ and the Klein four group comes from the $8$th roots of unity acting in the way you want. There is a unique prime ideal of $K$ above $2$, hence we see that the decomposition group at $2$ is equal to $G$. Taking the completion of $K$ at this prime ideal then yields a $\mathbb{Q}_2$-extension of the required form. This construction works for many polynomials of the form $x^8 - n$, but one has to be careful. E.g. one does not obtain the required Galois group when $n=2$ or $n=14$. I'll let you have fun thinking about why this is. 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be regular integral Noetherian schemes. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are smooth and proper over a base scheme $S=Spec R$, where $R$ is a discrete valuation ring. If $X$ and $Y$ have isomorphic generic fibres, is it also the case that their special fibres are isomorphic? Remarks: 

Suppose two such disks Σ1 and Σ2 exist, and pull back TΣ2 to Σ1 by some homeomorphism. Viewed as a subbundle of TR3|Σ1, this plane bundle intersects TΣ1 in a line bundle L over Σ1 since no two tangent planes are parallel. Furthermore, L|∂Σ1 is exactly the bundle of lines tangent to ∂Σ1. Since a line bundle over a disk is trivial, we can take a nonzero section of L, and thus we get a nonvanishing vector field on the disk Σ1 which is tangent to the boundary at every point of ∂Σ1. But then by doubling we can construct a nonvanishing vector field on S2, and this is impossible. 

If $A$ is a Seifert matrix for $K$ and $\omega \in \mathbb{C}$ has norm 1, then the Tristram-Levine signature $\sigma_\omega(K)$ is the signature of the matrix $(1-\omega)A + (1-\bar{\omega})A^T = (1-\bar{\omega})(A^T - \omega A),$ which jumps when some eigenvalue of $A^T - \omega A$ crosses zero (i.e. changes sign). At these values of $\omega$ the product of the eigenvalues, which is $\det(A^T-\omega A) = \Delta_K(\omega)$, must therefore be zero. 

I don't have anything close to a complete answer, but for many $tb$-maximizing knots we can get some obstructions from Legendrian contact homology. The generators for the DGA $A(K)$ associated to a given front diagram (as described by Ng) are right cusps, which have grading 1, and crossings, whose grading is the difference in Maslov potentials of the two strands through a crossing, so if the Maslov potential is valued in {0,1} then every generator has grading 0 or ±1. In particular, any 2-graded normal ruling of the front is actually just a graded normal ruling, and vice versa. The classical invariants of $K$ satisfy the HOMFLY-PT bound $tb(K)+|r(K)| \leq -\deg_a P_K(a,z) - 1$, and Rutherford showed that $K$ has a 2-graded normal ruling if and only if $K$ achieves equality and $r(K)=0$. Thus if $K$ achieves the bound with $r(K)=0$ and $K$ has a {0,1} Maslov potential, we see that $K$ actually has a graded normal ruling. A theorem of Fuchs now says that $A(K)$ has an augmentation, so we can compute the linearized contact homology of $K$, which is generated over $\mathbb{Z}/2$ by crossings and right cusps whose gradings are bounded as above. In particular, if $K$ has a {0,1} Maslov potential and $tb(K) = -\deg_a P_K(a,z)-1$ then $A(K)$ must have augmentations, and the linearized homology for any augmentation has to be supported entirely in degrees -1,0,1. We can use this on some examples in the Legendrian knot atlas as follows. The first $m(5_2)$ knot has linearized contact homology in degree 2, so it can't have a {0,1} Maslov potential, whereas the second $m(5_2)$ clearly does. The second $m(9_{45})$ knot has two different linearized contact homologies, and one of them is supported in degrees -1,0,1 but the other isn't, so it can't have a {0,1} Maslov potential either. Finally, the first three $7_4$ knots achieve the HOMFLY-PT bound ($tb=1$) but don't have any linearized contact homology, so they can't have {0,1} Maslov potentials while the fourth $7_4$ does. 

Let $$X: \quad Q_1(x)=Q_2(x) = 0 \quad \subset \mathbb{P}^{2n+1},$$ be a smooth complete intersection of two quadrics of odd dimension over a field $k$, not of characteristic $2$. Let $J(X)$ denote the intermediate Jacobian of $X$. When $k$ is algebraically closed, I know that $J(X)$ is isomorphic to the Jacobian of the hyperelliptic curve $$y^2 = \mathrm{det}(xQ_1 + Q_2). \quad (*)$$ 

Interesting question. But, alas, the answer is no. The issue is that you have missed an extra non-rationality criterion. Namely, it is possible that such a surface $X$ has $\mathrm{Br}(X) = \mathrm{Br}(k)$, yet we have $\mathrm{Br}(X_K) \neq \mathrm{Br}(K)$ for some finite extension $K/k$. Problems of this type for cubic surfaces over finite fields are considered in the PhD thesis of Shuijing Li: $URL$ Though she only works over finite fields, the analysis for surfaces over number fields with a cyclic splitting field is more-or-less identical. Here is how the counter-example goes. Take your DP4 $X$ and blow it up in a rational point not on a line to obtain a cubic surface $S$. We then choose this surface so that it has conjugacy class $C_7$ in the notation of Manin's table (p176 of his book); such a surface exists over $\mathbb{Q}$ by the recent resolution of the inverse Galois problem for cubic surfaces by Elsenhans and Jahnel. Its splitting field is cyclic of order $6$. You see from the table that the Brauer group of $S$ is constant. However this surface is non-rational. This is because the Brauer group (modulo constants) becomes $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^2$ after a cubic extension, as it becomes the class $C_3$ from Manin's table. I don't know whether this more general "extra non-rationality criterion" I mention is sufficient over number fields. That it is sufficient over finite fields is proven in Theorem 5.3.7 in Li's thesis. To approach this general problem over number fields, I guess one could just enumerate all conjugacy classes of subgroups of the appropriate Weyl group in magma, and study which Brauer groups arise as well as the configurations of lines, and use the non-rationality criterion given in Theorem 5.3.1 in Li. 

Recall that a divisor is called pseudo-effective if it lies in the closure of the cone of effective divisors. 

Edit: This answer addresses an earlier version of the question, where the OP asked whether or not BSD made sense for elliptic curves over finite fields. It also however answers the current question. The Birch and Swinnerton-dyer conjecture for an elliptic curve over a number field relates the rank of the Mordell-Weil group to the L-function of the curve. To have a "BSD" over other fields, one needs an analogue of these objects. The appropriate positive characteristic analogue of BSD is for elliptic curves over function fields of curves (the other "global fields"). This is known in some cases, but not in full generality. In fact it is known that BSD for an elliptic curve over a function field is equivalent to the finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group of the curve. However, if you have an elliptic curve $E$ over a finite field $k$ and a function field $K$ of a curve in positive characteristic, then by base change you may consider $E_K$ as a "constant" curve over $K$. In which case I do believe that BSD is known, but hopefully someone else can help me with a precise reference as I cannot remember it.
