Details: Let's consider the condition that $\langle h_{\lambda_1} \ast \cdots \ast h_{\lambda_k}, e_n \rangle = 1$. As is well known, $h_{\lambda_1} \ast \cdots \ast h_{\lambda_k}$ expands positively in the $h$'s, and the coefficient of $h_{\mu}$ is the number of $k$-dimensional tables of nonnegative integers where summing up the $k-1$ dimensional slices gives the partitions $\lambda_1$, ..., $\lambda_k$ and just listing all the entries in sorted order gives $\mu$. (We pad partitions with infinitely many zeroes at the end.) Also, $\langle h_{\mu}, e_{n} \rangle$ is $0$ unless $\mu = 1^n$, in which case it is $1$. So you are counting $k$-tuples of partitions $(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_k)$ such that there is a unique way to fill a $k$-dimensional table with $0$'s and $1$'s so that the $(k-1)$-dimensional slices total $(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_k)$. Let $T$ be a $k \times k$ array of $0$'s and $1$'s, and let $\sigma(T) = (\sigma_1(T), \ldots, \sigma_k(T))$ be its sums along slices. I'll call $T$ "ordered" if each of the $\sigma_j(T)$ is a partition. I'll call $T$ an "ideal" if the set of $1$'s of $T$ is an order ideal. And I'll call $T$ "singleton" if no other $T'$ has $\sigma(T) = \sigma(T')$. It is clear that, if $T$ is an ideal, then $T$ is ordered. Your conjecture is that the number of $(k,n)$ ideals is equal to the number of $(k,n)$ ordered singletons. Here are the true statements: Claim 1 Every ordered singleton is an ideal. Proof Suppose that $T$ is ordered, but not an ideal. Then there must be some $(i_1, \ldots, i_k)$ and some index $j$ for which $T(i_1, \ldots, i_k)=1$ but $T(i_1, \ldots, i_j-1, \ldots, i_k)=0$. Since $\sigma_j(T)_{i_j} \leq \sigma_j(T)_{i_j-1}$, there must be some other $(i'_1, \ldots, i'_k)$ with $i_j=i'_j$, $T(i'_1, \ldots, i'_k)=0$ but $T(i'_1, \ldots, i'_j-1, \ldots, i'_k)=1$. But then define $T'$ by switching the values of $T$ in these $4$ places, and $\sigma(T) = \sigma(T')$, a contradiction. $\square$ Claim 2 There are ideals of type $(3,13)$ which are not singleton. Proof Let $I$ be the order ideal which contains the $10$ triples $(i_1, i_2, i_3)$ with $i_1+i_2+i_3 \leq 2$ and also $\{ (2,1,0), (1,0,2), (0,2,1) \}$. Let $I'$ be the same with $\{ (0,1,2), (1,2,0), (2,0,1) \}$. Let $T$ and $T'$ be the corresponding indicator functions. Then $\sigma(T) = \sigma(T') = (7,4,2)^3$. $\square$ 

This is basically a comment, but I don't want it to get lost in the conversation about defining the question: The Godemont resolution of a sheaf (of abelian groups, on any topological space) can be defined without making any choices. If you define sheaf cohomology groups as the cohomology of the Godemont resolution, I would guess that you can prove whatever you consider to be the primary results about them without use of choice. 

What if you take $5$ paths with $k$ vertices each and glue them together at the endpoints? So $5(k-2)+2=5k-7$ vertices in all, and circumference $2(k-1)=2k-2$. 

I worry that the other answers may be giving too much detail. What is going on is that there are linear relations between the classes of the lines so that, although they are 27 lines in the cubic surface, the lattice they span in H^2 only has dimension 7. If you want to know exactly how these 27 vectors sit in a 7 dimensional vector space, read Emerton's answer. 

Tom Church's answer is correct for $M$ compact. Here is a counter-example for $M$ not compact: The cotangent bundle $T^* S$ has the tautological symplectic structure: At a point of $T^* S$ lying over $x \in S$, the tangent space to $T^* S$ is naturally isomorphic to $T_x S \oplus (T_x S)^*$. Take the natural pairing between the first facts and the second factor and skew symmetrize it to get a symplectic structure on $T^* S$. Now, look at $T^* S \times \mathbb{R}^2$ with the standard symplectic structure on $\mathbb{R}^2$. So this is a symplectic manifold. But the cotangent bundle to $S$ is stably trivial: $T^* S \times \mathbb{R} \cong S \times \mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$. So $T^* S \times \mathbb{R}^2 \cong S \times \mathbb{R}^{2n+2}$ and there is a symplectic structure on $S \times \mathbb{R}^{2n+2}$. 

The answer is all line segments of the form $p_1 + p_2 + e$ where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are vertices of the hexagon and $e$ is an edge. More carefully, I can prove that the singular locus is contained in this set, and I expect equality. Here is a picture. 

Your first condition implies that $r$ is the order of $p$ modulo $q$. If the order of $1-t$ is $q$, then $p$ divides $$ \prod_{i=1}^{p-1} \prod_{j=1}^{p-1} (1 - \zeta^i - \zeta^j) \quad (*)$$ where $\zeta$ is a primitive $p$-th root of unity. If these two conditions are satisfied, we can find $t$ with the required properties. Proofs: First, suppose that $t$ obeys your first condition. Let $f$ be the characteristic polynomial of $t$. If $f$ factored as $gh$, and $v$ were in the kernel of $g(t)$, then $\mathrm{Span} (t^i v)$ has dimension at most $\deg g$, contradicting your hypothesis. So $f$ is irreducible. In particular, $f$ divides $x^{p^r}-x$ and so $q | p^r-1$. Also, if $f$ divided $x^{p^s} - x$ for some $s<r$, then $f$ has a nontrivial factor of degree $\leq s$, contradicting that $f$ is irreducible. So $r$ is the order of $p$ modulo $q$. Now, suppose that $1-t$ has order $q$. Let $\Phi_q(x) = (x^q-1)/(x-1)$. Then $f(x) | \Phi_q(x)$ and $f(1-x) | \Phi_q(x)$ as well. So $f$ divides $\mathrm{GCD}(\Phi_q(x), \Phi_q(1-x))$. In particular, the resultant of $\Phi_q(x)$ and $\Phi_q(1-x)$ is zero modulo $p$. The product $(*)$ is precisely that resultant. Finally, we must reverse the argument. Suppose that $p$ divides $(*)$. So there is an irreducible polynomial $f$ dividing $\Phi_q(x)$ and $\Phi_q(1-x)$. Let $s = \deg f$. Let $V$ be the field $\mathbb{F}_{p^s}$ and let $t$ be the action of a root of $f$ on $V$. Then $t$ obeys condition 1. (If not, $\mathrm{Span} (t^i v)$ is a $t$-stable subspace of $V$, contradicting that $f$ is irreducible.) By the first paragraph of the proof, this shows that $s$ is the order of $p$ modulo $q$, so $s=r$ and we have constructed the desired $t$. 

I'll put down what I figured out. Example 2.4 of Schiffman's Lectures on Hall Algebras tells how to multiply by the partition $1^r$. It is a generalization of the Pieri rule. If we set $p=1$, there is a symmetry of the ring of symmetric polynomials which sends a partition to its transpose, so we can just transpose this formula. But I don't know if there is an analogous symmetry for Hall polynomials. (The ring of Hall polynomials has an antipode, which morally should do this, but I couldn't find a statement of whether it does in a quick search.) The formula for multiplying by $1^r$ also appears as Lemma 2.4 in this paper. According to this, the formula occurs on page 341 of Macdonald's book. I don't have the book available, but if I did I would look there to see whether the transpose formula also occurs. Finally, I share your intuition that this computation should be doable by hand. If I were you, I'd look at Schifman's proof and see if I could adapt it. 

The point of this answer is simply to repeat Scott's answer in a more visible place. If he wants to post it himself, I'll delete my post: Let $a_i$ be the sequence of these integers, sorted into order. Let $a_r \leq N < a_{r+1}$. We want to estimate $$\frac{1}{r-1} \sum (a_{i+1} - a_i) = (a_r-a_1)/(r-1).$$ As Scott explains, $$r=(1/2) \cdot (\log N/\log 2 + O(1)) \cdot (\log N/\log 3 + O(1)) = (\log N)^2/(2 \log 2 \log 3) + O(\log N) .$$ Also, there is clearly a power of $2$ between $N$ and $N/2$, so $a_r \sim N$. So the average distance is $\sim N/(\log N)^2$. If you work harder, you can probably tighten up the bounds to show that it is $N (2 \log 2 \log 3)/(\log N)^2 (1+O(1/\log N))$ 

Yes, if a collection of colinearity conditions is realizable, then they are realizable using only 3 distinct points. Suppose that $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a collection of points realizing your colinearity conditions, and not all on a line. Choose two unequal points $x_i$ and $x_j$, and let $\overline{x_i x_j}$ be the line through them. Take $B_1$ to be the set of $x_k$ which are equal to $x_i$ (same point in $\mathbb{R}^2$); take $B_2$ to be the set of $x_k$ which are on the line $\overline{x_i x_j}$ but not in $B_1$ and take $B_3$ to be everything else. If a colinearity condition met all three of $(B_1, B_2, B_3)$, then this would correspond to a line which met $\overline{x_i x_j}$ at $x_i$ and another point, and also passed through a point not on $\overline{x_i x_j}$. Obviously, this works for configurations in $\mathbb{R}^{k-1}$ just as well: Choose points $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_k$ with no linear relations between them, and let $B_d$ be the points which are in the affine linear span of $(x_1, \ldots, x_d)$ but not of $(x_1, \ldots, x_{d-1})$.
