It is a reasonable interpretation to think about a black hole as being a void with an infinitely small singularity in which lays all the mass, momentum and charge. In this sense, a black hole is empty, except for the region not described by the space-time framework (and that is not subject to the Einstein equations). So it is correct to think that black holes are only distorted region of space-time. The space-time is distorted so that going from the infinity (where there is no mass and no spin) you can reach the singularity continuously. If you fall onto a rotating black-hole, you will end up with the same spin as the black hole once you hit the singularity, (almost) regardless of how much spin you had initially. Schwarzschild black holes force you to fall inward once you cross the 'horizon' of the black hole, regardless of how much acceleration you can produce. Kerr black holes have the same horizon, as well as a so-called 'ergosphere'. This 'sphere' is a region of space where everything including light is forced to rotate in the direction of the spin of the black-hole. In the case of the Earth, you cannot directly use the Kerr solution to approximate the rotating Earth (as stated previously, this is a solution of the equations in void) how much drag you will have, but this gives you the correct idea, as stated by @James K. 

Most of the galaxies are believed to host a super massive black hole. The black hole in return has a dramatic impact on the evolution of the galaxy, an effect usually called "AGN feedback". Quoting W. Ishibashi, A. C. Fabian: 

set some initial conditions to your problem: initial position $\vec{x_p}$ of the planet and $\vec{x_\star}$ of the star and initial velocities $\vec{v_p}$ and $\vec{v_\star}$. compute the force $\vec{F}$ of the star on the planet and the accelerations of the planet and the star: $$ -M_\star \vec{a_\star} = M_p \vec{a_p} = \vec{F_{\star\rightarrow p}}$$ update the speed of the planet and the star using the respective acceleration: $$ \vec{v}(t+\Delta t) = \vec{v}(t) + \Delta t\times \vec{a} $$ update the positions of the planet and the star using their respective velocity: $$ \vec{x}(t+\Delta t) = \vec{x}(t) + \Delta t\times \vec{v} $$ recompute the distance between the planet and the star $\vec{r_{{\star\rightarrow p}}} = \vec{x_p} - \vec{x_\star}$ and go back to 2. 

In general relativity, then notion of space and time is local. As underlined in the OP, it means that at a radius $r$ of a star of mass $M$, time will run at $$\sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}}$$ the rate at an infinite distance of the object. For example imagine that $1-2GM/rc^2 = 1/4$, so that at a distance $r$, time runs at half the rate compare to an observer at infinity. If you are initially with an observer at infinity, you travel to $r$ (we neglect the time distortion during the travel), stay here an hour and then go back. When you'll reach the observer once again, your local clock will be one hour late, because 1 hour at $r$ will have passed in two hours at $r=\infty$. So this distortion of space and time is only local. A massive object, like a star is only impacting in its neighborhood space and time. A distant observer is not impacted by the distortion, so that time and distances are unaffected. To answer your question, an observer far away (for example on Earth) measuring by some meaning the speed of the two stars will actually see $c/2$ for both of them. 

To start with, a (non rotating) black hole and a star of the same mass creates the same gravitational potential when you are far away enough. Since we observe planets at $0.05\mathrm{AU}$ around stars of about the same mass as the sun, I think you can expect planets in this region around a similar mass black hole, according to stability criterion. Moreover, the smallest black holes you can physically create have masses of about $3-4 M_\odot$. There are multiple issues here though. First is how do you physically bring the planet that close to the black hole? I see two possibilities. Either the planet formed directly in the accretion disk of the black hole, and staid there, or the planet formed further away (say around the binary star system) and was captured by the black hole. If you assume that at $0.05\mathrm{AU}$, the accretion disk of the black hole is not that different than the accretion disk around a protostar at early ages, then you can maybe create a planet there (I can think of a few scenario that would prevent it, but it would require a more important study). If the planet formed further away in the disk or in the binary system, it is possible to make it migrate inward. This is actually called ex-situ formation in planetary systems. If you imagine that the planet is tidally locked (you can try fiddling around with the formula $t_{\text{lock}} \approx \frac{\omega a^6 I Q}{3 G m_p^2 k_2 R^5}$ from wikipedia that gives the timescale for the planet to become tidally locked to get an estimate of how long it would take) and that there is no accretion disk anymore, I guess you could manage to make the system stable. The final question is then to get the whole system stable on a large. Even though it may extremely unlikely, I think there has to be some stable orbits in the system using 3 body resonance, but this is not my field of expertise. having one or two stars is not making a huge difference, between the flux received from them and the gravitational pull are both in $1/r^2$, so that two stars at 1.4AU give the same flux and the same mean gravitational pull than one star at 1AU. The only difference is in the stability of the system. To conclude, I guess that the system is very unlikely to exist. Yet if you manage to find a planet there, you'd require to have life: 

Black holes are solutions of the Einstein equations, the fundamental equations of Einstein's relativity, that link together space-curvature to density of matter and energy. The black holes solutions are found in the void, when you let a single point of the space-time be singular (the 'center of the black hole'). If you further assume that the black hole is static, you find three solutions: 

You have to assume a characteristic mass for the stars in the cluster. Usually, to get an approximate I go with stars of mass $1 M_\odot$. Then, given the density of $10^6\ M_\odot.\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ you have a density of stars of $\rho_\star = 10^6\ \mathrm{pc}^{-3}$. In a box of $1\ \mathrm{pc}^{3}$, you have $10^6$ stars, so the characteristic distance between stars is simply given by the density of stars to the minus one third: $$ d_\mathrm{carac} = \rho_\star^{-1/3} \approx 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{pc} \approx 2000\ \mathrm{AU}.$$ Addendum: if you want to do a more correct calculation, you should take into account the different masses of stars to estimate the correct number of stars, using for example a Chabrier initial mass function and try to get the mass function at the age of the cluster. Because of the fact that stars of about $\geq 1 M_\odot$ reach their red giant branch and lose much of their material in less than the age of the cluster, it will decrease the mean star mass of the cluster to something between $0.1$ and $0.8 M_\odot$ ($0.3 M_\odot$ according to Rob Jeffries). However it won't change the order of magnitude of the mean distance between stars. 

The fact that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light is not an assumption, but is derived from the assumption that nothing travels faster than light. In General Relativity, you build a metric, which is a tool to be able to measure and locate events in space and time. Building this metric puts constrains on the speed of information, and a basic assumption is that this speed is at most $c$ and is equal to $c$ if the information carrier is mass-less (photons for example). Gravity waves are small non-static perturbation of this metric in the void. So they are propagating information without any mass and travel at $c$. Of course, this is a physical approach to your question, answering it correctly would involve much harder calculations to perturb the metric, obtain the propagation equation and study the speed of the waves. This is for example explained in the wikipedia article in the linear section. I can think about an example (correct me if I'm wrong). Think about a massive object collapsing into a black hole. This is an extremely energetic process, if light was able to get out of the forming black hole, you would see it shining like a extremely bright supernova. To my knowledge there is no evidence of that. More theoretically, I think that the assumption that light travels faster than gravity is incompatible with the cosmic censorship hypothesis, 

The easiest approach is to do a numerical integration of the equation of motion of your system. For that you need to remember that the gravitational force of $a$ on $b$ is $$\vec{F}_{a\rightarrow b} = -G\frac{M_a M_b}{r_{a\rightarrow b}^{3}} \vec{{r_{a\rightarrow b}}}$$ where $\vec{{r_{a\rightarrow b}}} = \vec{x_b} - \vec{x_a}$ and that $$ M\vec{a} = \sum \vec{F}$$ where $M$ is the mass of your object, $\sum\vec{F}$ is the sum of the forces applied to the object and $\vec{a}$ is the acceleration. To do the simulation, you then have to follow this numerical scheme 

the accretion disk of the black hole has to be cleared the planet should be tidally locked to the black hole to be protected from the radiations the planet should be trapped in a very unlikely stable orbit so that it doesn't travel around in the system AND it has time to get tidally locked to the black hole 

To distinguish galaxies from stars, you can use the spectrum. Roughly, stars have a black-body like spectrum with features depending on the absorption and emission on the line of sight and in the chromosphere of the star. Galaxies on the other hand of a spectrum that is the composite of tons of stars. The spectrum will for example be much wider (ranging from smaller to larger wavelengths) because of the diversity in the spectra of stars. Take a look at $URL$ if you want a quick overview of the differences. I don't have a precise number about the number of galaxies we see as point source, but the answer varies greatly from one instrument to another one. If you try to observe a galaxy using radiotelescopes in interferometry, you can resolve much better scales than an Earth-based small visible telescope, etc… 

the Schwarzschild solution, this is a non-rotating non-charged black hole, which is entirely described by its mass M ; the Kerr solution, this is a rotating non-charged black hole, entirely described by its mass and spin (how fast it rotates) ; the Kerr-Newmann solution, describing a rotating charged black hole, entirely described by its mass, spin and charge. 

There's already good answer provided, but it is worth noting that the rotation rate of a planet is ill defined, as many planets are unlikely to be uniformly rotating. For example, Hot Jupiters present zonal flows, so should the rotation rate of the planet be measured taking into account the flows or not? We don't even know if there's a solid core in gas giants, so the question of the rotation rate should be 'is there a way to measure the rotation rate profile of a planet' and the answer is yes, but it's really hard. This is for example one of the long-term objectives of the Juno Mission. By measuring the pressure, density and composition of the atmosphere at different radius, you can try to stick a general circulation model that would give you the local speed hence the rotation rate. Of course, the picture is made harder when you consider magnetic fields. 

The topic of understanding how the supermassive black hole form in the first place, evolve and interact with their galaxy is still in debate among the scientific community, so it is impossible to fully answer your question yet. 

You can use Kepler's third law to get the length of a year $$\frac{P^2}{a^3} = \frac{4 \pi^2}{G(M+m)},$$ where $P$ is the period of rotation, $a$ is the distance between the planet and the star, $M$ is the mass of the star, $m$ is the mass of the planet and $G$ is the universal gravity constant. As the mass of Venus is roughly the same as the Earth's ($M_V = 0.815M_\oplus$), you will get something close but a bit larger than 365 days. If you want the length of a day on this planet, you need more information as the rotation rate of the planet which gives the length of a day cannot be constrained easily. For example on Earth, one day is 24 hours today, and the length of a day circa 620 million years ago has been estimated from rhythmites (alternating layers in sandstone) as having been about 21.9 hours. The origin of the evolution of the length of a day is the tidal interactions between Earth and the Moon (as well as to a smaller extent with the Sun) , an effect known as tidal acceleration (or in this case, deceleration). This is also the reason why we only see one side of the moon: it is tidally locked to the Earth so that the Moon revolves around the Earth in exactly one moon day. In the very far future, the Earth will revolve around the Moon in exactly one 'future' day, so that one day will last 27.7 present days! Finally, the initial rotation rate of the planet at its formation is largely unconstrained so that even though you give us a planet's mass and age and the properties of its orbit and its star, it will still be impossible to answer your question entirely.
