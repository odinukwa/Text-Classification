Let $B(n,p)$ be a binomial distribution, where $p$ is fixed. Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be fixed and "small". I need a lower bound for the tail probability of this distribution, at distance $\varepsilon n$. It seems to me that for a random variable having this distribution one should essentially have $$ P ( |X-np| \geq \varepsilon n) \gg e^{-\sigma^2 \varepsilon^2 n/2}, $$ where $\sigma^2$ is the variance. Can someone give me a reference for such an inequality? (I suppose one could show this using heavy machinery, such as Kullback-Liebler distance etc., but it should be a simple and basic fact. Anyway, I have not found a reference. Thanks for your help.) 

In metric Diophantine approximation you are often interested in finding conditions on $(\phi(q))_{q \geq 1}$ which guarantee that $$ \left| \alpha - \frac{p}{q} \right| < \frac{\phi(q)}{q} $$ has infinitely many integer solutions p,q for almost all $\alpha$. (Often you also assume that $p$ and $q$ must be coprime, but this is not the point in my question). A problem of this type is for example the famous (unsolved) Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture, see $URL$ The problem can also be written in the following form: Let $A_1, A_2, \dots$ be intervals on the torus (of length $\leq 1$), which are symmetric around 0. Let $\psi_1, \psi_2, \dots$ denote the Lebesgue measure (that is, the length) of these intervals. Under which conditions on $\psi_1, \psi_2, \dots$ do we have $$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathbf{1}_{A_n} (n \alpha) = \infty $$ for almost all $\alpha$ (here $\mathbf{1}_A$ is the indicator function of $A$. Also, everything is understood to take place on the torus, so the indicators are extended with period 1.) Now you may generalize the situation in a first step to the case when the intervals $A_1, A_2, \dots$ are not necessarily symmetric around $0$. Then you get a problem in inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation. This type of question is also quite well-investigated. Now my question is the following: what happens is if don't assume that $A_1, A_2, \dots$ are intervals, but if they may denote any measurable sets in $[0,1]$. Again, write $\psi_1, \psi_2, \dots$ for the measure of these sets. Under which conditions on $\psi_1, \psi_2, \dots$ do we have $$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathbf{1}_{A_n} (n \alpha) = \infty $$ for almost all $\alpha$? Are there any sufficient conditions? (Note that a necessary condition is the divergence of the sum of the measures, by Borel-Cantelli). Does it help if the sequence $(\psi_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is monotonic? Are there any known results at all about this general problem? (Remark: This question is distantly related to Khintchin's conjecture, which was disproved by Marstrand in 1970. See $URL$ (Remark 2: The sequence $(n \alpha)_{n \geq 1}$ mod 1 has an interpretation in terms of ergodic theory, but I don't think that this will help here.) 

Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{A},P)$ be a probability space, and let $(\mathcal{F}_k)_{k \geq 1}$ be a filtration which converges to $\mathcal{A}$. I suppose it is true that $$ E \left( \big(E \left( X | \mathcal{F}_k \right) \big)^2 \right) \to E \left(X^2 \right). $$ How to prove this? I guess one will need Jensen's inequality and a convergence theorem for submartingales, but cannot find the right reference (I am working on number theory, not probability). (If you know an answer, please also provide a citable reference.) 

Let $A$ be a set of $N$ distinct positive integers. For every integer $n$, write $rep(n)$ for the number of representations of $n$ as a difference of two elements of $A$. Then the additive energy of $A$ is given by $\sum_n rep(n)^2$. Assume that the additive energy is large (between $N^3/(\log N)$ and $N^3$, say). Examples for this would be the sets $$ \{1, \dots, N\} $$ or $$ \{k, 2k, \dots, Nk\} $$ or $$ \{k+1, k+2, \dots, k+N\} $$ for some positive integer $k$, or randomly (in a suitable way) constructed subsets of a segment of the positive integers. Now in all these examples, the set of those number $n$ for which $rep(n)$ is large (in other words, those numbers which make the essential contribution to the additive energy) has a very strong structure (it is an interval, or consists of a fixed integer multiple of all integers in an interval). This seems to be necessary - for example, it seems that for the sets $\{n: ~rep(n) \geq N/100\}$ or $\{n: ~rep(n) \geq N/\sqrt{\log N}\}$ one cannot get any arbitrary subset of $\mathbb{N}$, but only sets which have a very strong ("interval-like" or "self-similar") structure. Is there any theory for this? 

Assume that $N=2^k$, and let $\{n_1, \dots, n_N\}$ denote the set of square-free positive integers which are generated by the first $k$ primes, sorted in increasing order. Question: what is a good lower bound for $$ \min_{1 \leq \ell_1 < \ell_2 \leq N} ~ \frac{n_{\ell_2}}{n_{\ell_1}}. $$ Remark 1: Since by assumption $n_{\ell_2} > n_{\ell_1}$ for $\ell_2 > \ell_1$, a trivial lower bound is 1. Remark 2: By the prime number theorem, the largest number $n_N$ is of size roughly $e^{c k \log k}$ for some $c$. Thus an obvious lower bound is something like $$ \frac{e^{c k \log k}}{e^{c k \log k} -1} \approx 1 + \frac{1}{e^{c k \log k}}. $$ The questions is if an essential improvement of this simple lower bound is possible. In particular, it would be nice to get a lower bound of size roughly $$ 1 + \frac{1}{e^{c k}}. $$ (All constants $c$ in these statements are generic positive numbers, their specific values are not of interest for me. Also, I don't care about small values of $k$ or $N$, but about an asymptotic result.) Edit: It would already be very helpful to know that 1% (or any other fixed percentage) of all possible quotients of consecutive numbers $n_{\ell+1}/n_\ell$ satisfy the desired lower bound. 

It is well-known that the Riemann zeta function can be approximated in the critical strip by a finite Dirichlet polynomial. More precisely, $$ \zeta(\sigma+it) = \sum_{n \leq X} n^{-\sigma-it} + \frac{X^{1-\sigma-it}}{\sigma+it-1} + O ( X^{-\sigma}) $$ uniformly for all $X$ satisfying $2 \pi X / C \geq |t|$, where $C$ is a fixed constant greater than 1. (This is Theorem 4.11 in Titchmarsh's book). In particular this holds for $\sigma = 1/2$. Question: is there a similar (simple) approximation of zeta by a finite Euler product? 

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of schemes (or algebraic spaces), and $s:Y\rightarrow X$ is a section to $f$, i.e. $fs=1_{Y}$. Question: Is $s$ an (closed) immersion? 

Is an algebraic space over a DVR, whose special fibre (and all its infinitesimal neighborhood) and generic fibre are schemes, actually a scheme? 

I am interested in the following example! Let $k$ be a field, let $X_0$ be the scheme $\mathrm{Spec}R$ with $R_0=k[x,y]/(xy)$, let $R$ be the strict Hensilian localalisation of $R_0$ at the origin and $X=\mathrm{Spec}R$, we define a sheaf $F$ on $X$ by $F(U)=\mathbb{Z}^2$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ for $U$ open in $X$ depending on if $U$ contains the origin or not (hence the stalk of $F$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$ at the origin, and $\mathbb{Z}$ at other points). The restriction maps for defining $F$ are given by $\mathbb{Z}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}:(m,n)\mapsto m+n$ (in fact the sheaf comes from the log structure associated to the embedding $X_0\subset \mathbb{A}^2$ ). Since $X$ is strict Hensilian, we have $H^1(X,F)=0$. Now consider the projection $p:\mathbb{G}_{m,R}\rightarrow X=\mathrm{Spec}R$. What would be the group $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},p^*F)$? Maybe an easier version, is $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},\mathbb{Z})$ zero? We do know $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m},\mathbb{Z})=H^1(\mathrm{Spec}R,\mathbb{Z})=0$! 

The group cohomology of cyclic groups can be computed easily due to the periodity. Now how can one compute the group cohomology $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? As least in some special case, e.g. $M$ has trivial action, or even $M=\mathbb{Z}$? I would like to know the case that $M$ is not $\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, can one compute $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times\cdots\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? 

How to determine a functor (natrually arising from geometry or homological algebra) to be locally of finite presentation? Is there any reference for such staff? My example of functors underlying this question is functors of the form $$\mathcal{E}xt^1_S(A,\mathbb{G}_m)$$ for $A$ some group scheme or even some fppf-sheaf of geometric meaning over some base scheme $S$, and $\mathcal{E}xt^1_S(,)$ denotes the 1st fppf extension sheaf in the category of abelian fppf-sheaves over $S$. 

should be not true! What is the cokernel of the map $\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow A$ with $A$ an abelian variety and $\mathbb{Z}$ the constant group scheme represented by the ring of integers? But if you consider only commutative algebraic group scheme over a field $k$(i.e. of finite type over $k$), then it should be abelian. 

In Raynaud's paper "Specialisation du foncteur de Picard", Theorem 3.3.1 says that algebraic group spaces, which are locally of finite type and separated over any locally noetherian normal 1-dim scheme, are group schemes. On the other hand, relative Picard functors for proper flat finite presentation schemes $f:X\rightarrow S$ over DVR such that $f$ is cohomologically flat are represented by algebraic sapces, but are often not schemes, see also that paper or the book Neron Model. 

Given a totally degenerated abelian variety $A_K$ (to make it easier) over a complete discrete valuation field $K$ with $R$, $\pi$ and $k$ the corresponding discrete valuation ring, uniformiser and residue field. Let $S=\mathrm{Spec}R$ and $S_n=\mathrm{Spec} R/(\pi)^{n+1}$. For any $S$-scheme $V$ we denote the scheme $V\times_S S_n$ as $V_n$. In particular, $A_K$ has semistable reduction, $A_K$ extends to a semiabelian scheme $G$ over $S=\mathrm{Spec} R$, and the corresponding Raynaud extension is just a torus $T$ over $S$, analytically $A_K=T_K/Y_K$, and we have a pairing $Y_K\times X_K\rightarrow \mathbb{G}_{m,K}$, where $Y_K$ is the periods lattice and $X$ is the character group of $T$. Moreover, we assume both $X$ and $Y$ (the character group of the Raynaud extension associated to the dual abelian variety $A_K^{\vee}$ which gives $Y_K$) are free $\mathbb{Z}$-modules. Starting from this, we can construction lots of projective models of $A_K$ by using Mumford's construction, see Mumford compositio 1972, Faltings-Chai's book, the 1999 Tohoku paper of Aleexev and Nakamura. Given a nice (being nice see [Mum1973]section 6) $Y_K$-invariant polyhedral decomposition $\Sigma$ of the affine space $E=\mathrm{Hom}(X,\mathbb{Q})$, we can construct a projective model $P_{\Sigma}$ of $A_K$ and cut out the semiabelian scheme $G$ from $P_{\Sigma}$. Over $S_n$ we have group action $G_n\times_{S_n} P_{\Sigma,n}\rightarrow P_{\Sigma,n}$. Now the question is: could we have an action of $G$ on $P_{\Sigma}$ which extends the group operation on $G$ and the actions on the infinitesimal fibres? It seems to me in Aleexev's 2002 Annals paper, the answer is yes, at least for certain canonical models obtained from a given theta divisor of some ample line bundle (since $A_K$ extends to a stable semiabelic scheme over $S$ once you are given a ample line bundle on $A_K$, and being a stable semiabelic scheme implies you have an action on the model, see Theorem 5.7.1 case 2 in that paper), but I couldn't find a concrete argument for this in the paper. Could anyone help me point out where the hidden argument is? Or give me some other reference. I know in dimension $1$ case, the paper by Deligne and Rapoport describes this action in order to define generalised elliptic curves via a different approach (using $\mathrm{Pic}^0$), but seems not easy to generalise to hight dimensional case. 

It is said so in Knutson's book 'algebraic sapces' in several places for different topologies on schemes, see Chapt. I, 2.19 for Zariski top, 3.13 for flat top., 4.11 for etale topology. But this seems to be clearly wrong to me. For example, let $f$ be the identity from $P^1$ to itself which is clearly surjective, consider the Zariski open covering $A^1\cup A^1\rightarrow X=P^1$, then $A^1\rightarrow X$ is not surjective. 

How far is it to extend the results of SGA III Exp. VIB from group schemes to group spaces? In particular, does Corollary 4.4 from SGA III Exp. VIB hold for G/S being merely a group space? Here the base $S$ is still a scheme. Is there any reference for group spaces? I checked stack project, but the section 'properties of group algebraic spaces' from Chapter "groupoids in alg. sp." is less than 1 page. Raynaud's IHES paper contains a few pages. To be more precise, I would like to know if the following is ture: Let $G/S$ be group space locally of finite presentation with $S$ a trait (to make it easier), let $s,t$ be the closed point and generic point of $S$ respectively. Suppose $G_s$ and $G_t$ are smooth over $k(s)$ and $k(t)$ respectively, and $\mathrm{dim}G_s=\mathrm{dim}G_t$. Then the functor $G^0$ (defined as in SGA III Exp. VI B Def. 3.1) is represented by a smooth group scheme over $S$.
