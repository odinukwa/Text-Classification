Question 1: To what extent is this picture reproduced in $\infty$-categories? I believe we should still have an analogous hierarchy -- for the notions defined in terms of the functor $C \to Fun(G^{op},Top)$, this is evident, while if $C$ is cocomplete then I think it is straightforward that dense generator $\Rightarrow$ colimit-generator $\Rightarrow$ strong generator. So the question is more about situations where the hierarchy collapses. The notions of generator which seem to be most commonly used $\infty$-categorically are the strongest ones -- colimit-generators and dense-generators. So I'm particularly interested in these: Question 2: In an $\infty$-topos, is it the case that every colimit-generator is dense? 

Let's unpack that. Many of the basic definitions are from Kelly and Schmitt, which in turn is based on Albert and Kelly. But beware that some notation may clash with Kelly and Schmitt. 

(Of course, "explicitly-describable" is vague, but let's at least stipulate that "all acyclic cofibrations between small objects" (the sort of description one gets from Jeff Smith's recognition theorem) is not an explicit description per se.) For example, the Quillen model structure satisfies both (1) and (2) (witness the horn inclusions), while the Joyal model structure satisfies neither (1) nor (2). Taking a Reedy model structure or projectively-inducing a model structure along an adjunction -- operations that preserve property (2) -- also preserve property (1). In fact, I don't know a single example of a model category $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying (1) but not (2) or (2) but not (1)! This leads to a vague question: "Question" A: Does $(1) \Leftrightarrow (2)$ hold in some sense? Here's a more precise, and seemingly stronger, formulation that I haven't been able to rule out. In lieu of explicit generating acyclic cofibrations, one often works with what Simpson calls a pseudo-generating set: a set of morphisms $S$ such that 

Any pseudonatural endomorphism $\Phi$ of the forgetful 2-functor $U:Topos^{coop}\to Cat$ is essentially determined by its component $\Phi_{Set}$. But which endofunctors of $Set$ induce such a $\Phi$? More generally, one can consider pseudonatural transformations $U^n \Rightarrow U$, which are determined by a functor $\mathsf{Set}^n \to \mathsf{Set}$. Here 

This is sort of an extended comment. If you're interested in this sort of thing, you should be aware that there's a whole cottage industry centered around generalizations of Barr's characterization which apply to uniform spaces, approach spaces, and other "topological" categories. See, for example, Clementino, Hofmann, and Tholen. The basic setup is that you have a monad on the category of Sets, you extend this to (a generalization of) the category of relations, and then you define lax algebras for the monad. A lot of work goes into seeing which aspects of topology can be generalized to this setting. I can't resist mentioning that this story fits into a common abstract setup with the notion of a multicategory -- see Cruttwell and Shulman. Note that the axioms for a convergence space are all phrased in terms of convergence to a single point $x$. So in a Barr-like axiomatization of convergence spaces, one expects there will be no analog of Barr's lax associativity axiom, which relates convergence at many different points to convergence at a single other point. In fact, if you simply drop the lax associativity axiom from Barr's characterization, (so you just have a relation from ultrafilters to the original set which is lax-unital) you get pseudotopoogical spaces, which can be identified as a certain subcategory of convergence spaces. To get convergence spaces you would presumably have to work with the filter monad rather than the ultrafilter monad. Be aware that there is more than one reasonable way to extend the filter monad from $\mathsf{Set}$ to $\mathsf{Rel}$ -- see Seal, which discusses two important ones, and Schubert and Seal, which discusses them more generally. 

Then $\mathcal{C}$ is injectively closed. Proof sketch: Check that $\mathcal{C}$ satisfies the hypotheses of the proposition. Notes: 

A word on the bigger picture. Examples are absolutely ubiquitous in category theory. First note that if $\mathcal{C} \perp \mathcal{D}$, then $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ determine each other uniquely up to the closure operations ${}^\perp(()^\perp)$ and $(^\perp())^\perp$, so to understand what's going on largely boils down to understanding classes of morphisms of the form ${}^\perp(\mathcal{C}^\perp)$. Now consider: Theorem Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a locally presentable category and $\mathcal{K}^{[1]}$ its category of morphisms. Then the following are equivalent: 

The point is that descent is a limit condition. Since limits are defined representably, it can be checked by mapping in from objects $C \in \mathsf{Cat}$. And moreover, it suffices to check on a strong generator of $\mathsf{Cat}$, such as the arrow category (by which I mean the category $0 \to 1$ with two objects and one non-identity morphism, which goes between them). 

A few thoughts a bit too long for a comment. I should preface this by saying that I'm not that familiar with the sort of generator conditions you're using, so I can only really talk about analogous cases using stronger generating conditions. I'm really hoping that someone who actually knows these things might respond to this. 

Item (2) takes advantage of a peculiar symmetry of the "square" category $S = \downarrow^\to_\to \downarrow$; namely $S$ can either be regarded as $S' \ast \mathrm{pt}$ where $S' = \cdot \leftarrow \cdot \rightarrow \cdot$ is the universal pushout diagram, or $S$ can be regarded as $S = \mathrm{pt} \ast S''$ where $S'' = \cdot \rightarrow \cdot \leftarrow \cdot$ is the universal pullback diagram. Hence it makes sense to ask, for a given $S$-diagram, whether it is a pullback, a pushout, or both. Item (1) similarly takes advantages of the identities $\mathrm{pt} = \emptyset \ast \mathrm{pt} = \mathrm{pt} \ast \emptyset$. But I can't shake the feeling that notion of a stable infinity category somehow "transcends" this funny fact about the geometry of points and squares. For one thing, one can use a different "combinatorial basis" to characterize the exactness properties of a stable $\infty$-category, namely: 1.' The category is (pre)additive (i.e. finite products and coproducts coincide) 2.' The loops / suspension adjunction is an equivalence. True, (2') may be regarded as a special case of (2) -- but it may also be regarded as a statement about the (co)tensoring of the category in finite spaces. Both of these ways of defining stability say that certain limits and colimits "coincide", and my sense is that in a stable $\infty$-category, all finite limits and colimits coincide -- insofar as this makes sense. Question: Is there a general notion of "a limit and colimit coinciding" which includes 

$\Psi$ is sound. $\Psi^+(T^\mathrm{op}) = \Psi\mathrm{-Alg}(T )$ holds for any $\Psi$-theory $T$. For any small $D$, every weight $\varphi: D^\mathrm{op} \to \mathcal{V}$ is a $\Psi$-ﬂat colimit of a diagram in $\Psi(D)$. For any small $D$, the closure of $\Psi(D)$ in $[D^\mathrm{op},\mathcal{V} ]$ under $\Psi$-ﬂat colimits is all of $[D^\mathrm{op},\mathcal{V} ]$. 

Here's an argument (assuming global choice) that the codomain fibration will always be split in "natural" cases. Perhaps it's well-known, or perhaps it has an important shortcoming (such as the use of choice?). Or perhaps there's an error -- strictification is tricky! 

"Derived algebraic geometry" usually means the study of geometry locally modeled on "$Spec R$" where $R$ is a connective $E_\infty$ ring spectrum (perhaps with further restrictions). Why "connective", though? In my (limited) understanding, approaches to the subject like that of Toen and Vezzosi are motivated as an approach to studying things like intersection theory in ordinary algebraic geometry. The picture is that a connective $E_\infty$ ring $R$ (incarnated as a simplicial commutative ring, usually) is an "infinitesimal thickening" of the ordinary ring $\pi_0 R$. This picture breaks down if $R$ is not connective, motivating one to restrict attention to the connective case (moreover, I don't know of a way to model nonconnective ring spectra analogous to simplicial rings). But another motivation comes from homotopy theory, $TMF$, and the moduli stack of elliptic curves, which is a nonconnective derived Deligne-Mumford stack. When the basic motivating objects are nonconnective, it leaves me puzzled that Lurie continues to focus primarily on the connective case in Spectral Algebraic Geometry. I see basically two mutually exclusive possible reasons for this: 

$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} c_L @>{f}>> c_R \\ @A{\gamma_L}AA @VV{\gamma_R}V\\ c_L' @>{f'}>> c_R' \end{CD}$ This is interpreted as the following double-categorical square: $\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} f @>{\gamma_R}>> \gamma_R f \\ @V{\gamma_L}VV @VV{\gamma_L}V \\ f \gamma_L @>{\gamma_R}>> f' \end{CD}$ Note: $TTw(C)$ is what BOORS call a stable double category: a square $\begin{CD} A @>>> B \\ @VVV @VVV \\ C @>>> D \end{CD}$ may be recovered from knowing either the following 3 objects, horizontal leg, and vertical leg: $\begin{CD} A @>>> B \\ @. @VVV \\ @. D \end{CD}$ or the following 3 objects, vertical leg, and horizontal leg: $\begin{CD} A @. \\ @VVV @. \\ C @>>> D \end{CD}$ In fact, on reflection it seems pretty clear that this construction shows that a stable double category is the same thing as a pair of categories $D,E$ with a bimodule $M: D^{op} \times E \to \mathsf{Set}$ between them. In the BOORS framework, the operation taking a stable double category to its diagonal "category" is essentially the $S_\bullet$ construction, and it recovers $Tw(C)$ from $TTw(C)$. 

Here's a proof that if $\kappa$ is an uncountable regular cardinal, then the 2-category $\mathsf{Pres}_\kappa$ of locally $\kappa$-presentable categories are closed in $\mathsf{Cat}$ under PIE limits. Here the 1-morphisms are cocontinuous functors which preserve the $\kappa$-presentable objects, or equivalently have $\kappa$-accessible right adjoints. But since $\mathsf{Pres}_\kappa$ is a non-full sub-2-category, the limits in $\mathsf{Cat}$ do not necessarily continue to be limits in $\mathsf{Cat}$. But from the description below it will be clear that the inclusion $\mathsf{Pres}_\kappa \to \mathsf{Cat}$ reflects inserters, equifiers, and $\kappa$-small products. Products It's easy to check that locally $\kappa$-presentable categories are closed under small products. For colimits can be computed pointwise, and a generating set is given by objects whose components are $\kappa$-presentable, and initial except on a $\kappa$-small set of coordinates. If we were working with general $\kappa$-accessible categories, this would be more complicated -- I'm not sure, we might have to raise the degree of accessibility. This does not require $\kappa$ to be uncountable. But note that if the product is of size $\kappa$ or more, then generally it will not actually be a product in the 2-category $\mathsf{Pres}_\kappa$ because a functor all of whose projections preserve $\kappa$-presentable objects will generally not itself preserve $\kappa$-presentable objects. Inserters Now consider the inserter $Ins(F,G)$ between functors $F,G: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$. Colimits are computed as in $\mathcal{C}$, and it's easy to see that the objects whose underlying $\mathcal{C}$-object is $\kappa$-presentable are $\kappa$-presentable. So it suffices to show that the colimit closure of these objects is all of $Ins(F,G)$ -- by Theorem 2.5.1 in Makkai-Paré, or by Lemma 3.7 in these notes by Mike Shulman and the usual strong-generator characterization of locally $\kappa$-presentable categories. Consider an object $F(c) \overset{\gamma}{\to} G(c)$ of $Ins(F,G)$. Then $c$ has some presentability rank $\lambda$. If $\lambda \leq \kappa$ we are done, otherwise $\lambda = \mu^+$ for some uncountable $\mu$, and $c$ is a $\mu$-sized colimit of $\kappa$-presentable objects (see Adámek and Rosický Remark 1.30). Let $K: I \to \mathcal{C}$ be such a diagram. There are two cases: either $\mu$ is regular, or $\mu$ is singular. If $\mu$ is regular. In this case, we can replace $I$ with a $\mu$-sized poset with $\mu$-small colimits and $K$ with a functor that preserves these colimits and takes values in the $\mu$-presentable objects of $\mathcal{C}$. To see this, first replace $I$ with its free completion under $\mu$-small colimits (extending $K$ by $\mu$-small-cocontinuity); then an easy induction allows one to choose a cofinal poset closed under $\mu$-small colimits. Construct a cofinal chain $(i_\alpha)_{\alpha < \mu}$ in $I$ and a natural family of morphisms $\gamma_\alpha: F K i_\alpha \to G K i_\alpha$ as follows. Enumerate the objects of $I$ as $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha < \mu}$. Let $i_\alpha^0 = \sup(\{i_\beta \mid \beta < \alpha \} \cup \{x_\alpha\})$. Because the $Fi$'s are $\mu$-presentable and $I$ is $\mu$-filtered, we may inductively choose objects $i_\alpha^n$ and morphisms $i_\alpha^n \to i_\alpha^{n+1}$ and $\gamma_\alpha^n : F K i_\alpha^n \to G K i_\alpha^{n+1}$ such that the following diagram commutes for all $\beta < \alpha$: $\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} FK i_\beta @>>> FKi_\alpha^0 @>>> \cdots @>>> FKi_\alpha^n @>>> FKi_\alpha @>>> Fc \\ @V{\gamma_\beta}VV @V{\gamma_\alpha^0}VV @VVV @V{\gamma_\alpha^n}VV @V{\gamma_\alpha}VV @V{\gamma}VV \\ GK i_\beta @>>> GKi_\alpha^1 @>>> \cdots @>>> GKi_\alpha^{n+1} @>>> GKi_\alpha @>>> Gc \end{CD}$ In the diagram, we have set $i_\alpha = \varinjlim_{n<\omega} i_\alpha^n$ and observed that becuse this colimit is preserved by $K$, $F$, and $G$, we can define $\gamma_\alpha : FKi_\alpha \to GKi_\alpha$ to be the colimit of the $\gamma_\alpha^n$'s, and this is indeed how we define $i_\alpha$ and $\gamma_\alpha$. This is where we need $\kappa$ to be uncountable -- otherwise we cannot take the colimit of this chain when $\mu = \kappa$. Now it is easy to see that the chain $(i_\alpha)_{\alpha < \mu}$ is cofinal in $I$, and the arrows $(FKi_\alpha \overset{\gamma_\alpha}{\to} GKi_\alpha)_{\alpha < \mu}$ define a functor into $Ins(F,G)$ taking values in the $\mu$-presentable objects whose colimit is $Fc \overset{\gamma}{\to} Gc$. By induction, the $\mu$-presentable objects are in the colimit closure of the $\kappa$-presentable objects (this is where we use that $\mu$ is regular -- otherwise $\mu$-presentability is the same thing as $\lambda$-presentability!). So $Fc \overset{\gamma}{\to} Gc$ is in this colimit closure too. If $\mu$ is singular The basic idea is to do what we just did for a cofinal sequence of smaller regular cardinals, and take a colimit. (Interestingly, this argument seems to work for any limit cardinal $\mu$). Choose a sequence of regular cardinals $(\mu_\alpha)$ satisfying $\kappa \leq \sum_{\beta < \alpha} \mu_\beta < \mu_\alpha < \mu$ with supremum $\mu$. Similarly to the preliminaries before, we can replace $I$ with a $\mu$-sized poset equipped with an exhaustive filtration $I_0 \subset I_1 \subset \dots \subset I$, $\cup_\alpha I_\alpha = I$ satisfying the conditions that $|I_\alpha| = \mu_\alpha$ and $I_\alpha$ is closed under $\mu_\alpha$-small colimits, which are preserved by the inclusion $I_\alpha \to I$. And we may assume that $K$ preserves $\mu$-small colimits and that $Ki$ is $\mu_\alpha$-presentable for $i \in I_\alpha$ . We construct a chain $(i_\alpha)$ with $i_\alpha \in I_\alpha$ and a natural family of morphisms $\gamma_\alpha : Fi_\alpha \to Gi_\alpha$ by taking $i_\alpha^0 = \sup (\cup_{\beta < \alpha} I_\beta)$ and performing an iterative construction as before to choose $i_\alpha$ and $\gamma_\alpha$. It is harmless to assume that $i_\alpha \in I_\alpha$ -- otherwise $i_\alpha$ first appears in $I_{\alpha'}$ for some $\alpha'>\alpha$, and we simply modify our choice of $I_\beta$ for $\alpha \leq \beta < \alpha'$ by adding in $i_\alpha$ and closing under $\mu_\beta$-filtered colimits in $I_{\alpha'}$. As before, we have defined a chain in $Ins(F,G)$ whose colimit is $Fc \overset{\gamma}{\to} Gc$. Moreover for each $\alpha$, the object $Ki_\alpha$ is $\mu_\alpha$-presentable, and $\mu_\alpha$ is a regular cardinal strictly less than $\lambda$, so by the inductive hypothesis, $Fc \overset{\gamma}{\to} Gc$ is in the colimit closure of the $\kappa$-presentable objects as desired. Equifiers I think that a similar argument to the inserter case will show that locally $\kappa$-presentable categories are closed under equifiers for uncountable $\kappa$.
