So how do we motivate the wealthy to raise more children? By looking at what currently motivates them and structure raising children as providing a similar benefit. In this case, they are very clearly motivated by a desire to pay less taxes. Therefore, Legislate tax breaks proportional to the number of kids raised. Write the legislation so that the amount of money saved from taxes per child is greater than the amount of money spent to care for each child per tax year. This creates a net-tax break. Structure the legislation so that raising more kids returns a greater tax break. More importantly: do not cap it leaving it uncapped maximizes the generational distribution of wealth. This creates a dangerous issue: exploitation How does one protect the children from malicious upperclassmen who intends to exploit them for financial gain? It would seem simple to legislate the following points: 1. Each child must be guaranteed a share of the inheritance. 2. Each child must be treated humanely (and this much be checked) 3. If the child dies or goes missing, formal investigations must be had. But, we're talking about the supremely wealthy and their armies of lawyers and accountants. Obviously, if they'd like to maximize their tax cut, they will be motivated to adopt a massive number of children. In the short term, this benefits them; however, in the long term, they may wish to keep their wealth and not distribute it after their death. Similarly, they may wish to keep the children at a manageable age to reduce costs and psychological overhead. Anecdotal example: rich teens invokes far more legal fees than rich 10 year olds. Or, they could sell the kids (ex: females) when they reach a certain age and make a tidy profit. Therefore, they may attempt to trade or remove kids from their parentage, be it adoption to another wealthy family, or 'mysterious disappearances' (read: murder, human-trafficking, slavery, prostitution). Without heavy government oversight, it would be simple for the obscenely wealthy and obscenely malicious to exploit lower-class adopters for financial gain. Similarly, one can see them forming the equivalent of a foster home. In essence, you'd be shifting the foster-care system to the wealthy; but, like the current foster care system, incredible oversight will be required to prevent exploitation. 

L1 is a unstable point. If the satellite drifts a bit, it can fall out of L1 and towards the Earth or Moon in an unstable elliptical orbit. Unfortunately this applies to all Lagrange points, but unequally. Depending on your SciFi scenario, this may not be an issue assuming the station has basic thrust capacity to keep it within the Lagrange point. L1 is strongly coupled with the Moon's 27 day orbit. As a direct result, from the station's POV, in 24 hours it'll move 13.3 degrees around Earth while Earth would've rotated a full 360 degrees. As far the station is concerned though, it'll observe Earth rotate 360-13.3 degrees or 346 degrees. This means that if the prime meridian were directly below the station, after 24 station hours, the 13th longitude would be beneath it, and after 48 hours the 26th longitude, and so on... For comparison this would place Greenwich at 00:00, ~Naples, Italy at 24:00, Bucharest, Romania at 48:00 and Mecca, Saudi Arabia at 72:00. As you can tell, this would disrupt the proposed equal balance between shifts and world-powers. Unfortunately, this also applies to each other Lagrange point. FURTHER DISCUSSION @ BOTTOM OF POST 

How to derive the Scale Height The Nebraska Astronomy Applet Project of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln provides a complete derivation of Scale Height with respect to Planetary atmospheres which I will duplicate below. Please note that I'll hold of on explaining what each symbol means until Part 3: Calculating the Scale Height. First we begin with the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium. (1). $~~ dP = - \rho g dz$ Then we use the ideal gas law to simplify (1). We may use one of two forms: (2). $~~ P = \cfrac{kT}{\mu m_\mu} \rho$ (3). $~~ \rho = \cfrac{ kT}{\mu m_\mu} P$ to eliminate $\rho$ or P from (1). Using (2) returns (4) and using (3) returns (5): (4). $~~ dP = - \left( \cfrac{\mu m_\mu P}{kT} \right) g dz$ (5). $~~ d\rho = - \left( \cfrac{\mu m_\mu \rho}{kT} \right) g dz$ Shift P or /rho to the left hand side and you'll arrive at: (6). $~~ \cfrac{dP}{P} = - \left( \cfrac{\mu m_\mu}{kT} \right) g dz$ (7). $~~ \cfrac{d\rho}{\rho} = - \left( \cfrac{\mu m_\mu }{kT} \right) g dz$ If you look closely, you'll notice that the formulas are identical, and therefore equivalent. It then follows that whichever we solve for, will have an identical form to the other. Taking after the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, we'll derive the scale height from pressure and continue with (6). Integrate from the surface of the planet ($P_i = P_0$, $z_i = 0$) to some height ($P_f = P$, $z_f =z$). $\int{\cfrac{dP}{P}} = - \cfrac{\mu m_\mu }{kT} g \int dz $ $\ln P |_{P_0}^P = \left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu }{kT} g \right) z |_{0}^z $ $\ln P - \ln P_0 = \left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu }{kT} g \right) (z-0) $ Use the logarithmic identity for subtraction to simplify the left hand side. $\ln \cfrac{P}{P_0} = \left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu g}{kT} \right) z $ Raise the entire formula to an exponent to eliminate the logarithm, then rearrange as a function of pressure. $e^{\ln \cfrac{P}{P_0}} = e^{\left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu g}{kT} \right) z} $ (8). $~~ P = P_0 e^{\left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu g}{kT} \right) z} $ Lump the coefficients on z into a single coefficient. We'll call it H. (9). $~~ H = \left(\cfrac{kT}{\mu m_\mu g} \right)$ Then (1) simplifies to: $P = P_0 e^{-\cfrac{z}{H}} $ Since H is a constant coefficient, if we take z to equal it (z = H), then we'll get: $ P = P_0 e^{- 1} = \cfrac{P_0}{e} $ Therefore we formally define $H$ as the height where the pressure drops to $\frac{1}{e}$ of the surface pressure, i.e. The Scale Factor. Determine Air density at a given height. Recall earlier how the Scale Factor may be derived either from pressure or density? Using density instead of pressure, i.e. formula (7) to derive the scale factor gives us: (10). $~~ \rho = \rho_0 e^{\left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu g}{kT} \right) z} $ using the same logic as before: $H = \left( \cfrac{kT}{\mu m_\mu g} \right)$ which is the scale height. Therefore (10) may be used to calculate the air density at a given height, or in your case, at the scale height. Calculating your scale height. $m_\mu$ is the atomic mass constant: $1.66 \times 10^−27 \frac{kg}{amu}$. k is the Boltzmann Constant: $1.38 \times 10^−23 \frac{J}{K}$. g is the surface gravity: $11.127 \frac{m}{s^2}$. T is the temperature of the gas (average temperature of the atmosphere): $\overline T = \frac{8.0°C + 2.9°C}{2} = 5.45 °C = 278.6 K $ $\mu$ is the average particle mass of the gas (our atmosphere). Similarly to The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, we compute this from the weighted composition of the atmosphere: $\mu = 0.771 m_{N_2} + 0.222 m_He + 0.004 m_{O_2} + 0.002 m_{Ar}$ $\mu = (0.771)(28) + (0.222)(4) + (0.004)(32) + (0.002)(39)$ $\mu = (0.771)(28) + (0.222)(4) + (0.004)(32) + (0.002)(39) = 22.682 amu$ Plugging these values into formula (9) returns: $H = 9176.83 m $ or $H = 9.177 km $ Therefore the air density at a given height, z, is $\rho = \rho_0 e^{- \cfrac{z}{9176.83 m}} $ Sample densities: Since the scale factor is the distance required to reduce the pressure or density by $\frac{1}{e}$ sample pressures and densities at integer multiples of the scale factor ($nH$) are simple to calculate. $\rho = \rho_0 e^{- \cfrac{nH}{H}} =\rho_0 e^{-n} = \cfrac{\rho_0}{e^n} $ $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \text{Elevation} & \text{n} & \text{coefficient} & \rho & P\\ \hline 0 & \text{0} & \left(\cfrac{1}{1}\right) & 1.000 \rho_0 & P_0\\ \hline H & \text{1} & \left(\cfrac{1}{e}\right) & 0.368 \rho_0 & 0.368 P_0\\ \hline 2H & \text{2} & \left(\cfrac{1}{e^2}\right) & 0.135 \rho_0 & 0.135 P_0\\ \hline 3H & \text{3} & \left(\cfrac{1}{e^3}\right) & 0.050 \rho_0 & 0.050 P_0\\ \hline 4H & \text{4} & \left(\cfrac{1}{e^4}\right) & 0.018 \rho_0 & 0.050 P_0\\ \hline \end{array}$$ 

Remember, though, that these rooms aren't empty, like in the picture above; they contain all the provisions you're holding onto in case of a siege. And remember that, due to the difficult engineering problem of constructing a cellar which the castle doesn't collapse on top of, you're not going to be building these with a lot of extra room. And here's the payoff for the bit about tornadoes above. Cities faced with tornadoes don't build extra infrastructure to protect their citizens. They use whatever they had already (so, church basements and YMCAs and so forth), the people at the top are taken care of one way or another, and the interchangeable people at the bottom of society are left to fend for themselves. (Oh, and if you think the nobles are going to give them time off work to dig themselves tunnels, you don't have a clear picture of what the serf/vassal system looked like.) And tunnels aren't that great anyway. You know how to deal with an enemy who digs tunnels? Here's what Wikipedia has to say: 

Moore, Oklahoma extends a couple of miles on either side of Interstate 35 as it passes south out of Oklahoma City on its way to Dallas. It occupies about twenty square miles, which is fairly small by the standards of this part of the country, but with a population of around 50k it's one of the ten largest cities in the state. And, unlike the larger cities of Norman and Oklahoma directly to its north and south, it's also had completely devastating tornado damage several times in the past few years. In fact, some of these tornadoes were destructive enough to merit their own Wikipedia pages. (I had a third link to post here, but I haven't got the reputation to post it yet.) Now, what I want to highlight here is basically a direct analog of what's been suggested in many of the other answers. Among the casualties of the 2013 Moore tornado were several students at the Plaza Towers elementary school, one of two Moore elementary schools destroyed by the tornado. In the days after the tornado, a proposed law requiring new schools in the state to be built with tornado shelters unsurprisingly gained a great deal of traction with the public. Now take a minute to think through what this says. It's not proposing public tornado shelters for everyone, or retrofitting existing structures, but merely that any new construction of schools will come equipped with some sort of tornado shelter. In interviews with the media, the measure was immediately dismissed by the Governor as too expensive, and nothing came of it. What did happen? Well, the city of Moore updated its building code, essentially requiring that new construction be built to withstand EF-2 tornadoes. Now, remember, the tornadoes that have repeatedly destroyed Moore are in the EF-4 and EF-5 range, not the EF-2 range. Since that probably doesn't mean anything to most people, here are the sample images from Wikipedia of EF-2 and EF-4 destruction: EF-2 damage: 

Which makes tunnels without fortified entraces an unattractive defense against fire-breathing dragons. So, how would cities under threat from dragons be designed? Well, unfortunately, they likely wouldn't be designed at all. 

With a question like this there are two ways to go: how would things play out in a work of fiction, and how would they play out in real life? I think a lot of people have covered the "work of fiction" angle. If you were going to design a city from scratch and with none of the real-world financial or political constraints that cities face as they grow and evolve, you'd probably have a big network of underground shelters for people to hide in when the dragons came around. But let's look at a similar real-life situation featuring unpredictable death from above: a city prone to catastrophic tornado damage. (I write this with my other browser tab open to a weather radar, because I'm currently under threat from a severe storm system right now). 

Okay, so how do we compare this to what we know about the (I'm assuming) medieval societies that we're imagining facing a dragon attack? We know that many medieval cities were built around castles that served as a central fortress for the community. The laborers who worked in the city surrounding the castle would, in the event of an invasion, come inside of the castle. Now I'm going to assume that the castle predates the dragon here, because nobody in his right mind would spend the time, money, resources, and man-hours it takes to put up a castle in an area where there were constant dragon attacks. To quote an article on HowStuffWorks by Craig Freudenrich (which I can't link to with a new account), 

Nobody would bother undertaking such a project if those three thousand workers kept getting eaten alive and/or set on fire. People would just live somewhere else. So I'm envisioning a castle built to keep out invading armies, not dragons. Now, there's a problem with this. Castles, pretty much from the beginning to the end of their existence, have relied on the fact that having the higher ground is what you want in battle. Early "motte-and-bailey" castles were basically just walled buildings (often just made wood or even dirt!) put on top of a hill that would suck for an invading army to run up. And even later on, when castles started to get way more sophisticated, it was always the case that the most heavily-fortified part of the castle was also the highest off the ground. 11th-century motte-and-bailey castle
