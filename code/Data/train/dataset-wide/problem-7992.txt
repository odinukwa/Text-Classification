An A-S TFT is a functor from $\text{Bord}_{<n−1,n>}(\mathcal{F})$ to $\text{Vect}$ where $\mathcal{F}$ denotes a set of background fields, eg a spin structure. An extended theory is a functor from $\text{Bord}_n(\mathcal{F})$ to a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathcal{C}$ that restricts to an A-S TFT on $(n−1)$- and $n$-manifolds. For a topological field theory to be a true “extension” of an Atiyah-Segal theory, the top two levels of its target (ie its $(n-1)^{\text{st}}$ loop space) must look like $\text{Vect}$. What other (physical) considerations constrain the choice of target category? The targets of invertible field theories are (by definition) symmetric monoidal $\infty$-groupoids and (therefore) can be represented as spectra. What constraints can we impose on target spectra of invertible theories; in particular, on their homotopy groups? 

I'm asking because premodular tensor categories appear in the literature with (at least) two definitions: 

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a pivotal tensor category. Feel free to assume finiteness, semisimplicity, fusion, sphericality, unitarity or whatever makes things interesting. Which of the following structures come for free? 

Let $f:A\rightarrow B, g:B\rightarrow C$ be maps in the category CGWH (compactly generated weakly Hausdorff spaces). Do we have a homotopy fibration sequence $$F(f)\rightarrow F(gf) \rightarrow F(g)$$ consisting of homotopy fibres? (And the dual statement for homotopy cofibres?) 

$\require{AMScd}$ Let $M$ be a pointed model category, consider a commutative square $$ \begin{CD} X' @> f' >> Y'\\ @Vu_0VV @VVu_1V \\ X @>> f > Y, \end{CD} $$ taking the homotopy cofiber of the four maps give a diagram as follows $$ \begin{CD} X' @> f' >> Y'@> g' >> C'\\ @Vu_0VV @VVu_1V @VVu_2V\\ X @>> f > Y@>> g > C\\ @Vv_0VV @VVv_1V\\ X'' @> f'' >> Y'', \end{CD} $$ taking further the homotopy cofiber of $f''$ gives a commutative diagram like this: $$ \begin{CD} X' @> f' >> Y'@> g' >> C'\\ @Vu_0VV @VVu_1V @VVu_2V\\ X @>> f > Y@>> g > C\\ @Vv_0VV @VVv_1V @VVv_2V\\ X'' @> f'' >> Y''@> g'' >> C''. \end{CD} $$ My question is 

Let's call a function $f$ k-podal if, for every multipodal set $X$ of size $k$: $$\sum_{x\in X}f(x) = 0$$ In particular, a 2-podal function is just another name for an odd function: $f(-x)=-f(x)$. I am looking for information about these "multipodal points" and "$k$-podal" functions. In particular: 

The theoretic question seems non-trivial even for k=2. I could solve it only when the polygon to cover is a rectangle. Suppose the rectangle has an aspect ratio of L. Then: 

For every integer $d\geq 1$, say that $S$ is $d$-dimensional if there exists a collection of sets $W_{j,t}$, for $j=1,2,\dots$ such that for every $j$: 

the square is carved 3 times. The rectangle-numbers are written in each resulting polygon. The final rectangle-number is 6, since $P'$, which is a union of two polygons, can be partitioned to 6 pairwise-disjoint rectangles. Let $R(n)$ be the largest rectangle-number that you can achieve in $n$ carvings. The example above shows that $R(3)\geq 6$. What is an upper bound on $R(n)$? In the example above, each carving adds at most 2 to the rectangle-number. This hints that there may be an upper bound such as $R(n)\leq (2n+1)$, or maybe another linear upper-bound. EDIT: while there are scenarios in which a single carving can double the rectangle-number: 

Does the pivotal structure canonically define a twist: a natural transformation $\theta$ from the identity functor to itself? Or must I to add this structure by hand? Endow $\mathcal{C}$ with a braided structure $c$ (assume this is possible). Is $\mathcal{C}$ balanced: do $\theta$ and $c$ satisfy $\theta_{x\otimes y}=c_{yx}\cdot c_{xy}\cdot(\theta_y\otimes\theta_x)$? (ie does the ribbon diagram make sense?) If so, is $\mathcal{C}$ ribbon: does $\theta$ satisfy $(\theta_x)^*=\theta_{x^*}$? (compatible rigidity, twist, and braiding) 

The 1D result is discussed in detail here: 1607.06766. (See also 1607.06504.) The analog of the TVBW invariant is the FHK state sum, which takes as input a separable algebra $A$. As Kevin points out, this algebra has an interpretation as the space of states on the interval with some boundary conditions. The algebra has a canonical special symmetric Frobenius form, which is used to build the invariant. Not all 2d TQFTs, which are classified by commutative Frobenius algebras, have an FHK state sum; but up to deformation (appropriate for gapped phases), they all do. The construction is also redundant, as the TQFT only senses the Morita class of $A$. In particular, the space of states on the circle (the vector space underlying the commutative Frobenius algebra) is the center of $A$. The analog of the LW model is the fixed-point Matrix Product State (MPS) system, which also takes as input a separable algebra. It consists of a parent Hamiltonian, whose ground states are have a simple wavefunction representation called MPS. For each module $V$ over $A$, there is a ground state $\vert\psi_V\rangle$ on the circle; the space of ground states is spanned by the indecomposable modules. Therefore, as was the case for the TQFT, the space of ground states is the center of the separable algebra $A$. The correspondence is made more explicit by extending the state sum to incorporate physical (brane) boundaries. These are associated to modules $V$ over $A$. If one evaluates the state sum for the anulus with boundary condition $V$ on one boundary circle and outgoing cut boundary on the other, one obtains the MPS state $\vert\psi_V\rangle\in A^{\otimes N}$ before projecting to the TQFT state space (the center of $A$). The parent Hamiltonian arises as the projector assigned to the cylinder. I agree with Kevin's opinion that the 1D result only becomes interesting when new structure is added. This is due to the trivial algebra $\mathbb{C}$ being the only indecomposable separable algebra in $\text{Vect}$. See the references above for systems with finite group actions. There, one works with separable algebras in $\text{Rep}(G)$ and has a Morita class of algebras for each pair $(H,\omega)$, an unbroken symmetry group and a cocycle characterizing the SPT order. For the correspondence between 1D fermionic systems and field theories that are sensitive to spin structure, see 1610.10075. 

Stromquist and Woodall (1985) study the problem of Sets on which several measures agree. There are $n$ non-atomic value measures on the unit circle, and a parameter $w\in(0,1)$. The goal is to find a subset of the circle, whose value according to all $n$ measures is exactly a fraction $w$ of the total. The subset should be a union of a finite number of intervals, and this number should be as small as possible. Denote by $Ints(n,w)$ the smallest number of required intervals. Stromquist and Woodall prove the following bounds on $Ints(n,w)$: 

After reading many papers about problems of minimum polygon covering, I found out that there are four different types of units that are considered for covering polygons, in increasing order of generality: squares, rectangles, convex shapes and star shapes. In theory, there can be many other covering units, for example: it is possible to cover a polygon with triangles (this is different than the problem of triangulation because the units in a covering may overlap), pentagons, hexagons... but, I haven't found any paper discussing such covering problems. My question is: are you aware of any papers discussing the problem of finding a minimum covering of a polygon with shapes other than the four classes above? I am particularly interested in covering a polygon with right-angled isosceles triangles, isolateral triangles or other regular polygons.

Here $1\times d^s: \Delta^{n-1}\cong\Delta^{n-1}\times\Delta^{0}\rightarrow\Delta^{n-1}\times\Delta^{1}, s=0, 1$ are the inclusions of the endpoints of the standard 1-simplex; and the maps $d^i, d^j:\Delta^{n-1}\rightarrow\Delta^{n}$ are also the coface maps. Drawing a picture, I think $\Delta^{n}$ should be a quotient of the prism $\Delta^{n-1}\times\Delta^{1}$, possibly by collapsing some non-degenerate n-simplices except only one of them, to a point, but I can't make this intuition rigorous. Could you make this precise? In fact, I want to define a notion of path components of a Kan complex. In the literature, I only find the definition of $\pi_0$, which only involves the 0-simplices. I want to define path components of a Kan complex, all of which should then also be a (connected) Kan complex. If you can make sense of this without proving the above result, it would also be very helpful. 

Let $\mathscr{M}$ be a model category and let $G$ be a group object in $\mathscr{M}$. Then is it also a group object in the homotopy category $\mathsf{Ho}\mathscr{M}$? 

Let $H$ be a set-family (a set of sets). For every set $g$, define the intersection set-family: $$ H\cap g := \{h\cap g| h\in H \}$$ For every set $g$, the family $H\cap g$ contains at most $2^{|g|}$ sets (the subsets of $g$). Call $H$ simple if, for all two-element sets $g = \{x,y\}$, the family $|H\cap g|$ contains at most $3$ sets. (in other words, $H$ is simple iff its VC dimension is at most $1$). My goal is to characterize the combinatorial structure of simple set-families. I found some sufficient conditions for simplicity of $H$. In all cases, I assume that $g=\{x,y\}$, and prove that $H\cap g$ cannot contain one of the four subsets of $g$. 

I just found this excellent blog-post: $URL$ It contains a poem on complexity classes, based on Dylan's song "Man gave names to all the animals", with the same tune but different lyrics: 

This is an attempt to complement Nick Gill's answer. If it is correct (I am not sure), it should be merged into his answer. Proposition: In every hole-free polygon, there exists a corner square that lies in exactly one maximal subrectangle. Proof: Observe that as one moves clockwise around the perimeter of the polygon, one must go either left or right at various stages. One obtains a sequence: $R,R,L, R, L \cdots$ and it is clear that the number of $R$'s is 4 more than the number of $L$'s. Therefore there must be a pair of two adjacent $R$'s. Assume w.l.o.g. that there is such a pair such that the side between the corners faces west. Consider the maximal rectangle that covers the two $R$ corners (red in the pictures below). This rectangle must run into at least one eastern side. There are two cases: Case A: The eastern side is connected to an $R$ corner adjacent to the $RR$ pair at the north or south: 

Let $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$ denote the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-module defined by the inversion action on $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $G_0$ be a finite group that acts trivially on $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$. Then one can compute via the Künneth Theorem and UCT for cohomology,\begin{align}H^3(G_0\times\mathbb{Z}/2;\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv})&=\text{Tor}(H^3(G_0;\mathbb{Z}),\mathbb{Z}/2)\times H^2(G_0;\mathbb{Z})\otimes_\mathbb{Z}\mathbb{Z}/2\times \mathbb{Z}/2\\&=H^2(G_0;\mathbb{Z}/2)\times \mathbb{Z}/2.\end{align}We find that every non-zero element in the cohomology group is of order $2$. Now let $G_0\rightarrow G\xrightarrow{x} \mathbb{Z}/2$ be a possibly non-trivial extension of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ by $G_0$. A $G$-action on $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$ is defined by $g:n\mapsto (-1)^{x(g)}n$. Is it true that every non-zero element in $H^3(G;\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv})$ is of order $2$? 

Given two spectra $A$ and $B$, the set $[A,B]$ of homotopy classes of maps from $A$ to $B$ forms an abelian group. Can the dual abelian group $\text{Hom}([A,B],\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$ be expressed as a group of homotopy classes of maps between spectra? The Brown-Comenetz dual $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E$ of a spectrum $E$ is defined here. A key property of $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E$ is that its homotopy is dual of that of $E$ in the sense that $\pi_*I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E=\text{Hom}(\pi_*E,\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$. Naively, I suspect that $\text{Hom}([A,B],\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$ can be expressed in terms of $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}A$ and $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}B$. What if I replace ${\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}$ by ${\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}$ or ${\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}}$? 

So the interesting question is: how to divide the land fairly, such that each state receives only a small number of disconnected pieces? (e.g. a constant, or a function of the number of citizens). Initially I thought of a variant in which only half of the citizens in each state should feel that the division is fair. This makes sense in democratic states, since the suggested division may be brought to a referendum in each state, and if at least half vote in favor of it, it is implemented. Under this assumption, it is possible to divide the land in a single cut (a single piece per state). But this does not generalize well to 3 or more states. 

$\newcommand{\abs}[1]{\left|#1\right|}$ There is a population $O$ with a countable (finite or infinite) number of subjects. The population is colored randomly: for each subject, an unbiased coin-toss is used to decide whether the subject is colored red or green. Then, a sub-population containing $t$ subjects are selected; denote this sub-population by $T$ (so $T\subseteq O$ and $|T|=t$). Denote by $T^R$ the set of red subjects in $T$ and by $T^G$ the set of green subjects. The difference $\abs{|T^R|-|T^G|}$ denotes the imbalance caused by the randomization process. What is high-probability upper bound on this imbalance, as a function of $t$? There are two extreme cases: 

For a generalized homology theory $h$ and a Serre fibration $F\rightarrow E\rightarrow B$, we can define an Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence\begin{equation}E^2_{p,q}=H_p(B,h_q(F))\Rightarrow h_{p+q}(E)\end{equation}Suppose we have determined $E^\infty_{p,q}$ for all relevant $(p,q)$ and want to find $h_n(E)$. We have\begin{equation}\bigoplus_pE^\infty_{p,n-p}=\text{gr }h_n(E)\end{equation}where $\text{gr}$ is the associated graded space for some filtration $F_ph_n$ on $h_n(E)$. This determines $h_n(E)$ up to extension. Are there results about how to solve the extension problem for certain theories $h$? We sometimes have that $\text{gr }h_n(E)=h_n(E)$, in which case $h_n(E)$ is trivially obtained from $E^\infty_{p,q}$. For which $h$ and $E$ is this true? In my limited experience, this often (though not always?) holds when $h$ is ordinary homology $H$ or oriented cobordism $\Omega^{SO}$ and $E$ is the classifying space $BG$ of a finite abelian group $G$. Meanwhile, spin bordism tends to be less trivial; in particular, suppose $E^\infty_{p,n-p}=\mathbb{Z}_{k_p}$, then $\text{gr }\Omega^{spin}_n(BG)=\Omega^{spin}_n(\text{pt})\bigoplus_{p=0}^{n-1}\mathbb{Z}_{k_p}$ often (always?) becomes $\Omega^{spin}_n(BG)=\Omega^{spin}_n(\text{pt})\oplus\mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N=\prod_{p=0}^{n-1} k_p$. Are these examples supported by general results? 

There are two ways in which higher categories appear in topological field theory: in extended TFTs and in TFTs with defects. How are these appearances related? According to the Atiyah-Segal axioms, a d-dimensional TFT is a symmetric monoidal functor \begin{equation*}\text{Bord}_d\rightarrow\mathcal{C}\end{equation*} where the target category $\mathcal{C}$ is a symmetric monoidal category, typically $\text{Vect}$. The objects of $\text{Bord}_d$ are closed $(d-1)$-manifolds and map to the vector spaces of $\text{Vect}$ under the TFT. The morphisms are d-dimensional bordisms of the closed $(d-1)$-manifolds and map to the linear maps of $\text{Vect}$. This description can be "extended down" to define a d-dimensional n-extended TFT as a symmetric monoidal $n$-functor \begin{equation*}\text{Bord}_d^n\rightarrow\mathcal{C}\end{equation*} where $\mathcal{C}$ is now an symmetric monoidal $n$-category. The objects of $\text{Bord}_d^n$ are $(d-n)$-manifolds (for a "fully extended" TFT, i.e. $n=d$, the bordism objects are points) and map to the objects of $\mathcal{C}$, which can be thought of as $(n-1)$-categories. One should really specify $\mathcal{C}$ as some extension of $\text{Vect}$, but I am ignoring this technicality by thinking of the n-category of all (small) $(n-1)$-categories. More generally, $k$-morphisms are $(d-n+k)$-dimensional bordisms between $(d-n+k-1)$-manifolds and map to $(n+k-1)$-categories. There are also technicalities surrounding how one manages "manifolds with corners" in $\text{Bord}_d^n$, but allow me to gloss over them here. Meanwhile, one uses higher categories to decorate manifolds with defects. In this picture, $k$-dimensional manifolds are decorated with $k$-dimensional (extended?) TFTs called "$k$-defects." Lower dimensional submanifolds can be decorated with "defects within defects." The $k$-defect assigned to a $k$-dimensional "boundary" between two $(k+1)$-dimensional regions, each with attached $(k+1)$-defects, amounts to a morphism of $(k+1)$-defects. Fusion of defects and sub-defects endows the set of $k$-defects with the structure of a $k$-category. (For details, see $URL$ If we again imagine the $k$-category of (small) $(k-1)$-categories, we can understand decoration as an assignment of $(k-1)$-categories to $k$-manifolds. This construction of TFT with defects feels "upside down" compared to extended TFT: $k$-manifolds are decorated by $(k-1)$-categories and map to $(d-k-1)$-categories under the TFT functor. I realize that decoration is not a functor from a bordism category, but is it a functor in some other sense (from some category where higher degree morphisms are lower dimensional submanifolds)? Defects may have an interpretation as inserted operators (Wilson loops, surface operators, etc); can these two formalisms be combined to compute path integrals with operator insertions in an extended theory? In general, I am curious about the relation between how higher categories are used to define an extended TFT and how they are used to characterize TFTs with defects. Here is a particular problem from $URL$ Consider a fully extended 4D TFT. The TFT functor assigns $1$-categories to Riemann surfaces $\Sigma$. Meanwhile, in the defect description, 2D TFTs form a $2$-category. Restricting ourselves to a single object leaves us with a symmetric monoidal category of $1$-dimensional domain walls (essentially boundary conditions) of the 2D theory. Is this category of boundary conditions identified with the category assigned by the TFT functor (as is claimed)? It seems that this identification is only possible since $\dim\Sigma=2=\text{codim }\Sigma$ in dimension four and does not reflect a general relation between extended TFT and TFT with defects.
