Bubbles may form and explode sooner or later in this case, which is nothing desirable. Adjusting the money supply is a difficult balancing exercise for central banks. 

In Nicholas Stern (1991)'s The Determinants of Growth first equation (I a), without preconceived ideas, one reads $\frac{\dot{K}}{K} = \frac{d K}{d t} \frac{1}{K}$ Which means explicitly (in discret values) $= \frac{K_{t+dt}-K_{t}}{dt} \frac{1}{K_{t}}$ If $t$ is in years, and that we are interested in the variation of $K$ over $1$ year (i.e. $dt=1$), one obtains $= -1 +\frac{K_{t+1}}{K_{t}}$ Even if the above equality could represent either the variation of a stock or the variation of a flow, the story behind this is about stocks. To summarize 

This depends on whether companies want to keep their real rates of return constant. This is not "mechanic", but companies' strategy-based. If they chose to do so, i.e. to keep constant their real rates of return, this will be reflected in the nominal increase of their profits (real profits will thus remain constant). 

Answer a is not possible since it reduces to $m = \frac{1}{2} 2m + \frac{3}{2}\frac{2m}{3} = 2m$ which has no sense. Idem for answer c, $m\neq\frac{1}{4}m$. Remains answers b or d. For answer b, we have $u(2m,0)=8m$ and for answer d, $u(0,\frac{2m}{3}) = \frac{28}{3}m = (9+\frac{1}{3})m$ As you can see, $ (9+\frac{1}{3}) > 8$. In the general case, to find the maximum of your utility function given a monetary constrain, you can formalize and maximize the following Lagrangian function $L(x_1,x_2,\lambda)=u(x_1,x_2)+\lambda(m-p_1 x_1 - p_2 x_2)$ where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are prices. In your case, those are $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{3}{2}$ respectively. Suite As usual, the story behind equations is of first importance. Remember that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are two perfect substitutes. This means that the individual will spend all her income either in $x_1$ or in $x_2$, and will chose the good which provides her with the highest utility. And this is actually the story that the use of the Lagrangian function tells you. As you mentioned in your comment below, you get first order conditions which seem to be contradictory. But they are not. Indeed, the two goods will never be bought simultaneously. Which means that you will get either $\lambda = 8$ or $\lambda = \frac{28}{3}$ in a mutually exclusive manner. Recall what $\lambda$ is : it is a shadow price. In other words, it expresses how much your objective function, $u(x_1,x_2)$, will increase, if your constrain, $m$, increases by $1$. Thus, if $m$ increases by $1$, and the individual spends all her income in $x_1$, $u$ will increase by $8$. If she spends all her income in $x_2$, $u$ will increase by $\frac{28}{3}$. Which good will the individual chose ? 

You are right. There is nothing in "importing" which is intrinsically related to "borrowing". If economics books often quotes this, it is because they make an accounting-like shortcut (under assumptions of balanced public accounts) that is representative of the USA-China case. On the one hand, USA has a net negative trade balance with China, i.e. USA is "net-importing" from China. On the other hand, the "U.S. debt to China is $1.2 trillion as of August 2017". The accounting-like shortcut consists of saying that USA debt to China is actually used to import goods from China. This is not the factual reality, but an accounting one. The real story behind is that actually, when importing goods from another country, a U.S. private company is not doing so from a local one who would pays taxes and thus generates tax income for the U.S. government, which would in turn allows it to contract less debt and so on... 

Thus the difference between the two appears to be the discounting factor considering how far (in time) we are from the exercising/stopping date (which is the same as the maturity date if $\tau=T$), which implies to compute (continuously) the present value of this futur payoff. If $(\tau-t \rightarrow0) \land (\tau=T \lor t \rightarrow T)$, both equations become equal. If one decides (for some reasons) that the option will be exercised at maturity, i.e. $\tau=T$ and that "now", $t$, is "turning into this futur date $T$", i.e. $t \rightarrow T$, one gets $T-t \rightarrow 0 \implies \sup_T e^{-r(T-t)} \rightarrow 1$ $\implies \sup_T E[e^{-r(T-t)}\max\left\{K-S(T),0\right\}]$ $\rightarrow E[\max\left\{K-S(T),0\right\}]\rightarrow\max\left\{K-S(T),0\right\}$ Where the last above row shows that the expected payoff becomes certain. 

Following @Anasta's comments To address the first comment. Creation of money by commercial banks is what I describe above. Briefly but strictly speaking, emission is the physical increase of money supply and this is the exclusive prerogative of Central Banks. Creation of money (thus what I am talking about in the first part of my answer), consists of duplicating scripturally this supplied money. To address the second comment. In practice, the risk of liquidity is (semi-) unobservable, and cannot be managed perfectly. That is why there are standards on banks' minimum capital ratios: using my simplifying/intuiting example above, this capital ratio would be something like [ the amount associated to the first line written in the book ] divided by [ the total written amount (corresponding to the sum of all amounts reported in the book) ]. Also, as just outlined, the first asset (bike) is actually owned by the shareholders of the bank, which subsequently shifts the liquidity risk from the first line to the following lines. But theoretically, the process of scriptural creation can be infinite as soon as the book (above) contains one line (shareholders' equity), used to generate a second one, which could in turn be used to generate a third one, and so on. Indeed the capital ratio can converge asymptotically towards $0$. Theoretically (i.e. if the liquidity risk is perfectly managed) there is no hard constraint. Finally on this point, the constraint is only regulatory, and without it, banks would have the right to rush, soon or later, headlong into disaster. And as you mention, this minimum capital ratio is subjectively determined, and we should expect it to be upward pressured as centuries goes by. To address the third comment. Printed money is nothing more than the emanation of a record, written somewhere. This is even more visible when you use your credit card: does the amount you type when buying something on internet have any sort of physical representation ? Physically not but scripturally it does. And, actually, if you were under the impression that there is no detectable difference between these two kinds of money (bikes), this is because the the "first" bike is also borrowed from someone else. 

German bonds placed as a reference in the eurozone is a form of tacit understanding and i don't think you will find official conventions about this. This practice comes from market Finance pricing technics, as the CAPM, which use a risk (-free-rate) referential to price different kind of assets. Given the higly positive trade balance of Germany, the stability of its revenue base, etc... the country is seen by financing markets as higly creditworthy, i.e. viewed as the "most risk-free" of the eurozone. 

The intellectual link you are doing here is nothing but obvious nor mechanic, and it appears to reflect your confusion regarding the subject. This is possible but not for unequivocal reasons: this ultimately depends on (i) where (stimulated) demands go or (ii) how the "market" perceives (within this context of exogenous/political-based increase in money supply) the strategy of the considered company. E.g. If the market "thinks" that the chosen strategy is the good one, they will probably wants more of company's stocks, which in turn will ceteris paribus increase their prices... 

Actually, the expression more money supply is not clarifying at all (i) which effect is desired and (ii) what really occurs, whence your (really natural) question. What is implicit behind this expression is that commercial banks will have an easier access to (re-)financing. If commercial banks play their role of Money multiplier -- which is not that obvious since they may prefer to clean their balance sheets --, they will basically be more prompt to grant credits. Put differently and using an abusive but pedagogical term: they will be psychologically more prompt to waste money, and thus to stimulate demands here and there. Since growth is very often conceived as being demand led, more demands (of goods or whatever) at a constant level of supply (of those goods or whatever) in turn means inflation, until levels of supply, here and there, adjust and create jobs, generate dividends, etc... To conclude and summarize 

Depending on the object you are looking at, it can be both measured in flow or in stock. To know with what you are dealing with, you must understand the story behind equations. To the practice side of the issue, you cannot make realistic analogy between Solow's capital and, say, tractors. The least abusive perception of $K$ would be cumulated flows of investment in terms of money since, for example in micro-based CGE modelling, it is conceived as representative of the shareholding structure of the economy, and is thus linked to income formation via dividends (see the zero profit condition). In this non-realistic framework, although non-abusively linked to the everyday-life object, $L$ is very similar to $K$, is a self owned stock, and gives right to wages, that are flow objects, as dividends are. Still on the practice side of the issue, the difference between $L$ and labor force is the fact that the former is effectively employed, while the latter is not. Put differently, the link between the two is the labor market, $L$ is a demand, while labor force is a supply, and both form jointly a labor market whose equilibrium is reached via deflation/inflation of wages. Finally, to my knowledge, the fact that the same factor of production (stock) is employed in more than one activity over a given period (flow). is not really a neoclassic native notion, I would say, once again when one refers to CGE modelling, because of the capital market clearing condition. It is more a monetary-macro-financial object, and is, e.g. all what debt is about when dealing with capital. However I do not see any analogy with $L$ in this case. 

And given that you are using US CPI as base, you are very likely to want the logarithm of the ratio. Why ? What would you do If I were asking you to compute the growth rate (relative difference) of two aggregates, say, productions (e.g. of cars), denoted by $Q$, between two consecutive years $t$ and $t+1$ ? Actually, you would use the following formulae: $g_{t} = \frac{Q_{t+1}-Q_{t}}{Q_{t}} = -1 + \frac{Q_{t+1}}{Q_{t}}$ Note that when one computes $g_{t}$ like so, there is a hidden assumption behind. This hidden assumption is that we reasonably suppose our productions to be discrete values. If we were considering those as continuous values (e.g. liters of water), we would actually use an other formulae, as follows $g_{t}^{c} = \ln{\left(\frac{Q_{t+1}}{Q_{t}}\right)}$ Note that $g_{t}^{d} \rightarrow g_{t}^{c}$ when $Q_{t+1}\rightarrow Q_{t}$. Thus, we just compared two types of production over time, conditioning the formulae that is used to what these productions are (discrete versus continuous). What if I were asking you to compare CPIs over two nations ? 

You do not find the same answer because of what I suspect to be a typographical error, which would thus be the main reason of your problem: $x_{03}$ would be set to $80$, not $8$. Another possibility, if you keep $x_{03}=8$, is an error in the second estimated coefficient, say, $\hat{\beta}_2 = -0.1$ instead of $-0.01$. Anyway, one of these modifications solves everything and yields the same result as the solution to this exercise. Considering this change, with $t_{\alpha/2}=1.96476138969835$, one gets Method 1 $\text{CI}(E[y_0|x_0])=[e^{6.43618291164626},e^{6.49755798189177}]=[624.020307335178,663.519326788772]$ (the given solution to this exercise) or Method 2 (as stated In Wooldridge's Intro to Econometrics, in page 212) if we're sure the error terms are normal (and one is extremely lucky) $$\text{CI}(E[y_0|x_0])=\left[e^{s^2/2}624.0203,e^{s^2/2}663.5193 \right] = \left[ 624.0960,663.6002 \right] $$ however the method 2 is very unlikely to be correct, since as you mention in your question [...] the (underestimation) correction should not be used to the CI but only for the point estimation. Why ? I would say because of the dependency betweeen the two terms, knowing the expectations of $e^{s^2/2}$ on the one hand and $\hat{y_0}$ on the other hand does not mean one knows the one of $e^{\frac{s^2}{2} + \hat{\ln(y_0)}}$. 

But in reality, strong monetary policies, which (stimulate demands here and there and thus) disturb markets' equilibria in an unpredictable manner are rarely, not to say never applied, because those who sharehold markets do (not like free volatility an do) not "take that lightly". 

So the second bike, i.e. bike1' (actually the same as bike1), is scriptural. Thus quantities are scripturally not conserved. But the effects on economic activities is anything but scriptural: me, I still enjoy the fact of having this bike, in term of solvency and so on. The borrower can use this bike to go faster (leverage effect to increase her income) than before. When the borrower does not need the bike anymore, she informs the parker, who erases the second line in her book, which destroys the scruptural bike refered to as bike1'. Thus money is an object whose quantity is conserved, but an object that commercial banks can duplicate/create scripturally until the liquidity risk becomes unbearable, i.e., until the probability that everybody wants to use the scriptural money at the same time becomes to high, which would be equivalent to the so-called bank run.
