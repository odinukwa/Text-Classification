Scholars doing research had to go on pilgrimages to find the books where the knowledge the sought was stored. Traveling to different regions was so rare, that there were few or no facilities for them to use (no hotels or restaurants), so they commonly stayed overnight at these monasteries. While the travelers slept, the monks in these monasteries would "steal" knowledge by taking the travelers books and copying them. I could easily see the church and its monasteries taking up a similar role after the apocalypse. It would store all knowledge but especially the knowledge of how to fight the undead. It would also act as a repository for religious items shown to be effective against the undead. In fact, that might become the primary role of the church - manufacturing the weapons of war against the undead. 

An Alderson Disk suffers from almost all of the same problems that a Niven ring world does and has a couple unique to its configuration. Instability One problem is that the structure / star configuration is dynamically unstable. If you perturb the disk / toroid (by say a meteor strike), then it will most likely (eventually) hit the star - to the extreme detriment of all disk inhabitants. Therefore, the disk will require an active control system able to restore the disk (toroid) back to its desired location relative to the star if something perturbs it. Gravitation One bit problem the disk has that the ring world doesn't is gravitation. The disk provides no mechanism for keeping things "stuck to the surface". If you wish to make the disk massive enough to supply its own gravitational field then you end up with a toroid whose cylindrical cross section is that of Earth's in both dimension and composition. The problem is, we haven't mastered the use of materials able to resist isostacy (returning to a spherical shape) under those conditions. Rather than simply supplying a force to keep people stuck to the toroid's surface, it would supply enough force to collapse the toroid into a (large) ball of matter - much to the dismay of the toroid's inhabitants. The extremely bad news about this is that you can't magic the problem away with fantastically strong and lightweight materials. You need that mass for its gravitation and it's the combination of mass and gravitation that will collapse your toroid. Good news Unlike the ring world concept, if you built a self-gravitating toroid, you wouldn't need to spin it to keep things stuck to the inner surface. This significantly reduces the strength of materials requirements (but doesn't get rid of the problems stated above). Realistically I can't see any way to enable this to work nor can I foresee any unless we fundamentally alter our understanding of the Universe. But if you have your heart set on the design, just include the fiction changes required to make it work. I think an extremely light weight design with gravity generators would work (until someone shuts off the power). You'll want some fail safes, along with fail safes for your active stabilization system to keep the toroid/disk from contacting the surface of the star. 

No nuclear power All of our nuclear fission powered reactors use Uranium or Transuranics. So no fission power. No nuclear bombs (either fission or fusion). 

Speed of Transit Of course there are some benefits to the rapid travel. These fall into a few main categories and they are: 

By the time the public becomes aware of the threat - everyone is already infected. Victory is assured, you just need to have a little patience. 

How would we make map for creatures that use scent as their primary sense? How might such a (for example) "smell map" "appear"? How would we create a scent map? 

In a story you can have the machines be at any state you desire by the time of the arrival of the colonists. 

Hemoglobin Hemoglobin uses iron as its metal atom. We are all familiar with hemoglobin and its color red. Hemocyanin Hemocyanin's can be found in certain mollusks. It is colorless when not transporting oxygen and blue when transporting oxygen. Hemocyanin uses 2 copper atoms in its protein structure and the protein is very similar (but not identical) to hemoglobin. Chlorocruorin Chlorocruorin's uses $Fe^{II}$ as its metal ion. 

I was thinking of doing something like a "snow line" scale for my linear scale and then some other marker if the atmospheric composition deviates from the norm. Snow line - planet composition chart 

The configuration is unstable and will not occur naturally. No, it is unstable and the stars will eventually collide or wander off. No. 

Much depends upon the specific animal in question, the fertility of the land, the weather, the regional climate, and other parameters. Lower Bounds However, in the US Midwest, using modern agricultural techniques, in a typical year, and using high intensity farming, hobby farm enthusiasts estimate that it takes 1 acre of farm to support each person for a year. Carrying capacity ($C_{Human}=\frac{kg}{km^2}$) Estimated human population ($P_{human}= 1$) Average Individual human mass ($M_{human}=100 kg$) Area of Cultivation ($A_{\text{Farm}} = 1 Acre = 0.004 km^2$) $$C_{Human} = \frac{P_{Human} \times M_{Human}}{A_{\text{Farm}}} \rightarrow \frac{1 \times 100 kg}{0.004 km^2}=24,710 \frac{kg}{km^2}$$ Real Life Example A real life estimate for natural carrying capacity could be derived from the bison population of the American plains prior to major European settlements. Multiply by the population of bison by their average weight and then divide by the area of that region. Carrying capacity ($C_{Bison}=\frac{kg}{km^2}$) Estimated Bison peak population ($P_{bison}= 60,000,000$) Average Individual Bison mass ($M_{bison}=700 kg$) Area of Great Plains ($A_{\text{Great Plains}} =1,300,000 km^2$) $$C_{Animal} = \frac{P_{bison} \times M_{bison}}{A_{\text{Great Plains}}} \rightarrow \frac{60,000,000 \times 700 kg}{1,300,000 km^2}=32,307 \frac{kg}{km^2}$$ Conclusion These results are close enough to be mutually supportive. For North America Midwest and Great Plains regions, a carrying capacity of $25,000\frac{kg}{km^2}$ to $35,000 \frac{kg}{km^2}$ seems quite reasonable. 

-- A quote from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams Honestly, there's not much the natural world could offer that would make such a trip worthwhile. Some estimate that it would take $ 174 Trillion and 40 years to create and fuel an unmanned, one-way, fly-by type interstellar voyage. From this number, it is not unreasonable to assume a manned mission that stops at its destination will be significantly (10x - 100x) more difficult (I estimate it at $3,480 Trillion). Any natural element, compound, or other natural resource could be had far more cheaply from sources in our solar system. As I see it, there are only three possibilities and each of these is highly unlikely (which is why they would be potentially so valuable). Basically we're need something worth more than the estimated cost of $3,480 Trillion that we cannot find in our Solar System and cannot make ourselves. 1. Alien Artifacts/Technology If aliens left clues that a treasure trove of advanced technology were there or sent signals that we should come visit, this might make a economic, military, or even a scientific visit practical. The return on the investment might be very well be worth our while. Alternatively, a visit to a planet with aliens might similarly be worth the trip, but you'll have to think this through very carefully. What could they offer to make it worth our while that we could not trade via distant communications? Most science, math, music, philosophy, etc. can easily be transmitted. The value of Paintings, sculpture, etc. couldn't justify the tremendous expense of a trip. Materials and building techniques could be transmitted via building plans by long-distance communications. How about a planet with a Stargate on it? Active Stargate 

Question: What is the minimum level of rocketry technology (perhaps type of rocket capable of performing the task?) required to support a civilization that spans the breadth of Saturnian moon system? If you can, try to equate that to a year of human technological development (e.g. liquid fueled rockets developed by Robert Goddard circa 1926). 

An organization exists that is attempting something similar to what you describe. It isn't collecting analog knowledge but it is attempting to collect and archive all digital knowledge. The Internet Archive In it's own words: 

Two-dimensional visualization of an Alcubierre drive, showing the opposing regions of expanding and contracting spacetime that displace the central region. 

Many people posted excellent answers on this already. However, I wanted to add a little story realism / flavor (amplifying the excellent answer provided by Samuel). Let's assume the portal is giant and vessel sizes range from 1 manned flitters up to gargantuan colony ships which fill the entire portal face. To optimize use, you will want to set up unidirectional lanes (as Samuel and other's have said) but you also want "lanes" set up for the smallest common denominator (the small flitter). Split the portal into as many lanes as you can safely manage and allocate the unidirectional lanes according to the amount of traffic going in each direction. Using a lane to transit represents 1 unit of charge (expense) for using the gate. A person flying a cruiser through the portal (which uses 4 lanes) will get charged 4x as much. A freighter that also uses 4 lanes but is slow so it takes twice the time, costs 8x as much as a small flitter lane. How about gargantuan colony ships? They use all lanes and stop traffic going both ways for a considerable amount of time. This probably costs an arm and a leg to pay the transit costs. Transit costs get paid to the transit authority that maintains all hardware, patrol ships, and pays the salary for the space traffic controllers on both sides of the gate. Transit officers on each side send messages back and forth using radio drones informing the other side of impending changes in traffic pattern and the timing of those changes. Wealthy travelers could pay a premium to get moved to the head of the queue to some extent. But if there's lots of traffic, the controllers would be unlikely to take increased toll payments for disrupting all the rest of the traffic. 

No or few consumables Basically food, drink, booze, etc. provide no real long-term advantage. The few items I can think of that would violate this principal would be multivitamins and/or commonly needed drugs (e.g. antibiotics & pain killers). Information Engineering, chemistry, physics texts are nice but the protagonists problems will be more mundane than the theory discussed in those texts. For instance, engineering texts will often discuss alloys and grades of steel for use in different structure. How in the heck are the survivors going to know what steel alloys and grade of alloy they have access to? So field guides would be more practical for acquiring and manufacturing the basic materials. For instance, instead of providing lots of bullets (still a good idea, btw), instructions for finding and refining lead, potassium nitrate, etc. would be even better. Additional instructions on how to make gun cotton will be beneficial too. Nutrition is another area in which information would be very valuable. Provide hardy heritage seeds and instructions for growing the plants, harvesting them, and preserving the very important seeds. Additional field guides on how to find food in wilderness areas would be beneficial. The Rosetta Project has >13,000 pages of information on the world's languages. Rosetta Project Disk 

The Background Imagine a setting in which the only major fictional technology is human teleportation at the speed of light (for this question please ignore the question about how the teleportation device makes it to the destination). Human beings are able to teleport themselves around the nearby stars at the speed of light. What this means in a practical sense is that for the teleported person, no time transpires. Meanwhile for everyone not being teleported, time continues to advance at its normal rate. So a person who teleports to Alpha Centauri A, turns around, and jumps back experiences just seconds of elapsed time. While the people they left back home experience ~8.6 years of elapsed time. There is already a teleport booth/portal network in existence between all habitable planets within teleport range of the Earth. Some of the settlements in the Solar System have these booths/portals but there are also several colonies on inhabitable planets within 15-20 light years of the Earth. Human History Empires like the British and other colonial powers, controlled territories across the globe when it would take months for instructions to pass from the empire's sovereign to the various outposts. So from that perspective there is some precedence of a human government being able to control its various functions with long latency between the issuance of an order and its receipt. Obviously some local functionary would take the role of governor to handle the urgent stuff. The question Could humanity maintain control over such an empire or would it tend to fly apart into independently controlled units (maybe at the stellar system level)? Although I'll accept yes/no, I'm more interested in the reasoning behind that yes/no and will rate answers with explanations higher. Bonus points
