What's tricky is that the problem has a kink. Below a certain production value no capital is used. The demand functions for $k$ and $l$ are as follows: If $Q \leq 180$ $$L(Q) = (Q/20)^2$$ $$K(Q) = 0$$ If $Q > 180$ $$L(Q) = 81$$ $$K(Q) = (Q - 180) / 2$$ Which you can get from thinking about what happens to the marginal cost of producing with labor just below and above $L=81$ (goes from below 4.5 to above 4.5) and comparing it with the the cost of producing a marginal unit with capital (which is always 4.5). Why the split at $Q = 180 / L = 81 $? $$\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}=w/r \leftrightarrow \frac{10L^{-1/2}}{2} = 5/9 \rightarrow L = 81$$ Note that $ Q(k=0,L=81) = 180$ 

One mechanism that holds fixed the prospects of the firm and your own preferences, but changes stock prices is to change the market's discount factor. If discount rates are everywhere higher than before than stock prices must be lower. Is this good for you? Do you want the market to discount the future at a high rate or a low rate? Subject to several caveats, I'd say you'd want to the market to discount at a high rate. A high discount rate will mean that stock prices will be low relative to the price you would place on their discounted profits and therefore you would be getting something you value at high price for a low one. Some critical caveats are as follows:

Is the Discount Window Necessary? A Penn Central Perspective (Calomiris (1993)) That is, banks would rather borrow from the Fed than each other, so the Fed sets its policy rate higher to push banks back into market sources of funds. Then only those shut out of such markets will avail themselves of such funding. 

An increase in risk aversion Lower expected returns for the equity index Higher expected returns for fixed income index Greater positive co-variation of the two funds 

Historically, banks would take deposits, telling depositors that they could withdraw their deposits upon demand. The bank would then take these deposits, combine them with with the equity of the bank's owners, and extend long term term loans to business, governments, and home owners. Under normal circumstances, this is a nice business model, give 3% interest on depositors' accounts, lend the depositors money at 6% interest and then be playing golf at 3pm. You pocket the difference between the deposit rate and the lending rate and live in Connecticut or Luxembourg. The problem is those pesky depositors. Because they know that the bank has tied up most of their money in these illiquid long term loans, they can't possibly pay everyone back if they all show up to demand their money on short notice. Under normal circumstance they have no reason to show up and demand all their money back. But if there are inklings that the bank has lost money on its loans, or even just that you've heard that other people are thinking about pulling their money out, you can have this in no time: 

Marshallian demand is also called uncompensated demand. That is a price changes and you see what changes in what the household buys. This consists of two effects. 

The planner is trying to maximize: $$\Pi = Y - r\cdot K - w\cdot L= min [K, L] - r\cdot K - w\cdot L $$ In perfect competition factors receive their marginal product as price. If $0<w <2$ then $0 < L_s < 100$. This means that the marginal product of capital (MPK) is zero and therefore the price of capital ($r$) should be zero. In this region the marginal product of labor (MPL) is 1, and so there is only one wage that represents a competitive equilibrium, $w*=1 \rightarrow L^* = 50, Y^* = 50, r^* = 0$. What about of $w\geq 2$? In this region the MPL is 0 so this can't be a competitive equilibrium because $2< w \neq MPL$. 

Source: Risk aversion Question 2: Are there more "measures" of risk-attitude? If so, how does the expected payoff change? Check out the Arrow-Pratt measures of absolute and relative risk aversion. Log utility is a special case of when the agent has an Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aversion $\rho=1$. The log actually turns out to be a rather risk-tolerant parametrization of relative risk aversion, consistent with laboratory evidence but at odds with some financial and macroeconomic estimates. 

The first lottery has a certainty equivalent of \$50. The second lottery has no negative payoffs and so shouldn't ever have a negative price. Therefore the certainty equivalent must be $\geq 50$. 

If bidder valuations are dependent on the information revealed by other bids (particularly increasing in their number and level), then we would expect too low bids because bidders have to internalize the effects of their bids on others and reduce them in response. Allowing sniping fixes this problem because last second bids don't give others an opportunity to profit from the new information. 

Leontief and Lexicographic functions, used in preferences or production functions are non-differentiable. Labor models often employ a discrete labor supply (work or don't work, sometimes alongside the decision of how much or how hard to work). Housing models often employ a non-convex adjustment cost to ensure that there is a discontinuity in the cost function for the choice of housing. Kinked objective functions, where at one or more points the left-hand and right-hand limits differ, are also common in economics (e.g. optimal option exercise at maturity) 

Source: STARLING CITY Update: I couldn't find a time series of the holders of Greek debt but here are some additional charts to see the evolution. The first one is more comparable to the pie chart above than the second one which shows only bank holdings. If this is of interest, the BIS's consolidated banking statistics could be used to create a time series of the bank holdings of Greek debt 

How about a hint rather than an exact answer? Put Call Parity concerns the relationship between the prices of European put and call options (with matched strike and expiration dates): $$ C - P = D(F-K) $$ where C and P are the current prices of calls and puts respectively, D is the discount factor, F is the forward price of the asset, and K is the strike price. You can rewrite the equation above to get a the price of a negative call, just solve for $-C$. 

A constrained optimization function maximizes or minimizes an objective subject to one or more constraints. As I understand it, the Lagrangian multiplier approach transforms a constrained optimization problem (I) into an unconstrained optimization problem (II) where the optimal control values to problem II are also the optimal control values to problem I. Additionally, the the objective functions in problems I and II take the same optimal values. The trick is a clever way of putting the constraints into the objective function directly rather than using them separately. I agree with your presentation of the consumer's maximization problem: $\Lambda(x,y,\lambda) = x^{\alpha} y^{1-\alpha} + \lambda ((xp_x+yp_y)-w)$. Now we take the partial derivatives with respect to x an y, set them equal to zero, and then solve for x* and y*. $0=\partial\Lambda / \partial x = \alpha x^{\alpha -1 } y^{1-\alpha} + \lambda p_x = (\alpha / x ) x^{\alpha } y^{1-\alpha} + \lambda p_x$ $\Rightarrow -\lambda = (\alpha / (x p_x)) x^{\alpha } y^{1-\alpha}$ $0 =\partial\Lambda / \partial y = (1 - \alpha) x^{\alpha} y^{-\alpha} + \lambda p_y = ((1 - \alpha) / y ) x^{\alpha } y^{1-\alpha} + \lambda p_y$ $\Rightarrow -\lambda = ((1- \alpha) / (y p_y)) x^{\alpha } y^{1-\alpha}$ $\Rightarrow (\alpha / (x p_x)) x^{\alpha } y^{1-\alpha} = -\lambda = ((1- \alpha) / (y p_y)) x^{\alpha } y^{1-\alpha}$ $\Rightarrow (\alpha / (x p_x)) = ((1- \alpha) / (y p_y))$ $\Rightarrow ( y p_y ) / (1- \alpha) = (x p_x) / \alpha$ (eqn 1) Recover the budget constraint equation by taking the partial derivative $\partial\Lambda / \partial \lambda = 0$. $0 = \partial\Lambda / \partial \lambda = xp_x + yp_y - w \Rightarrow xp_x / w + yp_y /w = 1$ (eqn 2) We now have two equations and two unknowns (x,y) and can solve for x* and y*. $\Rightarrow yp_y / w = xp_x/w \cdot (1 / \alpha - 1) = xp_x/w / \alpha - xp_x/w$ $\Rightarrow 1 = yp_y / w + xp_x/w = xp_x/w / \alpha$ $\rightarrow \alpha = xp_x/w$ (result 1) $\Rightarrow \alpha = xp_x/w = 1 - yp_y /w$ $\rightarrow 1-\alpha =yp_y/w$ (result 2) Results 1 and 2 form the famous constant expenditure shares result for the Cobb-Douglas utility and production functions. Which can also be explicitly solved for x* and y*: $x^* = \alpha w /p_x$ and $y^* = (1-\alpha) w /p_y$ which are the optimal values for both the Lagrangian and the original problems. 

International risk-based capital standard: History and explanation by MC Alfriend (1988) In the United States it isn't just Basel that is changing. FDICIA act of 1991 is also an important regulatory change for regulatory capital standards. My understanding is that Basel I only worried about credit risk but FDICIA introduced capital requirements for interest rate risk as well, perhaps in response to the contemporaneous savings and loan crisis where many thrifts failed as a result of losses from interest rate exposures. 

I believe that @Andrew_M is right, this is caused by differences in default options in the implementations of ARIMA across statistical applications. 

The effect of (1) is always to make you consume less of the good. The effect of (2) is what is ambiguous. An inferior good is one where as you get richer (poorer) you consume less (more) of it. For an inferior good forces (1) and (2) oppose. You consume more of the good because you are poorer and less because it is more expensive. A good (check out Giffen goods) could be so powerfully inferior that the effect of (2) is bigger than the effect of (1). No one seems to be able to find evidence that they exist, but they certainly are possible. Often potatoes in Ireland are used as an example, though they were not. 

Cyclical unemployment is named after the business cycle, as in the part of unemployment that varies with the business cycle. Structures are things that last a long time, so structural unemployment is the part of unemployment that is driven by features of the economy, like structures, that last a long time. But as you intuit, surely the length, frequency, and other details of business cycles are driven by such structural features. That's almost certainly true, and major reason why structural change and good policy are thought by many to explain the great moderation in business cycles. 

No, a deflator greater than 100 means that the price level is higher than in the base year. It doesn't mean that inflation is still occurring. In fact, you could be experiencing deflation after a period of inflation and if prices today are still higher than the base year, have the deflator be above 100. A growing deflator is an indication of inflation. To detect inflation acceleration you'd need to see changes in the log(deflator) growing over time. 

I don't think they are "sure", but the weights are based on the American Consumer Expenditure Survey which has a big sample size, a carefully chosen sampling frame, professionally executed sample gathering, and a large team of experts crafting questions and collating the data. 

Kaushik Basu has proposed (Why, for a Class of Bribes, the Act of Giving a Bribe should be Treated as Legal) legalizing paying bribes to separate the ties of criminality between the bribe payer and receiver. This allows the bribe payer to pay the bribe and report the bribe taker. If bribe paying is illegal then the shared criminality prevents this. Dina Pomeranz empirically examines the widely held belief that VAT taxes discourage tax evasion (No Taxation without Information Deterrence and Self-Enforcement in the Value Added Tax) and finds that they do indeed discourage tax evasion: 

I don't have advice specific to error correcting model (ECM) setting, but in undergraduate applied econometric class they gave us the generic advice to continue to extend lags in the model until the residuals of the fitted model were serially uncorrelated. For example, in the US life expectancy data, residuals of male life expectancy is serially uncorrelated in the AR(5) model but not the AR(4) model. You can see this for yourself with the following Stata code: 

Intuitively, the marginal utility of x falls faster than the marginal utility of y (which is actually constant), so with enough money all marginal funds go into y. Similarly, with enough money, an decrease in money only reduces the quantity of y, not x. But you should know this isn't true globally. If $$m < \frac{p_y^2}{4 p_x}$$ then the demand functions are: $$x_M =\frac{m}{p_x}$$ $$y_M = 0$$
