Appendix: orbit averages Orbit averages of $v_rf(r)$ with an abitrary (but integrable) function $f(r)$ can be directly calculated for any type of periodic orbit. Let $F(r)$ be the antiderivative of $f(r)$, i.e. $F'\!=f$, then the orbit average is: $$ \langle v_r f(r)\rangle = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T v_r(t)\,f\!\left(r(t)\right) \mathrm{d}t = \frac{1}{T} \left[F\left(r(t)\right)\right]_0^T = 0 $$ with $T$ the orbital period. For the orbit averages required in $\langle\dot{\boldsymbol{e}}\rangle$, we must dig a bit deeper. For a Keplerian elliptic orbit $$ \boldsymbol{r}=a\left((\cos\eta-e)\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}+\sqrt{1-e^2}\sin\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\right)\qquad\text{and}\qquad r=a(1-e\cos\eta) $$ with eccentricity vector $\boldsymbol{e}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\equiv\hat{\boldsymbol{h}}\wedge\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}$ a vector perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{e}$ and $\boldsymbol{h}$. Here, $\eta$ is the eccentric anomaly, which is related to the mean anomaly $\ell$ via $ \ell=\eta-e\sin\eta, $ such that $\mathrm{d}\ell=(1-e\cos\eta)\mathrm{d}\eta$ and an orbit average becomes $$ \langle\cdot\rangle = (2\pi)^{-1}\int_0^{2\pi}\cdot\;\mathrm{d}\ell = (2\pi)^{-1}\int_0^{2\pi}\cdot\;(1-e\cos\eta)\mathrm{d}\eta. $$ Taking the time derivative (note that $\dot{\ell}=\Omega=\sqrt{GM/a^3}$ the orbital frequency) of $\boldsymbol{r}$, we find for the instantaneous (unperturbed) orbital velocity $$ \boldsymbol{v}=v_c\frac{\sqrt{1-e^2}\cos\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}-\sin\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}}{1-e\cos\eta} $$ where I have introduced $v_c\equiv\Omega a=\sqrt{GM/a}$, the speed of the circular orbit with semimajor axis $a$. From this, we find the radial velocity $v_r=\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{v}=v_c e\sin\eta(1-e\cos\eta)^{-1}$ and the rotational velocity $$ \boldsymbol{v}_t = v_c\frac{\sqrt{1-e^2}(\cos\eta-e)\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}-(1-e^2)\sin\eta\,\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}}{(1-e\cos\eta)^2}. $$ With these, we have [corrected again] $$ \left\langle \frac{h^2v_r\boldsymbol{r}}{r^4}\right\rangle = \Omega v_c^2\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\, \frac{e(1-e^2)^{3/2}}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\sin^2\!\eta}{(1-e\cos\eta)^4}\mathrm{d}\eta =\frac{\Omega v_c^2e}{2(1-e^2)}\hat{\boldsymbol{k}} \\ \left\langle \frac{v_r^2\boldsymbol{v}_t}{r}\right\rangle = \Omega v_c^2\, \hat{\boldsymbol{k}}\, \frac{e^2(1-e^2)^{1/2}}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\sin^2\!\eta(\cos\eta-e)}{(1-e\cos\eta)^4}\mathrm{d}\eta=0, $$ in particular, the components in direction $\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}$ average to zero. Thus [corrected again] $$\left\langle 2\frac{h^2v_r\boldsymbol{r}}{r^4}-\frac{v_r^2\boldsymbol{v}_t}{r}\right\rangle =\frac{\Omega v_c^2e\,\hat{\boldsymbol{k}}}{(1-e^2)} $$ 

does that mean inflation occurred before the current laws of physics (read the four basic forces) precipitated, was c greater then than it is now? NO Already the very concept of an expansion velocity is flawed. Expansion means that elements of the medium move away from each other with a relative velocity that is proportional to their distance (for small distances). The constant of proportionality, the expansion rate, is the sensible concept here and has dimension of a frequency. Currently the universe expands at about 73km/s/Mpc, which is the smallest natural frequency known. At the epoch of infation, the expansion rate was just much larger. Of, course, over large sufficiently distances, any expansion results in superluminal velocities, but the laws of phyiscs only constrain the relative velocities of objects in close vicinity. 

There are two issues: Would there be gravitational waves to be detected and would LIGO detect them. On the first issue, gravitational waves are quadrupolar, and a cylindrically symmetric system will not produce any. (Specifically, the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment of an isolated system's stressâ€“energy tensor must be non-zero in order for it to emit gravitational radiation.) So a head-on collision of equally massive black holes would not produce significant gravitational waves. If the BHs were of different masses, or the collision not quite head-on, gravitational waves would be produced. On the second issue there are at least three ways LIGO might might miss them. First, they might simply be too faint. A merger through rotation is one of the best ways to produce gravitational waves, and a head-on collision is one of the worst (during a BH merger, of course). A second way it might miss is if the merger is in one of its blind spots. Each LIGO detector has blind spots and there's no rule that says a BH merger can't be in one of them. (In fact, the neutron star merger was located by use of the blind spots. The third gravitational wave (GW) detector, Virgo, in Italy, didn't pick up the neutron star merger. It was bright/loud enough that it should have, which meant that the merger was in one of Virgo's blind spots, which helped to narrow down its location. A GW detected in only one detector would be listed as a possible GW, but not as a detection, because it might simply be terrestrial interference. But another way it might miss is if LIGO had not been looking for the waveform of that kind of merger. General Relativity allows us to compute in very good detail the GW signal from any type of collision that we think likely. Because the GW signals are so faint, the first step of detection is matching computed GW waveforms to the data and looking for matches. Once a match is found, the signal is analyzed in more detail, but they have to know where to look. If no one expected the waveform and it was not strong enough to pop out of the data and yell "Here I am, dummy!" it might be missed. Since head-on collisions are expected to be very rare, it's possible that they are not in the library of waveforms that LIGO checks. 

Dark matter is not distributed evenly. It forms clouds, it concentrates in galaxies, it forms hairs around celestial bodies. A google search for dark energy distribution floods me with dark matter distribution results. How is dark energy distributed? Does it cover the space uniformly, at even density, or does it create areas of concentration or other irregular forms? 

The closest thing I could find that would cover more than innermost piece of corona is for sigma binaries. As if solar corona outer reaches were a taboo not to be spoken of, the graphs for it are always cut off way before its peak, never mind fade region. src 

Other sources I found also give the density either as percentage of mass of the universe, or just as mass density like above, $kg/m^3$ or similar. In about all other applications and contexts of usage of energy density, I'd find MJ/L, or other units of energy per volume. Why is energy of density given as mass per volume, and how do I convert it to more familiar units? Using $E=mc^2$ ? 

Mass. The more massive a body, the larger the gap between its lowest and highest orbit; the range of speeds at which a random body entering its gravity is likely to remain as its satellite. Sun has millions of satellites if you count all the asteroids; smaller planets tend to have one or two moons at most (Pluto with five being a notable and not fully explained exception) To a lesser degree there's a matter of shape too. A regularly round body will have more regular and stable orbit than a potato-shaped one. Jupiter, being a gas giant is perfectly round. This doesn't play that much of a role though, especially with higher orbits. And last but not least, no destabilizing influence of other bodies. It's very hard to maintain a lunar orbit - artificial satellites around our Moon last only a couple years each, because relatively close neighborhood of Earth tends to destabilize orbit of anything orbiting the Moon. Jupiter being a single massive planet with relatively tiny (relatively to its mass) moons doesn't have them influence each other all that much. 

No Near-Earth objects (NEOs) may be temporarily captured to oribt Earth as discussed in the reference quoted in the question. Such a capture must invariably involve the NEO to pass by the L1 or L2 points, which are the saddle points in the co-rotating binary potential of the Earth-Sun system. Thus, these objects have just high enough co-rotating energy (Jacobi constant) to enter the region around the Earth via those saddle points. Since they can only escape that region by exiting through the same saddle points, it may take a while before they "find" the exit, i.e. they are temporarily captured. However, as I read that paper, there is no expectation of NEOs captured on orbits around the L1/L2 points. In fact, there are no stable orbits around those Lagrange points and hence no such captured satellites are expected. Indeed, this is one of the major benefits of putting an artificial satellite there. It also means that, in order to keep Gaia at L2, it will need to correct its orbit from time to time. Otherwise, it will eventually drift off the L2 region. This has the advantage that no space debris from missions like this will accumulate there. Thus, to answer your question: there are no satellites orbiting near L2 to be discovered. The chance of any asteroid passing by (on its way to or from temporary capture) is rather small or, equivalently, the typical NEO passing there on a regular basis is tiny (1m or so), i.e. hardly detectable. Moreover, any NEO moving near Gaia will have a huge proper motion and be highly unlikely to be seen on more than one scan (and different sightings cannot be related). Of course, NEOs elsewhere can and will be detected by Gaia, as discussed in another answer, in particular Trojan asteroids (orbiting L4/L5 on stable orbits) of Earth and Mars. 

As I understood tidal heating, it comes from tidal force acting upon a body as it spins, distorting it; the wave of distortion travels along the surface (along with apparent travel of the other body on the sky) and continued friction as the matter is strained into the traveling wave is the source of tidal heating. Now, if the two bodies are in a tidal lock, the distortion remains constant - it doesn't move. There's no new work done as the bodies remain immobile relative to each other. The tidal heating should be a flat zero. Meanwhile, Io has immense volcanic activity attributed to tidal heating - despite it being tidally locked to Jupiter. While it still heats Jupiter, dragging its own tidal wave around it, Jupiter shouldn't contribute any heat to Io as its distortion remains constant over time, a stable equilibrium. Is that just residual heat from times when Io was spinning or am I missing something? 

Comet tail always aims away from the sun, as it's torn from the comet's gas cloud by solar wind. It trails slightly behind, as the comet moves along its orbit while the gas travels directly away, but that's relatively minor - the speed at which the gas and particles are pulled away forming the tail is much higher than the comet's orbital velocity. Your visualisation shows it trailing behind the comet as if it was moving in some gaseous/liquid medium that stops the lighter particles while letting the heavy comet head travel ahead. This is not the case - as the comet is far away from the sun, the gas cloud just forms its atmosphere and travels with the comet. As it approaches though, the intensity of solar wind increases and it pulls away the atmosphere which can't be protected against it by magnetic field or strong gravity, as the comet has neither. 

I'm not sure what you mean by "nebulae". You could mean "matter in a gaseous or plasma state" or "cloud of low density gas and dust in space" (which is what astronomers mean by nebulae.) The former case is believed to be correct, and it pretty well described in Wikipedia. I'll summarize. Immediately after the Big Bang (10-20 seconds or so) the universe was full of extremely hot and extremely dense matter -- hot enough that not only did atoms come apart, and nuclei come apart, but even protons and neutrons came apart into a quark-gluon plasma. This cooled into a stew of elementary particles, which cooled into mostly protons, neutrons and electrons, which cooled partly into nuclei. At this point we're maybe a minute into the expansion and the universe was full of a plasma that was still hotter than the center of a star. After around 300,000 years, the plasma cooled enough to recombined into atoms. Stars eventually started to form. No astronomer would call any stage of this expansion a "nebula" -- they first formed later after the atomic gas left a milion years after the Big Bang started to condense into stars and patches of gas and patches close to vacuum. Bottom line: Nebulae did not exist until millions of years after the Big Bang, but the universe was filled with hot gas much earlier in the Big Bang. 

The Wikipedia article says that Spica A has 8 times the luminosity of Spica B (presumably that's at maximum.) Magnitude is -2.5*log10(I/I0). So if the combined magnitude is 0.97, the magnitude of component A is ~1.1 and the magnitude of component B is ~3.3. 

What can be said about 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko axial tilt? Is it fixed (if so, at what value), only changing with precession (at what rate?) or does 67P "tumble" with axial tilt changing over time? (and if so, at what rate?) I'm interested in estimating the 'polar night' area of the comet, and how it changes over time - but without knowing the rotation properties this is quite hard to do. 

So far I got to understand the expansion of space is not to be understood as stars drifting further apart through space. There's something more fundamental - e.g. you can't simply measure speed of it, nor tell where the center of the universe (the midpoint of expansion) is. Well, some smart people got me from knowing the answer that is "Simple, obvious, neat and wrong" to "I have no clue what it is". Is there a resource/method that would allow a layman to understand how to think about distortions of space like its expansion; to visualize and understand the concept correctly and without erroneous simplifications; understand it before trying to delve into underlying details of physics? 

...today I must have left my brain home. I know it's a simple calculation but I keep failing simplest calculations today. What is the angular diameter of Earth as seen from the surface of the Moon? 

Orbital radius depends on speed of the body. Size is largely irrelevant. Imagine a space craft and much larger space station, able to orbit meters apart at the same speed, with engines switched off. An astronaut going on a spacewalk would be launched away from the station, being much smaller and so on wrong orbit. No. It's as relevant as "Boeing 747 shouldn't be able to fly because it's painted the wrong color." False and based on wrong premise. For anything to ring you need atmosphere, a medium for sound to travel through. Moon, floating in vacuum, doesn't ring, nor create any other sound for that matter. Even the most powerful meteor impacts are entirely silent. False and based on wrong premise. Countless iron meteorites hit the surface of the Moon, often shattering on impact. Specks of iron are very common in lunar soil, and I have no doubt it's entirely possible shavings-shaped pieces of lunar meteor might have found their way into the samples. Likely True and nothing odd about it. ...how does that even relate?
