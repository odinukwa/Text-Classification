Nathan's paper linked above mostly makes a definition and gives proofs in types A and B. Later research has focused on other types and connections to other areas of math. Here what I consider the other main papers in this vein. 

Instead, let me say a few things to make the argument seem plausible. First of all, a sanity check: $g(\theta) = g(2 \theta)$; just change $\ell$ to $\ell+1$. This is as it should be. (I don't know why Spencer insists that $\theta \in [1,2)$.) Second, the effect is numerically quite small. I get a minimum of 0.721342 near $\theta = 1.3$ and a maximum of $0.721354$ near $\theta = 1.9$. Finally, let me try to sketch the heuristic which convinced me the result was reasonable. I don't know if this will make sense to anyone but me. Let's imagine two marathons, which start out with $1.5 \cdot 2^u$ and $2^u$ people, for some large $u$. Very roughly, if we run the first one for a single dance, it will drop down to $1.5 \cdot 2^{u-1}$ people. Then, if we run the second one for one dance, it will drop down to $2^{u-1}$. If we keep going in this manner, the numbers keep jumping over each other while staying in fixed ratio, until we get down to small values, say $12$ and $8$. There is no reason the odds for $n=12$ and $n=8$ should be the same, so why should they be for $1.5 \cdot 2^u$ and $2^u$. More carefully, but still heuristically, if we start with $1.5 \cdot 2^u$ people, the number of people at the next step is a distribution, centered at $1.5 \cdot 2^{u-1}$ but with standard deviation $\sqrt{1.5 \cdot 2^u}$. Think of it as $1.5 \cdot 2^u \cdot 2^{-1} \cdot (1 \pm 2^{-u/2})$. At the next step, $1.5 \cdot 2^u \cdot 2^{-2} \cdot (1 \pm 2^{-u/2})(1 \pm 2^{-(u-1)/2})$. And continuing down $1.5 \cdot 2^{u-k} \cdot (1 \pm 2^{-u/2})(1 \pm 2^{-(u-1)/2}) \cdots$. So the ratio between the two marathons is like $$1.5 {\Big (} (1 \pm 2^{-u/2})(1 \pm 2^{-(u-1)/2}) \cdots {\Big)}^2$$ where we truncate the product at some fixed power of $2$; perhaps at $1 \pm 16^{-1}$. As $u$ grows, that product stays bounded, so the ratio is still staying roughly fixed, not spreading out all the way between $0$ and $\infty$. So I still buy the argument of the paragraph above. 

There's a paper of H. L. Royden "Holomorphic fiber bundles with hyperbolic fiber", Proc. AMS, Volume 43, Number 2, April 1974 which proves "Theorem: The holomorphic fiber bundles with hyperbolic fiber M and base B are in natural one-to-one correspondence with the homomor- phisms of the fundamental group of B into the group of biholomorphic automorphisms of M onto itself. " In other words, it appears that holomorphic disc bundles are naturally flat. Note: the first projection $p_1: \mathbb{B}^2\to \mathbb{D}$ of the real 4-ball to the disc is not a holomorphic bundle of discs, because it is not locally trivial. To see why, suppose we have an isomorphism $f:p_1^{-1}(D)\to D\times \mathbb{D}$ of bundles over a sufficently small disc $D$ of radius $r<1$ around zero. Write $f(x,y) = (x, f_2(x,y))$. Now choose $y_0\in p_1^{-1}(0)$ with $\sqrt{1-r^2} <|y_0|< 1$, so that it is sent via the second projection $p_2:\mathbb{B}^2\to\mathbb{D}$ outside the disc of radius $\sqrt{1-r^2}$. By assumption, $p_1$ has a section $s$ over $D$ passing through $y_0$ -- this is just a level set of $f_2$. Composing, we obtain $ h=p_2\circ s : D\to \mathbb{D}$. I claim $h$ fails the maximum modulus principle for holomorphic functions. Why? Any circle of sufficiently large radius in $D$ must be sent by $h$ inside a disc of radius strictly less than $|y_0|$ around $0$. Meanwhile, the center of the disc $D$ is sent to $p_2(y_0)$, which has norm equal to $|y_0|$. This goes against the maximum principle or the Gauss mean value theorem, if you like. 

I thought it might be nice to couple Terry Tao's great general answer by showing we can write down an explicit limit to the classical case for the simple harmonic oscillator. These solutions are an example of "coherent states". I learned this from an old blog post by John Baez which I can't find right now; Wikipedia has a less helpful exposition. We work with an oscillator of frequency $\omega$, so the potential energy is $(1/2) m \omega^2 x^2$ and Shrodinger's equation is $$i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2}{(\partial x)^2} \psi + \frac{m \omega^2}{2} x^2 \psi.$$ As usual, it is convenient to define $$a = \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar}}\left(x+\frac{\hbar}{m \omega} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) \quad \mbox{annihilation}$$ $$a^{\dagger} = \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar}}\left(x-\frac{\hbar}{m \omega} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) \quad \mbox{creation}.$$ The lowest energy state is the kernel of $a$, namely $\psi_0 := \exp(-m \omega x^2/(2 \hbar))$; it gives rise to the solution $e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0$. Then $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}} (a^{\dagger})^n \psi_0$ is the $n$-th energy state, so $e^{i (n+1/2) \omega t} (a^{\dagger})^n \psi_0$ is the $n$-th solution to the time dependent equation (up to normalization). I prefer to rewrite this as $(e^{i \omega t} a^{\dagger})^n (e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0)$. If $F(z)=\sum f_n z^n$ is any power series then, at least formally, $F(e^{i \omega t} a^{\dagger})(e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0)$ is a solution of Schroedinger's equation, since it is a linear combination of the pure energy states above. In particular, take $F(z) = \exp(C z)$ for some scalar $C$. So $$\exp\left( C e^{i \omega t} \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar}}\left(x-\frac{\hbar}{m \omega} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) \right) (e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0)$$ solve Schrodinger's equation. We reduce clutter by setting $C\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2 m \omega}}=R$; the constant $R$ has units of distance. So our solution is $$\exp\left( e^{i \omega t} \left(\frac{R m \omega}{\hbar} x-R \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) \right) (e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0)$$ Now, the commutator of $\tfrac{R m \omega}{\hbar} x$ and $R \tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}$ is $\tfrac{m R^2 \omega}{\hbar}$, which commutes with both $x$ and $\partial/\partial x$. So, by Baker-Cambell-Hausdorff (and discarding some global constants) we can rewrite $(\ast)$ as $$\exp(e^{2 i\omega t} \tfrac{m R^2 \omega}{\hbar}) \exp(e^{i \omega t}\tfrac{R m \omega}{\hbar} x ) \exp\left( -e^{i \omega t} R \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \right) (e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0).$$ The exponential of differentiation is translation, so this is $$\exp(e^{2 i\omega t} \tfrac{m R^2 \omega}{\hbar}) \exp(e^{i \omega t}\tfrac{R m \omega}{\hbar} x ) (e^{i \omega t/2} \psi_0(x-R e^{i \omega t})).$$ One can then do a bunch of work translating each formula into its real and complex part, which I omit. At the end of the day, one get's a solution to Schrodinger's equation which roughly looks like $$e^{i A(t)} \exp\left(\tfrac{m \omega}{\hbar} \left[-(x-R \cos(\omega t))^2/2 - i R \sin(\omega t) x \right] \right).$$ Here $A$ is a big messy function I am unwilling to work out. This is the sort of gaussian beam solution Terry was talking about -- it is localized both in position and in Fourier space. In position space, it is a Gaussian centered at $x=R \cos (\omega t)$. As $\hbar \to 0$ (with $R$ fixed), the Gaussian becomes tighter and tighter until, in the limit, it is a delta function at $R \cos (\omega t)$ -- the classical solution to the problem. Meanwhile, the momentum is a Gaussian centered at $-m R \omega \sin(\omega t)$. Again, as $\hbar \to 0$, the Gaussian becomes a delta function at $-m R \omega \sin(\omega t)$ -- the classical solution. (Of course, you could ignore all the discussion about $a$ and $a^{\dagger}$ and just directly check that this solves Schrodinger's equation. If you do, please let me know what constants I left out!) If one tries to take the $\hbar \to 0$ limit of some simpler solutions like the pure energy states, they bunch up at the origin while spreading out over all of momentum space. You need a moderately complicated solution like this to get both limits to make sense. I will close by noting a heuristic way to think about $\exp(C a^{\dagger})$. The coefficient of the $n$-th energy state is $C^n/\sqrt{n!}$ (putting in the correct normalization constant.) So, if we observe the energy of this particle, we have probability proportional to $C^{2n}/n!$ of getting the answer $(n+1/2) \hbar \omega$. In other words, the energy of this particle is a Poisson random variable with expected value $C^2 \hbar \omega+\hbar \omega/2$. Plugging in for $C^2$, this is $m R^2 \omega^2/2+\hbar \omega/2$. The $m R^2 \omega^2/2$ term is the energy of the classical solution. So this solution may be thought of as the best attempt to mimic an energy of $m R^2 \omega^2/2$ when we only have access to the discrete levels $n \hbar \omega$. 

Consider $J^{g-1}$, the variety of degree $g-1$ line bundles on a compact Riemann surface of genus $g$. Recall that $J^{g-1}$ is a torsor for the Jacobian, thus has dimension $g$. We can produce elements in $J^{g-1}$ by choosing $g-1$ points $p_1,\ldots,p_{g-1}$ and constructing the associated line bundle to the divisor $p_1+\cdots+p_{g-1}$. In this way, we obtain a $g-1$-dimensional family of elements of $J^{g-1}$, forming the so-called $\Theta$ divisor. Elements of the $\Theta$ divisor may be distinguished from other points in $J^{g-1}$ by the fact that they represent line bundles admitting sections, i.e. $h^0(L)\neq 0$. For degree $g-1$ line bundles, the Riemann-Roch theorem gives $h^0(L)=h^1(L)$, so over $J^{g-1}$ we see that $h^0(L),h^1(L)$ are generically zero and jump along the $\Theta$ divisor. One might imagine that there are vector bundles $V,W$ over $J^{g-1}$ of the same rank, with fibres over $L\in J^{g-1}$ given by Dolbeault $0$- and $1$-forms with coefficients in $L$ respectively, together with a bundle map $\overline{\partial}:V\rightarrow W$ which is generically an isomorphism but drops rank along $\Theta$; then $\det \overline{\partial}$ would be a section of a line bundle $\det V^*\otimes\det W$ over $J^{g-1}$ which cuts out $\Theta$. This line bundle turns out to be a well-defined object called the determinant line bundle and it was introduced by Quillen. Quillen's construction of the line bundle proceeds by replacing the family of (2-term) Dolbeault complexes parametrized by $J^{g-1}$ by a quasi-isomorphic family of finite-dimensional (2-term) complexes and taking the determinant line bundle of this. The finite-dimensional replacement for the Dolbeault complex is given by the Dolbeault operator acting on forms lying in the first few eigenspaces of the Laplacian, roughly speaking. Then as we move along $J^{g-1}$, some of the eigenvalues may hit zero and we have a jump of $h^0(L)$. For a good list of references for the above, see determinant line bundle (nlab). My question: What is a simple, modern construction of the determinant line bundle on $J^{g-1}$, perhaps one which uses the tools of algebraic geometry? It may well be tautological from some point of view, in which case I would probably be unsatisfied. Also, if you wish to rhapsodize on determinant line bundles, please feel free. My motivation: Many of the classic papers by Beauville, Narasimhan, Ramanan etc. on moduli of vector bundles expend a lot of effort working with determinant line bundles and extracting information from them in quite ad-hoc and clever ways. I'd like to understand these better. 

Several warnings: (0) You didn't say that you want every cone of your fan to be of the form $\mathrm{cone}(T)$, for $T \subseteq S$, but I assume that you meant to. If not, there will be infinitely many fans meetng your conditions, because you can always insert new vertices. (1) There can be fans which do not support any convex piecewise linear function. Such fans are called non-coherent or non-regular. They do not correspond to cones of the secondary fan. (2) As I have described it, the secondary fan lives in $\mathbb{R}^S$. Note that, if $\lambda$ is a linear function on $\mathbb{R}^d$, then $f$ and $f+\lambda$ always lie in the same cone of the secondary fan, so the secondary fan is invariant under this action of $(\mathbb{R}^d)^{\vee}$. Many references quotient by this action. (3) Many references specialize to the case that $S$ lies in an affine hyperplane, and then draw their pictures in $\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$. I think GKZ does this, which might be part of your difficulty. (4) You mention Stanley-Reisner ideals. You don't say what your motivation is, but it sounds like you might be computing Grobner degenerations of toric varieties. If so, remember that these can be nonreduced, and the secondary fan will only see the reduced structure. See Sturmfels paper Gröbner bases of toric varieties for details. 

I've had difficulty finding sources which treat the classification of holomorphic disc bundles over (compact and noncompact) Riemann surfaces. Note that by "bundle", I mean a holomorphic fiber bundle, which means it is locally holomorphically trivial. I'm really just looking for information about holomorphic disc bundles, but if you want a specific question: What is the classification of holomorphic disc bundles over a Riemann surface? 

It appears these lattices can be described as a kind of twisted product of the simple lattice $[n]=\{0,1,2,\ldots, n-1\}$ with the usual order. To construct the lattice of subsequences of the sequence of weakly decreasing positive integers $(k_1,\ldots, k_N)$, let $m(k)$ be the multiplicity of the integer $k$ in the given sequence and form the product $$[d(1)]\times \cdots \times [d(N)],$$ equipped with the order $(a_1,\ldots, a_N)\leq (b_1,\ldots, b_N)$ iff $$a_N\leq b_N$$ $$a_N+a_{N-1}\leq b_N + b_{N-1}$$ $$\ldots$$ $$a_N+\cdots + a_1\leq b_N+\cdots + b_1.$$ For example, for the sequence $(3,2,1,1)$, we have $d(1)=2$ and $d(2)=d(3)=1$, so that the lattice is given by $[2]\times [1]\times [1]$, with the order given above. This must be a standard construction in poset/lattice theory, please let me know if you've seen it somewhere. 

Here are two true statements like this. I assume we are talking about two player games with finite strategy sets. Let the number of strategies of the two players be $p$ and $q$. 

The Bernoulli numbers are closely related to alternating permutations. That is to say, permutations like $1524376$ where the numbers alternately go up and down. Specifically, if $A_n$ is the number of such permutations of an $n$ element set, then $$B_{2n} = (-1)^{n-1} \frac{2n}{4^{2n}-2^{2n}} A_{2n-1}.$$ It's possible you could somehow relate your sums over diagrams to alternating permutations. 

GC Lie groups: these are Lie groups equipped with GC structures compatible with the multiplication map. Holomorphic Poisson Lie groups are an example of this, but there are others. For example, the known examples of generalized Kahler structures on compact even-dimensional semisimple Lie groups (we just need a bi-invariant metric, not all hypotheses are necessary) consist of two commuting GC structures, one of which is multiplicative in the above sense, and the other of which is a GC homogeneous space over the GC Lie groupd defined by the first. This situation will be familiar to those in Poisson Lie Group theory, and this is joint work in progress with Jiang-Hua Lu. David is of course correct in his statement that GC actions of GC Lie groups would then define GC action groupoids. B-symplectic groupoids as described in $URL$ These are, first and foremost, symplectic groupoids, but they have an extra 2-form making them GC Lie groupoids. Any holomorphic Poisson groupoid is an example of a generalized complex groupoid. For example, if Z is a Poisson manifold, then $Z\times Z$ is a Poisson groupoid and hence a generalized complex groupoid. 

I've been staring at Zassenhaus's table, and it looks to me like there is a uniform way to describe all the exceptional near fields. Let $\Gamma$ be a finite subgroup of the quaternions, with entries in number field $K$. Let $\pi$ be a prime of $\mathcal{O}_K$ which does not appear in the denominator of any of the entries of $\Gamma$ and let $p$ be the norm of $\pi$. Assume $p$ is odd. Then we can reduce the entries of $\Gamma$ modulo $\pi$ and get a subgroup of $\mathbb{F}_p\langle i,j \rangle / (i^2=j^2=-1,\ ij=-ji)$. This ring is known to be isomorphic to $\mathrm{Mat}_{2 \times 2}(\mathbb{F}_p)$, so we get an action of $\Gamma$ on $\mathbb{F}_p^2$. In all of the examples that occur, we can make this more explicit: In each case $\pi$ is principal and we can choose a generator $\alpha$ which is a sum $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$ of four squares in $K$. So we can realize the vector space $\mathbb{F}_p^2$ explicitly as the quotient of the quaternions by the right ideal generated by $g:=a+bi+cj+dk$. All of Zassenhaus's examples are of the form $\Gamma \times C$ acting on $\mathbb{F}_p^2$, where $C$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{F}_p^{\ast}$ acting by scalars and chosen such that $p^2-1 = |\Gamma| \times |C|$. In terms of the original question, we then take $n=p^2$ and $G = (|\Gamma| \times |C|) \ltimes (\mathbb{Z}/p)^2$. The tetrahedral cases Take $\Gamma$ to be the double cover of the rotational symmetries of the tetrahedron. This can be embedded in the quaternions with rational coefficients, as the group $\{ \pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k, (\pm 1 \pm i \pm j \pm k)/2 \}$. So $|\Gamma|=24$. We can take $p=5$, $g=2+i$, $|C|=1$ or $p=11$, $g=3+i+j$, $|C|=5$. The octahedral cases Take $\Gamma$ to be the double cover of the rotational symmetries of the octahedron. This can be embedded in the quaternions with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$. So $|\Gamma| = 48$. We can take $p=7$, $\pi = (3 + \sqrt{2})$ and $g=(1+\sqrt{2}/2) + i+j/2+k/2$ and $|C|=1$. We can also take $p=23$, $\pi = (5+\sqrt{2})$ and $g=(1+\sqrt{2}/2) + 3i/2+j+k/2$ and $|C|=11$. The dodecahedral cases Take $\Gamma$ to be the double cover of the rotational symmetries of the octahedron. This can be embedded in the quaternions with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$. So $|\Gamma| = 120$. We can take $p=11$, $\pi = (4+\sqrt{5})$ and $g = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2+(1 + \sqrt{5})/2 i + j$ and $|C|=1$. We can also take $p=29$, $\pi = (7+2 \sqrt{5})$, $g=(1+\sqrt{5}) + i$ and $|C|=7$. Finally, we can take $p=59$, $\pi = (8+\sqrt{5})$, $g=(1 + \sqrt{5})/2+(1 + \sqrt{5})/2 i + 2j+k$ and $|C|=29$. 

If $M$ is a smooth complex manifold and $N$ is a smooth complex surface, we may ask when a holomorphic map $f:M\rightarrow N$ lifts to a map $f:M\rightarrow [N:p]$, where $[N:p]$ denotes the blowup of $N$ in a point $p\in N$. The answer, which provides a universal property for $[N:p]$, is that the map lifts whenever the pullback of the ideal sheaf of $p$, i.e. $f^{-1}I_p\otimes_{f^{-1}O_N}O_M$, is locally free of rank 1 on $M$. In other words, the functions $x,y$ cutting out $p$ pull back to $M$ to define a divisor. Question: Let $M$ be a smooth real manifold and $N$ a smooth complex surface. When does a smooth map $f:M\rightarrow N$ lift to the complex blowup $[N:p]$? I believe it is true that the map lifts whenever $f^{-1}I_p\otimes_{f^{-1}O_N} C^\infty_M$ is locally free of rank 1 over the sheaf of $C^\infty$ complex-valued functions, in other words it generates a complex line bundle. I would especially like to know if this result appears in the literature. 

Chang 2012 and others study $$\zeta(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k):= \sum_{\deg(a_1) < \deg(a_2) < \cdots < \deg(a_k)} \frac{1}{a_1^{s_1} \cdots a_k^{s_k}}.$$ 

This is an attempt to summarize some work related to question 2 which I do not fully understand myself. I am summarizing Sections 1.1 and 1.2 of Dudko's thesis, whose exposition is excellent (including work of earlier authors which he describes). Set $F(z) = e^z-1$, so $F(z) = z+z^2/2+z^3/6+O(z^4)$. This discussion will apply to functional square roots of any $F(z)$ of the form $z+c z^2+O(z^3)$ for $c \neq 0$. Set $f(w) = 1/F(1/w)$, so $f(w) = w - 1/2 + w/12 + O(w^2)$. We will attempt to find a composition square root $f^{\langle 1/2 \rangle}(w)$ for $w$, the change of coordinates $w \mapsto 1/z$ will then change it into a compositional square root for $F$. Suppose that we had an invertible holomorphic function $\alpha$ obeying $$\alpha(f(w)) = \alpha(w)-1/2. \quad (\ast)$$ For now, I'll be sloppy about on what region $\alpha$ is defined; this will eventually be a crucial issue. Such an $\alpha$ is called a Fatou coordinate. Then we could define fractional compositions $f^{\langle s \rangle}$ by $f^{\langle s \rangle}(w) = \alpha^{-1}(\alpha(w)-s/2)$ and we would clearly have $f^{\langle s \rangle} \circ f^{\langle t \rangle} = f^{\langle s+t \rangle}$ and $f^{\langle 1 \rangle}=f$. There is a unique formal power series solution $$\alpha(w) = w+\frac{1}{6} \log w + \sum_{n \geq 1} c_n w^{-n}$$ to $(\ast)$. Dudko shows (Theorem 37) that, for any $\delta>0$ there is an $R>0$ such that the sum $\sum c_n z^{-n}$ is Borel summable on a region of the form $U_+ = \{ r e^{i \theta}: r > R, \theta \in (-\pi+\delta, \pi - \delta) \}$ and is separately Borel summable on a region of the form $U_- = \{ r e^{i \theta}: r > R, \theta \in (\delta, 2 \pi - \delta) \}$. Here the integral defining the first Borel sum is along the positive real axis, and the integral for the second is on the negative real axis. However, the two Borel summations have different values! I'm not sure how to translate that Borel summability into the Borel summability you are looking for, but it seems in the same neighborhood.
