If I recall correctly, this was an exercise in Mathematics for the Analysis of Algorithms. I don't have access to a library right now, so I can't check that. In any case, here is a proof. Fix a positive integer $N$. We will be counting the number of $n$ in $\{ 1,2, \ldots, N \}$ such that the largest prime divisor of $n$ is $\leq \sqrt{n}$. We can break this count into two parts: (1) Those $n$ which are divisible by $p$ where $p \leq \sqrt{N}$ and $n \leq p^2$ and (2) Those $n$ which are divisible by $p > \sqrt{n}$. Case (1) is easier. We are looking at $\sum_{p \leq \sqrt{N}} p = \int_{t=0}^{\sqrt{N}} t d \pi(t)$. (This is a Riemann-Stieltjes integral.) Integrating by parts, this is $\int_{0}^{\sqrt{N}} \pi(u) du + O( \sqrt{N} \ \pi(\sqrt{N}))$. Since $\pi(u) = O(u / \log u)$ as $u \to \infty$, this integral is $O \left( \int^{\sqrt{N}} \pi(u) du \right) = O\left(\sqrt{N} \frac{\sqrt{N}}{\log N} \right) = O(N/\log N)$, and the second term is also $O(N/\log N)$. So case 1 contributes density zero. Case (2) is the same idea — integrate by parts and use the prime number theorem — but the details are messier because we need a better bound. We are trying to compute $$\sum_{\sqrt{N} \leq p \leq N} \lfloor \frac{N}{p} \rfloor = \int_{\sqrt{N}}^N \lfloor \frac{N}{t} \rfloor d\pi(t) = \int_{\sqrt{N}}^N \left( \frac{N}{t} + O(1) \right) d\pi(t).$$ The error term is $O(\pi(N)) = N/\log N$ so, again, it doesn't effect the density. Integrating the main term by parts, we have $$\int_{\sqrt{N}}^N \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ \frac{N}{t} \right) \pi(t) dt +O(N/\log N).$$ Where the error term is $\left( N/t \pi(t) \right)|^N_{\sqrt{N}}$. Now, $\pi(t) = Li(t) + O(t/(\log t)^K)$ for any $K$, by the prime number theorem, where $Li(t) = \int^t du/\log u$. So the main term is $$\int_{\sqrt{N}}^N \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ \frac{N}{t} \right) Li(t) dt + O\left( \int^N \frac{N}{t^2} \frac{t}{(\log t)^K} dt \right).$$ The error term is $O \left( N/(\log N)^{K-1} \right)$. In the main term, integrate by parts, "reversing" our previous integration by parts. We get $$\int_{\sqrt{N}}^N \frac{N}{t} \frac{dt}{\log t} + O(N/\log N).$$ Focusing on the main term once more, we have $$N \int_{\sqrt{N}}^N \frac{dt}{t \log t} = N \log 2.$$ Putting all of our error terms together, the number of integers with large prime factors is $$N \log 2 + O(N/\log N).$$ 

Here is a vague idea for how one might prove this in general. $M$ is flat if and only if, for all finitely generated ideals $\langle x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \rangle$ of $R$, we have $\mathrm{Tor}_1(M, R/\langle x_1, \ldots, x_n \rangle) = 0$. $N$ is torsion free if and only if, for all nonzero $x$ in $R$, we have $\mathrm{Tor}_1(N, R/x)=0$. Can we somehow get a relation between $\mathrm{Tor}_1(M, R/\langle x_1, \ldots, x_n \rangle)$ and $\mathrm{Tor}_1(M^{\otimes n}, R/(x_1 \cdots x_n))$? 

Let $f(z) = \sum z^n/n^2$, which is continuous and bounded on the closed unit disc but not analytic near $1$. Then consider $$\sum f(z^n)/n^2.$$ This should have a singularity at every root of unity; and should be analytic in the interior because it is uniformly convergent. 

Just to make the obvious comments: Let $q = (1 - \sqrt{5})/2$. Then $F_n=((-q^{-1})^{n} - q^n)/\sqrt{5}$. So $$\sum \frac{1}{F_n} = \sqrt{5} \sum \frac{q^n}{1-(-1)^n q^{2n}}.$$ This looks kind of like the logarithmic derivative of the modular form $\prod (1-q^n)$, but it's not exactly that. In any case, it is unlikely that someone has evaluated this sort-of-a-modular-form at this particular quadratic irrational. The natural thinkg to do is to evaluate modular forms when $\tau$ is a quadratic irrational, where $q=e^{2 \pi i \tau}$. For example, people might know what this sum equals at $q=e^{- \pi \sqrt{163}}$. I'd be pleasantly surprised if there is a known answer. Of course, the safe money is always to bet on "transcendental" when you don't see a reason to expect anything else. 

I thought I would write out the quaternion proof, because it is really quite elegant if you have good algebraic terminology. One note: I won't be proving quite the right result. Let $r(n)$ be the number of quadruples $(a,b,c,d)$ with $n=a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$ such that either $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are all in $\mathbb{Z}$, or are all in $(1/2) + \mathbb{Z}$. The formula I'll be proving is $$r(n) = 24 \sum_{\begin{matrix} d|n \\ d \ \mathrm{odd} \end{matrix}} d \quad \mathrm{for}\ n>0$$ The question of allocating the terms between $\mathbb{Z}$ and $(1/2) + \mathbb{Z}$ is a bit messier. Let $H$ be the ring of quaternions of the form $a+bi+cj+dk$, with $(a,b,c,d)$ as above. The following lemmas are proved in many sources on the quaternion proof of the Lagrange theorem: $\bullet$ Every right ideal of $H$ is principal. $\bullet$ The right ideal $(a+bi+cj+dk) H$ has index $(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)^2$ in $H$. Let $q(n)$ be the number of right ideals of $H$ that have index $n^2$. Since the unit group of $H$ has size $24$, we have $r(n) = 24 q(n)$. So we concentrate on computing $q(n)$. Let $I = (a+bi+cj+dk)H$ be a right ideal of $H$ with index $n^2$. Then $(a+bi+cj+dk)(a-bi-cj-dk) = n \in (a+bi+cj+dk)H$. So $I/nH$ is an index $n^2$ ideal in the ring $H/nH$. We see that $q(n)$ is the number of index $n^2$ ideals in $H/nH$. Now, by the Chinese remainder theorem, if $m$ and $n$ relatively prime, then $H/mnH \cong H/mH \times H/nH$. So $q(n)$ is multiplicative, and we are reduced to proving the claim for $n$ a prime power. 

You have the right numbers. $\mathrm{Trop} \ G(2,n)$ is the space of phylogenetic trees studied in Billera-Holmes-Vogtman. It has $1 \times 3 \times 5 \times \cdots \times (2n-5)$ maximal faces and $2^{n-1} - n-1$ vertices, matching your $945$ and $56$. The first several face numbers are $$\begin{matrix} 1 & & & & \\ 1 & 3 & & & \\ 1 & 10 & 15 & & \\ 1 & 25 & 105 & 105 & \\ 1 & 56 & 490 & 1260 & 945 \\ \end{matrix}$$ Write $f(n,k)$ for the number of $k$ faces in $\mathrm{Trop} \ G(2,n)$, we have $$f(n,k) = (k+1) f(n-1,k) + (n+k-2) f(n-1,k-1).$$ I am prone to off by one errors, so check this against the above table. It is easy to get closed formulas for $f(n,r)$ or $f(n,n-r)$, for small fixed $r$, but there seems to be no simple expression for the middle terms. Billera-Holmes-Vogtman say that there is more discussion in Exercise 5.40 of Enumerative Combinatorics I by Stanley; I don't have my copy with me to check. 

See, for example, Theorem 4.5.2 in Huneke and Swanson. The condition $S_1$ is equivalent to "has no non-minimal associated primes", so you can see it in the Ext-groups as Karl explains. As far as I know, $R_0$ can't be thought of as a condition about Ext-groups, but it is often not hard to check, since you only need to check it at the generic points of $X$. 

No for $n$ odd, yes for $n$ even. By a result of Hua and Reiner, the automorphism group of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by (1) conjugation by $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ (the matrices with determinant $\pm 1$) and (2) the map $X \mapsto \epsilon(X) \cdot X$ where $\epsilon$ is the unique nontrivial character $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \to \pm 1$. The maps of the form (1) clearly preserve $\Gamma(n)$, so we just need to check the single map $X \mapsto \epsilon(X) \cdot X$. We can describe $\epsilon$ as follows: $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ acts on the three points of $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{F}_2)$, giving a map $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \to S_3$. Compose this with the sign character $S_3 \to \pm 1$. If $n$ is odd, then $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1 & n \\ 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix} \right) \equiv \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix} \right) \bmod 2$, so $\epsilon \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1 & n \\ 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix} \right) = -1$. So $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1 & n \\ 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ is in $\Gamma(n)$ but $\epsilon \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1 & n \\ 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix} \right) \cdot \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1 & n \\ 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix} \right) = \left( \begin{smallmatrix} -1 & -n \\ 0 & -1 \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ is not. On the other hand, if $n$ is even then $X \equiv \mathrm{Id} \bmod n$ shows that $X$ maps to $e$ in $S_3$, so $\epsilon(X)=1$ and $\epsilon(X) X = X$ for all $X \in \Gamma(n)$. 

No (assuming that $a^2 \neq 4b$, so the quadratic is not a square). In fact, the fields $\mathrm{Frac}(R)$ and $\mathbb{C}(t)$ are not isomorphic. From a sophisticated perspective, the point is that the former has genus one and the latter has genus $0$. In general, this is a hard notion to define in an elementary way; see the discussion here. Let's do something elementary and check that $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(y^2-x^3-1)$ is not an $n$-point ring. If it were, we could identify it with a subring of $\mathbb{C}(t)$, let $x$ correspond to $p(t)/q(t)$ and $y$ to $r(t)/s(t)$ in lowest terms. Comparing poles, we must have $q(t) = d(t)^3$ and $s(t) = d(t)^2$ for some polynomial $d$, so $(p(t)/d(t)^2)^3 = (r(t)/d(t)^3)^2+1$ or $p(t)^3=r(t)^2+s(t)^6$. This would violate the Mason-Stothers theorem, and you can mimic any proof of that theorem to see that this is impossible. 

I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, and that the proof will use Cox rings. However, I haven't been able to find references for all the facts about Cox rings I want, so I'll leave this as CW and hope someone else fills in the gaps. Let $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$ be two fans, and $X$ and $X'$ the corresponding toric varieties, with $X \cong X'$. For simplicity, I'll assume that the unit groups of $X$ and $X'$ are both trivial (i.e. equal to $k^*$). This is equivalent to assuming that $\Sigma$ (respectively $\Sigma'$) is not contained in a hyperplane. Let $H$ be the class group of $X$ (Weil divisors modulo principal divisors). Let $G$ be the character group $\mathrm{Hom}(H, \mathbb{G}_m)$. Cox's construction gives: A variety $Y$; an action of $G$ on $Y$; a $G$-invariant open subspace $U$; and a map $U \to X$ which makes $X$ into the categorical quotient $U/G$. This is sometimes called the universal torsor of $X$, although it is only a torsor when $X$ is smooth (earlier false statement corrected). To help get you oriented, if $X = \mathbb{P}^2$, then $H = \mathbb{Z}$, $G = \mathbb{G}_m$, $Y= \mathbb{A}^3$ and $U$ is the complement of the origin in $Y$. 

I thought I'd add in my favorite way of computing sums of the form $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{p(n)}{q(n)}$$ for $p$ and $q$ polynomials. First, expand in partial fractions: $$\frac{p(n)}{q(n)} = \sum \frac{a_i}{n+s_i} + \mbox{terms for repeated roots}.$$ Since the sum is to converge, we must have $p(n)/q(n) =O(n^{-2})$, so $\sum a_i=0$. So rewrite this as $$\frac{p(n)}{q(n)} = \sum a_i \left( \frac{1}{n+s_i} - \frac{1}{n} \right) + \mbox{terms for repeated roots}.$$ We are now reduced to evaluating sums of the form $$\sum \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+s} \right)$$ and $$\sum \frac{1}{(n+s)^k}$$ We have the identity $$\sum \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+s}\right) = \frac{\Gamma'(s)}{\Gamma(s)} + \gamma + \frac{1}{s}$$ where $\Gamma$ is the Gamma function and $\gamma$ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. See, for example, this website. Taking repeated derivatives of this gives a formula for $\sum 1/(n+s)^k$. So, if you accept derivatives of the $\Gamma$ function at algebraic numbers, such sums can always be evaluated. In general, I don't know a better method. However, in many cases, one can use familiar $\Gamma$ function identities to do better. Here are three tricks, all of which come up in our setting: 

$\def\ZZ{\mathbb{Z}}\def\QQ{\mathbb{Q}}\def\KK{\mathbb{K}}\def\LL{\mathbb{L}}\def\Gal{\mathrm{Gal}}\def\FF{\mathbb{F}}$Here are some examples of $\mathbb{K}$ for which this Hasse principle holds, and for which it does not. Hasse principle $\KK= \QQ(\sqrt{b})$ a quadratic extension of $\QQ$. Let $\LL$ be the normal closure of $\KK(\sqrt{a})$ over $\QQ$. We break into cases according to $\Gal(\LL/\QQ)$. Case 1 $\Gal(\LL/\QQ)$ is either $\ZZ/4 \ZZ$ or $D_8$ (the dihedral group of order $8$). In this case, there is a conjugacy class $\sigma$ in $\Gal(\LL/\QQ)$ of order $4$ whose image in $\Gal(\KK/\QQ)$ is the nontrivial class. By Cebatarov, there are infinitely many primes $p$ of $\QQ$ whose Frobenius class is this $\sigma$. Let $p$ be such a prime, chosen relatively prime to $2$ and $a$. Then $p \mathcal{O}_K$ is prime, with residue field $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ and $a \equiv q k^2 \bmod p \mathcal{O}_K$ for some $q \in \mathbb{F}_p$ and some $k \in \mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. But every element of $\mathbb{F}_p$ is square in $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, so $a$ is square in $\mathcal{O}/p \mathcal{O}_K$. We deduce that $p$ splits in $K(\sqrt{a})$ and thus in $\LL$, contradicting our choice of Frobenius class. Case 2 $\Gal(\LL/\QQ)$ is $(\ZZ/2 \ZZ)^2$. Then $\LL \cong \QQ(\sqrt{b}, \sqrt{c})$ for some $c \in \QQ$, and we have $K(\sqrt{a}) = K(\sqrt{c})$. But then $a=c k^2$ for some $k \in \KK$, as desired. $\square$. No Hasse principle If we only formulate the Hasse principle as "for all but finitely many primes", then we have a counterexample whenever $\KK/\QQ$ is Galois of odd degree. The reason is simple: For any $a$ whatever in $\KK$, the condition will be satisfied at any unramified prime of odd characteristic. Proof: Let $\pi$ be such a prime of $\mathcal{O}_{\KK}$, with residue field $\mathbb{F}_{p^f}$. Note that $f$ divides $[\KK:\QQ]$, so it is odd. Then $\KK_{\pi}^{\times}/\QQ_p^{\times} \cong \FF_{p^f}^{\times}/\FF_p$ (because the extension is unramified). The quotient has order $p^{f-1} + \cdots + p+1$ which is odd, since $f$ is odd. So every element of $\KK_{\pi}$ is of the form $q k^2$ for $q \in \QQ_p^{\times}$ and $k \in \KK_{\pi}$, and it is easy to use an approximation argument to make $q \in \QQ$. It is easy to choose $a$ to also work at the archimedean places, the even places and the ramified places, and thus get a counterexample to the whole claim. 

I'm not sure this is what you are looking for, but if you look at Gelfand and Manin's Methods of Homological Algebra, the end of Section II.5, they make the following definition: Let $Y$ be an object of an abelian category. An element of $Y$ is a pair $(X,h)$, with $h: X \to Y$, modulo the equivalence relation that $(X,h) \sim (X',h')$ if we can complete the square $$\begin{matrix} Z & \to & X' \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ X & \to & Y \end{matrix}$$ so that the maps $Z \to X$ and $Z \to X'$ are surjective. The map sending an object $Y$ to its elements, $E(Y)$, is clearly a functor from our Abelian category to PointedSetsWithAnInvolution, where the labelled point of $E(Y)$ is the zero map $0 \to Y$ and the involution is $(X,h) \mapsto (X,-h)$. (It seems to me that $(X,h)$ and $(X,-h)$ are always equivalent, but G+M sometimes use notation which seems to distinguish the elements $e$ and $-e$, so I am following them.) Gelfand and Manin state as exercises:
