In general, it seems not known which finite abelian groups are class groups of quadratic number fields. For imaginary quadratic number fileds, I read that $(\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})^3$ is the smallest abelian group which does not occur. It does occur as the class group of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{188184253})$. What other groups are known not to be the class groups of imaginary quadratic number fields ? How does one prove this ? What is the situation for class groups of real quadratic number fields ? 

The result mentioned above is Waring's problem for matrices (respectively for algebraic number fields). The result is: Theorem (Katre, Kuhle 1990): Let $R$ be an order in an algebraic number field $K$. Let $n\ge k \ge 2$. Then every $n\times n$ matrix over $R$ is a sum of $k$-th powers if and only if it is the sum of seven $k$-th powers if and only if $(k, disc (R)) = 1$. If this is true, then the question is if the seven matrices can be constructed explicitly. For the case $k=n=2$ and $R=\mathbb{Z}$ this seems to be the case (article of Newman "Sums of squares of matrices"), by constructing certain companion matrices to characteristic polynomials: every integral $2 \times 2$ matrix is the sum of at most $3$ integral squares. The proof for the general case however uses an argument of the form "every $n\times n$-matrix is a sum of $k$-th powers in $M_n(R)$ if every $m\times m$-matrix is a sum of $k$-th powers in $M_m(R)$ for $n\ge m\ge 1$ and $k\ge 2$", which does not seem to be constructive. 

Here is a result, which I think is interesting in this context (for reference see books on Lie algebras): Theorem: Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field $K$ of characteristic zero. Let $E\subseteq F$ be two linear subspaces of $End(V)$ and $M=\lbrace A \in End(V) \mid [A,F] \subseteq E\rbrace $. Assume that $tr (AB)=0$ for all $A\in M$. Then $B$ is nilpotent with $tr(B)=tr(B^2)=\cdots = tr(B^n)=0$ for all $n$. Edit: $[A,B]=AB-BA$ in $End(V)$. 

This is Weyl's dimension formula. The dimensions of the fundamental modules $L(\omega_1), \ldots ,L(\omega_{n-1})$ for $A_{n-1}$ are $\binom{n}{1}, \binom{n}{2},\ldots ,\binom{n}{n-1}$. The dimensions for $L(k\omega_i)$ can also be computed from Weyl's dimension formula. This is done (in part) in Knapp's book Lie groups beyond an introduction, Theorem $5.84$ and the examples thereafter. There is also a "universal" dimension formula for the dimension of the Cartan powers of the adjoint representation of a complex simple Lie algebra, independent of the type. See here: $URL$ I hope this "derivation" helps. 

Lie’s theorem indeed still holds in positive characteristic provided the dimension of the vector space is less than the characteristic. For reference see, for example, the remark before example $81$ in $URL$ It is indeed often the case that results being true in characteristic zero, remain true for $p$ larger than the dimension of the vector space (or larger than the Coxeter number for simple Lie algebras). On the other hand there may be many results from the modular world where we need to be careful with such a statement. The classification of simple Lie algebras from characteristic zero does not remain true for large $p$. 

Another reference which was not yet mentioned, I think, is the article of M. Moskowitz, "Faithful Representations and a local property of Lie groups", Math. Z. $143$, 1975. There the question is discussed when all analytic groups with a given Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ have a faithful linear representation. He proves among other things the following result: Theorem All connected Lie groups $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ have a faithful linear representation if and only if $Z(\mathfrak{g})\cap [\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{g}]=0$ and $\tilde{S}$ has a faithful representation. Here $\tilde{G}=rad(\tilde{G})\cdot \tilde{S}$ is the Levi decomposition for the simply connected group $\tilde{G}$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Corollary Let $G$ be a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. If $ad(\mathfrak{g})$ has nontrivial center then there is a locally isomorphic group without any faithful representation. 

Specht polynomials and Specht modules have been applied not only to the representation theory of symmetric groups, but also for other reflection groups, e.g., for octahedral groups, see for example $URL$ Furthermore there are "Higher Specht Polynomials for Complex Reflection Groups", see the paper of H. Morita, and H. Yamada. Perhaps also of interest in this connection may be Garnir polynomials for finite reflection groups, which play a role for modular representations, too (S. Devadas). 

Since a Lie group is semisimple if and only if its Lie algebra is semisimple, we may show that the semidirect sum of semisimple Lie algebras is semisimple. Indeed, if $L$ is a semidirect sum of two semisimple Lie algebras $A$ and $B$, then we have a (split) extension $$ 0 \rightarrow A \rightarrow L \rightarrow B \rightarrow 0. $$ However, every extension of a semisimple Lie algebra by a semisimple Lie algebra is trivial (because the Killing form is non-degenerate, $L=A+A^{\perp}$) , i.e., we have $L=A+B$, the direct sum. Of course, $L$ is then semisimple. 

Even if we consider more generally cohomologically rigid Lie algebras $L$, which satisfy $H^i(L,L)$ for all $i\ge 0$, a classification is not possible. Roger Carles proved in 1985 in his paper "Sur certain classes d'algebres de Lie rigides", that every complete Lie algebra $L$ with abelian nilradical ${\rm nil}(L)$ is cohomologically rigid. He proves a lower bound of the number $s_n$ of non-isomorphic solvable cohomologically rigid Lie algebras of dimension $n$, which is indeed $$ \Gamma(\sqrt{n})\le s_n, $$ for all $n\ge 81$, with the Gamma function. This shows that a classification is more or less hopeless. 

Maximal (closed) subgroups of semisimple Lie groups have been first classified by E.B. Dynkin (see the reference above). There is indeed a way to "reduce" the problem to the case of a simple Lie group, but it is more complicated than just to take the direct product of the maximal subgroups of the simple factors. In the example $G=SU(n) \times SU(n)$, or in the example $SU(n)\times_{\mathbb{Z}_n} SU(n)=SU(n)\otimes SU(n)$, we would indeed start with the maximal subgroups of $SU(n)$, which are given by: (a) $SO(n)$ (b) $Sp(m), m=2n$ (c) $S(U(k) \times U(n-k))=\lbrace (A,B)\in U(k)\times U(n-k) \mid \det(A)\det(B)=1\rbrace$ for $1\le k\le n-1$. (d) $SU(p)\times_{\mathbb{Z}_d} SU(q)$, where $d=gcd(p,q)$, $pq=n$, $p,q\ge 3$ (e) $\rho(H)$, $H$ simple, $\rho \in Irr_{\mathbb{C}}$ of degree $n$. Then we should proceed as in Theorem 5.9, 5.10 etc. of the following (modern) reference: Fernando Antoneli, Michael Forger and Paola Gaviria, Maximal Subgroups of Compact Lie Groups. see $URL$ I am a bit too lazy to write out the result. Anyway, you don't have to read Dynkin (although this is interesting !). 

The metabelian groups $BS(n,1)\simeq BS(1,n)=\langle a,b\mid aba^{-1}=b^n \rangle$ are also linear (this seems not mentionened in the Wikipedia article). A faithful, linear representation $BS(1,n)\hookrightarrow GL_2(\mathbb{R})$ is given by $$ a\mapsto \begin{pmatrix} n^{\frac{1}{2}} & 0 \cr 0 & n^{-\frac{1}{2}} \end{pmatrix}, \quad b\mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \cr 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}. $$ This representation is not discrete, and the groups are not polycyclic (except for $n=\pm 1$). 

Frobenius groups have trivial center. This is helpful for non-examples, e.g., to see that $p$-groups, or the quaternion group is not Frobenius (and all nilpotent groups). Further examples are: non-abelian groups of order $pq$, the group $A_4$. Further non-examples: the groups $S_n$ for all $n\ge 4$. In addition to the other answers, here is a nice discussion on Frobenius groups by Terence Tao in his tag archive: $URL$ 

A further reference is the thesis of O. Motsak, on "Computation of the central elements and centralizers of sets of elements in non-commutative polynomial algebras". There the center of the universal enveloping algebra is computed explicitly for several examples of classical Lie algebras. The computations have been done in SINGULAR. 

It seems to me that this is conjectured by Schinzel. His conjecture for this special case is as follows: Conjecture(Schinzel 1995): For every algebraic number field $K$ there exists a constant $C_1(K)$ such that, if $n > 2$, $A,B ∈ K^{*}$ and the trinomial $x^n +Ax +B$ is reducible over $K$ then either it has a proper factor of degree $≤ 2$ or $n ≤ C_1(K)$. (For $K = \mathbb{Q}$ we have $C_1(\mathbb{Q}) ≥ 52$.) In other words, we should find an integer $n\ge C_1(K)$, such that $x^n+x+B$ is irreducible. The reference is: A. Schinzel: "Solved and unsolved problems on polynomials", $1995$. 

In German it is: Punktlose Räume - Lokale. It means a generalisation of a topological space ("Ein Lokal"). The following article uses this, for example here. 

Yes, in general $L$ need not be a prime knot, if $K$ is a prime knot, given a knot epimorphism $f\colon \pi K \to \pi L$, see section $4$ of D.S. Silver and W. Whitten, Knot group epimorphisms II (which is referring to part I for an example). There it is also discussed which properties of $K$ are inherited by $L$, given a knot group epimorphisms $f\colon \pi K \to \pi L$. For example, if $K$ is alternating, $L$ need not be alternating in general. On the other hand, if, say, $K$ is a torus knot, then $L$ is, too. 

Here is a comment relating the question to representations of sums of five squares of rational polynomials (sorry, too long for the comment field): Suppose that $f$ is a linear combination of two squares of polynomials, i.e., $f=u^2-rv^2$ for some $r\in \mathbb{Q}$, and $u,v\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. If $r\le 0$, then $f$ need to be nonnegative. As $-r$ is the sum of four rational squares, we can write $f$ as the sum of five squares of rational polynomials. Conversely, if $f$ is nonnegative, then it is known that $f$ can be written as the sum of five squares of rational polynomials, $f=u_1^2+\cdots +u_5^2$. This is due to Pourchet, 1971, "Sur la représentation en somme de carrés des polynômes à une indéterminée sur un corps de nombres alge ́briques". This result is best possible as far as the number of squares needed for such representations is concerned. Edit: The result of Pourchet does not imply that $f$ may not be a linear combination of two squares of rational polynomials. Consider the example $f(x)=x^2+x+4$. Since $4ac-b^2=15$ cannot be represented as a sum of three rational squares, the polynomial $f$ cannot be represented as the sum of squares of $4$ rational polynomials. However, $$ f(x)=x^2+x+4=\left( \\frac{x-7}{4}\right)^2+\frac{15}{16}(x+1)^2. $$ If $r>0$, then $f$ must be reducible over $\mathbb{R}$, as $f=(u-\sqrt{r}v)(u+\sqrt{r}v)$ (see the comment of i707107). 

You may already know this, but the best reference about Steinitz $1910$ work I could find is the following summary by Peter Roquette: $URL$ Some English references are given there, and apparently a lot of Steinitz $1910$ work can be found in the book "Modern Algenbra" by van der Waerden, but I don't know about a full translation. Edit: I think, as Jim has pointed out, that most likely there is no translation. Certainly Peter Roquette would have mentioned a translation in his discussion, and I think he has searched for it. 

There are already uncountably many isomorphism classes of $3$-dimensional real Lie algebras. In fact, there are $1$-parameter families of $3$-dimensional solvable Lie algebras. The classification has been done over an arbitrary field. For references see the paper of Willem A. de Graaf, and the book of Jacobson on Lie algebras, chapter $1$, section $4$. 

Werner Nahm not only made important contributions to conformal field theory, but also conducted research about the Mayan civilization and their astronomy. In his Mayan research, he also worked with Linda Schele and Nikolai Grube and participated in the ongoing decipherment of Maya hieroglyphs. 

Clearly it is not a proof. In the same way we could "demonstrate" the squaring of the circle (and it has been done more or less that way already by many amateurs). However, isn't it nice to "see" Pythagoras that way ? 

Using Groebner bases (or even direct computing) we see, that the solutions of your system $f_5=f_6=0$ are as follows: Case 1: $a_1b_2-a_2b_1=0$. Then it follows $y^2+z^2=0$. Over the real numbers this means $y=z=0$, and $a_1x=b_1x=0$. For $a_1=b_1=0$ we have always a solution with $x\neq 0$. Case 2: $a_1b_2-a_2b_1\neq 0$. Then we obtain either $y=0$ and $x=z=0$, or if $y\neq 0$, then $$ x=\frac{(a_3b_1-a_1b_3)(y^2+z^2)}{(a_1b_2-a_2b_1)y}, $$ and $ry^2+sz^2=0$ with $$ r:= a_1^2b_3^2 - a_1a_2b_2b_3 - 2a_1a_3b_1b_3 + a_1a_3b_2^2 + a_2^2b_1b_3 - a_2a_3b_1b_2 + a_3^2b_1^2 $$ and $$ s:= (a_1b_3 - a_3b_1)^2. $$ Here you have the case 2, i.e., either $y=z=0$ again (we have required $y\neq 0$, so this was solved earlier), or some non-trivial solution. The other systems can be solved too, using Groebner bases. 

Assuming $gcd(a,b,c)=1$ there are no solutions (see GH's answer), and this fits well for the hyperbolic case of the generalised Fermat equation $x^p+y^q=z^r$ with $1/p+1/q+1/r<1$, and $gcd(x,y,z)=1$, because for $n>4$ above we are in this case. By Darmon-Granville theorem we know that there are only finitely many solutions, and conjecturally at most $10$ solutions. None of these is for $(p,q,r)=(n,n,2)$ with $n>4$. 

I have found a counterexample while studying Lie algebra degenerations. Consider the following filiform nilpotent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of dimension $13$, given by the brackets with respect to a basis $(e_1,\ldots ,e_{13})$: \begin{align*} [e_1,e_i] & = e_{i+1},\quad 2\le i\le 12 \\[0.2cm] [e_2,e_3] & = e_5 \\ [e_2,e_4] & = e_6 \\ [e_2,e_5] & = \frac{9}{10}e_7-e_9 \\ [e_2,e_6] & = \frac{4}{5}e_8-2e_{10} \\ [e_2,e_7] & = \frac{5}{7}e_9-\frac{335}{126}e_{11}+ \frac{22105}{15246}e_{13}\\ [e_2,e_8] & = \frac{9}{14}e_{10}-\frac{125}{42}e_{12}\\ [e_2,e_9] & = \frac{9}{12}e_{11}-\frac{4421}{1452}e_{13}\\ [e_2,e_{10}] & = \frac{8}{15}e_{12}\\ [e_2,e_{11}] & = \frac{27}{55}e_{13}\\[0.5cm] [e_3,e_4] & = \frac{1}{10}e_{7}+e_{9}\\ [e_3,e_5] & = \frac{1}{10}e_{8}+e_{10}\\ [e_3,e_6] & = \frac{3}{35}e_9+\frac{83}{126}e_{11}-\frac{22105}{15246}e_{13}\\ [e_3,e_7] & = \frac{1}{14}e_{10}+\frac{20}{63}e_{12}\\ [e_3,e_8] & = \frac{5}{84}e_{11}+\frac{697}{10164}e_{13}\\ [e_3,e_{9}] & = \frac{1}{20}e_{12}\\ [e_3,e_{10}] & = \frac{7}{165}e_{13}\\ [e_4,e_5] & = \frac{1}{70}e_9+\frac{43}{126}e_{11}+\frac{22105}{15246}e_{13}\\ [e_4,e_6] & = \frac{1}{70}e_{10}+\frac{43}{126}e_{12}\\ [e_4,e_7] & = \frac{1}{84}e_{11}+\frac{7589}{30492}e_{13}\\ [e_4,e_8] & = \frac{1}{105}e_{12}\\ [e_4,e_9] & = \frac{1}{132}e_{13}\\[0.5cm] [e_5,e_6] & = \frac{1}{420}e_{11}+\frac{313}{3388}e_{13}\\ [e_5,e_7] & = \frac{1}{420}e_{12}\\ [e_5,e_8] & = \frac{3}{1540}e_{13}\\[0.5cm] [e_6,e_7] & = \frac{1}{2310}e_{13} \end{align*} Let $\mathfrak{h}$ be the ideal generated by $e_3,\ldots , e_{13}$ of codimension $2$. Then $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}=\{ [e_1],[e_2]\}$, and we may write $L=\{ \alpha[e_1]+\beta[e_2]\}$, where $\alpha,\beta$ vary over all complex numbers. Hence the preimage is $L(\alpha,\beta)=\{\alpha e_1+\beta e_2,e_3,\ldots ,e_{13} \}$, which is a $1$-codimensional ideal in $\mathfrak{g}$. Now it is easy to see that $$ L(1,\alpha)\simeq L(1,\alpha') \text{ if and only if } \alpha=\pm \alpha'. $$ So we obtain infinitely many non-isomorphic Lie algebras. 

I am not an expert here, but I think it has been implicitly considered in the context of $k$-Lehmer numbers. These are the positive composite integers $n\ge 1$ which satisfy $\phi(n)\mid (n-1)^k$, where $k\ge 1$ is a fixed positive integer. There are strong connections between $k$-Lehmer numbers and Carmichael numbers. Now we have the following elementary observation. We have $(n-1)^2=(n-1)(n+1)-2(n-1)$. Hence, if $\phi(n)$ divides $2(n-1)$ and $n^2-1$, then $n$ is a $2$-Lehmer number. It is easy to see that there always exist $k$-Lehmer numnbers for all $k\ge 2$. Of course, Lehmer's conjecture is, that there are no $1$-Lehmer numbers. I know, this does not imply too much with respect to your question, but I tend to believe, that there should be no composite solutions to your equation $\phi(n)\mid 2(n-1)$, too. As far as I know, this is not known. For some more interesting facts about $k$-Lehmer numbers, see, for example, the article $URL$ 

The AKS-primality test shows that cheking primality can be done in polynomial time. About the growth of $\sigma(n)$, it holds $\lim \sup_{n\to \infty}\frac{\sigma(n)}{n\log (\log(n))}=e^{\gamma}$, and assuming the Riemann hypothesis, there is the estimate (Robin) $\sigma(n)< e^{\gamma}n\log(\log(n))$ for all $n\ge 5041$. 

The algebra $S$ is etale, i.e., smooth of relative dimension $0$. A proof, that $S$ is flat over $R$ can be found in www.math.purdue.edu/~dvb/preprints/etale.pdf‎, see Proposition $1.3.5$ on page $17$. The proof uses induction, and the following lemma: Let $S$ be an $R$-algebra. Suppose that $M$ is an $S$-module, $f\in S$ an element such that multiplication by f is injective on $M \otimes k(m)$ for all $m \in Max (R)$, and $M$ is flat over $R$. Then $M/fM$ is flat over $R$. I hope this is more than just $Spec(S)$ is smooth over $Spec(R)$, hence flat. 

For finite groups, solvability can be detected from Engel-like identities. This was not really the question, but it is very interesting in this context, I think. The proof is surprisingly complicated, relying on reduction to J.Thompson's list of minimal non-solvable simple groups, on extensive use of arithmetic geometry and on computer algebra and geometry - see $URL$ 

I like the book of Ireland and Rosen "A classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory". There the Cubic and Biquadratic Reciprocity law are proved (and the Eisenstein Reciprocity law , the $m$-th power reciprocity law). Furthermore the book has a quite remarkable bibliography. 

I should add one reference, for the case of real numbers, namely the classification of all solvable real six-dimensional Lie algebras by Turkowsky: P. Turkowski. Solvable Lie algebras of dimension six. J. Math. Phys. 31 (1990), 1344-1350. As mentioned before, the classification of nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension $6$ has been done earlier by Morozow in $1958$, valid for all fields of characteristic zero. Recently this classification has been extended to arbitrary fields, by Serena Cicalo, Willem A de Graaf and Csaba Schneider here:$URL$ 

Every discrete group of Euclidean isometries acts properly discontinuously and cocompactly on some subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (a result of Bieberbach). If we are in the crystallographic case, then the index is bounded by the maximal order of a finite subgroup of $GL(n,\mathbb{Z})$. Here we have several results in the literature, e.g., the result of Friedland in $1997$, that $$m\le 2^nn! $$ for $n\ge n_0$. There are exceptions for small $n$, see the comment of Geoff Robinson. There are conditions given in Friedland's paper "The maximal orders of finite subgroups of $GL(n,\mathbb{Q})$", when equality is attained. Rockmore in $1995$ proved the following: for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists a constant $c(\epsilon)$ such that $m\le c(\epsilon)(n!)^{1+\epsilon}$.
