Since this question was first asked, nontrivial decomposition numbers for Quiver Hecke algebras (=KLR algebras) have been discovered in finite type. Thus there is an alternative family of examples where the canonical and KLR basis disagree, if one is willing to accept ones algebras living over a field of positive characteristic. Known examples are not always explicated in the literature right now. The historically first example is due to Geordie Williamson - see $URL$ or $URL$ 

[From the comments] The proof of Proposition 13.2.19 in Kumar's "Kac-Moody groups, their flag varieties and representation theory" appears to provide the requested information. 

The following quote, from Pseudo-reductive groups by Conrad, Gabber and Prasad (Definition A.1.14, lightly edited) should answer your question. 

The size of the double quotient can be bounded by a function exponential in the number of places where KG is not maximal compact. The base of the exponential will of course depend on the kernel of the central isogeny, but all the dependence on the field F can be moved into the implied constant. The part about this that I don't know how to prove is to show that the double quotient is finite in the first place. I can only do this for PGLn, which I think is a worthwhile group to think about for this problem since you can see everything explicitly. Let Z be the kernel of the central isogeny G'-->G. The natural map $G(\hat F)\rightarrow \prod'_v H^1(F_v,Z)$ has kernel $G'(\hat F)$ in which the rational points are dense by strong approximation. This map is surjective, so we can rewrite the adelic double quotient as a double quotient of this restricted direct product of H1's. Now consider what happens when we shrink KG at one place v from a maximal compact to something smaller. Then the cardinality of the double quotient can increase by at most a factor of |H1(Fv,Z)|. To show the desired exponential growth, we simply need a bound on |H1(Fv,Z)| that is independent of v. For Z=μn, we know explicitly $H^1(k,\mu_n)=k^\times/(k^\times)^n$ for any field k and the bound is easy. If G is split, then Z is a product of μn's and there is no more work to be done. For general G, pick a finite Galois extension K/F over which G splits. Then the inflation-restriction exact sequence together with the result for split groups implies the necessary uniform bound on |H1(Fv,Z)|. 

(This is a joint musing with Andrew Gordon and Wyatt Mackey) There is a classic, elementary riddle, discussed before on MO and math.SE: suppose you have 1000 bottles of wine, and one is poisoned. The poison is slow-acting, and will not cause any negative effects until 24 hours after consumed. How many taste-testers (for the sake of humanity, let's say they are rats) do you need to determine which bottle is poisoned by the end of the 24 hours? There is a natural generalization to this problem, which is discussed here: what if there are two poisoned bottles? What about three? The accepted answer of Sergey Norin cites a paper of Frankl and Furedi that develops theory to give a constructible solution of 43 taste-testers for the case of 1000 bottles, 2 of which are poisoned. Apparently, there are also some sources out there that give the exact lower bound at 19 testers. Our version of the problem extends the original one in a different direction: suppose there is one poisoned bottle and one bottle with antidote, so that any taste-tester who consumes wine from both the poison and antidote bottles will show no adverse effects. Then what is the fewest number of testers needed to locate the poisoned bottle? This question as well has two further related questions: 

I can give a general solution under the additional assumption that the long word acts by -1 on the root system. Let $\alpha_i$ denote the simple roots and $\beta_i$ be a vector orthogonal to all $\alpha_j$ with j different from i. Let (,) be a W-invariant inner product. The point: For any vector v and any w in the maximal proper parabolic corresponding to i, we have $(v,\beta_i)=(wv,\beta_i)$. A simple Lemma: If $(\gamma,\beta_i)=(\alpha_i,\beta_i)$, $(s_i\gamma,\beta_i)=-(\alpha_i,\beta_i)$ and $||\gamma||=||\alpha_i||$, then $\gamma=\alpha_i$. Since rank at least two, there exists a root $\alpha'_i$ with $(\alpha_i,\beta_i)=(\alpha'_i,\beta_i)$. and $||\alpha'_i||=||\alpha_i||$ Now if $w_0=w_1s_iw_2$ with $w_1,w_2$ in the max. parabolic, lets act on $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_i$. Since $w_1,w_2$ can't change value of inner product with $\beta_i$, and applying $w_0$ must multiply this product by -1, by our lemma we must have $w_2\alpha_i=w_2\alpha'_i=\alpha_i$, a contracition. 

Suppose that $x\in \mathbf{f}$ and $r(x)=x\otimes 1+1\otimes x$. Recall $\mathbf{f}$ is graded by $\mathbb{N}I$, WLOG $x$ is homogenous, $x\in \mathbf{f}_\nu$. We know we get primitive elements if $\nu=i$ for some $i\in I$ so let us assume that $\nu$ is not of this form. Then $\mathbf{f}_\nu$ is generated by products of the form $yz$ with $y\in \mathbf{f}_\lambda$, $z\in \mathbf{f}_\mu$ with both $\lambda$ and $\mu$ nonzero. Now we consider the symmetric bilinear form on $\mathbf{f}$ and compute $$(x,yz)=(r(x),y\otimes z)=0$$ since $x$ is assumed primitive. This shows that $x$ is orthogonal to all of $\mathbf{f}_\nu$. But the bilinear form is nondegenerate, so $x=0$. Thus the Chevalley generators give a basis of the primitive elements of $\mathbf{f}$. 

Another construction is significantly less efficient and pointless, but sort of fun. If we consider testers as points in a finite projective space $\mathbb{P}_q^n : = \mathbb{P}\mathbb{F}_q^n$ for $q = p^e$ a prime power, and bottles of wine as lines in such a projective space, then a tester will drink from a bottle if and only if the corresponding point lies on the corresponding line. The problem can thus be transformed to the following, which would give an upper bound: Question 1 Fix an integer $n$. For what prime power $q$ and what dimension $m$ does $\mathbb{P}_q^m$ contain at least $n$ lines and have the minimum number of points? Perhaps "the problem can be reduced to" was not a great choice of words; I mean, any solution to Question 1 would give an upper bound to our problem, because lines in finite projective spaces contain at least three points, and those data are enough to distinguish any two points. The numbers of points and lines in finite projective spaces are known, so you can write a quick script to check for a minimum within some reasonable range of prime powers. Anyway, our ideas were clearly insufficient, because Noam Elkies knocked them out of the park overnight (literally), the following two algorithms being due to him: Solution #1: We can solve this with $O(\log_2(n)^2)$ testers as follows. The solution to the 1-poison, no antidote problem comes from assigning a tester to each bit when the bottles are numbered base-2; this solution comes from assigning four testers to each pair of bits. That is, each pair of bits can be 00, 01, 10, or 11, and we assign a tester to each of those possibilities. This requires $2\ell(\ell - 1)$ testers, where $\ell = \lceil \log_2(n) \rceil$. Solution #2: This one is $O(\log_2(n))$, the best we could possibly get via information-theoretic considerations, and it is non-constructive. So that I don't risk botching the construction, I'll quote directly Noam's solution: 

For p a constant in (0,1) and n going to infinity such that pn is an integer, consider the distribution on n bits that selects a random subset of pn bits, sets those to 1, and sets the others to 0. What is the largest k = k(n,p) so that the induced distribution on any k bits is 1/10 close in total variation distance (a.k.a. statistical distance) to the distribution that sets each bit to 1 independently with probability p? For every p I would like to know k up to a sublinear (i.e. o(n)) additive term. (For starters, p = 1/8 is good too.) Does anybody know of a place where this is worked out? Thanks! Emanuele 

Define $m(n,k,l)$ as the maximal size of a family $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ having the property that the intersection of every two sets is less than $l$. As stated on wikipedia, in 1985 Rödl proved Erdős’s conjecture that for fixed $k$ and $l$ $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} m(n,k,l) = \binom{n}{l}/\binom{k}{l}.$$ (The book "the probabilistic method" contains a proof of this fact.) Does anybody know what happens when $k = k(n), l = l(n)$? I am especially interested in the case when $l = O(\log n)$ and $k = n^{\epsilon}$ (which is one of the settings that has applications in theoretical computer science for Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom generators). 

Assume that the antidote, when consumed without the poison, is also poisonous (this is not so ridiculous a situation: according to this article, the chemical atropine, while poisonous when consumed on its own, counteracts anthrax) Locate the antidote in addition to the poison. 

Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a closed monoidal category, and $\mathscr{C}$ be a category enriched over $\mathcal{V}$. One says that the power or cotensor of an objec $A \in \mathscr{C}$ by an object $U \in \mathcal{V}$ is an object $A^U$ of $\mathscr{C}$ with a natural isomorphism $$\mathscr{C}(B, A^U) \cong \mathcal{V}(U, \mathscr{C}(B, A)),$$ where $B \in \mathscr{C}$, and $\mathcal{V}(-, -)$ is the inner hom of $\mathcal{V}$. Riehl and Verity, in their third of a series of papers towards an axiomatic theory of $(\infty, 1)$-categories, define an $\infty$-cosmos to be some sort of category, the details of which do not really matter to my question. My question does, however, regard one certain part of their definition. They require that the class of isofibrations be closed under forming the Leibniz cotensor of two maps, and I am having a bit of difficulty seeing how this map is defined. Specifically, the Leibniz cotensor of a map $p: E \to B$ in $\mathscr{C}$ by a map $i: U \to V$ in $\mathcal{V}$ is a map $$ i\, \widehat{\pitchfork}\, p: E^V \to E^U \times_{B^U} B^V. $$ Certainly, this map would follow by the universal property of pullbacks given maps $E^V \to E^U$ and $E^V \to B^V$ that satisfy the requisite commutativity condition. My question is as follows: How does one define these maps? Indeed, a good definition of these maps is necessary even to form the pullback. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
