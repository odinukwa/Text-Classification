Finding interest rates with fractional banking is very difficult because it is governed by quantifiable and unquantifiable factors. Regulatory requirements (like reserve ratios and capital requirements) are objective and quantifiable and play a role (but it varies from bank to bank). The supply of base money is only limited and is another objective quantifiable component. But...a major component of banking is trust. If I create a new money "exchangepesos" and nobody wants it, then any quantifiable math equation would be useless. Banks create money. They create "deposit dollars" that of course exceed government dollars (base money). For this to work, there must be trust. If I as a depositor or as another bank don't trust say "Bank A", we won't trust in turn their deposit money which will ruin their credit rating and result in the destruction of their deposit money. Another way of putting this is that banks operate by maturity mismatching. Matching short term debt to long term assets. This is naturally exceedingly risk and depends on those lending short term to the bank to consistently roll over such debt. Because long term assets are long term they will not get the principal in time to satisfy a redemption run by short term debt holders (many of which could be called depositors). The extent to which a bank can create money and buy interest bearing assets (which affects interest rates) is a function largely of the trust the individuals (but mostly other banks) have in the bank that does the money creation. This is of course non-quantifiable. The best solution IMO is to at least quantify the extent to which a bank mismatches debt to asset maturities. This is an obscure but growing measurement sometimes referred to as the liquidity mismatch index. A most practical manifestation of this equation would be to have a graph with the horizontal access being maturity times (say 1 second 'aka demand deposits), 1 month, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 25 years, etc...). Then the vertical axis quantify be amounts in dollars. Two lines would be drawn...one for bank debt stratified by maturity time and another for bank assets stratified by maturity time. Measuring the area of the difference of the two lines would give you a relatively interesting idea of where the banking system is at and where it could go (especially when compared to historic norms). But ultimately an exact equation to find interest rates is not possible because trust is so important to banking yet is not quantifiable. 

Standard dividends are not the only cash outlet from company to sharesholder. One option is stock buy backs. A company could in theory say buy 1 million dollars of shares every year and this would be a form of a dividend. The shareholder could benefit by selling their stock directly or waiting to sell their stock back to the company a later point time. Another option is waiting for a merger. Often cash is involved in these deals and this is a form of stock buyback/dividends that can realize impressive gains for investors. A third method that shareholders can access a companies loot is through a liquidating dividend. So a stock does have intrinsic value even if it doesn't issue dividends. 

There is no quantifiable answer as the concept is illusory. Banks operate by mismatching short term debt with long term assets. This has no benefit to the economy as a whole and in fact creates inflation, risk and volitionality. Banks operate maturity mismatching because they can and it serves their own interest. There is no natural demand for banks which is why they are in need of constant artificial support from central banks (much of which happens on a daily basis). Without central bank support, banks would be accountable for mismatching short term debt with long term assets and they would quickly and rightly so burn up in a liquidity fire. Perhaps a better premise to start before mathematically quantifying the demand for banks is to ask conceptually the role banks play in an economy first. Without conceptual and contextual understanding, math is meaningless number juggling designed to impress and confuse those that don't know better. Now...it can be said it said there is a demand for money of which banks create. Imagine if we were to switch to the gold standard all of sudden. Only gold could be exchanged for services. Because gold is limited, the price for it (to acquire as a means of exchange) would shoot up astronomically. This profiting (from gold sellers to gold buyers) represents economic loss for the buyers. If they could acquire another means of exchange (say gold deposits that were not tied 100% to gold) they would not have to pay as much for the gold. So in a way banks can create competition for money. But in doing so they create either their own inflation or profiteering. Then there is of course the matter of fiat currencies competing which never ends well... Personally, that is why I'm in favor of a national depository that would negate the need for deposit banking. 

Why do I need to subtract the means from both series? I.e why even introduce $vc_{t}$ and $sc_{t}$ and not just stick with $v_{t}$ and $s_{t}$. And how do I actually calculate these values? Should I simply subtract the sample mean from each observation? I don't understand how to incorporate the price level in to the model. I somewhat understand the structural model, equation (6). But how do I use this to make simulations? I was able to find the AR(1) coefficients and the structural covariance matrix. But how do I use these to simulate the model as Cochrane did. 

$dp_{t} = \Delta ln(p_{t}) - E(\Delta ln(p_{t})) = [\alpha_{a} \quad \alpha_{z}] [a_{t} \quad z_{t}]'$ (6) This is the structural model. Cochrane then says 

I am trying to replicate the results of Cochrane, 1998. Most of the paper is just describing the theory behind The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level. But from p. 42 he begins the econometrics aspect. Cochrane uses a frictionless model so the government's flow budget constraint can be written as: $v_{t} = \frac{1}{r_{t+1}}(s_{t+1} + v_{t+1})$ (1) where $v_{t} = \frac{B_{t-1}(t)}{p_{t}}$ i.e, the real value of a bond issued in $t-1$ and matures in $t$. $s_{t}$ is the real primary surplus and $r_{t}$ is the real rate of return on government bonds. For theoretical reasons he deflates the variables by consumption (as opposed to output) and writes the flow constraint as: $\frac{v_{t}}{c_{t}} = \frac{1}{r_{t+1}}\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_{t}} (\frac{s_{t+1}}{c_{t+1}} + \frac{v_{t+1}}{c_{t+1}})$. If we define $\beta = \frac{1}{r_{t+1}} \frac{c_{t+1}}{c_{t}}$, the flow constraint can be iterated forward and expressed as: $vc_{t} = E_{t} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \beta^{j} sc_{t+j}$ (2) Note that $vc_{t}$ and $sc_{t}$ and just $vc_{t} = \frac{v_{t}}{c_{t}} - E(\frac{v_{t}}{c_{t}})$ and $sc_{t} = \frac{s_{t}}{c_{t}} - E(\frac{s_{t}}{c_{t}})$. Here is my first source of confusion: Why does he subtract the mean from each series? I understand that this is "deviations from the mean" but surely the flow constraint could be iterated forward even without subtracting the means? A key aspect of the fiscal theory is that primary surpluses evolve exogenously. Thus, Cochrane defines the following: $sc_{t} = a_{t} + z_{t}$ (3) where $a_{t} = \phi_{a}a_{t-1} + \epsilon_{at}$ $z_{t} = \phi_{z} z_{t-1} + \epsilon_{zt}$ note that $a_{t}$ and $z_{t}$ are unobserved variables. Substituting this into equation (2) we find that: $vc_{t} = \frac{\beta \phi_{a}}{1 - \beta \phi_{a}} a_{t} + \frac{\beta \phi_{z}}{1 - \beta \phi_{z}} z_{t} $ (4) So equation (3) and (4) describe the observed variables (sc,vc) in terms of the unobserved ones (a,z). We can put this in state-space form: Let $Y_{t} = (sc_{t}, vc_{t})'$ be the vector of observed variables and let $X_{t} = (a_{t},z_{t})'$ be the vector of unobserved variables. Then the system can be represented as: $Y_{t} = BX_{t}$ and $X_{t} = AX_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t}$ where $ B =\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ \frac{\beta \phi_{a}}{1 - \beta \phi_{a}}& \frac{\beta \phi_{z}}{1 - \beta \phi_{z}} \end{bmatrix}$, $A = \begin{bmatrix} \phi_{a} & 0 \\ 0& \phi_{z} \end{bmatrix}$, $\epsilon_{t} = (\epsilon_{at}, \epsilon_{zt})'$ This can be expressed as $Y_{t} = B(AX_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t}) =BA \underbrace{B^{-1}Y_{t-1}}_{\text{$X_{t-1}$}} + \underbrace{e_{t}}_{\text{$B\epsilon_{t}$}}$ (5) So (5) is a reduced form equation which can be estimated. I have estimated the model and obtained $\phi_{a}$ and $\phi_{z}$ as well as the reduced form covariance matrix from which I was able to infer the "structural" covariance matrix. You can find Cochrane's results on p.43. The next part is where I am very confused, he says: 

I apologise for the long post, if you want further information I recommend p.42-46 from the paper. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. 

$dp_{t} = [1 \quad -0.21] [sc_{t} \quad vc_{t}]'$ And lastly, he goes on to simulate this model. I am able to follow up until he introduces the price level ($dp_{t}$). My two questions are:
