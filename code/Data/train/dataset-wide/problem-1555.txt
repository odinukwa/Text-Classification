This is simply false, so of course it gets you in trouble if you insist on taking it as axiomatic. The average recession velocity goes luminal at redshift $z\approx 1.4$, while there are observed galaxies and objects at $z\sim 8$, e.g., Z8 GND 5296 dwarf galaxy and the GRB 090423 gamma ray burst. Additionally, there are at least some candidates for objects much farther than even that, possibly $z\sim 12$. That means that other than the CMB itself, the most distant and most ancient object we might have observed hails from when the universe as around $370\,\mathrm{Myr}$ old, which is around a thousand times older than the recombination epoch when the universe first became transparent and hence when the cosmic background radiation was emitted. In terms of redshift, the CMB has $z\gtrsim 1100$ or so. 

You seem to have an implicit assumption about where the Big Bang occurred. It actually occurred everywhere. Including here. See this question. Imagine looking out to the most distant galaxy that you can barely see. Because of the finite speed of light, you are looking at it not as it is, but as it was in the distant past. You are just now catching light from that distant place. If you were instantly transported to that place, and look back to where the Milky Way should be, you won't see it, but rather as this area of space was in the distant past. You'll be just catching light from somewhere the Milky Way area. In other words, you will see light from the distant past no matter where you go. Because the Big Bang happened everywhere, light from it (well, actually from recombination epoch later, because the universe wasn't transparent before then) is present everywhere. And hence it'll look about the same no matter where you go, again assuming isotropy and homogeneity. 

Excepting a Big Rip scenario, there is no eventual 'clash'. Consider a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker universe: $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\mathrm{d}t^2 + a^2(t)\left[\frac{\mathrm{d}r^2}{1-kr^2} + r^2\left(\mathrm{d}\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\,\mathrm{d}\phi^2\right)\right]\text{,}$$ where $a(t)$ is the scale factor and $k\in\{-1,0,+1\}$ corresponds to a spatially open, flat, or closed cases, respectively. In a local orthonormal frame, the nonzero Riemann curvature components are, up to symmetries: $$\begin{eqnarray*} R_{\hat{t}\hat{r}\hat{t}\hat{r}} = R_{\hat{t}\hat{\theta}\hat{t}\hat{\theta}} = R_{\hat{t}\hat{\phi}\hat{t}\hat{\phi}} =& -\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} &= \frac{4\pi G}{3}\left(\rho + 3p\right)\text{,} \\ R_{\hat{r}\hat{\theta}\hat{r}\hat{\theta}} = R_{\hat{r}\hat{\phi}\hat{r}\hat{\phi}} = R_{\hat{\theta}\hat{\phi}\hat{\theta}\hat{\phi}} =& \frac{k+\dot{a}^2}{a^2} &= \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho\text{,} \end{eqnarray*}$$ where overdot denotes differentiation with respect to coordinate time $t$ and the Friedmann equations were used to rewrite them in terms of density $\rho$ and pressure $p$. From the link, note in particular that $\dot{\rho} = -3\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\left(\rho+p\right)$. If dark energy is described by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, as it is in the standard ΛCDM model, then it contributes a constant density and pressure $\rho = -p = \Lambda/8\pi G$, and so no amount of cosmic expansion would change things. Locally, things look just the same as they ever did: for a universe dominated by dark energy, the curvature stays the same, so the gravitational tidal forces do too. Through those tiny tidal forces, the dark energy provides some immeasurably tiny perturbation on the behavior of objects, including atomic nuclei, forcing a slightly different equilibrium size than would be otherwise. But it is so small that that it has no relevance to anything on that scale, nor do those equilibrium sizes change in time. The cosmological constant holds true to its name. On the other hand, if dark energy has an equation of state $p = w\rho$, then a flat expanding universe dominated by dark energy has $$\dot{\rho} = -3\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\left(\rho+p\right) = -3\sqrt{\frac{8\pi G}{3}}\left(1+w\right)\rho^{3/2}\text{,}$$ and immediately one can see that there is something special about $w<-1$, leading to an accumulation of dark energy, while the cosmological constant's $w = -1$ leads to no change. This leads to a Big Rip more generally, as zibadawa timmy's answer explains.

Not in general relativity. Energy is the gravitational charge, and antimatter has positive energy; thus it should gravitate in the same way. 

There's two different effects here, and they're both related to viscuous forces in the accreting matter. First, if the infalling matter has some nonzero angular momentum vector $\mathbf{L}$, then consider a plane perpendicular to this vector. Due to its conservation, we can't get rid of rotation along this plane, but the component of angular momentum orthogonal to the plane is zero. As the accreting matter heats up and radiates away energy, that energy is taken from the gravitational potential, which is lessened by bringing the matter particles closer together. Thus, such interactions tend to flatten the matter into the plane orthogonal to its angular momentum. But there's something more that happens for rotating black holes, as a combination of its gravitomagnetic field and viscous forces in the matter, that drives the matter to the plane of the black hole's rotation, regardless of its initial angular momentum. This is called the Bardeen–Petterson effect [1]:

In the standard ΛCDM model of the Big Bang, the universe is infinite and has always been such. The Big Bang singularity happened everywhere, in the sense that far back enough in time, the density diverges to infinity at every place. But this is just a particular model--it assumes that the universe if spatially flat and is globally homogeneous and isotropic. There are extended models in which it is not exactly flat, and so could be finite even if it is still homogeneous and isotropic (if the curvature is even slightly positive). And of course we don't actually know whether it is homogeneous and isotropic at scales much larger than we actually see. Some inflationary models imply that it isn't. 

We could measure it. As a conceptually (but not practically) simple way to do so, we could set up a small ball consisting of initially comoving test particles. With no curvature of the gravitational field, every such ball would keep the same shape and volume because they're all the test particles are moving in the same direction with the same speed. But if the gravitational field has Ricci curvature, the volume of the ball would either start shrinking or expanding. Similarly, changes in the shape of the ball would give information about Weyl curvature. This is the same kind of answer as in the case of electromagnetism: the field strength is also a kind of curvature (though not of spacetime), but how do we perceive it? Well, we could measure it by seeing how test charges behave. 

To clarify: the ΛCDM model uses the assumes a spatially flat FLRW solution of general relativity, in which space is the Euclidean $3$-space The Euclidean $3$-space is the only flat homogeneous and isotropic $3$-manifold, so there no way to make it finite without violating at least one of those modeling assumption (e.g., a flat torus could have the same form for the metric, but would not be globally isotropic). 

This is only significant closer to the black hole, at $r\lesssim 100M$. At larger radii, the disk shape is due to the direction of the angular momentum of the matter instead. 

I'm not sure what you mean by saying that quantum gravity "doesn't exist". But because this is the Astronomy SE, I will interpret your question as primarily asking why astronomy hasn't found evidence of quantum gravity. This is a reasonable question; after all, nineteenth-century astronomers have found evidence of funny business in the perihelion precession of Mercury, which in the twentieth century was understood as the relativistic corrections to the Newtonian orbits. Then astronomy one-upped that and found more evidence for general relativity. So why not now? Because gravity is weak. Very weak. Weakness per se isn't a big problem theoretically; it makes it possible to calculate quantum gravity corrections when they aren't too large, which can be interpreted as a running Newton's constant: $$G(r) = G\left[1 - \frac{167}{30\pi}\frac{G\hbar}{r^2c^2} + \ldots\right]\text{.}$$ For example, for the Sun's gravitational field near the Sun's surface (mass $M_\odot\sim 2\times 10^{30}\,\mathrm{kg}$, radius $R_\odot\sim 7\times 10^8\,\mathrm{m}$), the relativistic corrections are of order $GM_\odot/rc^2\sim 10^{-6}$, a few parts per million, while the quantum gravity corrections are on the order of $G\hbar/r^2c^3\sim 10^{-88}$, which is so much smaller as to be completely hopeless. Making the Sun a black hole would not improve things by much, since in that case $r = 2GM_\odot/c^2$ means while the relativistic corrections become appreciable, the quantum gravity corrections are on the order of $10^{-76}$. Note that larger black holes are actually worse, which is sensible because large-scale quantum gravity must agree with general relativity. An interesting overview by Cliff P.
