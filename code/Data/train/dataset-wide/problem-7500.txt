A Gassmann-Sunada triple is a triple $(U,V,W)$ of groups, with $V, W$ subgroups of $U$, such that $U$ and $V$ meet every conjugacy class in $U$ in the same number of elements, and such that $V$ and $W$ are not conjugate. Such triples have been widely used for constructing isospectral manifolds. However, usually when I encounter these triples in the manifold context, I read something like "... and if one now can find a suitable manifold such that $U$ acts in the right way, then ...." My first question is: (a) Starting from a triple $(U,V,W)$ as above, how does one naturally construct isospectral manifolds, which are not isometric ? (So I want to see the manifolds arise only from the data $(U,V,W)$, and I also want a guarantee that the manifolds are not isometric.) Next, I wonder if someone can give me a reference on the second question: (b) Construct isospectral manifolds $\mathcal{M}_U$ and $\mathcal{M}_V$ from $(U,V,W)$ in the "natural way" (see the answers on (a)). Now let $T$ be a group properly containing $U$, and assume it "induces the same Gassmann-Sunada triple" (for instance, $T$ also acts on the same sets $X$ and $Y$ which give the permutation groups $(U,U/V)$ and $(U,U/W)$). My guess is that this "new" triple gives the same manifolds as those coming from $(U,V,W)$. Can anyone fill in the details here ? Bye ... 

It is well known that Gassmann-Sunada group triples can be used to construct isospectral manifolds, arithmetically equivalent number fields, etc. (Recall that a Gassmann-Sunada triple $(U,V,W)$ consists of a group $U$ and subgroups $V, W$ such that every $U$-conjugacy class hits $V$ and $W$ in the same number of elements.) Starting from known triples, one can construct new ones using "trivial constructions," such as enlarging $U$, direct products, etc. My question now is: are there constructions known using tensor products of groups ? If so, are they "trivial" ? 

I have read many times that it is crucial to understand the absolute Galois group $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) =: L$, in so far that some have stated (was it Richard Taylor ?) that this understanding is the main goal (or the very definition) of Number Theory (give or take). Anyway, in this question I am concerned with actions of this group. I know that there is, for instance, Grothendieck's "Dessins d'enfants" theory (although Deligne has stated that, at the point of writing and publishing his famous "projective line minus three points paper," the dessins had not helped that understanding very much at all). If one would want to define some action of $L$ on some space/set/geometry/etc., what would make that action interesting ? Example given: I have never seen descriptions of $L$ on combinatorial geometries such as (axiomatic) projective planes, but (when) would such actions be interesting enough ? What are natural constraints on the geometry acted upon, so that we would have a nice action ? 

Suppose $\chi$ is a scheme of finite type over the field $k$; define $\overline{\chi} := \chi \otimes_{\mathrm{Spec}(k)} \mathrm{Spec}(\overline{k})$, with $\overline{k}$ an algebraic closure of $k$. Then with $G$ the absolute Galois group $\mathrm{Aut}(\overline{k}/k)$, the closed points of $\chi$ correspond to the $G$-orbits in the set of closed points of $\overline{\chi}$. 

I have a number of questions on constructible sets. The first one is on morphisms: suppose $X$ and $Y$ are constructible sets, respectively in projective spaces $\mathbf{P}_1$ and $\mathbf{P}_2$ over a field $k$. How does one define morphisms between $X$ and $Y$ as natural generalization of morphisms between closed subsets of $\mathbf{P}_1$ and $\mathbf{P}_2$ ? Can one see $X$ and $Y$ naturally as ringed spaces, and then see the morphisms as morphisms between ringed spaces ? Thanks ! 

Hi there, I have a question which popped up while reading papers on motives. Let $V_k$ be the category of (projective) k-varieties, and let $K_0(V_k)$ be the Grothendieck ring of $V_k$; then $\mathbb{L}$ is the class $[\mathbf{A}^1]$. I read in several places that in the Grothendieck ring of motives of $V_k$, $\mathbb{L}$ corresponds to the class $[(\mathrm{Spec}(k),\mathrm{id},-1)]$. Why is that? (Where is the affine line gone suddenly?) Thanks so much ! 

Let $\mathcal{Q}$ be an irreducible quadric in $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$, with $n \geq 2$ and $k$ a finite field. Let $K_0(V_k)$ be the Grothendieck ring of $k$-varieties. It is well known (it appears) that the class $[\mathcal{Q}]$ in $K_0(V_k)$ is contained in $\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{L}]$, where $\mathbb{L} = [\mathbb{A}^1(k)]$. My question is: what is an easy (elementary) way to prove this rigorously ? The more proofs the better !! 

I read the following statement in these slides of Saharon Shelah: "$K$ is stable iff for every $M \in K$ there are only "few" complete types over $M$." About the notation: here $K$ consists of all structures $N$ with the same theory of $M$, that is, the same set of first order sentences which are true in $M$. I am trying to understand this statement in a context far away from Model Theory. Suppose $M$ is, e.g., a projective space $\mathbb{P}^n(k)$ with $k$ some field; then what would this statement mean exactly ? 

Let $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{P}^n(k)$ be the $n$-dimensional projective space over a field $k$, let $A, B$ be projective varieties in $\mathbf{P}$ such that $A \subset B$. Now define $V(A,B)$ to be the set of all projective varieties $C$ such that $A \subseteq C \subseteq B$. What can be said about the structure of $V(A,B)$ ? What about the same question where we allow "quasi-projective'' instead of ''projective" ? Can one see $V(A,B)$ as a variety (and what is its dimension) ? 

Here is my second question on constructible sets, now on Grothendieck rings. Let $K_0(Sch_k)$ be the Grothendieck ring of schemes over $k$. I have read that if $S$ is a constructible set in a projective $k$-space $\mathbf{P}$ (or in a scheme over $k$), then $S$ has a well-defined class in $K_0(Sch_k)$. Is there an easy way to see this ? Also, if $C$ is closed in $S$, does one know that $[S] = [C] + [S \setminus C]$ ? Thanks again ! 

for a general reference, this book "Absolute Arithmetic and $\mathbb{F}_1$-Geometry" (Thas, ed., with chapters by Borger, Deitmar, Le Bruyn, Lorscheid, Manin & Marcolli, Thas) should give all the answers, I guess. Some chapters might be on arxiv. And I also think this paper ''Projective spaces over $\mathbb{F}_{1^\ell}$'' by Thas (on arxiv) might give the answers to the question(s) of @Alexander Chervov. 

Let $\Gamma = (P,L,I)$ be a point-line geometry (here, $P$ is the point set, $L$ the line set, and $I$ is the symmetric incidence relation). (As an example, $\Gamma$ could be a graph.) I suppose $\vert P \vert = \vert L \vert = n \in \mathbb{N}$. Now put $P = \{ p_1,\ldots,p_n \}$ and $L = \{ l_1,\ldots,l_n\}$; according to this labeling, I define the incidence matrix of $\Gamma$ as the $(n \times n)$-matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ in which $a_{ij} = 1$ if $p_i\ I\ l_j$, and $0$ otherwise. I have the following two questions: 

I read in Serre's "Lectures on $N_X(p)$" that when $X$ is a scheme defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$ (a finite field), the geometric Frobenius $F: X \mapsto X$ is defined by fixing every element of the topological space of $X$, and acting as $f \mapsto f^q$ on the structure sheaf. As a particular case, if $X$ is affine (say $Spec(\mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x,y])$), then "$F$ is the "standard Frobenius map" (on points): $(u,v) \mapsto (u^q,v^q)$." Why is that ? Doesn't the action on the structure sheaf implies that every element of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}[x,y]$ is raised to the $q$-th power ? Also, I have seen other definitions of geometric Frobenius. (I have noticed related questions on MO, but the answers confuse me even more.) Secondly, it is mentioned that the geometric and arithmetic Frobenius act in the same way on $X(\overline{\mathbb{F}_q})$. Can anyone explain this in some detail ? Thanks ! 

I was wondering what was known about fields $k$ having the property that any polynomial over $k$ of degree $3$ has at least one root in $k$. Does such a field have a special name ? Is there some kind of classification ? Many thanks ... 

I often see lower bounds on the size of centralizers of involutions in finite (nonabelian) simple groups, but is there a general upper bound for the size of an involution centralizer in such a group (in function of, for instance, the size of the simple group) ? Best, 

I have some questions about toric geometry. 1) Can any toric variety (I mean not necessarily smooth or projective, ...) be constructed from a fan ? 2) Suppose $T_1$ and $T_2$ are toric varieties coming from fans $F_1$ and $F_2$ in (say) $\mathbb{R}^2$. Is there a theorem saying something like "$T_1$ and $T_2$ are isomorphic if and only if $F_1$ and $F_2$ are, by an element of (for instance - just to set the stage) $\mathbf{GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$" ? 3) If so, does it generalize to higher dimensions as well ? Thanks so much ! 

Many research has been done on Cremona groups - the Cremona group $\mathrm{Cr}(\mathbb{P}^d(k))$ in dimension $d$ over a field $k$ is the group of birational transformations of $\mathbb{P}^d(k)$. (Many other equivalent definitions exist; e.g., it can also be defined as the $k$-automorphism group of $k(X_1,\ldots,X_d)$.) I have done some browsing, and usually I seem to come up with pages and papers where $k = \mathbb{C}$, where $k$ is algebraically closed, etc. In any case, "usually" $k$ seems to be infinite. QUESTION: What are the big results known when $k$ is finite ? How is the $k$ finite case essentially different from the $k$ infinite case ? What about the case $d = 2$ ?
