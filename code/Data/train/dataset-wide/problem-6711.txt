In Addition to @Christophe Strobbe's answer, there is a kind of private use area in ISO 639-3: In addition, 520 codes in the range – are 'reserved for local use'. So you can assign in your application the code for "other" when you want to do this. Note that the same code can have completely different assignments on other places. 

"Inline", as you call it; it is also called "vertical" or "one word per line" or "one token by line" "Standoff", as you call it, also called "horizontal" or "layered" 

Morphological levelling is the force working against Verner's law in this situation. Note also that many forms with the ge- prefix may be created after Verner's law was active; there is a modern trend to date the activity of Verner's law even before Grimm's law was active. 

From your additional comments I see that you want to have some LaTeX input that can be rendered in two ways: Cyrillic orthography and IPA. I suggest the following approach: Design some LaTeX macros, one Macro for each possible pair (Cyrillic letter(s), IPA representation). There will be easy cases and complicated ones. Then use some switches to the macros to render them in the fashion you want to have them. For more in-depth advice on designing the LaTeX macros, ask a question of the TeX stackexchange $URL$ 

Many languages lack phonemic glottal stops, but regularly insert them. For example: English invariably inserts glottal stops before utterance-initial vowels, and often before word-initial vowels when enunciating: 

Is it true that languages often don't distinguish (phonemically) between velarization and pharyngealization? If so, why? Are they acoustically similar? 

It depends on the language, and how you choose to analyze it. In the phonetic sense, an affricate is a consonant cluster consisting of a stop that is released directly into a fricative, with no intervening release burst before the start of the fricative. Affricates may or may not be phonemic; that depends on whether the affricate behaves phonologically/phonotactically as an indivisible unit. An example is the cluster [tˢs]. In Japanese, it patterns as a phonemic unit; in fact, it alternates with (compare [matsu] waits with [mata] waited), and is often considered an allophone of, the single phoneme /t/. In contrast, in English, [tˢs] is a sequence of 2 phonemes rather than a phoneme, because it patterns like the sequence /t/ + /s/ (in words like cats /kæts/ the /t/ and /s/ belong to different morphemes, so /ts/ is clearly not a unitary phoneme). Another case is [tɕ] in Russian. This is clearly a phonemic affricate: because Russian doesn't even have a phoneme /ɕ/, it's not even possible to analyze it as a sequence. Whether to consider a (phonetic) affricate as two separate consonants in the onset depends on whether you are considering it as a non-phonemic sequence. Phonotactic considerations can also guide you here. Example: /tʃ/ in Spanish. There are 2 arguments that this should be considered a single consonant in the onset: 

The native name for Latin is Lingua Latina "Latin language". The adjective latinus is not only used for the Latin language, but also for people and things coming from the region of Latium (where the Latin language was originally spoken). 

For syntactically annotated sentences, I suggest to get a treebank, for example the Penn Treebank. There is also a great tool called GrETEL that allows you to enter a sentence (in ordinary language) and query for syntactically similar sentences. GrETEL is supported by the European Language Research Infrastructure CLARIN. 

Well, it happens even nowadays that languages are created anew from fragments of other languages. There are creoles like Papiamento or Tok Pisin that are created from fragments of different and unrelated languages and have no clear antecessor. There are also constructed languages like Loglan or Lojban that did not evolve from any natural language. I also remember (but I could not retrieve a quotable reference in short time) a story about twins raised in circumstances of language deprivation who developed their own language allegedly not related to the language of the country they lived in. Having said all this, the main reason for having unrelated language families is time depth: Any traces of relatedness are completely wiped out by linguistic changes over time. 

It looks mostly regular. The (classical) Latin benedictiōnem /benediktioːnẽ/. In Western Romance, changes that would apply: 

Japanese is similar, except it also allows a glottal stop utterance-finally, especially in emphatic utterances: 

Combining these sound changes, we get something like /benejtsjon/. (The sound /ts/ was often written c or ç.) The same applies for /malediktioːnẽ/ > /malejts(j)on/. I'm not sure why the /j/ after /ts/ is lost here; it might be idiosyncratic. 

It's a type of appeal to emotion, specifically an appeal to flattery. The first part of the statement is an example of antiphrasis It can also be considered a red herring, since it is intended to distract from the negative second part. Like a dissoi logoi, but with a different intention. Related terms: 

Not sure if this is the same text you're thinking of, but "The North Wind and the Sun" ("Βορέας καὶ Ἥλιος"), one of Aesop's fables, is commonly translated into various languages and used as an example text in phonetics. The International Phonetic Association has a tradition of using it as an example text to illustrate its phonological descriptions of languages and dialects (see the Handbook for many translations and transcriptions). But it doesn't contain the phrases you mention. Audio readings of the IPA's translations of the fable are available. Wikisource has a Polytonic Greek version, two versions in English, one in Spanish, and one in Japanese. The Wikipedia article says it's also used "as a parallel text in comparative linguistics as it provides more natural language than the Lord's Prayer". 

If I remember correctly, a major argument in favour of the reinterpreted consonant system is the suspicious rareness of *b in the protolanguage. The absence of /b/ in the presence of /p/ and /bʰ/ is more difficult to explain than the absence of /ˀp/ in the presence of /p:/ and /p/. The problem is that no Indogermanic language has preserved glottalised stops (they are present in Armenian but this can be explained as a later acquisition due to areal influence of Caucasian languages). 

For sure, there was an advance in linguistic capabilities from great apes to humans, and this advance is determined by some genes. One gene, termed "The language gene" in popular science and in genetics is already identified. Its protein differs in two positions between humans and the other mammals (it is the same for great apes and mice!). The mutation is shared by Neanderthalers and modern men, therefore it is at least 300 thousand years old. There may be differences in linguistic capabilities between modern men, but there is a strong levelling effect: Assume, that a minority of men has some advanced linguistic capabilities and they can communicate more effectively with each other. They need to communicate with the majority of people lacking those advanced capabilities using the majorities' language, so they cannot take profit from their mutations. It is unlikely that speech communities with advanced linguistic capabilities can form and will be identified by linguists. 

In addition to slashes and square brackets, sometimes also used are double-slashes, pipes, and angle brackets. Their uses are: 

This same phenomenon appears in many other ON words, such as tǫnn 'tooth', from Proto-Germanic *tanþs, gunnr 'war' from *gunþiz, munnr 'mouth' from *munþaz. (Note that English instead lost the /n/.) 

While Lapropriu gives evidence for a sort of vowel harmony, diphthongizing "stem-changing" verbs are not an example of vowel harmony. This is not restricted to -ir-conjugation verbs; other common ones are sentar (me siento 'I sit'; nos sentamos 'we sit') and perder (pierdo 'I lose'; perdemos 'we lose'). And there's nothing special about verbs; the same phenomenon occurs with stress alternation in nouns and adjectives. Example: /be.ne.ˈθwe.la/ Venezuela, /be.ne.θo.ˈla.no/ venezolano. (Aside: This process is no longer productive; more recent forms do not alternate: Puerto Rico /pwer.to.ˈrˑi.ko/ corresponds to puertorriqueño /pwer.to.rˑi.ˈke.ɲo/, not */porto/-.) Generally, the alternating diphthongizations are derived from Latin short /e/ and /o/. In Spanish, these vowels regularly become /je/ and /we/ in stressed syllables, and /e/ and /o/ in unstressed syllables. This accounts for the alternation between most such verb forms, which differ in stress. It occurs regardless of the other vowels in the word, so it is not vowel harmony. (Non-alternating /e/ and /o/ come from Latin /eː/ or /i/, resp. /oː/ or /u/.) Demonstration: /e/ in contar diphthongizes in stressed syllables, when followed by a syllable starting with any of the possible vowels for the -ar conjugation: * /e/: present subjunctive 3sg -> cuente * /a/: present indicative 2sg (tú) -> cuentas * /o/: present indicative 1sg -> cuento but never diphthongizes in unstressed syllables: * /e/: past perfective indicative 1sg -> conté * /a/: present indicative 2sg (vos) -> contás * /o/: past perfective indicative 3sg -> contó More information: historical sound changes; conjugations. You could argue that the raising mutations in ir-conjugation verbs are like vowel harmony, since they only occur in that conjugation, and depend somewhat on the vowel in the following syllable. But there doesn't seem to be any tendency to regularly place the same vowels in multiple classes, which would be needed for it to be vowel harmony. 

This is called Order of Genitive and Noun and common abbreviations are GenN (for A's B) and NGen (for B of A). For a survey, see WALS chapter 86. 

By policy, UNICODE does not assign code points for contextual variants. Some contextual variants are in by exception—their purpose is to guarantee round-trip equivalence with some older legacy standards that were in existence before UNICODE. So you should go with the single code point for ARABIC LETTER DOTLESS FEH (U+06A1) and let the typesetting engine do the contextualisation. When the engine does not reproduce the handwriting faithfully, you can hint the contextual variant using one of the two characters ZERO WIDTH JOINER and ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER. EDIT: This means in particular, that you should not use the available contextual variants for encoding the Arabic script and treat them as deprecated or compatibility only characters. 

I suggest getting all the persons from Wikipedia. You can use a wikipedia dump and the category system to extract the person names. For the German Wikipedia, there is a tool and an interface to browse person names here: $URL$ 

The Wikipedia article "Aramaic of Jesus" contains many instances of transliterated Aramaic, using a system I have not seen before. Some of the notations are well-established, like ŝ for /ʃ/ and macrons for long vowels, but there are many I haven't seen before. I tried looking up more information on Aramaic transcription systems. Wikipedia has no article on Aramaic transcription, and the articles on Aramaic, Romanization of Hebrew, and various Hebrew letters don't seem to have any relevant information. Particularly T-cedilla: 

This is a common process called lenition. Consider a language that has a phoneme /b/ as its only voiced bilabial phoneme. Speakers will then often pronounce /b/ without complete closure of the airway, giving a fricative [β] or approximant [β̞] realization. A very similar phenomenon occurs in Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan, where intervocalic /b/ is realized as [β̞]. For example, Spanish bobo /ˈbo.bo/ will be pronounced [ˈbo.β̞o]. Japanese similarly often realizes /b/ as /β/. In this case, the (voiced bilabial) stop turns into an approximant. Kyrgyz lacks a /w/ phoneme, so there is no need to distinguish /b/ from /w/. Since the bilabial approximant [β̞] sounds similar to the bilabial-velar approximant [w], it is not surprising that [w] is another possible realization. Such shifting between various labial sounds and [w] is very common cross-linguistically; examples include: 

Add more rules for other terminals (bit, admired, rat, elephant, ...). I didn't care for generating initial capitalisation or interpunctuation (you can add this if you care). 

There is no proof that the Indus valley language was Dravidian at all. Looking only at the geographical distribution of the Dravidian languages, it looks at the first sight that Brahui is an old relic of a formerly existing Dravidian language continuum stretching from the southern tip of India to the border of Pakistan and Iran. However, newer research has completely turned the picture, now we think that the Brahui speaking people are rather recent immigrants from central India. They picked up words from Indoarian languages during their migration. Glottochronology also tells us, that the last common ancestor of the Dravidian languages is rather young, and post-dates the Indus civilisation. 

It's history. The western European languages share the Latin alphabet (with minor deviations) because of the cultural dominance of the Roman empire and later the Catholic Church. Shared words (that a layman recognises as the same) are typically rather recent coinings, often borrowed from the culturally prestigious languages Latin and Classical Greek. Those shared words are found in the domains of science and technology as well as in religion or politics. The common Indo-European ancestry is blurred by sound shifts and semantical shifts and expert knowledge is needed to discover it. To a layman, the words "tooth" (Englisch) "Zahn" (German) and "dens" (Latin) do not look shared anymore. 

There are two terms used for pairs of words (in the same or different languages) that look similar but are actually unrelated: false friend and false cognate. Are these terms synonymous? If not, what's the difference? 

Yes. Korean [kor] There are roughly 2,000,000 Koreans living in China. Ethnologue lists 1,920,000 Korean speakers in China as of the 2000 census. (Not sure whether that counts North Korean refugees.) Korean is an isolate (assuming you don't accept it as Altaic). Wikipedia says, "With over 78 million speakers, Korean has more speakers than all other language isolates combined." So Korean wins. Chinese Sign Language [csl] Wikipedia lists it as an isolate. There are probably other local sign language isolates, presumably undocumented or poorly documented. ISO 639-3 considers it two languages, the other being hks. List See also Wikipedia's partial list. 

This seems to be an under-studied phenomenon despite its widespread occurrence. Do you have any references comparing how this works in different languages?
