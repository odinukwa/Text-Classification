Let $S=\{2^k-1: k \in \mathbf{N}\}=\{1_2,(11)_2,(111)_2,...\}$. Clearly $S$ is sparse. Writing $m,n \in \mathbf{N}$ in their binary expansion, $m$ is connected to $n$ in $G_S$ if $m>n$ and $n$ is obtained by bitwise inverting $m$. For example, $(11001)_2$ is connected to $(00110)_2=(110)_2$. This shows that $G_S$ is connected by repeatedly applying this procedure to an arbitrary element to find a path to 1. To show that there is no bound on the diameter of $G_S$, consider the sequence $(a_k)$ given by $1,(101)_2, (10101)_2, (1010101)_2,...=\{(2^{2k}-1)/3: k \in \mathbf{N}\}.$ Consider a path from $a_n$ to 1. Whenever a digit of a number on this path is flipped, all digits to the right are flipped too. This means that if the left-most digit of $a_n$, which is initially 1, is flipped $r$ times, then the second digit, which is initially 0, must be flipped at least $r+1$ times. By induction, $a_n$ has distance precisely $2n-2$ from 1. 

Suppose that $H$ is normal in $G$. Write $G=\cup_{i=1}^n g_iH$. Let $M < V$ be an irreducible $H$-module and write $M_i:=g_iM$. Since $H$ is normal, $M_i$ is an $H$-module, which is irreducible as $M$ is irreducible. Note that $M_i \cap \sum_{j \neq i} M_j$ is either trivial or equal to $M_i$ since it is a submodule of $M_i$. Now $V=\sum_{i=1}^n M_i$ since the RHS is a $G$-submodule of $V$. By leaving out superfluous $M_i$'s we get that $V$ is a direct sum of certain of the $M_i$'s. 

I'm trying to understand the Cartan decomposition of a semisimple Lie algebra, $\mathfrak g=\mathfrak k \oplus \mathfrak p$, where $[\mathfrak k,\mathfrak p] \subseteq \mathfrak p$, cf. the wikipedia article on Cartan decomposition. I posted the following question on math.stackexchange.com, where Darij suggested to repost the question here as an answer is not completely obvious, I suppose. Let $\mathfrak {so}_{n}$ denote the skew-symmetric complex $n \times n$-matrices and let $M$ denote the symmetric $n \times n$-matrices of trace 0. Then $M$ is a module over the Lie algebra $\mathfrak {so}_n$ (this comes from the Cartan decomposition of $\mathfrak {sl}_n$). 

If memory serves, results similar to those you are interest in are proved in Seitz, Gary M. "Abstract homomorphisms of algebraic groups." Journal of the London Mathematical Society 56.1 (1997): 104-124. More recent references include the work by Caprace and his students, the starting point being Caprace, Pierre-Emmanuel. "Abstract" Homomorphisms of Split Kac-Moody Groups. Amer Mathematical Society, 2009. The main trick, already noted in Borel--Tits, is the following: by Jacobson-Morozov (on the group level), the nilpotent element you are interested in is included in a group of type $A_1$, i.e. $\text{SL}_2(\mathbf C)$ or $\text{PSL}_2(\mathbf C)$. Now either use representation theory (Caprace) or the fact that your nilpotent element is included in the derived group of a solvable group (Borel--Tits). 

A group $G$ is said to be linear if there exists a field $k$, an integer $n$ and an injective homomorphism $\varphi: G \to \text{GL}_n(k).$ Given a short exact sequence $1 \to K \to G \to Q \to 1$ of groups where $K$ and $Q$ are linear (over the same field), is it true that $G$ is linear too? Background: Arithmetic groups are by definition commensurable with a certain linear group, so they are finite extensions of a linear group, and finite groups clearly are linear (over any field). 

Let $I$ be an infinite index set and for $i \in I$ let $G_i$ be a finite group with trivial centre. Let $G:=\prod_{i \in I} G_i$ be the direct product of these groups. Then $G$ satisfies the property you mentioned $$ \forall g \in G\backslash \lbrace 1 \rbrace \exists b \in G: [G:C(b)]<\infty, g \not\in C(b) $$ but is not an FC-group, i.e., not every conjugacy class is finite. Indeed, let $g=(g_i)_{i \in I}\neq 1$ and $i_0 \in I$ such that $g_{i_0}\neq 1$. Let $b=(b_i)_{i \in I}$ be such that $b_i=1$ for $i \neq i_0$ and $b_{i_0}$ be such that it does not commute with $g_{i_0}$ (which exists since $G_{i_0}$ is assumed to have trvial centre). Then $g\not\in C(b)$, but $C(b)$ contains $\prod_{i \neq i_0} G_i \times \lbrace 1 \rbrace$ which is of index $|G_{i_0}|$. On the other hand, every element $g=(g_i)_{i \in I} \in G$ with infinite support, i.e. $g_i\neq 1$ for infinitely many $i$, clearly has infinitely many conjugates. 

Write $S=\{s_1, s_2, \ldots\}$ with $s_i<s_{i+1}$ for all $i$. Then $G_S$ has infinitely many connected components as soon as $s_{i+1}>2s_i$ for all $i$. (In particular, $S=\{3^k: k\in \mathbf{N}\}$ will do.) To see this, consider the induced subgraph $\Gamma_{n+1}$ on the vertices $\{1,\ldots,s_{n+1}\}$. It is obtained from the induced subgraph $\Gamma_n$ on the vertices $\{1,\ldots,s_n\}$ by "mirroring" at $s_{n+1}/2$. The connected components of $\Gamma_n$ now get twice as big and stay disjoint, while there is at least one new connected component due to the condition $s_{i+1}>2s_i+1$. The claim now follows by induction. 

For the record, here is a somewhat different proof: For $x \in X$ there is a permutation $g_x \in G$ which has only $x$ as a fixed point (as $|X|\geq 3)$. If two permutations $a,b$ commute, then $a$ sends fixed points of $b$ to fixed points of $b$ again. Now if $g$ is central, it commutes in particular with every $g_x$ for $x \in X$, hence it must fix $x$ as $x$ is the only fixed point of $g_x$. Hence $g$ is the identiy. 

The proof given by Steinhaus (following A. Schinzel) is slick indeed. I'll paraphrase what he does: At step number $n$, the interval (0,1) is divided into $n$ intervals $I_0^{(n)}=(0,\frac{1}{n}), \ldots, I_{n-1}^{(n)}=(\frac{n-1}{n},1)$. Then $\lfloor nP \rfloor$ gives you the number of the interval to which a point $P$ in the sequence belongs in the $n.$ step. He proceeds by proving the following claim: If $P_1 \in (\frac{7}{35},\frac{8}{35})$ and $P_2 \in (\frac{9}{35}, \frac{10}{35})$, then there is some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ big enough such that $\lfloor (n-1)P_1 \rfloor < \lfloor nP_1 \rfloor$ , but $\lfloor (n-1)P_2 \rfloor = \lfloor nP_2 \rfloor$. Let's see how this claim implies that there is no infinite such sequence. Eventually, in your sequence at the $k.$ step there will be two points $P_1,P_2$ as in the claim. Let $n$ be as in the claim, in particular $n>k$. Let $k_1:=\lfloor (n-1)P_1\rfloor$ and $k_2:=\lfloor (n-1)P_2\rfloor$. Then $P_i$ belongs to the $k_i$. interval in the $(n-1).$st step and there are $k_2-k_1-1$ points of $a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ of the sequence in-between. But in the $n.$ step, $P_1$ will move to the $k_1+1$.st interval, while $P_2$ will remain in the $k_2$.st interval, and so there will be a ''collision'' of the in-between points. 

Here are two papers dealing with this question: Wilkie, A. J.(4-MANC); van den Dries, L.(1-IA-S) An effective bound for groups of linear growth. Arch. Math. (Basel) 42 (1984), no. 5, 391--396. 20F05 and Imrich, Wilfried(A-MNT); Seifter, Norbert(A-MNT) A bound for groups of linear growth. Arch. Math. (Basel) 48 (1987), no. 2, 100--104. the second one using ends of groups, as indicated by Sam. 

Let $K$ be a field and $L$ an extension of $K$. I wonder how much larger the multiplicative group $L^\times$ of $L$ is than the multiplicative group $K^\times$ of $K$. I know that if $L=K(t)$ and $t$ is transcendental over $K$, then $L^\times/K^\times$ is isomorphic to the direct product of an infinite number of copies of the integers: Indeed, any (monic) rational function can be uniquely written as the product of a finite number of powers of irreducible polynomials. In particular, $L^\times/K^\times$ is not finitely generated. What happens when $L=K(t)$ and $t$ is algebraic over $K$? I can handle the case when $K$ is finite, but what happens in the infinite case? Even for $L=Q(\sqrt{2})$ it's not immediate to me if $L^\times/K^\times$ is finitely generated or not. 

Conjugating by an element $Q \in GL_n(\mathbf{Z})$ is usually not inner, furthermore the graph automorphism $A \mapsto (A^T)^{-1} $ is not inner. The phrase to google for is "automorphisms of Chevalley groups over rings" which in particular turns up recent work of Bunina. By invoking Margulis superrigidity, for $n \geq 3$, any automorphism of $SL_n(\mathbf Z)$ extends to a rational automorphism of $SL_n(\mathbf Q)$. To show that the above-mentioned examples then are the only ones, one calculates the stabilizer of $SL_n(\mathbf Z)$ in $GL_n(\mathbf Q)$. 

Via Theorem 7.2 in Borel-Tits, Groupes reductifs (1965), Tits's lifting result for the Weyl group also applies in the non-split case (for connected groups). This theorem states that there exists a split subgroup $F$ of $G$ such that $F$ contains the maximal split torus $S$ of $G$ and intersects each relative root group of $G$ non-trivially. In particular, the Weyl groups of $F$ and $G$ are isomorphic. 

The key word you're looking for is Littelmann path model, which gives a nice geometric description for the basis of a weight space of a highest-weight representation of a symmetrisable Kac-Moody algebra (see e.g. $URL$ for an introduction), and gives a fairly explicit algebraic description of this basis (see $URL$ Theorem 5.2), from which it is possible to calculate the action of the standard generators. While I don't know of a precise reference where this is written up, it is a good exercise to calculate these things for, say, $\tilde A_1$ and $\tilde A_2$.
