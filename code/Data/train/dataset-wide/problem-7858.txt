It's interesting to think about the case where $X$ is compact Hausdorff but not locally contractible. We have a short exact sequence of sheaves $\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{R}\to S^1$ (where $\mathbb{R}$ really means the sheaf of continuous $\mathbb{R}$-valued functions, and so on). This gives a long exact sequence of cohomology groups. We have partitions of unity, which we can use to prove that the higher cohomology of $\mathbb{R}$ is trivial. One can also check that a map $u\colon X\to S^1$ lifts to $\mathbb{R}$ if and only if it is nullhomotopic. Using this we get $$ H^1_{\text{sheaf}}(X) = [X,S^1] = \{\text{homotopy classes of maps from $X$ to $S^1$}\}. $$ On the other hand, one can prove the Hurewicz theorem and universal coefficient theorem for singular (co)homology by simplicial methods, so they do not depend on any special assumptions about the topology of $X$. If $X$ is path-connected, this gives $$ H^1_{\text{sing}}(X) = \text{Hom}(H_1(X),\mathbb{Z}) = \text{Hom}(\pi_1(X),\mathbb{Z}). $$ There is a natural map $$ \phi_X\colon H^1_{\text{sheaf}}(X) \to H^1_{\text{sing}}(X), $$ but it is not obviously bijective. However, it seems that $\phi_X$ is an isomorphism in at least one interesting case. Let $F$ be a free abelian group of countable rank, and take $$ X = \text{Hom}(F,S^1) \simeq\prod_{i=0}^\infty S^1. $$ As this is compact, any map to a CW complex lands in a finite subcomplex. Using this, it is not hard to see that $X$ does not have the homotopy type of a CW complex. Also, it is not locally simply connected. There is an evident evaluation map $$\chi\colon F\to\text{Map}(X,S^1)\to [X,S^1]=H^1_{\text{sheaf}}(X).$$ We also have $$ \pi_1(X)=\prod_{i=0}^\infty\pi_1(S^1)=\prod_{i=0}^\infty\mathbb{Z}, $$ or more naturally $\pi_1(X)=F^*$, where $A^*$ means $\text{Hom}(A,\mathbb{Z})$. Using this we get $H^1_{\text{sing}}(X)=H_1(X)^*=F^{**}$. The composite $\phi\chi$ is the usual map from $F$ to $F^{**}$. It is a nontrivial algebraic fact that this map is an isomorphism, even though $F$ is infinitely generated. (This is quite different to the situation with vector spaces over a field, of course.) This means that $\chi$ is injective and $\phi$ is surjective. I think that in fact they are both isomorpphisms, but I do not instantly see a proof of that. 

I think that this is always true. We can write $A$ as $A_1\oplus\dotsb\oplus A_r$, where each $A_i$ is cyclic. Let $I(n)$ denote the set of sequences $(i_1,\dotsc,i_n)$ with $1\leq i_1<i_2<\dotsb <i_n\leq r$. For $i\in I^n$ put $A(i)=A_{i_1}\otimes\dotsb\otimes A_{i_n}$, so $A^{\otimes n}=\bigoplus_{i\in I^n}A(i)$. Put $A[n]=\bigoplus_{i\in I(n)}A(i)$, so there is an evident inclusion $\iota\colon A[n]\to A^{\otimes n}$ and projection $\pi\colon A^{\otimes n}\to A[n]$. There is also a map $\mu\colon A^{\otimes n}\to\Lambda^nA$ sending $a_1\otimes\dotsb\otimes a_n$ to $a_1\wedge\dotsb\wedge a_n$. Because $A_i$ is cyclic we have $\Lambda^2A_i=0$, so $\Lambda^*A_i=\mathbb{Z}\oplus A_i$. Moreover, for any $B$ and $C$, the multiplication map $\Lambda^*(B)\otimes\Lambda^*(C)\to\Lambda^*(B\oplus C)$ is an isomorphism. Using this, we see that the map $\mu\iota\colon A[n]\to\bigwedge^nA$ is an isomorphism. On the other hand, it is also easy to see that the composite $\pi\alpha\mu\iota$ is the identity. It follows that $\alpha$ is injective. 

Let $G$ be a discrete group. Let $P$ denote the groupoid whose objects are the elements of $G$, and whose morphisms from $a$ to $b$ are the elements $g\in G$ such that $gag^{-1}=b$. It is then a standard fact that $\Omega'BG=BP$. Less naturally but more concretely, if we choose a set $C$ of representatives for the conjugacy classes in $G$, we get an equivalence $\Omega'BG=\coprod_{c\in C}BZ_G(c)$. If $G$ is nonabelian then this will be different from $BG\times \Omega BG=BG\times G$. For example, you could take $G$ to be the free group on two generators, so $BG$ is a figure eight. UPDATE: I can't immediately remember a convenient reference for the above "standard fact". However, if we regard $\mathbb{Z}$ and $G$ as groupoids with one object, then there is a functor $e\colon\mathbb{Z}\times P\to G$ given by $e((n,g)\colon a \to b)=g^n$. This gives a map $$ Be \colon S^1\times BP = B(\mathbb{Z}\times P) \to BG, $$ and adjointly a map $BP\to\text{Map}(S^1,BG)=\Omega'BG$, which is the one you want. Another way to analyse this is to consider $S^1$ as the pushout of two semicircles along a copy of $S^0$. After applying the functor $\text{Map}(-,BG)$ (and recalling that the semicircles are contractible) we get a homotopy pullback diagram $$ \begin{array}{ccc} \Omega'BG & \to & BG \\ \downarrow && \downarrow \\ BG & \to & BG\times BG \end{array} $$ After thinking a bit about how the maps work, one can recover the previous description of $\Omega'BG$. 

If you ask for 30 digits of accuracy (so that Maple cannot just use hardware floats) then it gets a lot slower, but still only 40 seconds. Incidentally, I tried this first as just Minimize(g), which gave me an answer with a warning that the maximum iteration limit had been reached. The default limit is 50 iterations, so I tried 200 and the warning went away. Also, there is another function called LSSolve which is specifically for the case where your objective function is a sum of squares. I did not use that because I do not know how to express your objective in the relevant form. 

More generally, the cohomology of any smooth hypersurface in $\mathbb{C}P^n$ is described in the paper 'Topology of nonsingular complex hypersurfaces' by Kulkarni and Wood. It depends only on $n$ and the degree of the hypersurface. (In fact, any two smooth hypersurfaces of the same degree are even diffeomorphic.) The proof is basically Morse theory. 

$SL(n,\mathbb{C})^N$ is a smooth and irreducible variety, and thus a manifold. The zero set $Z$ of a nonzero polynomial is a subvariety with $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}(Z)\leq Nn^2-1$ and so $\dim_{\mathbb{R}}(Z)\leq 2Nn^2-2$. If $a$ and $b$ are points in $Z^c$ then we can choose a smooth path $\mathbb{R}\to SL(n,\mathbb{C})^N$ joining them, then perturb it slightly to make it transverse to $Z$. As $\dim_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R})+\dim_{\mathbb{R}}(Z)<\dim_{\mathbb{R}}(SL(n,\mathbb{C})^N)$, transversality just means that the path does not meet $Z$, so we get a path in $Z^c$ as desired. For this we need a result telling us that the path can be made transverse. This is a standard fact in differential topology if $Z$ is a submanifold, which is the generic case. Essentially the same proof should work even if $Z$ is not smooth, though it might be harder to find a convenient reference. 

Let $G$ be a compact Lie group, and let $H$ be a closed subgroup such that $G/H$ is homotopy equivalent to a torus. Is it true that $H$ is normal and $G/H$ is isomorphic to a torus as a Lie group? One line of attack would be to reduce to the case where $G$ is connected, then to the case where $G$ is the product of a torus with a simply connected group, then try to use the classification of simply connected groups. A proof like that would be OK, but I would actually prefer a more uniform proof that just works directly with $G$. 

Probably the most natural thing to ask for Theorem 1 is as follows. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the category whose objects are pairs of finite sets, and whose morphisms are pairs of bijections. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the category of finite sets and functions. (Allowing more morphisms in $\mathcal{A}$ or fewer morphisms in $\mathcal{B}$ would make the problem harder.) We have functors $F,G:\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{B}$ given by $F(A,B)=(A\times B)\uplus(B\times A)$ and $G(A,B)=(A\times A)\uplus(B\times B)$. We then ask whether there is a natural injective map $j:F\to G$. I think the answer is negative. Indeed, the subset $j^{-1}(A\times A)\subseteq F(A,B)$ would have to be preserved by the action of $\text{Aut}(A)\times\text{Aut}(B)$ on $F(A,B)$, so it would have to be $(A\times B)$ or $(B\times A)$, wlog the former. Now $j$ gives an $\text{Aut}(A)\times\text{Aut}(B)$-equivariant map from $A\times B$ to $A\times A$, which consists of two equivariant maps $p,q:A\times B\to A$. For fixed $b$ we have an $\text{Aut}(A)$-equivariant map $p(-,b):A\to A$, and (provided that $|A|>2$) the only possibility is $p(a,b)=a$. Similarly $q(a,b)=a$, and we see that $j$ cannot be injective. [Added later] This whole story may be related to Thomason's paper "Beware the phony multiplication on Quillen's $\mathcal{A}^{-1}\mathcal{A}$". Here $\mathcal{A}$ is a symmetric bimonoidal category (like the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces, under $\oplus$ and $\otimes$). From this Quillen constructed a new category $\mathcal{A}^{-1}\mathcal{A}$. The objects are pairs $(A,B)$, where $A$ and $B$ are objects of $\mathcal{A}$. I won't spell out the morphisms except to say that $(A,B)$ is supposed to represent the "formal difference" $A-B$, and everything is guided by that. It is reasonable to hope that there should be a tensor product on $\mathcal{A}^{-1}\mathcal{A}$ compatible with the original tensor product on $\mathcal{A}$. However, Thomason showed that several purported constructions of such a tensor product contain subtle errors, and that a wide class of approaches are doomed to fail. 

Personally I think that the restricted product description should be avoided. It is best to define $\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$ to be the inverse limit of the system of all quotients $\mathbb{Z}/n$ (without gratuitously factoring $n$ as a product of primes) and then put $\mathbb{A}=(\mathbb{Q}\otimes\widehat{\mathbb{Z}})\times\mathbb{R}$. We can topologise this by giving $\mathbb{R}$ the usual topology, and $\mathbb{Q}\otimes\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$ the topology for which the sets $q\otimes\widehat{\mathbb{Z}}$ form a basis of neighbourhoods of zero. Now the adeles for any number field $K$ can be defined as $\mathbb{A}\otimes K$. Any $\mathbb{Q}$-basis for $K$ identifies $\mathbb{A}\otimes K$ with $\mathbb{A}^d$ and thus gives a topology on $\mathbb{A}\otimes K$, which is easily seen to be independent of the choice of basis. The connection with primes/valuations for $K$ should be a theorem, not a definition.
