Apart from etymological issues (and one cannot ignore that words acquire new uses all the times), the important question is "yes the Math part is clear. Where are the Economics? And the answer is "nowhere". To consider how much of its Industry's profits does a corporation claim in percentage terms, may be a valid additional datum in an overall assessment of the performance of the corporation. But here, the reporter just wanted to fill some space and make some useless noise, which he knew an expression like "$106\%$ of profits" could create. On another front, the OP asks, 

2) Monotonicity of $R(c)$ in relation to $A(c)$ $$\frac {\partial R(c)}{\partial c} = \frac {\partial [cA(c)]}{\partial c}=A(c) + c\frac {\partial A(c)}{\partial c} $$ So if $$\frac {\partial A(c)}{\partial c} \geq 0 \Rightarrow \frac {\partial R(c)}{\partial c} > 0$$ $ARA$ weakly increasing $\Rightarrow RRA$ is strictly increasing in $c$. 

Differentiating $(3)$ with respect to time we get $$u_{cc}\dot c = \dot \lambda \implies \frac {u_{cc}}{u_c} \dot c = \frac {\dot \lambda}{\lambda}$$ Inserting into $(6)$ we obtain $$\dot M = -\frac {\eta_M}{\eta_{MM}}\frac {u_{cc}}{u_c} \dot c$$ So the fixed point of $M$ will happen under the same conditions that the fixed point of $c$ will. Also, the optimal time-evolution of $M$ is a scaled linear value of the optimal evolution of $c$. So it appears all aspects are captured if you "ignore" the $M$ variable. A bit more formally, since your two decision variables are linearly dependent it means that the $3 \times 3$ Jacobian of the system will be singular at the fixed point. You will get a double eigenvalue and a single one, and you should be able to show what stability properties hold (or what is required for the desired stability notion to hold), in such a situation. Due to the existence of the double root, this requires a bit of a different mathematical approach. 

Indeed the IMF reports on this. A recent review-overview paper is Quinn, D., Schindler, M., & Toyoda, A. M. (2011). Assessing measures of financial openness and integration. IMF Economic Review, 59(3), 488-522. In the introduction, the authors write 

It is "stupid" only to the extent that it doesn't take into account the socio-economic and political realities. It appears the government tries to make the plan acceptable by giving to everybody, rich and poor, the same nominal amount of money. So it seems this is not "in favor of the poor against the rich" so why would the rich people react against it? Well, because their purchasing power will get a massive hit, and poor or rich, I haven't encountered many people that will take that lightly. Under the implied assumption that the economy is at full capacity (an assumption that is needed so that the full effect of the increase in the money supply to be reflected in inflation, otherwise this will not be the case), total output will be the same but the price level will indeed double. Setting the price level before the transfers at $P=1$, we have : FOR each POOR person The real value of money holdings (i.e. in units of goods) was $11.11$ and now it will be $$(11.11 + 20.00) /2 = 15.555 > 11.11$$ an increase of $40$% in real purchasing power. This means that each poor person will be able to consume $40$% actual units of goods more than before. FOR each RICH person The real value of money holdings (i.e. in units of goods) was $100$ and now it will be $$(100 + 20.00) /2 = 60 < 100$$ a decrease of $40$% in purchasing power. This means that each rich person will be able to consume $40$% fewer units of goods than before. Do you imagine the rich will stay quiet faced with such large decline in their living standards? 

In some statistical software (not all), in a correlogram the "zero lag" is also depicted - but the zero lag is just the correlation of a random variable with its own self, so it is by construction equal to unity. This appears to be happening in your first graph where the autocorrelation function is calculated. The second graph is the partial autocorrelation function which calculates the correlation coefficients after the effect of all "previous" lags (i.e. of lower order) has been removed (by linear projection estimation). First impression? The process is white noise. What lags appear to exceed the "statistical significance threshold", they nevertheless indicate very small values, never greater than $0.05$. This is truly economically negligible correlation even if it exists (irrespective of whether it is "statistically significant"), and most likely is due to "finite-sample variation", rather than indication of any actual relation. And apart from that, do the lags appearing "significant" make sense? It always matters what the process you are examining is, and what is its "typical properties" based on past scientific work (but don't take this to mean that "past typical properties" always carry over to all the realizations of the process). In any case, it would be instructive to "follow blindly" the Correlograms and see what you get, by trying various combinations based on the lags that appear statistically significant. 

In the basic "Cobweb Theorem", the assumption is that suppliers must decide now next period production, and that they assume that next period market price will be equal to current period market price. $$p^e_{t} = p_{t-1} \tag{1}$$ Now, we know that if price follows a random walk without drift, then the above a priori assumed expectations formation hypothesis coincides with the Rational Expectations Hypothesis: $$\text {If}\;\;\; p_{t} = p_{t-1} + u_{t} ,\;\;\; u_{t} \sim WN \implies E_{t-1}p_{t} = p_{t-1} \tag{2}$$ But in the cobweb model, the actual price process is determined endogenously, given the a priori assumption $(1)$: we assume $(1)$ and we let the equilibrium of the model give us the model-consistent price process. Assuming linear demand (say, with a white noise preference shock), and supply function we have $$D_t = a-bp_t +u_t,\;\;\; S_t = \gamma + \delta p^e_t$$ Imposing market clearing (an additional assumption no less) we have $$D_t = S_t \implies p_t = \frac {a-\gamma}{b} - \frac {\delta}{b} p^e_t +u_t$$ and applying the a priori expectations formation assumption $(1)$ we obtain $$p_t = \frac {a-\gamma}{b} - \frac {\delta}{b} p_{t-1} + u_t\tag{3}$$ $(3)$ is the model-consistent price process here (i.e. given $(1)$), not $(2)$. Only in the case that $a=\gamma, b=-\delta$ do we get that the price process emerges as a random walk without drift and so that the expectations formations hypothesis used in the model coincides with the Rational Expectations hypothesis. The price that suppliers use is the current market clearing price indeed. But how they use it (hypothesis $(1)$), does not "reflect all available information", which is embodied in $(3)$ which suppliers ignore. 

The above represents that case of truly lexicographic preferences. In the case where, if the consumer cannot afford $\bar q$, then he buys no quantity of the good, things are more complicated. 

We can obtain the result that Indiference Sets are not singletons, i.e. that consumption bundles that are equivalent under the preference relation must exist, by using a Consumption Set $X$ defined over $\mathbb R_+^n$, i.e. over real vectors, together with the property of Continuity of preferences (alternative-weaker prerequisites may exist though). An equivalent way to state the property of Continuity of preferences (see for example Mas-Collel et al, ch 3.C), is that $\forall x \in X$ the upper contour set $UCS$ and the lower contour set $LCS$ are both closed, i.e they include their boundaries. The contour sets are sets that include consumptions bundles "at least as preferred as $x$" (upper) and "at most as preferred as $x$" (lower). In order for them to "include" their boundary", a boundary must exist in the first place. But their boundary is the Indifference Set, the set containing all bundles as preferred as $x$. So your question essentially boils down to Is it possible that the boundary of the upper or lower contour sets of $x$, sets that are defined over real vectors, is a single point? I believe that envisioning this in two-dimensions will show that it is impossible, but let's prove it. Ad absurdum, assume that this holds for some $x \in X$. Then for any other consumption bundle in $X$, say $x'$, we will have either $x'>_{pr} x$ or $x'<_{pr} x$. In other words, any other point in $X$ will belong either in $UCS_x$ or in $LCS_x$, but not in both. So consider two such points , $x''>_{pr}x>_{pr}x'$. Assume that $x'=\{\mathbf y_{(n-1)}, y_n\}$, $x''=\{\mathbf y_{(n-1)}, y_n+\epsilon(k)\}$, i.e. that they differ in only one of the goods in Goods Space, $\epsilon(k)>0$. Transform now these two points into two sequences of points, $\{x''_k\}$ and $\{x'_k\}$, indexed by $k= 1,...$ and by constructing the sequence $\{\epsilon_k\}$ such that $\{\epsilon_k\} >0\; \forall k$ but also $\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \epsilon_k = 0$. The consumption space as defined permits these constructions. We note of course that $\{x'_k\}$ is a constant sequence since its value does not change as $k$ changes, but that's perfectly legal. Consider now the sequence of pairs, for each $k$, $\{(x''_k, x'_k)\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$, and it holds that $$ x''_k >_{pr} x'_k\;\;\;\forall k \tag{1}$$ $$\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} x''_k = x'$$ $$\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} x'_k = x'$$ Under Continuity of preferences we should obtain $$ (1) \implies \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} x'' >_{pr} \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} x'$$ but this is obviously not possible since these limits are identical. So by assuming that there exists an $x$ in the Consumption Set to which no other bundle is equivalent in terms of the preference relation, we have violated the Continuity property. Alternatively, since the bundles are defined over real vectors, and both $UCS$ and $LCS$ are closed due to the Continuity property, then every Cauchy sequence in each of them that converges has its limit in them. So the sequence $\{x''_k\}$ has its limit in $UCS_x$, while the sequence $\{x'_k\}$ must have its limit in $LCS_x$. But this limit is the same as shown above, and equal to $x'$. But the only common point of these two sets is $x$. So it must be the case that $x'=x$. But this cannot hold since we have started by assuming $x>_{pr} x'$. An example where indifference sets are singletons is the case of Lexicographic Preferences. And Lexicographic Preferences are not continuous.
