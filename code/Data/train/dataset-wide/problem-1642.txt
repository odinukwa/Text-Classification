As David Hammen commented, the power emitted through Hawking radiation is proportional to $M^{-2}$. Thus the evaporation timescale for a black hole is proportional to $M^3$. This means that a more massive black hole is much more stable against evaporation than a lower mass black hole. The other issue you mention is the limited rate that you can "feed" a black hole. There is inevitably a feedback; as gas is compressed towards the event horizon it gets hot and emits radiation. The pressure of this radiation can eventually balance the inward gravitational infall. For spherically symmetric accretion this leads to the Eddington limit, which sets the maximum spherical accretion rate, where $\dot{M}_{\rm max}\propto M$. That is, the maximum accretion rate is proportional to the black hole mass. If accretion proceeds at the Eddington limit then the black hole mass grows exponentially with time and with a characteristic doubling timescale of around 50 million years (independent of the original mass - see this Physics SE page for some mathematical details). If black holes were limited to this accretion rate (though there is some evidence from the presence of very luminous quasars at high redshift that they may exceed it), then the maximum black hole mass will depend on the age of the universe and the size of the initial "seed" black holes. If we assume an initial mass of 100 solar masses, a doubling timescale of 50 million years and that the seed black holes formed 400 million years after the big bang (all plausible, but contestable), then there have been 266 doubling timescales since and the black hole could have grown by a factor of $10^{80}$ ! Clearly there are no black holes with anywhere near this mass in the observable universe - the largest appear to be of order $10^{10}$ solar masses. Their growth is limited by their food supply. Supermassive black holes are found at the centres of galaxies. There is a poorly understood relationship between the black hole mass and the mass of the bulge of the galaxy it is in. Typically, the ratio is 1 percent. Since the most massive bulges of spiral galaxies or most massive elliptical galaxies are of order $10^{12}$ solar masses, this appears to set the maximum mass of a black hole in the present day universe. The future is speculation. If the cosmic expansion rate continues to accelerate, then galaxy mergers will become increasingly uncommon and the opportunities for further black hole growth will be limited. 

I think what you need to do is have a CCD imager on a telescope with a large f-ratio, such that each pixel on the detector covers a small angle on the sky - I would say at most 0.25 arcseconds. The field of view also needs to be wide enough that you can get many faint stars in the same CCD image. You must have a telescope able to track the sky. Then what you do is you take pictures on the nights of best seeing, making sure that you do not saturate the neaby star you are interested in, but getting reasonable signal to noise on the many faint stars. Then you need to astrometrically calibrate your images so that you can estimate the apparent position of the star of interest with respect to the (faint, and hence assumed) background stars. If you have seeing of 2 arcseconds, then the best centroiding precision you might reasonably expect to achieve is a precision of around 1/10 of the seeing disc or 0.2 arcseconds. If you have that sort of data repeated a number of times over the course of say 2 years (because you need to fit a solution which includes the annual proper motion as well as the annual parallax), then I reckon you might be able to measure parallaxes for stars out to a few parsecs (maybe ten?) with no problem. The problem with a three inch reflector is that you will need to do very long exposures in order to get lots of faint background stars in your image and then you may have problems with tracking accuracy. 

The answer is: to a neutron star - possibly; to a black hole, no. The process whereby a neutron star is formed is known as an accretion induced collapse and is being seriously debated, especially in the case of white dwarfs that are born at the upper end of the "natural mass range" for white dwarfs and then accrete more mass as part of a binary system. An excellent read are the introductory sections of Taurus et al. (2013), who go through the motivation, process and (limited) observational evidence. See also Schwab et al. (2015); Ruiter et al. (2018). Explosion vs Collapse A white dwarf can respond to the accretion of material by exploding or collapsing. It depends on the competition between energy released in fusion reactions and the energy being locked away by endothermic electron capture (also known as neutronisation) reactions. If thermonuclear reactions are initiated then the likely outcome is a runaway nuclear reaction - the pressure inside the star does not rise rapidly enough to prevent the entire star undergoing fusion. The energy released exceeds the gravitational binding energy and the likely outcome is a type Ia supernova. On the other hand, the white dwarf is supported by electron degeneracy. If neutronisation begins to occur in the core, then protons (in nuclei) capture electrons to form neutrons. This destabilises the star causing it to collapse. The collapse would proceed (quickly) in a similar way to a core collapse supernova. The nuclei would dissociate, neutronisation would run to near-completion and the collapse would be halted by the formation of a neutron star. There is little possibility that a black hole could be formed by such a collapse. The collapsing object would be of order 1.4 solar masses and comfortably smaller than the maximum mass of observed neutron stars (at least 2 solar masses). Therefore the collapse will be halted at the neutron star phase. White dwarfs of moderate mass Most white dwarfs of moderate mass have a C/O composition. They will need to accrete a lot of mass to get to a density (at about $4\times 10^{13}$ kg/m$^3$, reached at $1.38M_{\odot}$ in a non-rotating WD) where neutronisation becomes energetically feasible. Before this happens, it is probable that fusion reactions are ignited (due to high density, rather than temperature). The threshold density for ignition is *lower * for nuclei with lower atomic number (He < C < O) because of lower Coulomb repulsion, and the ignition threshold densities for He and C are also lower than the neutronisation threshold for C. This means that in a C/O WD that has accreted a lot of matter, ignition could take place in C at the core, or it could be triggered in He (at even lower densities) at the base of a deep accreted shell of material. The outcome would likely be runaway thermonuclear fusion and the complete destruction of the star. More massive white dwarfs O/Ne/Mg WDs are made as the final stages of more massive stars ($8-10M_{\odot}$) and are probably born as remnants with much higher mass $>1.2M_{\odot}$ than typical C/O WDs. More massive WDs are smaller, with higher density. The neutronisation thresholds for O, Ne and Mg are only $1.9\times10^{13}$, $6\times 10^{12}$ and $3\times 10^{12}$ kg/m$^3$ respectively (all lower than for C, especially for Ne and Mg). This means that a O/Ne/Mg WD may have to accrete very little mass to reach this central density, begin neutronisation, which leads to collapse. In addition if such densities are insufficient to trigger C burning in a C/O WD, then they certainly won't be high enough to trigger burning in O/Ne/Mg because of stronger coulomb repulsion. Further, if little mass is accreted, then there won't be a deep envelope of accreted material in which to ignite burning off-centre. For all these reasons, O/Ne/Mg WDs may be more likely to collapse than explode (the collapse would cause a type of core-collapse supernova though). Does accretion induced collapse occur? At present there is only indirect evidence. When we look at recently formed neutron stars - identified as fast-spinning pulsars - we see they generally have very high velocities. These velocities are thought to result from an asymmetric "kick" delivered by a type II core-collapse supernova. This in turn suggests it might be quite difficult to retain a neutron star in a binary system, but many neutron stars are observed to be in binary systems, and many of these, particularly the millisecond pulsars, are thought to have undergone significant mass transfer in the past. Further evidence comes from the retention of a significant population of neutron stars inside globular clusters. Again, the kicks might have been expected to expel most of these. In addition, there are a number of examples which appear to be "young", in that the ratio of their spin periods to rate of spin decay indicates they were formed recently. Since there are no high mass stars in globular clusters, and so no possible progenitors for these objects via the core-collapse of massive stars, then accretion induced collapse of a high mass white dwarf is a possibility.
