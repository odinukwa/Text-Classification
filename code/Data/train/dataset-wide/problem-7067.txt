In the standard discrete time economies with a finite number of states, $n$, a complete markets economy is simply an economy with $n$ independent assets (Think Ljunqvist and Sargent Chapter 8). This is because $n$ independent assets is sufficient to span the set of states tomorrow. I had a discussion with a professor last week in which he stated that one of the conveniences of continuous time when thinking about asset pricing is that within a continuous time economy one can get complete markets simply with a risk-free bond and a risky asset (independent) for each Brownian motion in the economy. He explained it as we talked, so I think I mostly understand it, but was wondering if someone would mind writing down the details? I will probably spend a day or two this week on it (depends on some of the properties of the differential calculus), so if no one else answers the question then hopefully I can provide a satisfactory answer. 

Cylical adjustment is simply a trendline based on past GDP. The structural budget balance is the balance with this trend removed. It is similar to seasonal adjustments, except over a longer period. 

You are talking about the inverse of the exploitation rate. Workers under capitalism are paid a wage less than the use-value of what they produce, with the remainder going to surplus value. Surplus value = exploitation rate x use value Wages = (1/exploitation rate) x use value 

$URL$ Very interesting little model. Government infrastructure spending increases wages in the short run by increasing the capital supply, but lowest wages and raises capital income in the long run by boosting the return on private capital. Is this result valid? 

Keynesianism (what you're apparently basing this on) is incoherent and relies on arbitrary eigenvalues such as "autonomous consumption". In real life the multiplier is small and inconsequential. However, the multiplier may appear close to one or slightly above simply because GDP increases the instant the government approves spending in public-subsidised enterprises, due to the way GDP is defined. For example, let's say the government spends $1 to subsidize Fannie Mae and this is counted as a consumption item (for whatever reason). GDP immediately increases by a dollar. Now Fannie Mae spends this on some irrelevant bureaucratic expense (buying mortgage derivatives, legal fees, financial services etc). GDP increases by a dollar again. So we just achieved a multiplier of two while having absolutely no effect on the real world. As you can see, measured GDP is subject to all sorts of random problems that make any attempt to calculate the multiplier pointless. Furthermore, strictly speaking, the "multiplier" is only technically supposed to apply to government consumption, and not transfers as you are asking about. 

In addition to the solutions that FooBar presented in his answer, one of the ways that people are able to get rid of multiple equilibria is incomplete information. I can't find the papers that are most relevant to your example at the moment, but the "canonical" example that I think of is Morris Shin 1998. Essentially what happens is the following: Their model is a model of a "currency attack." There is a state of the world that determines whether a currency attack is worthwhile or not and to successfully attack a currency a certain number of investors (which depends on the state) must participate in the attack. Under complete information multiple equilibria can be supported, but with even a very small amount of noise in their signal about the underlying state of the world the equilibrium becomes unique. One relevant paper could be "Coordinating Business Cycles." I don't remember most of the details in this paper, but it essentially has the same type of result in a more fully developed model.

Buying stock never incurs taxes. Selling stock will incur US taxes if the corporation is registered in the US, but Apple could issue stock to a foreign shell company and have the shell sell stock, then have the shell make an equity investment in Apple, all tax free. Avoiding taxes is trivial and most large companies do not pay significant taxes. 

It would undoubtedly be India, as enormous segments India's tertiary educated class come to the US to work as programmers for 120k. $URL$ 

Probably, but it's not visible because a country is usually already in shambles before a default, and data collection for domestic debt crises is poor. Here is a list of defaults: $URL$ Here's some rate data: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ There have been many cases where countries default on only internal debt. Argentina did this. I can't find bond data anywhere. But when it defaulted on domestic debt (1989), inflation went up and the currency fell. Which is pretty much the same as an increase in external interest rates. 

Short answer It doesn't seem like you've tried very hard to find estimation using Dynare (google results of "Dynare estimation"). Dynare is in fact capable of doing estimation and typically people use some sort of data to estimate the parameters that govern their model. Longer Answer What is a DSGE model? A DSGE model is a series of equations (and variables and parameters) that describe a "model" economy. Once you write everything down and take into consideration the optimizing decisions made by the agents, it is simply a system of stochastic difference (differential) equation that you can imagine writing in some form along the lines of: $$ E_t F(y_{t+1}, y_t, y_{t-1}, u_t) = 0$$ What does Dynare do? The majority of introductory examples only use Dynare to solve the model and run some simple simulations. In addition to being able to solve the model, Dynare is also capable of doing Bayesian estimation of the parameters that make up the model by feeding in data. Solves and simulates the Model Dynare takes this system of equations (and the given parameter values) and solves them using perturbation methods. One of the outputs of the solution is a law of motion for all of the variables in the economy -- i.e. one can write something along the lines of $$y_{t+1} = F(y_t, u_{t+1})$$ This law of motion allows you to generate model analogues of the data that you are interested in -- i.e. capital, labor, consumption etc... Estimates the model Once Dynare has a law of motion and has obtained simulated moments, it can compare the output of the model to data that you have provided. Dynare uses Bayesian estimation (though it is possible it does other types, but I'm not familiar with it) to estimate parameters which means that you need to provide it with a prior for each variable that you would like to estimate. It then uses a simple Metropolis Hastings algorithm to obtain estimates for the distribution over parameter values. References I would recommend you read both of the following references. 

The growth of developing countries has been accompanied by rising resource prices and crimping of growth in the First World. This does not mean that anyone is stealing resources per se. It shows that resources are scarce and constrain growth, and one countries' demand makes it harder for other economies to buy oil. The sort of commodity price behavior that we see during rapid growth in the Third World does provide support for a mercantilist, zero-sum, resource constrained view of growth. This does have elements of colonialist/resource imperialist model where the First World invades oil producers to privatize the resource rents. 

More than 100%. Fractional reserve banking allows banks to create money out of thin air, and they typically leverage twenty times over or more. Despite this they still demand free money from the federal reserve and complain about not being able to hit a button on a computer to lend more money during credit crunches. 

As you stated, transitivity is that overall $x \succeq y$ and $y \succeq z$ implies $x \succeq z$. I will show an example where majority rule isn't transitive and hopefully it will answer your question. Imagine that we live in a world with three people: Person 1, Person 2, and Person 3. Each of these people have preferences over three outcomes $x$, $y$, and $z$. Every decision in this world is made according to majority rules, i.e. The outcome chosen is the one preferred by at least two of the individuals. Now imagine that the three people have preferences according to: 

In a previous version of my answer, I wasn't careful in how I thought about and explained these ideas and I have clarified a few ideas in my head since then which hopefully translates to a clarified answer. Now to answer your question: We have an urn with 60 balls. We are uncertain about the number of black balls and yellow balls in this urn. Imagine we present this urn with the above specified lotteries to an individual (with a monotonic utility function $u$) and ask them to choose between $L_{A'}$ and $L_{B'}$. Without loss of generality, imagine they choose to take $L_{A'}$. This tells us by revealed preference $L_{A'} \succ L_{B'}$ which then implies $$u(30) > u(B)$$ where $B$ is the number of black balls that are believed to be in the urn (no probabilities here, this is some number the decision maker arrived at and at this point we don't know how). This implies $$B < 30$$ Now imagine that you give the agent the choice between $L_{C'}$ and $L_{D'}$ and the agent chooses to face lottery $D'$. Then $$u(60) > u(30 + (60-B))$$ where $(60-B)$ is the number of yellow balls that the agent must think are in the urn. This implies $$60 > 30 + (60-B) \Rightarrow B > 30$$ This means that an agent cannot prefer $L_{A'}$ to $L_{B'}$ and prefer $L_{C'}$ to $L_{D'}$ because that would imply $B > 30$ and $B < 30$. It is difficult to talk about where $B$ comes from because it is a hard concept to think about when we are used to working in expected value terms, this agent cannot compute any type of expectation over the sets of values that he thinks $B$ lies in. As an example of this, let me use a max-min approach. Imagine that when he is presented the urn and lotteries that he is told that the number of black balls is either 15 or 45, but the agent doesn't know with what probability it is 15 and what probability it is 45. 

There was abundant oil supply and the developed countries were splurging on FDI and debt in the periphery Greece had just joined the Euro and was getting tons of transfer payments The Euro was still fairly high and hadn't fallen yet. Greece may have fudged its numbers a bit to get into the Euro. 

Iran is dumping oil onto the market at about a dollar a barrel. This is boosting the global economy. It is only a temporary phenomenon and the total oil production will begin to fall any time now. Oil is the sole determinant of long run global growth, and real energy prices always rise before recessions. 

Your shell performs all your business transactions and records the profit. Thus all your profit seems to take place in the Cayman Islands and not the US, reducing taxes. There are other ways to use shells. For example, other people can pay you by making an equity investment in your company, which is untaxed. Look up Corp to corp/S corp tax evasion. In general, a shell company is a company with no assets besides that required for some very narrow purpose such as evading taxes. A somewhat circular definiton, but that's what people call it. 

thus he chooses lottery $A'$. Now consider $L_{C'}$ and $L_{D'}$. He thinks these lotteries will pay 

This is similar to what has already been said and it depends on what you classify as an asset. Money, although intrinsically worthless, maintains some worth which allows you to purchase in the future. There are three papers that I found really interesting on the subject (and I don't remember them being overly technical). They are three Kiyotaki Wright papers (1989, 1991, 1993). These papers basically set up a very simple economy (the one I'm thinking of has n goods and n agents). They then show what trade would look like in these economies without money and then what it would look like with the money. And one of the papers gets people basically establishing money (by saving a certain type of good which everyone accepts in trade). The others show that if you insert money into the economy then you are better off. Also, worth looking into if this is interesting to you is Neil Wallace's idea of "essentiality of money." 

A true labor shortage is when no labor is available for a task at any price. Surely this occurs all of the time if you consider markets that don't exist or could never exist, but has this ever happened otherwise? Has there ever been a situation where a particular type of labor existed, and then dissapeared, leading to a situation where none of the labor in that sector was available at any price? 

The lack of discounting will make tax discounting more valuable. Assuming that the market accepts this valuation it will mean increased effort toward tax deferral and possibly increased investment rates. Corporations will hold appreciating assets for longer periods to defer taxes, and will forgo some short term gains in favor of increasing the expected future tax defferal items on the balance sheet. In practice agents are supposed to be aware of accounting changes though and derive their own valuation independently of arbitrary rules set by some accounting standard. 

Consider a standard exchange economy (agents are endowed with some set of goods that they will use to trade with others). Piccione and Rubenstein wrote a somewhat interesting paper about "jungle equilibria" of an exchange economy. In their paper, allocations are decided by allowing more powerful animals are able to take goods from weaker animals (I don't think their preferences were necessarily monotonic -- i.e. I think there was satiation). They not only show that an equilibrium of this form exists, but that it is Pareto efficient (you can't make anyone better off without making someone else worse off). Obviously this paper isn't exactly a model of the jungle, but the point is that there could be an equilibrium in the wild which follows a framework similar to this (and I think it is a cool paper and your question reminded me of it). 

Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it), we don't know what $x$ and $y$ look like in this equation. Instead we are given $(x' x)$, $(x' y)$, and $(y' y)$. Using your comment about what RSS actually is -- Namely, that $$\text{RSS} = (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})' (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})$$ First notice that $y_{\text{estimated}}$ is simply $x \beta$. Then replacing this in the previous formula gives us \begin{align*} \text{RSS} &= (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}})' (y_{\text{observed}} - y_{\text{estimated}}) \\ &= (y_{\text{observed}} - x \beta)' (y_{\text{observed}} - x \beta) \\ &= y'y - 2y'x\beta + x \beta \beta' x' \end{align*} Now this is almost what we want. We want things to ultimately be in terms of $(y'y)$, $(x'x)$, $(x' y)$, and $\beta$. The first term is exactly $y'y$, but other terms look like they have pieces we want and we just have to find a way to get them. Now, notice that each of the elements in our equation above is simply a scalar (aka sizes are such that they are $1 \times 1$). The determinant of a scalar is itself, then by using properties of determinants we can say: \begin{align*} 2y'x \beta &= \det(2y'x\beta) = \det(2 \beta' x' y) \\ x \beta \beta' x' &= \det(x \beta \beta' x') = \det(\beta' x' x \beta) \end{align*} I will leave the linear algebra itself as an exercise.
