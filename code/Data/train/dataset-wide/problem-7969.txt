I have come across the following result regarding equitable division of a resource, which is a simple and immediate consequence of linear programming complementarity (in the infinite-dimensional case). I strongly suspect that it is a special case of some other well-known principle, perhaps in a related field such as economics or even geography, but as of yet I have not found any helpful leads. Can anyone suggest any results from which the statement below is a consequence? Any other leads will also be appreciated. Let $R$ denote a contiguous resource (such as a piece of land) that is to be divided into $n$ pieces $R_1,\dots,R_n$ among $n$ agents (so agent $i$ gets piece $R_i$). Suppose that each agent has a continuous "utility density" function $u_i(x)>0$ defined on $R$ and that $R$ also has a continuous "population density" $f(x)>0$ defined on it. The total "utility" that agent $i$ receives is then $\iint_{R_i} f(x)u_i(x) dx$. One might consider the problem of choosing $R_1,\dots,R_n$ as "equitably" as possible, say by maximizing the minimum utility of the agents: $\text{maximize}_{R_1,\dots,R_n}\lbrace\min_i \iint_{R_i} f(x)u_i(x) dx\rbrace$ subject to $\bigcup_i R_i = R$ and $R_i \cap R_j = \emptyset \text{ for all }i\neq j$ It is easy to verify that, at the optimal solution $R_1^*,\dots,R_n^*$, all of the agents' utilities are equal. Now, define $q_i^* := \iint_{R_i^*} f(x) dx$ (the population of the $i$th optimal piece), and consider the problem of choosing regions to maximize the total utilities of the agents, but under a logarithmic utility function, and imposing constraints on the populations in each piece: $\text{maximize}_{R_1,\dots,R_n}\lbrace\sum_i \iint_{R_i} f(x)\log(u_i(x)) dx\rbrace$ subject to $\iint_{R_i} f(x) dx = q_i^*$ $\bigcup_i R_i = R$ and $R_i \cap R_j = \emptyset \text{ for all }i\neq j$ It is not hard to show that the solution to this problem is the same as the solution to the original problem. I have uploaded a MATLAB script that demonstrates this principle using cvx at $URL$ if anyone is interested. 

I believe the full details, along the lines of what domotorp posted, are provided in "Reconstructing sets of orthogonal line segments in the plane" by Rendl and Woeginger. From the abstract, "We show that reconstructing a set of $n$ orthogonal line segments in the plane from the set of their vertices can be done in $O(n log n)$ time, if the segments are allowed to cross. If the segments are not allowed to cross, the problem becomes NP-complete." The authors give a reduction to planar 3-SAT that uses points on an integer lattice, which I believe is the setting you're interested in. 

Here is an algebraic version of Margaret's answer that gives an explicit bound on the dimension of the space of section. This reasoning can be also adapted to the case of complex (non-algebraic) manifolds, but without an explicit bound. Claim. Suppose $X^k\subset \mathbb CP^n$ is a $k$-dimensional projective variety. Let $D$ be the zero divisor of a section of a line bundle $L$ on $X^k$. Then the dimension of the space of sections of $L$ is at most the binomial coefficient: $$\binom{k+ deg(D)\cdot deg(X)}{deg(D)\cdot deg(X)}$$ The proof of this statement uses just Bezout theorem. Indeed from Bezout it follows that at a fixed (say smooth) point $x\in X^k$ a section of $L$ can vanish at most to order $deg(D)\cdot deg(X)$ (to see this cut $X^k$ through $x$ by a generic plane $\mathbb CP^{n-k+1}$ and intersect the obtained curve with $D$). Now, the binomial coefficient is the dimension of the space of all $deg(D)\cdot deg(X)$-jets at $x$. 

If you take an odd dimensional complex manifold $X$ with holomorphic structure $J$ then $-J$ defines on $X$ a holomorphic structure as well. And, of course, $J$ and $-J$ induce on $X$ opposite orientations. In general it is not true that these two complex manifolds are biholomprphic. Indeed, if $X$ is a complex curve, then $(X,J)$ is biholomorphic to $(X,-J)$ only if $X$ admits and anti-holomorphic involution (this will be the case for example if $X$ is given by an equation with real coefficients). Starting from this example on can construct a (singular) affine variety $Y$ of dimension $3$, such that $(Y,J)$ is not byholomorphic to $(Y,-J)$. Namely, let $C$ be a compact complex curve that does not admit an anti-holomorphic involution say of genus $g=2$. Consider the rank two bundle over it, equal to the sum $TC\oplus TC$ ($TC$ is the tangent bundle to $C$). Contract the zero section of the total space of this bundle, this gives you desired singular $Y$. 

The answer to this question is contained in the article of Mark Gross, page 33 Deforming Calabi-Yau Threefolds $URL$ The first cone can not be smoothed the second one can be smoothed (in the terminology of Gross, which is standard, $dP_1$ is a del-Pezzo of degree 8, $dP_2$ is the del Pezzo of degree 7). 

Linear programs with this many variables are solved all the time using column generation: $URL$ In your problem, let variable $q_k$ denote the probability of using permutation $\pi_k$, and let variable $p_{ij}$ denote the marginal probability that agent $i$ is assigned to $j$, so you have a total of $n! + n^2$ variables. Let $\pi_k(i,j) = 1$ if agent $i$ is assigned to position $j$ in permutation $k$ and zero otherwise. We can relate the $p_{ij}$'s and $q_k$'s via $n^2$ constraints of the form $\sum_k q_k \pi_k(i,j) = p_{ij} \forall i,j$ Now, assume as Kevin did that $\sum_i v_i = \sum_j b_j = 1$. Your equity criterion is just $\sum_j p_{ij} v_j = b_i \forall i$. We obviously must require that $q_k \geq 0$ for all $k$. Thus the feasible set of these permutations can be written as: $\sum_k q_k = 1$ $p_{ij} = \sum_k q_k \pi_k (i,j) \forall i,j$ $q_k \geq 0 \forall k$ $\sum_j p_{ij} v_j = b_i \forall i$ There are a total of $1 + n^2 + n$ equality constraints and $n!$ inequality constraints, and you have $n! + n^2$ variables. Any basic feasible solution of this set (i.e. a corner point) therefore must have $n! - (n+1)$ of the inequality constraints active, which means that the corner points have only $n+1$ nonzero $q_k$'s. Thus, if your problem is feasible at all for particular choices of $v$ and $b$, it's possible to find such a set of assignments using at most $n+1$ possible permutations. You may gain further insight by looking at the dual of this LP -- the primal problem above has $n^2 + n!$ variables, $1 + n^2 + n$ equality constraints, and $n!$ inequality constraints, so its dual will have $n^2 + n!$ constraints, but only $1 + n^2 + n$ variables. Those constraints should have a nice structure to them (something like, one constraint for each permutation, and that constraint sums over all nonzero $\pi_k(i,j)$'s or something), which would give you a polynomial-time separation oracle for solving the dual LP. There may likely be a way to recover a primal solution from the dual using complementary slackness. 

Suppose I have a collection of points $p_1,\dots,p_N$ in the plane. In the Euclidean $k$-medians (or $k$-means) problems, our objective is to distribute a set of $k$ points $x_1,\dots,x_k$ in the plane so as to minimize the distances (or squares of distances) to the points $p_i$, i.e. to minimize the quantity $\sum_{i=1}^{N} \min_j \| x_j - p_i \|$ (I am not requiring that the $x_j$'s be a subset of the $p_i$'s; they can lie anywhere in the plane). Obviously this problem has many practical applications. My question is: let's suppose we impose some constraints on the first or second moments of $x_1,\dots,x_k$, i.e. require that $\frac{1}{k}\sum_j x_j = x_0$ for some fixed point $x_0$, or that $\frac{1}{k} \sum_j \|x_j - \bar{x}\|^2 \leq S^2$ for some given threshold $S^2$. Is there any conceivable practical scenario where this might arise? I am not asking for assistance in solving this problem -- I'm really just interested in any thoughts on contexts where it might occur.
