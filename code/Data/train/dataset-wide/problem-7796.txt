Definition 1. An uncountable cardinal $\kappa$ is Shelah if for every function $f:\kappa\rightarrow \kappa$ there exists a transitive class $M$ and a non-trivial elementary embedding $j:V\rightarrow M$ such that $^\kappa M\subseteq M$, $crit(j)=\kappa$ and $V_{j(f)(\kappa)}\subseteq M$. Definition 2. Woodin's fast function forcing on $\kappa$ consists of partial functions $p$ from $\kappa$ to $\kappa$ ordered by inclusion such that: 

Remark. Following Joel's comment below, it is worth mentioning that the above definition is NOT the only variant of fast function forcing. There are other versions with slightly different properties. For a more complete argument along these lines see Joel's answer in this MO post. On one hand, preserving Shelah cardinals through lifting arguments often needs dominating the corresponding functions $f:\kappa\rightarrow \kappa$ by functions in the ground model. On the other hand, we know that the fast function forcing $\mathbb{P}_{\kappa}$ adds a very fast (and so non-dominatable) function of this type into the universe (i.e. the fast function) and simultaneously fails to satisfy $\kappa$-cc property which is a usual condition for providing dominating functions in the ground model. 

This is almost covered by Proposition 4.12 of Farb and Margalit's book "The primer on mapping class groups". Another useful reference is the paper "Presentations for the punctured mapping class groups in terms of Artin groups" by Labruere and Paris. See the second displayed formula in Proposition 2.12 of that paper. Here is an outline of the solution. Let $S$ be a surface of genus $g$ with one boundary component. Let $a_i$ be a "chain" of $2g$ curves in $S$. That is, $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$ meet in exactly one point and otherwise the $a_i$ are disjoint from each other. This is not done cyclically - that is, $a_1$ and $a_{2g}$ are disjoint. Note that the boundary of a regular neighborhood of the union of the $a_i$ is isotopic to $\partial S$. Let's also use the symbol $a_i$ to denote a Dehn twist about the curve $a_i$. Consider the following product of Dehn twists: $$H = ( a_1 a_2 \ldots a_{2g - 1} a_{2g} )^{2g + 1}$$ Claim: $H$ is the desired mapping class. Proof: $H$ fixes the curve $a_i$ (up to isotopy) but reverses the orientation of $a_i$. Since the chain $\cup a_i$ fills the surface, we are done. QED Proposition 4.12 of the primer and Proposition 2.12 of [LP] says that $H^2$ is isotopic to a full Dehn twist about $\partial S$. Since you allow isotopies that move boundary points, for you $H^2$ is isotopic to the identity. All of these claims can be proved by drawing a few pictures, applying induction, and using the "Alexander method". Another approach (that is less general) is to consider $S$ as a double branched cover of the $2g + 1$ times marked disk, and then to think about the generator of the center of the braid group. One final remark - there are many ways to choose the chain of curves $a_i$ and this might seem like a problem... however, any two ways of choosing the chain differ by a mapping class: thus the apparent choice is no choice at all. I believe that Farb and Margalit call this the "change of coordinates principle". 

See final remark of "SOME REMARKS ABOUT THE WEAK CONTAINMENT PROPERTY FOR GROUPOIDS AND SEMIGROUPS" by Claire Anantharaman-Delaroche for an affirmative answer of the question. $URL$ 

Let $K=\mathbb{F}_2((t))$ be the field of formal Laurent series over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_2$. Now consider $K^3$ as an additive group and its dual group $\hat{K^3}$, which consists of all continuous group homomorphism $\chi$ from $K^3$ into the circle Group $\mathbb{T}$, i.e., $\chi$ is a unitary character of $K^3$. It is well-known that for a fixed unitary character $\chi$ of $K$, distinct from the unit character. The mapping $\Phi: K^3\rightarrow \hat{K^3}$, $y\mapsto \chi_y$ is a topological group isomorphism, where $\chi_y$ is the character of $K^3$ defined by $\chi_y(x)=\chi(\sum_{i=1}^3 x_iy_i)$. Define an action of $SL(2,K)$ on $K^3$ by $g.x=(ax_1+bx_2,cx_1+dx_2,x_3+x_1x_2+(ax_1+bx_2)(cx_1+dx_2))$, where $g=\begin{pmatrix} a&b\\ c&d\\ \end{pmatrix}$$ \in SL(2,K)$ and $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in K^3$. Since characteristic of $K$ is 2, we know that 1=-1. Moreover, $1=det(g)=ad-bc=ad+bc$. It follows that $g.x=(ax_1+bx_2,cx_1+dx_2,x_3+acx_1^2+bdx_2^2)$. Since $(x+y)^2=x^2+y^2$ for all $x,y\in K$, it is easy to see this action is well-defined. In some sense, you can regard the semidirect product $K^3\rtimes SL(2,K)$ with this action as the Jacobi group in characteristic 2. Now we consider the dual action $\alpha: SL(2,K)\curvearrowright \hat{K^3}$ by $(g.\chi)(x)=\chi(g^{-1}x)$. My question is that what is the corresponding action of $SL(2,K)$ on $K^3$ via the isomorphism $\Phi$? More precisely, find the unique element $y'$ (depending on $g$ and $y$) in $K^3$ such that $\chi_{y'}=\alpha(g)\chi_y$. The isomorphism $\Phi:K^3\rightarrow \hat{K^3}$ is not canonical and we have to fix $\chi$. My favorite choice is that $\chi:\mathbb{F_2}((t))\rightarrow \mathbb{T}$, $\chi(\sum a_nt^n)=\exp(\frac{2\pi i a_{-1}}{2})$. My motivation is to compute all the orbits of the dual action $\alpha: SL(2,K)\curvearrowright \hat{K^3}$. 

I believe that $K$ is an infinitely generated free group. First we find an infinite presentation $K = \langle X \mid R \rangle$, and then we argue that we can pick an infinite subset of $X$ that freely generates. Presentation: Note that we can obtain the Borromean rings from the handlebody of genus two by drilling out the commutator curve and attaching a two-handle to the boundary along the usual separating curve. Since the attaching curve for the two-handle is trivial in the handlebody, we can take the universal cover of the handlebody and then attach infinitely many two-handles, and drill infinitely many lines. After drawing a few pictures, we can organize all of this information as follows. Let $D^2$ be the Poincare disk model for the hyperbolic plane. Pick hyperbolic isometries $a$ and $b$ that have perpendicular axes and equal (very long) translation lengths. Thus $F_2 = \langle a,b \rangle$ is a free group of rank two. Let $T$ be the regular four-valent tree isometrically embedded in $H^2$, arising as the Cayley graph of $F_2$. Let $v_0$ be the vertex of $T$ corresponding to the identity of $F_2$. The universal cover of the handlebody above is obtained as a three-dimensional neighborhood of $T$, and $F_2$ is the deck group. We define $X = \{ x_q \}$ where $q$ ranges over the connected components of $H^2 - T$. (These correspond to the drilled lines.) This gives the generating set for $K$ subject to the relations $R = \{ x_p X_q x_r X_s \}$ where the regions $p,q,r,s$ are arranged counter-clockwise about a vertex of $T$. (These correspond to the attached two-handles. Because we started with the commutator curve, the two-handles are attached to the neighborhood of $T$ via a "baseball curve" around each vertex.) Here we use the convention that $X_q = (x_q)^{-1}$. (Also, $p$ is always to the "north-east" of $v$ - we use translates of the picture about $v_0$ to set conventions.) For future use, let $w_v$ be the relation coming from vertex $v$. Subset that freely generates: We recursively color the regions of $H^2 - T$ as follows. (1) All regions start white. (2) In the first step, we pick two regions $p, q$ adjacent to $v_0$. Color both of $p$ and $q$ black. (3) In general, pick a vertex $v$ having exactly two white regions $p, q$ adjacent to $v$. Note that $p$ and $q$ must be adjacent to each other. Color $p$ black and color $q$ grey. The set of black regions gives a subset $X' \subset X$ of the generators. It is an exercise to prove inductively that $X'$ generates. Next, for a contradiction, suppose that $w$ is a word in the $X'$ that is trivial in $K$. Thus we can write $w$ as a product of conjugates of relations from $R$. Recall that relations are in bijection with the vertices of $T$. Pick one relation $w_v$ appearing in the product so that $v$ is as far as possible from $v_0$. Of the four regions adjacent to $v$, there are two regions $p, q$ that are combinatorially further than the others from $v_0$. Say $p$ and black and $q$ is grey. Then $x_q$ is not freely cancelled in the product of conjugates, a contradiction. QED 

Update. A MathOverflow fellow just emailed me expressing his interest in conducting some statistical research on MathSciNet and MathOverflow databases. He asked whether I know how to get access to the corresponding background data, which I actually don't. I am not even sure if it is publicly accessible or free (particularly in the case of MathSciNet and Arxiv). I also suspect that there must be some non-disclosure rules and restrictions which any corresponding research along these lines should follow. It would be nice if somebody who knows how to get access to the raw material needed for any research concerning these databases, sheds some light on these issues. 

Note that the failure of any such theorem (in the absence of choice) may result in the existence of very bizarre topological creatures of certain pathological behavior which could be of some interest as counterexamples. (As an analogy, see Alexander's horned sphere as a counterexample for the validity of Jordan–Schönflies theorem in three dimensions). In order to narrow down the question 1, one may consider the case of the Carathéodory's conformal mapping theorem (which implies Schoenflies theorem) or Alexander duality: 

Let $Q\in GL_n(\mathbb{C})$. The free unitary quantum group is the universal $C^*$-algebra $A_u(Q)$ with generators $u_{ij},1\leq i,j\leq n$ and relations making $u=(u_{ij})$ as well as $Q\bar{u}Q^{-1}$ unitary, where $\bar{u}=(u_{ij}^*)$. The comultiplication is defined by \begin{align} \Phi(u_{ij})=\sum_k u_{ik}\otimes u_{kj}. \end{align} $(A_u(Q),\Phi)$ is a compact quantum group. Let $Q\in GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ such that $Q\bar{Q}=\pm 1$. The free orthogonal quantum group is the universal $C^*$-algebra $A_o(Q)$ with generators $u_{ij},1\leq i,j\leq n$ such that $u=Q\bar{u}Q^{-1}$ is unitary. As above $(A_o(Q),\Phi)$ is a compact quantum group. It is well-known that every compact quantum group admits a unique Haar state. My question is that 

Let $K$ be a local field of characteristic $p$, where $p$ is a prime number greater than 2. In particular, $(x+y)^p=x^p+y^p$ for $x,y\in K$. The fake Heisenberg group is defined to be $$ G=\{\begin{pmatrix} 1&a&b\\ 0&1&a^p\\ 0&0&1\\ \end{pmatrix}: a,b\in K\}$$ It is a non-abelian, $K$-split connected algebraic group, which is also unipotent with nilpotent length two. Consider its Lie ring $$ \mathfrak{g}=\text{Log}(G)=\{\begin{pmatrix} 0&x&y\\ 0&0&x^p\\ 0&0&0\\ \end{pmatrix}: x,y\in K\}$$ Since $K$ is not perfect, $\mathfrak{g}$ is not stable under scalar multiplication. In particular, $\mathfrak{g}$ is not a vector Space and is different from Lie(G), the Lie algebra associated to G. Q.1: Do we know the unitary dual $\hat{G}$ of $G$? Notice that $G$ is a central non-split extension of the additive group $K$: $$0\rightarrow K\rightarrow G \rightarrow K \rightarrow 0.$$ I can image to apply the Machey Machine to this group extension similar to the real Heisenberg groups. Q.2: Is $G$ CCR? or type I? Q.3: Let $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$ be the Pontrjagin dual of the additive group $\mathfrak{g}$ and let $G$ act on $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$ by the coadjoint action. Are all orbits closed or locally closed in $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$? Recall that the adjoint action of $G$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by $Ad(g)(X)=gXg^{-1}$ for $g\in G$ and $X\in \mathfrak{g}$ and the coadjoint action of $G$ on $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$ is defined by $Ad^*(g)(f)=f\circ Ad(g^{-1})$ for $f\in \hat{\mathfrak{g}}$. Dear all, my motivation is about the Kirillov orbit method for unipotent Groups over a local field of positive characteristic (see Corollary 7.3 and Exapmple 8.3 in A general Kirillov Theory for locally compact nilpotent groups). It describes the unitary dual of $G$ by its coadjoint orbits. In order to do this, we need to know Q.3 has an affirmative answer according to Corollary 7.3 and Exapmple 8.3 in op. cit. So if the associated Lie ring $\mathfrak{g}$ is a vector space (this is always the case if char(K)=0), then we can identify its Pontrygagin dual with its linear dual, on which the unipotent group $G$ acts algebraiclly by the coadjoint action. Since unipotent Groups act algebraiclly on an affine variety, all its orbits are closed. Then the orbit method (Corollary 7.3 in op. cit.) implies that the group $G$ is CCR and the Kirillov-orbit map is a homeomorphism. Hence, we have affirmative answers for all my questions. For unipotent Groups over a local field $K$ with char(K)=p. I find the above obstruction. However, if we start with a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ (in particular, a vector space) with nilpotent length less that $p$ and consider the group $G=\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ obtained by exponentiating it, then we have affirmative answers for all my questions by exactly same argyments. Remark that $\exp: \mathfrak{g}\rightarrow G, \exp(X)=\sum_{l=0}^{3}\frac{X^l}{l!}$ with the inverse $\text{Log}: G\rightarrow \mathfrak{g}: \text{Log}(g)=\sum_{l=1}^{3} \frac{(-1)^l}{l+1}(1-g)^l$. 

It is easy to see that for an infinite cardinal $\kappa$, the existence of a Jónsson algebra of size $\kappa$ is equivalent to the existence of a Jónsson model of size $\kappa$. By the way, there is a combinatorial large cardinal of the same name: 

As some colleagues asked about the validity of the main result in the following paper in the absence of $\kappa$-cc property for fast function forcing, (with the permission of both authors) I would like to post an answer provided by Arthur in order to clarify the situation: A. Apter, J. Cummings, Blowing up the power set of the least measurable, Journal of Symbolic Logic 67 (2002), no. 3, 915--923. 

Of course, the existence of such a nice natural number $n$ should be checked. However, it sounds reasonable to expect that for a sufficiently large $n$ (which there are so many open knight tours with various beginning and ending points) there are some tours which can serve as the building blocks of the knight's king-like spiral. (Actually only a few straight and right-oriented $n\times n$ tours with appropriate beginning and ending points are needed. The other blocks will be redundant up to isomorphism). Here, the first question arises: 

As a partial answer to question one: The diameter of $M(S)$ with respect to the Weil--Petersson metric is finite. So $D_{WP}$ is finite. 

A pair of circles can be unlinked in any dimension above three. Thickening the rings doesn't change this. However, it is possible to have linked $n$-spheres inside of $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$. 

Notice that Hatcher proves that three-manifolds with a single torus boundary have only finitely many embedded boundary slopes. So I assume that your question one is asking about "immersed boundary slopes": the slopes occurring as boundaries of essential immersed surfaces. You ask if knot complements have only finitely many such. The answer is "no" for two-bridge knots. See the paper "Virtually embedded boundary slopes" by Joseph Maher ($URL$ (NB - Maher uses boundary slope as a synonym for "slope".) Regarding question two: I don't have a reference or proof at hand, but I'll boldly guess that all once-cusped hyperbolic three-manifolds have infinitely many immersed boundary slopes. Regarding question three: Again, I think your order of quantifiers is strange here. It doesn't matter how "far" the immersed boundary slope is from the filling slope, if the filling slope is, say, the meridian slope for the knot complement. 

Remark 2. Potentially, one may find some questions, related to the possible number/behavior of wild knots of the certain knot invariant (such as bridge, unknotting, stick numbers, etc.) in a forcing extension, interesting. However, for the sake of this question, I preferred to stick to a very specific one concerning crossing number. Please feel free to share your thoughts about other possibly interesting problems along these lines in the comments below. 

Assuming an affirmative answer to the above question, the next step is to speculate on the general structure of all possible knight tours on the infinite plane: 

In order to answer the above question one may need to figure out the distribution of hyperprime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ which in the case of usual prime numbers is given by Prime Number Theorem that provides the $\frac{k}{ln(k)}$ estimation for the number of $2$-hyperprime numbers in the interval $[1, k]$. 

I have a few questions about amenability at infinity for locally compact, second countable, Hausdorff topological groups. Recall that a locally compact group $G$ is said to be amenable at infinity if there exists a topologically amenable action (in the sense of $URL$ of $G$ on some compact Hausdorff space $X$. Permanence property: Q 1. What kinds of permanence properties do we know about amenability at infinity for locally compact, second countable non-discrete groups? e.g. If $\Gamma$ is a Lattice in $G$, which is amenable at infinity, does it imply that $G$ itself is amenable at infinity? Examples: Q 2. Which locally compact non-discrete groups are known to be amenable at infinity? e.g. Are Haagerup groups amenable at infinity? Q 3. Let $G$ be a locally compact, second countable Hausdorff topological group, which acts amenably on a compact Hausdorff space $X$. Does the transformation groupoid $X\rtimes G$ admit a continuous proper negative type function $\psi$? negative type means 1) $\psi(x,e)=0$ for all $x\in X$; 2) $\psi(x,g)=\psi(g^{-1}x,g^{-1})$ for all $(x,g)\in X\times G$; 3) $\sum_{i,j=1}^nt_it_j \psi(g_i^{-1}x,g_i^{-1}g_j)\leq 0$ for all $t_1,\ldots,t_n$ in $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $\sum_{i=1}^n t_i=0$, $g_i\in G$ and $x\in X$. 

The Schoenflies theorem, as a variant of the well-known Jordan curve theorem, states that the interior and the exterior planar regions determined by a simple closed curve (aka Jordan curve) in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (through Jordan curve theorem) are homeomorphic to the interior and exterior of the unit disk respectively. Equivalently, any Jordan curve $\phi : S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$, can be extended to a homeomorphism $\psi : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ of the plane. A closer look at the proof of this theorem suggests that it might be a little bit choicy. This is indeed the case, according to the following result of Sakamoto and Yokoyama: 

Finally, one may ask about the analogy of Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in the case of hyperprimes. Although, we are not dealing with a commutative hyperoperator for $n\geq 3$ but it is still meaningful and interesting to wonder whether every natural number has a unique representation in terms of $n$-hyper combination of $n$-hyperprime numbers or not? For instance, $8^{9^{10}}$ is a natural number. While $8=2^3$ and $9=3^2$ aren't $3$-hyperprime but this number has a representation $2^{3^{21}}$ via $3$-hyperprime numbers $2, 3, 21$. Does such a representation exist for every other number? Is it unique?
