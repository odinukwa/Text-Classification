This is mainly a special case of the main result of [1] R. Brown and P.R. Heath, "Coglueing Homotopy Equivalences", Math. Z. 113, 313-325 (1970), which in brief terms says that under suitable fibration conditions a pullback of homotopy equivalences is a homotopy equivalence. This is now seen as result in abstract homotopy theory,but an advantages of the methods of this paper is that there is control of the homotopies involved (see Theorem 3.4). Actually since you assume only $p_2\circ \phi \sim \psi \circ p_1$ there is needed a further step, that a pullback $f^*(E)$ of a fibration $p:E \to B$ depends, up to homotopy equivalence, only on the homotopy class of $f$. This theme is pursued in further papers of Heath under the title of "Groupoid operations and fibre-homotopy equivalence". 

There is a polyhedral model of the Projective Plane due to Brehm, Ulrich: How to Build Minimal Polyhedral Models of the Boy Surface, The Mathematical Intelligencer Vol. 12, 51-55 (1990). See a partial account of this here, and also other articles on the Brehm model available on the web. John Robinson transformed Brehm's polyhedral model of the Mobius Band into a sculpture he called Journey. 

What is more interesting is to look at the fundamental groupoid $\pi_1 G$ of a topological group, particularly in the non-connected case. This groupoid inherits a group structure, and so becomes what is called a group-groupoid, or a $2$-group, i.e. a group internal to the category of groupoids. Such objects are equivalent to crossed modules, which are objects which model connected, pointed weak homotopy 2-types. Here are a couple of relevant papers: R. Brown and C.B. Spencer, $\cal G$-groupoids, crossed modules and the fundamental groupoid of a topological group'', Proc. Kon. Ned. Akad. v. Wet. 7 (1976) 296-302. R. Brown and O. Mucuk, ``Covering groups of non-connected topological groups revisited'', Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc, 115 (1994) 97-110. and just now a search on Baez 2-groups gave 82,700 hits, e.g. Higher-Dimensional Algebra V: 2-Groups. John C. Baez. The second paper revisits the work of R.L. Taylor which showed that there is in general an obstruction to a non-connected topological group having a universal covering topological group. Later: The following may be seen as still not answering the original question, but I hope will be interesting to some readers! I was trying to convey that the fundamental groupoid $\Phi=\pi_1 G$ of a topological group $G$ contains useful information, so I hope it will be useful to set that out in some, but not full, detail. As said above, $\Phi$ is in fact a group-groupoid, and so has an associated crossed module, from which may be recovered the group-groupoid. This crossed module, say $\delta: C \to G$, is part, see below, of an exact sequence $$ 0 \to \pi_1(G,e) \to C \to G \to \pi_0 G \to 1$$ which is known as a crossed sequence. This crossed sequence determines a cohomology class $ k \in H^3(\pi_0 G, \pi_1 (G,e)) $, as shown by Mac Lane, which may also be identified with the first Postnikov invariant of the classifying space $BG$. This invariant is trivial if and only if $G$ admits a universal covering group (assuming $G$ is suitably nice locally), by which is meant a topological group $U$ with a covering map $p: U \to G$ which is also a homomorphism of topological groups, and such that $p$ restricts to a universal covering map for each component of $G$. Now to give more on the crossed module $\delta: S \to G$. According to one convention, $C$ is the costar (or star in another convention) of $\pi_1 G$ at $e$, i.e. the elements of $\pi_1 G$ which end at $e$. The map $\delta$ then is just the source map. The group structure on $C$ is induced by the multiplication in $G$: i.e. on path classes $[a][b]=[c]$ where $c(t)=a(t)b(t)$. The operation of $G$ on $C$ is by conjugation: $[a]^g= [g^{-1}ag]$. The crossed module rules are of the form: CM1) $\delta(\alpha ^g)= g^{-1}(\delta \alpha)g $; CM2) $\alpha^{-1} \beta \alpha = \beta ^{\delta \alpha}$, for all $\alpha, \beta \in C, g \in G$. Notice that in the crossed sequence displayed, the fundamental group is the kernel of $\delta$, and is an abelian group and in fact a module over $\pi_0 G$. But this abelian group, and even the module, is, in the non-connected case, and in general, but a pale shadow of the $2$-type of the classifying space. What I have been trying to convey is the idea that throwing away a larger structure, in this case restricting from a groupoid to a group, may throw away needed information. Thus in homotopy theory there is a concentration on homotopy groups, e.g. second homotopy groups. But it has been shown that in some cases the best way to determine this group may be, indeed may only be, by calculating the whole $2$-type, as determined by a crossed module. This seems to me an interesting inversion of a traditional approach. Maybe this site is not the place for such remarks? 

I like the idea of using the term "neighbourhood" and the notation $f(M)$ for a function $f$ and set $M$. So we have the definition: for all neighbourhoods $N$ of $f(x)$there is a neighbourhood $M$ of $x$ such that $f(M) \subseteq N$. Then you can draw pictures of the actual sets that are being mapped. Part of the psychological problem with an $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ proof is that these are measures of the size of the neighbourhood rather than the actual neigbourhood. For particular proofs you need the numbers. This also relates to the idea that the neighbourhood definition of a topology is the most intuitive, even if you need of course to bring in the equivalent definitions in terms of open or closed sets. Motivated by the idea of "reverse chaining" in the psychology of learning, we used the idea of "fill-in proofs". Take a proof that the product of limits is a limit, rub out bits, and ask the students to fill in the missing bits using clues that you have left from the rest of the proof. So the structure of the proof is given. This is analogous to the way a professional works, get the structure first, then fill in the details. Also these exercises are very easy to mark! 

There is research which you can find by a web search on "higher categories and concurrency". The basic intuition is that handling many computers for example accessing databases you can regard each as having it's own time, so we are dealing with $n$-dimensional time. You can also search on "double categories and data structures". My own research has been in using (strict) double and higher groupoids in homotopy theory. This gets round the old problem that double groups are abelian groups; double groupoids are surprisingly complicated, and are in a sense "more nonabelian" than groups. 

I came across this question in my 1961 DPhil Thesis; this was written up in two papers which are available from my Publication List, [3]. ``Cohomology with chains as coefficients'', Proc. London Math. Soc. (3) 14 (1964), 545-565. [4]. ``On K\"{u}nneth suspensions'', Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 60 (1964) 713-720. It is shown in the first paper that the isomorphism could be chosen to be natural with respect to maps of $X$ but not with respect to maps of either $Y$ or of $G$. The naturality was important for the second paper, which was poorly titled: it should have been something like "$k$-invariants of function spaces". Paper [3] also contains as an Appendix formulae for this isomorphism in some special cases The aim of this work was to investigate the Postnikov system of $Y^X$ by induction on the Postnikov system of $Y$. Michael Barratt suggested this as another way of determining in some cases the extensions involved in his work on exact sequences of track groups; such a determination in his paper "Track Groups II" used Whitney tube systems! . 

I am not sure if this answers the question explicitly, but in terms of references you should look up the notion of fibration of groupoids which I think first appeared in an exercisein the 1968 edition of what is now Topology and Groupoids, and is well discussed and used in that book. The family of exact sequences derived from a fibration of groupoids is an algebraic model of the bottom end of the exact sequences of a fibration of spaces. These sequences have been used by P.R. Heath in discussing Nielsen fixed point theory: Topology and its Applications 181 (2015) 3â€“33. See also arXiv:1207.6404. 

The abstract case is handled in R. Brown, ``Fibrations of groupoids'', J. Algebra 15 (1970) 103-132. where a 5-lemma type result is Theorem 4.9. I find it easier to handle the abstract case rather than the topological example. You get injectivity on Ker( $\pi_1(X, A) \to \pi_0 A)$ and an Example 4.10 (for groupoids) shows you do not always get injectivity. There are other applications of the exact sequences of a fibration of groupoids, see Heath, P.R. and Kamps, K.H. "On exact orbit sequences", Illinois J. Math. 26~(1) (1982) 149--154. 

To put another context to the above comments and answers, recall that a crossed module consists of a morphism $\mu: M \to P$ together with an action of $P$ on the right of the group $M$ satisfying the two axioms 

I mention the paper Blakers, A. "Some relations between homology and homotopy groups", Ann. of Math. (2) 49 (1948) 428--461. who assigns a simplicial set to what he calls a "group system" and which we now call a "crossed complex", of which a special case is a group. This continues earlier work of Eilenberg and Mac Lane (Ann. of Math. (2) 46 (1945) 480--509.). 

The simplicial and cubical nerves of crossed complexes are defined in the book partially titled Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (EMS 2011). Since strict $n$-groupoids are equivalent to $n$-truncated crossed complexes, this gives the construction. The globular case is discussed in this paper. The main feature of the construction of the nerve is of Dold-Kan type, but using the fundamental crossed complex functor $$\Pi: (\text{filtered spaces}) \to (\text{crossed complexes}).$$ So if $X_*$ is a filtered space we get a crossed complex $\Pi X_*$. In particular this applies to the skeletal filtration of CW-complexes, and so to $\Delta_*^n$ and $I^n_*$. So the cubical nerve of a crossed complex is defined by $$N^\Box(C)_n = Crs(\Pi(I^n_*), C).$$ I give the cubical nerve here because the $\omega$-groupoid structure this has is a major feature of the above book. However the extra structure that you ask about has not been studied to my knowledge. Variations on the "cubical site", including symmetries, are in the paper Grandis, M. and Mauri, L. "Cubical sets and their site". Theory Applic. Categories 11 (2003) 185--201. 

@HW: I actually wrote $\pi_2(K)$! The explicit determination of this kernel was long a problem for me, and a start on a solution (for finite $\pi_1 K$) is given in the paper with Razak Salleh `Free crossed crossed resolutions of groups and presentations of modules of identities among relations', LMS J. Comp. and Math. 2 (1999) 28-61. These methods are developed by Graham Ellis to give a GAP package HAP. The idea is to construct inductively with a contracting homotopy a universal cover of a prospective $K(G,1)$. One starts with a tree in a Cayley graph, which gives a retraction of the 1-skeleton of a prospective cover. A detailed explanation is in the big book already cited, p. 341ff. See also Graham's paper in J. Symbolic Comp. 38 (2004) 1077--1118. Also p. 139 of the same book gives some calculations of some finite $\pi_2$ of mapping cones which are obtained by first calculating the $2$-type as a (finite) crossed module and then determining the kernel, all using GAP. 

In view of Yemon's reference to group cohomology, I would like to mention Graham Ellis' work on "Homological Algebra Programming". The key point is that he constructs free resolutions inductively together with a contracting homotopy: it is the latter that gives the computational aspect. There is an explanation of some of this in Section 9.3 of the book Nonabelian algebraic topology, in terms of constructing a "home for a contracting homotopy", as against the more traditional "killing kernels", a method which is notably non algorithmic. The spirit of this derives from Homological Perturbation Theory, in which also the homotopies are crucial. 

There are all sorts of assumptions behind the question, and answers, such as that the solution of famous problems is the test of progress in mathematics. At my first international conference in 1964 I met Stanislaw Ulam, and he mentioned to me: "A young person may think the most ambitious thing to do is to tackle some famous problem or conjecture. But that might distract that person from developing the kind of mathematics most appropriate to them." In the 1980s I gave a talk to teachers and children on "How mathematics gets into knots" and mentioned prime knots and prime numbers. After the talk, a teacher came up to me and said: "That is the first time anyone in my career has used the word "analogy" in relation to mathematics." I find that tragic! We have to be careful not to fall into: "They ask for bread and we give them stones." The notion of fractal is well known to the public, but how many mathematics courses give a simple account of the Hausdorff metric, and let students see some of the mathematics behind the fractal notion. Other scientists would like to know what is new in mathematics, in terms of concepts and ideas. My talk to a Conference on Theoretical Neuroscience in 2003, was well received. it included an email analogy for colimits, as well as ideas on higher dimensional algebra. One participant told me: " That was the first time I had heard a seminar by a mathematician which made any sense!" So this time I managed to get it right! First year main math courses at University should contain something which excites the imagination. (I am told Physics courses usually have something on current research.) That Euclidean geometry has been out of most syllabi makes this harder, especially to get over the idea of proof. Is it too harsh to say that courses on "Proof" are about how to write clear proofs of boring things? It is good to show proofs of otherwise not so believable things. In the 20th century, a main contributor to the unity of mathematics has been Category Theory; I feel this is a high order mathematical achievement! See the article Analogy and Comparison for a discussion of analogy in this context. A simple talk to the first year on cubes of dimension $0$ to $5$, and how to count faces of various dimensions, awakened the interest of a student, who later went on to a PhD. (This was also a talk I have given to 13 year olds: they end up by counting the $2$-dimensional faces of a $5$-dimensional cube.) There is also a lot to say about the contribution of mathematics over the millennia to science and culture. See an article on Mathematics in Context. Edit: January 12, 2014 : I would like to add that since the general public are often familiar with the words fractal and chaos, it is sad if undergraduates in mathematics are not given some idea of the rigorous mathematics behind these notions, in particular for fractals that is the notion of Hausdorff metric. I have given a light hearted course on this in a second year course on analysis, without proving the completeness theorem, but explaining what it means, and with exercises on calculating the Hausdorff distance between subsets of the plane. I also asked them to do a short project on "The importance of fractals" using the web to get evidence, and also encouraged use of fractal computer programs. The notion of "chaos" is also important in view of the financial situation, and the everyday notion of weather and climate!
