We see that $r_s$ is always greater than about 2 light-years for $0\leq R\leq R_t$. Towards the center. Therefore, the systems you’re interested in should be near the outer edge of the cluster. Hold on a minute, though. This is a density distribution based entirely on a sphere of stars, with nothing else influencing them. We’ve guessed that this models an open cluster fairly well, but we also need to assume that the cluster, if left to its own devices, is unstable, and the stars will drift away. Let’s try adding a central object, like you suggested - an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). This isn’t terribly far-fetched; it’s an idea that’s been explored quite a lot in the case of globular clusters. In open clusters, we have problems because we need to explain how the black hole got there in the first place. However, we can ignore that for now. If there’s a central, massive object in a star cluster, the cluster should exhibit a Bahcall-Wolf cusp. Within a distance equal to one fifth of the black hole’s sphere of influence, the density should obey a power law of the form $$\rho_{BW}(R)\propto R^{-7/4}$$ Number density, assuming a roughly homogeneous population (again, more on that later), should obey this power law: $$\mathcal{N}_{BW}(R)\propto R^{-7/4}\tag{4}$$ All we have to do is calculate the sphere of influence, find the number density there according to the King model we computed, and fit the two together. The sphere of influence, according to one definition, is $$r_h=\frac{GM_{BH}}{\sigma_0}\tag{5}$$ where $G$ is the gravitational constant $M_{BH}$ is the mass of the black hole, and $\sigma_0$ is the central stellar velocity dispersion, which I’ll choose to be about .81 km/s - modeled after observations by Geller et al. (2009) of M35, a reasonably analog to our cluster. I’m going to choose $M_{BH}\sim10^4M_\odot$. We then get $r_h\approx 6.25$ parsecs, and the Bahcall-Wolf cutoff radius is roughly 1.25 parsecs. Let’s calculate the number density at $R=\frac{1}{5}r_h$ from the King model. We get 17.44 stars per cubic parsec - quite large! If we then assume that the cusp stars there, we know that $$\mathcal{N}_{BW}(R)=17.44=A(1.25)^{-7/4}$$ for some constant $A$, which we find to be $A=25.77$. All we have to do now is to plot the two together in a piecewise number density function, defined as follows: $$\mathcal{N}(R)= \begin{cases} \frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}R}N\frac{1}{4\pi R^2},\quad 0\leq R\leq1.25\\ 25.77R^{-7/4},\quad1.25\leq R\leq10\\ \end{cases}\tag{6}$$ Plotting this on with a logarithmic $y$-axis gives us 

This violates a few conservation laws. Lumping them together, it boils down to the idea that you cannot take in "normal" matter and output antimatter. Lepton number, baryon number, electric charge (in some cases) and a few other laws are violated. 

So, is a galaxy-wide language possible at all? I’m not asking for details about what one might be like, just if these hurdles aren’t enough to knock the whole idea down. 

All you have to do is connect the base to the house. The person who lives in the house will supposedly have a job as some sort of delivery person for a small company - or maybe a construction worker with a creepy white van - and they drive that van to and from work each day. The van, however, carries food - and lots of it. 

I'd like answers to focus on how much material could be deposited on each impact, orbital perturbations of the planet, regional distribution of impacts (due to planetary rotation) and how they can impact mineability of deposited material, and asteroid flux. Answers discussing only one or two factors, however, will be much appreciated; you don't need to cover everything to write a high-quality answer. 

Wipe his memory and put him in a regular cell. If Dave can't remember where he's been, then he clearly can't teleport there. He'll constantly be gaining new memories, of course, but they'll all be of his cell, so he can have fun teleporting from one side of the cell to another. Be sure to make sure he can't see through any openings at any time - that means no windows, and he must be unconscious if the cell door is opened for any reason. Basically, he's going to be in a solid block of concrete - with normal security precautions, of course. The prison should be able to hold any regular person who can't teleport. 

Let’s do a more formal assessment (based on e.g. these notes). Let the mean mass of a star in the cluster be $m_m$. By the virial theorem, the speed $v$ of a star at $R\approx. R_t$ is given by $$v^2\approx\frac{GNm_m}{R_t}\tag{7}$$ The time it takes a star to travel $R_t$, the crossing time $t_c$, is $$t_c=R/v\tag{8}$$ and the relaxation time $t_r$, the time over which encounters with other stars begin to have an effect on the motion of a star, is $$t_r\approx\frac{0.1N}{\ln N}t_c\tag{9}$$ Furthermore, if a percent $\gamma$ of stars have a velocity above a certain critical value, then the evaporation time of the system is $$t_e=\frac{t_r}{\gamma}\approx t_r\times10^2\tag{10}$$ So, what critical parameters have changed now that we added the Bahcall-Wolf cusp? Well, we can safely assume that $m_m$ and $R_t$ are the same, as we specified them. It turns out, however, than $N$ has changed. Integrating over the piecewise density distribution gives $n(R_t)=0.89$, meaning that we have fewer stars in the cluster. At the same time, the total mass of the cluster is much, much larger, since the black hole’s mass is substantially greater than the mass of the stars. Therefore, $$v^2\approx\frac{GNm_m+M_{BH}}{R_t}$$ Having fewer stars and adding a black hole will lead to a much shorter relaxation time. Even if we extend the tidal radius (as would be expected), the black hole still won’t help stars at the outside of the cluster. I recall one paper noting that in the case of a black hole with a mass somewhat less than that of the cluster, most of the stars in the outer regions of the cluster will behave just as if the cluster was perfectly described by a King model, with no central black hole. At the center of the cluster, there will indeed be some significant effects - and since the number density is much greater there, a large fraction of the stars should be impacted. I’m reluctant to draw analogies between stellar clusters and galaxies, but stars near the center should be influenced just like stars near the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A*, orbit the black hole. The analogy is actually fairly good: Most stars in a galaxy don’t orbit the central supermassive black hole; they orbit the total mass of the galaxy. It’s a self-gravitating system, not a set of bodies orbiting one massive one. At the very center, however, stars are clearly orbiting Sagittarius A*. The same holds true for our open cluster. So, to summarize: 

During this 2000-odd year history of Britain, the land went from independent to a colony/province to small independent kingdoms to larger kingdoms to having a parliament in addition to the monarchy to an empire and back to a smaller state, with a parliament and a monarchy. It went through these numerous stages over a long period of time, and, quite frankly, it is still changing. So, what's the takeaway model for a nation? Here's my guess: 

However, in the short-term, the immediate effects involve protecting all robots, not just those crucial to society's survival.

Voronoi diagrams have already been used to model the borders of countries and states; see specifically the work of Jason Davies (images copyrighted, by the way). There are certainly many differences from real-life borders (although in certain parts, like North Africa, things seem to work), but again, this is only a first approximation. For large $n$, creating such a diagram becomes a little complicated. Brute-force searches work but are obviously tedious; more sophisticated methods like Fortune’s algorithm become useful. For more information, see Easiest algorithm of Voronoi diagram to implement? and How do I derive a Voronoi diagram given its point set and its Delaunay triangulation?. However, I’d like to deal with a much simpler case, where $n=3$. $n=1$ is obviously trivial, and $n=2$ yields precisely one border - namely, the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting the two cities. However, $n=3$ is a little more interesting, although it is certainly simple to solve. All we need to do is find the one vertex where all three borders coincide. There are several ways in which we can do this, knowing the locations of three cities and assuming that each one is the center of its own city-state. We could use one of the above algorithms, if we really wanted, but those can be time-consuming to implement. Alternatively, we could use the fact that any Voronoi vertex is the center of a circle containing three points, and therefore, given three points, we could find the center of that circle. However, I’d like to use what I think is the simplest option: Determine perpendicular bisectors of segments connecting any two cities, and find the point where they intersect. Some assumptions (well, just one, for now): 

The answer, as far as I can tell, is that there aren't any existing drugs that would do what you want. Drug-induced amnesia is, of course, a real thing. In your question, you alluded to drugs that cause anterograde amnesia, which involves a reduced ability to form new memories. Alcoholism can cause this, but some drugs - mainly benzodiazepines - can, too. That said, you don't want anterograde amnesia, but retrograde amnesia. However, there aren't really drugs that cause retrograde amnesia for the time periods you're looking at. Some infamous date rape drugs can cause memory issues, but nothing that long-term; additionally, these only affect memories formed after the drug was administered. Even if you could find a drug that would do this, though, it would still be hard to make it airborne and still reasonably potent for a wide range of people.
