which are all convex. Further, since market demand is most often defined as the sum of individual demands (which above appear to be convex mostly) and the sum of convex functions is itself a convex function, then market demand should most often be a convex function it seems. Can a more general statement be made here about when the market demand curve is convex? 

The question is not totally clear, but I will attempt to give you some guidance. To answer your first questions, confounding variables are not a type of endogenous variable. We do not observe nor are we interested in the confounding variables, which means they are not endogenous variables in our model. You later give the correct definition of an endogenous variable "An explanatory variable in a multiple regression model that is correlated with the error term". Hence, there can be several reasons why a variable would be endogenous, but they all have to do with correlation with the error term. An endogenous variable is one, which cannot have a causal interpretation in a regression model. When something leads to a variable being endogenous, we call this a source of endogeneity. As you mention, an important source of endogeneity are omitted variables. If we omit a variable, which affects the outcome variable, then the omitted variable is captured by the error term in our model. If the omitted variable is correlated with an explanatory variable, then that explanatory variable becomes endogenous, because it is now correlated with the error term. Other important sources of endogeneity are reverse causality and simultaneity, as you mention. For reverse causality, we have that the explanatory variabe is supposed to influence the outcome variable, but if the outcome variable also affects the explanatory variable, then in our regression model, this latter channel is necessarily captured by the error term. This is because such a channel determines the relationship between the outcome and explanatory variable, but we cannot capture it in any variable. Putting the explanatory variable on the left side instead and using the outcome variable as an explanatory variable does not help either, because we then have the same problem. Then the explanatory variable is correlated with the error term, which makes the explanatory variable endogenous. So overlapping features are that all sources of endogeneity stem from a correlation of an explanatory variable with the error term. Distinctions are the source of this correlation and consequently how to deal with it. For example, omitted variable bias may be dealt with by observing and adding the omitted variable to the regression. This strategy does not work when trying to address reverse causality. 

No, the marginal cost curves are not necessarily the same for each firm in the market. However the values of marginal costs are. To disprove the general claim that "The marginal cost curve of each firm in a competitive market is the same" we simply need to find one counter-example, such as the one given below: Suppose there are two firms in the market and the market inverse demand function is given by $P=7 - q^m = 7 - (q_1 + q_2)$ Here $P$ represents the price, $q^m$ the market supply and $q_1, q_2$ represent the respective supplies of the firms 1 and 2. Suppose the marginal cost curves for each firm are given by: $MC_1 = 2q_1$, $MC_2 = 4q_2$ Note that these are not the same! Since we are looking for a competitive equilibrium, the firms behave competitively and hence we must assume that they do not realize they have market power. Hence they each set: $P = MC_i, \; i\in\{1,2\}$ From this, solving for quantity we have the respective Supply functions of each firm: $S_1 = q_1 = 0.5P$ $S_2 = q_2 = 0.25P$ Inserting these two supply functions into the inverse demand function we have: $P=4$, $q_1=2$, $q_2=1$. Is this an equilibrium with perfect competition? Well we found it by combining Supply and Demand assuming perfectly competitive firms, so it must be. To verify: $Market \; Demand = 7 - p = 3$ $Market \; Suppy=q_1 + q_2 = 3$ So the market is indeed in equilibrium. Are both firms setting $P=MC$ as they should in perfect competition? $MC_1 = 2*q_1 = 4 = P$ $MC_2 = 4*q_2 = 4 = P$ So indeed we have a market equilibrium with perfect competition and different marginal cost curves. QED Note however that the values of the marginal cost curves at the equilibrium quantities are the same for each firm (and must be the same for each firm in equilibrium). 

We would move upward along the LM curve. However if there is growth because of investment or some technology shock that would cause the IS curve to also shift upward. IS: When the growth "shock" you mention happens, there is now more demand for goods (Demand= C+I+G in a closed economy), without any change in interest rates. Since demand shifts, supply goes along with it in IS-LM and GDP increases The IS captures the GDP-to-interest rate relationship (along the curve) since this relationship has now changed, we must shift the curve. Specifically we have more GDP now per unit of interest rate compared to before. Since interest rates didn't change in your example, but there is more GDP (caused not by an interest rate increase) the IS curve must represent more GDP for each interest rate, which - if you draw it now - is a shift to the right of the IS. LM: Represents what happens to interest rates when GDP increases. This relationship has not changed, so we don't have a shift. The reason this relationship has not changed is because the only reason interest rates are increasing now, is because of GDP, something the current LM curve already captures. (If it would be for something else, like money supply change, there would have to be a shift.) So there can be growth without money supply increases. However since there is now more demand for money (because there are more things that we can buy) but not more supply of money, then money increases in value, i.e. the "price of money" which in a way is the interest rate must go up. For that reason, part of the growth will be reduced (as investment goes down), but we will still have growth. If money supply also increases exactly enough to accomodate the GDP increase (typically is the case in reality) the interest rate will not increase and the LM would also shift and we do not have the mentioned negative effect. 

I largely agree with mathtastic, but I think it is necessary to add something. When joining a monetary union a country does indeed lose its power to conduct monetary policy. However simply not being able to reduce the interest rate was not the main issue that Greece and other countries faced because of being in the Eurozone. This is because the ECB lowered interest rates (almost) down to the zero lower bound. To adequately address your question we have to distinguish advantages of a country from having its own currency while in a crisis, vs. advantages from always having had its own currency in the first place. Reasons why it is helpful to have your own currency when a crisis has already hit: The issue in this case was the impossibility of devaluation of the currency. One way to understand the Greek crisis is as a current account crisis. Not only was the government over indebted, but the country as a whole. That is to say that there was a too large trade deficit for too long. The trade deficit creates a sort of debt that the whole country owes to other countries in total and was a main point of focus in the debates about Greek debt. You might have heard the issue of competitiveness being cited as a factor in the Greek crisis, which simply means the impossibiliy of the Greek economy to export sufficiently. You may have also heard about "living above their means" or "BMWs going to Greece financed by German money". All this refers to the trade deficit, i.e. the current accuont crisis. To help itself out of this current account crisis, Greece would have to reduce its trade deficit, i.e export more and import less. If Greece would have had its own currency, a natural reaction to the crisis (without any government intervention even required) would be that Greece's currency loses value. Hence its exports are cheaper which leads to more exports and its imports are more expensive, which leads to less imports. In this way Greece would have an easier time dealing with the crisis and could also "grow its way out of the crisis" - policy advice often heard in this whole debate. In addition to reducing the trade deficit, a currency devaluation would have helped Greece's economy grow and help with debt service, because the private and public sector were over indebted and not in a position to borrow. This means that domestic demand was very low, so foreign demand- i.e. exports- would have to pick up the slack. Now, you might say that Greece could export more by simply reducing its prices even without currency devaluation. This is in theory true and is indeed what was recommended and what was attempted in Greece. You can look this up under the term "internal devaluation". However there are several problems with this. First of all it is easier to simply devalue the currency (one price adjustment) than to reduce prices of all export goods (many price adjustments). Furthermore, price decreases mean deflation, which brings with it further problems and is hard to combat later on, when it is no longer desired. A term to look up for more information on this would be "deflationary spiral". Third and perhaps most importantly is the issue of "downward nominal rigidity". This is the empirically observed phenomenon that nominal prices tend to not go down as much as they should or at all, i.e. are rigid in going downwards. This come perhaps from money illusion. It is easier to inflate away workers' wages than to actually reduce them, because the former doesn't cause any protest, while the latter does. Although this is not rational, it happens. Hence it is very difficult to reduce prices and export more (i.e. be more competitive) without an own currency. This is the reason many countries are likely happy to have their own currency. As to why they are happy despite possibly being "pegged" to the Euro, is because they can break that peg much more easily than Greece if they wanted to. Reasons why it is helpful to have your own currency before a crisis hits: For information on how it could have come to such a loss of competitiveness in Greece I can recommend looking up the "Balassa-Samuelson effect", although this may not be the whole story. Personally, I am not totally convinced by the conventional wisdom, especially popular in European media, that if Greece were to return now to the Drachma that things would be better. This is because their debts may then legally still be denominated in Euro and after the inevitable devaluation of the Drachma against the Euro (the whole point of having the Drachma now) would cause the debt burden to increase even further. For more on models where such effects are present see so-called "third generation currency crisis models". However had they not had the Euro in the first place, like the "happy" European countries you are mentioning, then their debts would have likely never been denominated in Euro in the first place and could more easily pay that debt through a currency devluation / inflation. Another reason countries are happy to not have had the Euro in the first place is because the Euro created interest rates for Greece's public debt that were too low than what they should have been. This means the government became over-indebted, which lead to the problems we see today. Had the interest rates been (correctly) higher the government would have perhaps borrowed less and not too much. This is to say that due to the Euro (and the false positie expectations caused by it) the "price signal" was not working so well. Other countries that never adopted the Euro did not experience such a loss of information from the price signal. 

UPDATE: I have now found the solution. It turns out that the terms I had previously omitted from $W$ were in fact relevant. I have added them and some more information to the question. I will leave up the question for a few days in case someone would like to attempt to answer it. Otherwise, I can answer it myself later on for anyone who might be stumped in the future. This question pertains to the paper "Optimal Tax Administration" by Slemrod and Keen (2017). The IMF working paper is freely available on SSRN, however, it is not necessary to know the paper in order to understand the question. I am confused on how to arrive at equation (5) in the working paper version. Suppose there is a welfare function: $W(t,\alpha)= wl - tz(t,\alpha) -c(e,\alpha) - \psi(l) + v(tz(t,\alpha) -a(\alpha)) $ Here, $v$ is an increasing and concave function, $\psi$ is an incresing and convex function, $t$ is the tax rate, $\alpha$ is tax enforcement, $c$ is evasion/compliance cost and $z$ is declared income, which depends on $t$ and $\alpha$. Declared income is given by $z=wl(t,w) - e(t,\alpha)$, where $w$ is the wage rate, $l$ is hours worked and $e$ is concealed income. Both $l$ and $e$ are derived optimally. The first order conditions for $l$ and $e$ are given by: $(1-t)w - \psi'(l) = 0$ $t - c_e(e,\alpha) = 0$ Here $c_e$ denotes the derivative of $c$ with respect to $e$ and $\psi'$ is the derivative of $\psi$. I am interested in $\frac{dW}{dt}$. The author's invoke the envelope property to arrive at: $\frac{dW}{dt}= -z + v'*(z + tz_t)$ Here $z_t$ is the derivative of $z$ with resprect to t and $v'$ is the derivative of $v$. How can I arrive at this expression?
