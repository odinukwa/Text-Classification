Dear Qiaochu, This is an interesting question. One way to solve the second question is by applying (some appropriate version of) Stokes's theorem. You are integrating a unit normal over the surface of the tetrahedron; it is a closed surface (or perhaps more relevantly, it is a boundary), so the answer is zero. This interpretation of the second problem is essentially how one would mathematize the physics of flux, pressure, and so on, and, at least based on my experience in undergraduate physics classes, this is in fact how physicists will think about it. Of course, the converse applies, namely, that when confronted with various surface integrals and so on, physicists have the ability to think of them in physical terms, as computing a flux or the like, and this gives an insight into their meaning. As for the first problem, I'm a little worried that if one mathematizes it too much, the proof will vaporize, because the mathematics of computing moments of inertia and so on is surely going to involve many applications of Pythagoras's theorem. On the other hand, at least formally, I would guess that one can again set it up as some kind of Stokes's theorem type computation. I guess the point of view that I am suggesting is that these conservation-law type arguments are mathematized by integral formulas of the Stokes's theorem type. 

Writing an infinite Galois group as the projective limit of finite Galois groups, one sees that the inertia groups in the infinite extension topologically generate the infinite Galois group. 

As I understand it, the Jacquet module for $(\mathfrak g, K)$-modules is defined so as to again be a $\mathfrak g$-module, and in fact it is a Harish-Chandra module, not for $({\mathfrak g},K)$, but rather for $(\mathfrak g,N)$ (where $N$ is the unipotent radical of the parabolic with respect to which we compute the Jacquet module). (I am probably assuming that the original $(\mathfrak g, K)$-module has an infinitesimal character here.) I am using the definitions of this paper, in particular the discussion of section 2. This in turn refers to Ch. 4 of Wallach's book. So probably this latter reference will cover things in detail. Added: I may have misunderstood the question (due in part to a confusion on my part about definitions; see the comments below), but perhaps the following remark is helpful: If one takes the Jacquet module (say in the sense of the above referenced paper, which is also the sense of Wallach), say for a Borel, then it is a category {\mathcal O}-like object: it is a direct sum of weight spaces for a maximal Cartan in ${\mathfrak g},$ and any given weight appears only finitely many times. (See e.g. Lemma 2.3 and Prop. 2.4 in the above referenced paper; no doubt this is also in Wallach in some form; actually these results are for the geometric Jacquet functor of that paper rather than for Wallach's Jacquet module, but I think they should apply just as well to Wallach's. Maybe they also apply with Casselman's definition; if so, doesn't this give the desired admissibility? 

[I'm entering my comment above as an answer here, so as to stop this question being bumped to the front page in the future.] There is simply a typo: the definition of $f_u^{cp}(\gamma)$ should be $\gamma + u$(etc. ...). 

Let me discuss a variant of the question, where I work in the holomorphic, or algebraic, category; I'm not sure off the top of my head how close it is to the original question. Suppose that $S$ in fact has the structure of an algebraic curve; or (what is the same) as a Riemann surface. Then the Riemann--Hilbert correspondence says that monodromy representations (which is the algebraic geometers word for what in the question are called holonomy reprsentations) $\pi_1(S) \to GL_n(\mathbb C)$ correspond to holomorphic vector bundles $\mathcal E$ on $S$ equipped with a holomorphic flat connection. My impression is that it is then not so easy to determine the isomorphism class of $\mathcal E$ as a holomorphic bundle, given the data of the monodromy representation. I don't know references for this, but I know there are other people reading MO who do; perhaps one of them will chime in. My impression in the original question is that one is working in the smooth category, rather than the holomorphic/algebraic category, and then the equivalence class of $\mathcal E$ is a much coarser invariant, I guess. In his answer, Igor Belegradek gives a sufficient condition for the bundles to be isomorphic (lying in the same path-component of the representation variety); I wonder how close this is to being necessary? 

At least in Faltings's setting, $m$ is the maximal ideal of a non-Noetherian valuation domain $V$. If we let $S$ be the non-zero elements of $m$, then the localization of $V$ at $S$ will be the field of fractions $K$ of $V$. The category of $K$-modules (i.e. $K$-vector spaces) is obtained as a Serre quotient of $V$-modules, but one quotients out modules which are killed by some non-zero element of $V$, while the category of amost modules is obtained by quotienting out by a much smaller category, namely the modules which are killed by every element of $m$. In other words, I think you have misinterpreted the meaning of $m$-torsion, at least in so far it is used in the context of Faltings's "almost commutative algebra". Added in response to the comment below: Let me not use the word $m$-torsion anymore, since it can be interpreted in different ways, and seems to be causing confusion. Let $\mathcal M$ be the category of $V$-modules. Here are two Serre subcategories of $\mathcal M$: 

I think that the property you want is the criterion for smoothness in terms of lifting maps over nilpotent thickenings. This is a way of expressing in algebraic terms the idea in manifold theory of having local sections. The statement is that $f:X \to S$ is a morphism of schemes, locally of finite presentation, then $f$ is smooth precisely when the following is satisfied: given a map Spec $A \to X$, a square zero thickening Spec $B$ of Spec $A$ (so $B$ surjects onto $A$, and the kernel $I$ satisfies $I^2 = 0$), and a map Spec $B \to S$ making the obvious diagram commute, then we can lift the latter map to a map Spec $B \to X$. If you look at Ex. II.8.6 in Hartshorne it discusses this somewhat obliquely. The book Neron models discusses it more clearly. You will probably have to think quite a bit yourself to really understand the analogy.
