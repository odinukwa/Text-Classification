A neat construction of Bjorn Poonen shows that the Grothendieck ring of varieties (over a field of char. 0) is not a domain: $URL$ Is the Grothendieck ring of varieties reduced? (My guess: the answer is yes, the proof is easy enough that several people have observed this without writing it up anywhere. But I don't know how to show it.) 

It usually makes no difference whether the set of strata is totally or partially ordered. In the partially ordered case, put $X_d = $ (disjoint) union of all $d$-dimensional strata. You are probably better off working with compactly supported equivariant cohomology. In fact I don't think the short exact sequence you wrote down exists in the generality you claim, but with compact support it's fine. If the strata are smooth and $X$ is compact then you get a sequence also for ordinary cohomology using Poincare duality (whence the funny degree shift in your short exact sequence) and $H^\bullet(X)=H^\bullet_c(X)$. There is a spectral sequence associated to the stratification whose first page is given by the various cohomologies $H^\bullet_{c,T}(X_\beta)$ computing $H^\bullet_{c,T}(X)$ (compactly supported equivariant cohomology). I don't have a reference off hand, but I know that the non-equivariant version is given a complete proof in Arapura's paper on the Leray spectral sequence; maybe it can be adapted. Other places I would start looking: the book of Chriss and Ginzburg and Kirwan's thesis. 

One nontrivial example where the universal cover is actually a scheme (locally of finite type) is when $X$ is the nodal cubic curve over a field $k$, i.e. $\mathbf P^1$ with two points identified. Note that when $k = \mathbf C$, we have $\pi_1(X(\mathbf C)) \cong \mathbf Z$. The universal cover $\widetilde X$ is an infinite chain of $\mathbf P^1$, where the point $0$ on the $i$th curve has been glued to the point $\infty$ on the $(i+1)$st curve, for all $i \in \mathbf Z$; the action of $\mathbf Z$ by deck transformation is translating along this chain. 

The answer to the first question is yes. Although the words "equivariant cohomology" don't appear there, this goes back to Deligne's Hodge III, since he defines the mixed Hodge structure on a simplicial variety and you can define the Borel construction simplicially in the usual way (via the resolution with $X$, $G \times X$, $G \times G \times X$, and so on). In particular he proves that $H^\bullet(BG)$ is pure of Tate type. If $G$ is connected, then there is a spectral sequence $$H^p(BG) \otimes H^q(X) \implies H^{p+q}_G(X).$$ If $X$ is smooth and projective this must therefore degenerate immediately for weight reasons and so the equivariant cohomology of smooth projective varieties is very simple: $H^\bullet_G(X) \cong H^\bullet(X) \otimes H^\bullet(BG)$. In particular the answer to your second question is also yes. I would imagine that there is a suitable theory of "six functors" for simplicial varieties as well, but I don't know the literature well enough to say anything meaningful or give a reference. 

The action of the symmetric group can be described in a compact way by means of the isomorphisms $$ \newcommand{\Lie}{\mathsf{Lie}}\Lie(\!(n+3)\!) \cong H^n(M_{0,n+3}) \otimes \mathrm{sgn}_{n+3}$$ for all $n$. These are due to Getzler: see his paper "Operads and moduli spaces of genus 0 Riemann surfaces". Here we denote by $\Lie(\!(N)\!)$ the component in arity $N$ of the cyclic Lie operad; if $\Lie(n)$ denotes the ordinary Lie operad then $$ \Lie(n) = \mathrm{Res}^{S_{n+1}}_{S_n}\Lie(\!(n+1)\!).$$ There is a very simple combinatorial description of $\Lie(n)$: it is the vector space spanned by Lie words in the symbols $a_1,\ldots, a_n$ such that each symbol appears exactly once. The module $\Lie(\!(n)\!)$ is subtler but can be computed from $\Lie(n)$ via $$ \Lie(\!(n)\!) \oplus \Lie(n) \cong \mathrm{Ind}_{S_{n-1}}^{S_n} \Lie(n-1).$$ See e.g. these notes of Stanley. 

It seems to me Kapranov's methods are purely algebraic and that his description works verbatim over $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbf Z)$. 

$\,\!$Hi Andrea. It's not just legal to apply the Fourier-Mukai transform here, it is highly encouraged. For an abelian scheme $A \to S$ the Fourier transform defines an exact equivalence of triangulated categories $D^b(A) \to D^b(\widehat A)$, where $\widehat A$ is the dual abelian scheme over $S$. This applies in particular to your case when your abelian scheme is a trivial fibration $X \times S \to S$. 

Check out Harris & Morrison's "Moduli of Curves", section 3E. There is a wealth of examples of applications of GRR coming from moduli theory, in which one applies it to projection from the universal family or some fibered power of the universal family. The basic idea in these cases is that both the base space and the total space are rather complicated beasts but the fibers of the morphisms are usually quite tractable, since they are just the gadgets you are trying to parametrize. For more examples in the same vein, you could read the classic "Towards an enumerative geometry of the moduli space of curves" by David Mumford. 

In "Automorphic representations of GSp(4)" (2004) (see $URL$ James Arthur announces a classification of discrete automorphic representations of GSp(4). There are no proofs however, these are to appear in a monograph "Automorphic representations of classical groups" (in preparation), which still hasn't appeared. His 2012 article, "Classifying automorphic representations", makes no reference to the announced results for GSp(4). Arthur also mentions that the classification is conditional on the existence of a stabilized trace formula (and its twisted analogues) which require certain cases of the fundamental lemma. But of course there's been a lot of progress in this area since 2004. My question is to what extent proofs of these claims can be found in the literature. Is it more or less known among experts how to prove them, maybe even unconditionally? Are there any interesting partial results, for instance, if you fix the archimedean component(s) to be a particular cohomological $(\mathfrak g, K)$-module? To what extent can the various cases in the classification be understood as functorial liftings from smaller groups? Sorry about the open-ended question. Any information is appreciated. I am aware that an equivalent of this classification for PGSp(4) is proven in Flicker's book: $URL$ 

The roots of $f$ (and the point at infinity, when $f$ has degree five) give you six points on $\mathbf P^1$. The curve is bi-elliptic if and only if there is an involution of $\mathbf P^1$ which switches these points pairwise with each other. After a quadratic extension of your base field you can assume that the involution has the form $x \mapsto -x$, in which case your equation can be written in the form $y^2 = f(x^2)$ where $f$ is a squarefree cubic which does not vanish at the origin. 

Consider $f \colon {\mathbb C}^2 \to {\mathbb C}^2$ given by $(x,y) \mapsto (xy,y)$. The image consists of ${\mathbb C}^2$ minus the subset $y = 0, x \neq 0$. Since the image is not closed, it is not a variety. The notion of a constructible subset was invented to deal with questions like this. A constructible subset is one which can be constructed from subvarieties using "boolean operations". Equivalently it is a subset defined by polynomial equations and inequations. It is true that the image of a constructible subset is again constructible (Chevalley's theorem). 

In genus two the situation is very simple. All toroidal compactifications of $A_2$ are isomorphic and the DM compactification $\overline M_2$ is a toroidal compactification. I don't know a good reference unfortunately. 

The minimal number of open affine sets needed to cover (the coarse moduli space of) $M_{g,n}$ is a famous open problem. The conjecture, which is due to Looijenga if I recall correctly, is that the minimum is given by $g - \delta_{n,0}$ if $g > 1$. Proving this would in one swoop give a proof of Diaz's theorem and several different vanishing theorems on intersection numbers. 

One can indeed modify the formulas in the paper of Getzler to get an answer for any $\mathbf R^d$, by judiciously inserting minus signs and making substitutions $x \mapsto x^{d-1}$ in various places, but if I try I'll probably get it wrong. So let me explain how it works instead, and hopefully there are no sign errors and everything ends up in the right cohomological degree. The cohomology ring of $F(\mathbf R^d,k)$ was computed by Cohen. It is the graded commutative algebra generated by variables $\omega_{ij}$ of degree $(d-1)$ for distinct $i,j \in \{1,\ldots,k\}$, modulo the relations 

I'm assuming you are not primarily looking for references to papers in algebraic geometry. Maybe $URL$ is what you are looking for. They construct rigorously the DM-compactification as an analytic space and explain how to interpret it in terms of Teichm√ºller theory. The combinatorial structure of the Deligne-Mumford boundary is easiest explained in terms of dual graphs. To define the dual graph of a nodal Riemann surface with some marked smooth points, draw a vertex for each irreducible component of the Riemann surface. Usually you decorate each vertex $v$ with the genus of the compnent, $g(v)$. For each marked point you draw a half-edge at the vertex where it is attached. For each node you draw an edge (two half-edges) connecting the components given by the branches at the node (so you might have loops in the dual graph). Define $n(v)$ as the number of half-edges incident to a vertex $v$. Finally define the genus of the dual graph as $b_1 + \sum_v g(v)$, where $b_1$ is the first Betti number of the graph. Then the strata of $\overline{M}_{g,n}$ correspond bijectively to isomorphism classes of dual graphs of genus $g$ with exactly $n$ "legs" (half-edges which are not part of an edge). If $\Gamma$ is a dual graph, then the stratum is given by the quotient $$ \left(\prod_{v \in \mathrm{Vert}(\Gamma)} M_{g(v),n(v)}\right)\big/\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma),$$ where $ \mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ is the finite group of automorphisms of the graph. This means that understanding the strata amounts to the same as understanding the moduli spaces of smooth curves. A lot of the combinatorial structure of the boundary becomes transparent in this language. For instance the gluing maps between different moduli spaces become here just the operation of fusing two half-edges into an edge. 

Let $\Gamma_g$ be the mapping class group of a closed oriented surface $\Sigma$ of genus $g$. There is a natural surjection $t \colon \Gamma_g \to \mathrm{Sp}(2g,\mathbf Z)$ which sends a mapping class to the induced action on $H^1(\Sigma,\mathbf Z)$. Composing $t$ with any representation of the symplectic group produces a large number of linear representations of $\Gamma_g$. These are only a small fraction of all representations of the mapping class groups. Others can for instance be obtained from 3D TQFTs or by from different constructions involving lower central series. My question is however whether the symplectic representations are the only ones that can be defined "algebro-geometrically". Let me ask a more concrete question. A representation of $\Gamma_g$ is the same as a local system on the moduli space of curves of genus $g$, $M_g$. For a representation which factors through $\mathrm{Sp}(2g,\mathbf Z)$ this local system underlies a polarized variation of Hodge structure, since it is pulled back from a PVHS on the Shimura variety parametrizing principally polarized abelian varieties of genus $g$. Is the converse true - if a local system (say with $\mathbf Q$ coefficients) on $M_g$ underlies a PVHS, is it isomorphic to one of the symplectic local systems? 

Let $(x_{ij})$ be an $n \times n$ matrix, and define $p(T_1,\ldots,T_n) = \det (x_{ij} - \delta_{ij}T_i)$. Let $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$ be the eigenvalues of $(x_{ij})$ counted with algebraic multiplicity. The problem is to find a "reasonable" general formula for $$ \prod_{\sigma \in \mathfrak{S}_n} p(\lambda_{\sigma(1)},\ldots,\lambda_{\sigma(n)}).$$ For example, when $n=1$ this expression vanishes identically. When $n=2$ one gets $x_{12}x_{21}\Delta$, where $\Delta = (\lambda_1-\lambda_2)^2$ is the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial. A conceptual way of seeing that this is the right answer for $n=2$ is that the formula must vanish on all lower or upper triangular matrices, and when the eigenvalues coincide all factors of the product vanish.
