In the study of convexity and convex polyhedra there are three (related) important notions of duality 1) Polar duality This is a map assigning to every convex set $K$ containing the origin its polar dual: $K^*$ which is the set of all points whose inner product with every point in $K$ is at most 1. On polytopes it induces an order reversing map on the face lattices. This operation has subtle relations to mirror-symmetry and Koszul duality. Web sources (1; 2; 3; 4) 2) Gale transform This is an operation to move from n points in $R^d$ to n points in $R^k$ where k=n-d-1. It is especially useful if the original n points are in convex position to study the convex polytope they define. (Web-sources: 1, 2; 3; 4) 3) Linear programming duality This is an operation to move from a linear programming problem to a dual problem which have the same solution. (We sources: 1; 2; 3;) 

The following graph theoretic notion appeared in an economics paper entitled: "Prize competition under limited comparability, by Michele Piccione and Ran Spiegler which studies models of economics were the firms are rational but the consumers are not. A graph is weighted-regular if vertices (nodes) can be assigned positive weights, such that each node has the same total weighted-expected-number of edges (links). Every regular graph is, of course, weighted regular (give all vertices weight 1). A star, tree with center vertex connected to k leaves is weighted-regular: Give the center weight 1 and every leaf weight 1/k. (In the paper, every vertex is also contained in a loop. Therefore its weight also counts when we compute its weighted-expected-number of edges. The star is still weighted-regular: give weight 1 to the center and weight 0 to the leafs.) Is there a characterization of weighted-regular graphs? Is this notion known? Does it have known applications or connections? 

I want to consider the following problem, which generalises the decision problem to decide if a given finite permutation group is a Frobenius group: 

The property that the digraph is Eulerian gives that the automaton is strongly connected, and the common value of the outdegree and the indegree equals the size of the alphabet. So, if we denote the state set by $Q$, the alphabet by $\Sigma$ and the state transition function by $\delta : Q \times \Sigma \to Q$, then as the digraph is Eulerian we have for $T \subseteq Q$ and with $\delta^{-1}(T, x) := \{ q \in Q : \delta(q, x) \in T \}$ for $x \in \Sigma$ that $$ \sum_{x \in \Sigma} |\delta^{-1}(T, x)| = |\Sigma||T|. $$ because these are two ways to count the number of incoming edges. Now this gives that for every $T \subseteq Q$ we have exactly one of the two cases $$ \forall x \in \Sigma : |\delta^{-1}(T, x)| = |T| \qquad \mbox{or} \qquad \exists x \in \Sigma : |\delta^{-1}(T, x)| > |T|. $$ This observation might be of help. The above statement written more formal: 

Every finite abelian group is the direct product of its cyclic groups of prime order, and every commutative monoid divides a product of its cyclic submonoids. Could these results generalized to locally commutative semigroups? Here a semigroup is called locally commutative if for every idempotent $e \in S$ the semigroup $eSe$ is commutative. 

Let $X = \{ 0, 1 \}$ and $X^{\mathbb N_0} = \{ x_0 x_1 x_2 \ldots : x_i \in X \}$ be the space of all infinite sequences, then a metric could be defined on it $$ d(u,v) := \frac{1}{2^r} \mbox{ with } r := \min\{ n : u_n \ne v_n \}. $$ Here $d(u,v) < \frac{1}{2^n}$ iff $u,v$ coincide in their first $n$ symbols. Regarding to this metric we have: 

The question Let $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$ be a sequence whose entries are +1 or -1. Let t be a parameter. My question is to give an estimate for the number of such sequences so that 

(a) What is the computational complexity of GI, is an example of a major question that we genuinely did not know the answer to even on a heuristic or conjectural level. Even now, whether GI is in P is everybody's guess. Of course, the new result gives some support for the possibility that GI is in P and the methods may be relevant for attacking it. (b) We don't know even if GI belongs to coNP and proving this will also be a major breakthrough. Again, the new result gives some support to GI being in coNP. Here, it is (I think) a clear computational-theoretic expectation, given the derandomization view on randomness in complexity, that GI is in coNP, but, even so, it is much beyond any derandomization that can be proved. Again, the methods of the new proof may be relevant. (c) The quasipolynomial algorithm for GI is, by itself, an off-scale scientific achievement. One important application would be to support the wide (while not universal) claim that "If it is easy in practice theory will follow." An earlier example of this was the fact (proved in 1979) that LP is in P. (Another insight from LP yet to be tested in this case is that "If it is easy in theory, practical fruits will follow".) (d) There are various computational questions about permutation groups, groups, and group representation that the new breakthrough may be relevant to. It can certainly lead to much activity, interest and progress in computational questions for groups. (e) That that hidden subgroup problem is so much more general/difficult than GI is a clear insight of the new result. There were some earlier indications for that but it was far from being clear, even on a conjectural/heuristic level. 

In his classic textbook Foundations of the Theory of Probability Kolmogorov defines Independence a little bit differenent then it is usually done today. He denotes a probability space by $(E, \mathcal F, P)$, on page 9 he wrote: 

Two infinite words $\xi, \eta \in X^{\omega}$ are separated by an (Büchi-)automaton if it accepts one but not the other. Denote by $F_n(\xi)$ the factors of length $n$ of an infinite word $\xi$ and also by $F_n^{\infty}(\xi)$ the factors of length $n$ that occur infinitely often. Define two equivalence relations on words: $$ \xi \sim_k \eta \mbox{ iff } \xi[1\ldots k] = \eta[1\ldots k] \land F_k(\xi) = F_k(\eta) $$ and $$ \xi \sim_k^{\infty} \eta \mbox{ iff } \xi[1\ldots k] = \eta[1\ldots k] \land F_k^{\infty}(\xi) = F_k^{\infty}(\eta). $$ Now I am interested in two questions: 1) If for two infinite words $\xi \sim_k \eta$, i.e. their prefix and factors of length $k$ coincide, what is the size of the minimal automata separating them, and 2) if for two infinite words $\xi \sim_k^{\infty} \eta$, what is the minimum size of an automata separating them? For i) I believe there is no interesting relationship, cause consider $\xi_i = 0^i 1 0^{\omega}$ and $\eta_i = (0^i1)^{\omega}$ then $\xi_i \sim_i \eta_i$ for all $i$ and they could always be separated by a two-state automata which stays in the first state as long as it read $0$'s, switches to the second state on the first $1$, and then stays there as long as just $0$'s are read, so accepting $\xi_i$ but not $\eta_i$. This lead me to consider the second equivalence relation. Here for example $\eta_i = (0^i1)^{\omega}$ and $\xi_i = 0^i100^i1000^i1\ldots$, then $\xi_i \sim^{\infty}_i \eta$ and I guess the minimal automata needed to separate them has $i+2$ states, reading $0$'s in the first state, switch to second state on first $1$, and then a loop which counts the $0$'s (need $i$ states for the loop) and goes back to the second state if $i$ $0$'s are followed by a $1$, so passing the second state an infinite number of times. This automata accepts $\eta_i$ but not $\xi_i$. Are there any lower bounds on the size of an automata separating two words with $\xi \sim_k^{\infty} \eta$? Added: A finite automata accepts an infinite word according to the Büchi-condition if there is a prescribes set of states such that the infinite words enters some state of this set an infinite number of times, see Wikipedia. 

One source I found over the Internet is Information System on Graph Classes and their Inclusions. There you can find a page devoted to comparability graphs, complements of comperability graphs (a.k.a (XF12n+3,XF52n+3,XF62n+2,Cn+6,T2,X2,X3,X30,X31,X32,X33,X34,X35,X36,co-XF2n+1,co-XF3n,co-XF4n,odd-hole)-free graphs), and graphs which are comparability $\cap$ co-comparability. This class coincides with six other classes which are equivalent but are defined differently. Overall, it looks that it is best to consider the above classes of graphs in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs. 

I was especially interested (for polymath5 purposes) in the value of $K=K(n)$ for which this probability is $2^{-n/\log n}$. The answer to this specific query is thus $K=C\sqrt{\log n}$ for a suitable $C$. 

This is a famous problem known as the "Dedekind Problem", and it was posed by Dedekind in 1897. The Wikipedea article has some information. There have been remarkable progress on understanding the asymptotic value of M(n) the number of antichains of sets from {1,2,...,n}. (This paper of Kleitman gives some of the history, and this paper by Kahn gives an updated history.) While $2^{{n}\choose {n/2}}$ is an obvious lower bound there is a beatiful 1966 proof by Hansel for the upperbound $3^{{n}\choose {n/2}}$. Kleitman & Markowsky (1975). gave the asymptotic behavior of $\log M(n)$. They showed that $log M(n)$ behave asumptotically like ${{n} \choose {n/2}}$. The paper by Kahn that we already mentioned gives a simpler entropy based proof. Amazingly, the asymptotic behavior of M(n) itself was discovered as well. in 1981, Korshunov , using an extremely complicated approach, gave asymptotics for M(n) itself. Simpler, though still difficult, arguments for Korshunov's and some related results were later given by Sapozhenko. (See eg this book.) Sapozhenko's method turned out to be very important, e.g., in the result by Galvin and Kahn on the threshold behavior of the d-dimensional hard core model.
