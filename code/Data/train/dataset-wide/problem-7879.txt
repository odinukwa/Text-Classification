Some background (not needed to answer the question): For factorizations using the Number Field Sieve, one would construct 2 polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ such that $f(m)\equiv g(m) \equiv 0$ (mod $N$) for some $m$. Usually, one of the polynomial will be of degree 1, the other ranging from 2 to 8 for practical purposes. There exists methods to construct 2 polynomials of similar degree, such that both are non-linear. The problem stated essentially gives one a way to construct 2 cubic polynomials. This method may have some advantages over the traditional linear case. Note that the problem do not ask how can one find the actual geometric progression, as that is believed to be hard and at the same time an open problem. Motivation: I am posting this problem as the sources I read suggests that such series do exist by "counting argument". The part I am wondering about is: how does the counting argument work? Initial Thoughts If I may humbly present some of my naive ideas: We start off with $2*N^{2/3}$ possibilities for the first term $a$. Next, since we seek a second term $b$ bounded by $O(N^{2/3})$, we similarly allow $2*N^{2/3}$ possibilities for it. However, this fixes the common ratio $r=ba^{-1}$ (mod $N$), whence we have no control over the 3rd, 4th and 5th terms. We reason that such an $r$ must exist for each pair of $\lbrace a,ar \rbrace$, as failure would imply that $a^{-1}$ does not exist, which implies that we have found a factor of $N$. If we were to assume that the effect of multiplying by $r$ (mod $N$) results in a random permutation of the integer, the 3rd, 4th and 5th terms each have $(2*N^{2/3})/(2*N)=N^{1/3}$ chance of being bounded by $O(N^{2/3})$. This gives us a grand total of $2*N^{2/3}*2*N^{2/3}/(N^{1/3})^3=4*N^{1/3}$ valid series. Suppose this line of thought holds, the difficult part is to account for determinant not zero. (This is stated as to ensure the series is not a second-order linear recurrence over $\mathbb{Q}$, which is a requirement for the Number Field Sieve to work.) It is clear that if the series is of the form $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} ar^4&ar^3&ar^2\\\\ ar^3&ar^2&ar\\\\ ar^2&ar&a \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$ with $ar^4 < N^{2/3}$, such that no modulo reduction happens, the determinant is zero by default. So in some sense the series "must exceed $N$ at some point". My guess is that if we remove all series without the modulo reduction then the remaining probability presumably will tell us that the geometric progression should exist. Is my argument sound? How does one go about counting the series to remove? 

If I am not mistaken there is a theorem that says any curve $C$ can be embedded in $\mathbf{P}^3$. What can be said about surfaces? Do we have a theorem like: 

I think everyone is familiar with Goedel's incompleteness theorems. In particular they imply that PA (Peano arithmetic) can not prove its own consistency. Now my question is what is the largest subsystem of PA that "can" prove its own consistency? You definitely can't have the induction axiom but is that enough? 

I am wondering what are the prerequisites for being a modern geometer? It seems that the amount you have to know is just huge: differential geometry, differential topology, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, ... and then there is all kinds of overlap. So my question is the following: what should you know (from the topics I mentioned and the topics that I forgot) to call yourself a geometer (lets say by the time you get your Ph.D.)? And where are the best books/articles covering all that? 

Some context: $A$ is a generalized Cartan matrix, $\frak h_{\mathbb{R}}$ is a real form of the Cartan subalgebra in the Kac-Moody algebra associated to $A$ and finally $X$ is the Tits cone. Question: if one reads the proof given by Kac, it is written for $X$ and not $\overline{X}$. Is there a mistake or am I missing something here? 

Recently I was watching a talk: $URL$ and at the end the lecturer gave a correspondence (I was having trouble with subscripts so changed the notation a bit): $$ \mathfrak{Q} (\lambda, \mu) \Leftrightarrow \mathfrak{M} (\lambda, \mu)$$ Between Quiver varieties and slices of affine Grassmannian. I would like to learn how this exactly works (like precise definition of both objects is a start!). If you have the time and the patience you can post a lengthy response here or you could just point me towards the right place to start reading on my own. Thank you! 

EDIT: corrected a mathematical mistake pointed out by Jim Humphreys, also improved the format as to make things more visible. Again suggested by Jim Humphreys. 

Let $V$ be a normed infinite dimensional vector space. Let $L: V \longrightarrow V$ be a bounded linear operator. Moreover assume that $L$ is 'locally nilpotent' that is: $$ \forall v \in V \quad \exists n \in \mathbf{N}: L^n (v) = 0. $$ Now my question is if the linear operator: $$ \exp (L) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{L^n}{n!} $$ is bounded or not. 

It is well known that all symmetric group can be generated using two generators The two generators are: 1) $(1,2)$ 2) $(1,2,3,\dots ,n)$ 

It is easy to generate all of them without repetition using $n-1$ generators, by the Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm. It is easy to generate all of them, with repetition, using two generators. However I was unable to find a way to generate all without repetition and using only two generators. As this approach seems natural, I suspect someone should have worked on it but I was unable to find any references online. Does anyone knows the status of this problem? 

Hi! I have a proposed answer for 2). You can construct an infinite series of counter examples. Erdos proved that there are primes between $n$ and $2n$. Now consider $2n=2^k$ for some $k>2$. We can observe that the binomial number $\binom{2n+1}{r}, 1< r < n+1$ is always even. The upper product have powers of 2 as the following sequence: $\lbrace k,1,2,1,3,\dots,s \rbrace$ while the bottom product have powers of 2 of the form: $\lbrace 1,2,1,3,\dots,s,k-1\rbrace$. This can be reflected for cases $\binom {2n+1}{r}, n < r < 2n$. The difference of the sum of these 2 sequences is at least 1. As a result, the binomial number may be divisible by $p$ but it will not be even. (Edit) Exception: When the binomial number is $\binom{2n+1}{1}$ or $\binom{2n+1}{2n}$ you have either no powers of 2 or same powers of 2. But in this case it will not be divisible by $p$. 

Inria has published a paper factoring 50-200 bits integers. The four methods of choice are: SQUFOF, ECM, SIQS and CFRAC. Within the paper a short pseudocode is given for each method, so you may be able to judge whether they will suit your computation restrictions. From their experiments, SQUFOF is indeed the fastest up to $2^{60}$ range, where it is tied against SIQS. Note that these experiments are done on integers known to have few prime factors (Something like 2-4). For your case, it appears that you are factoring random integers up to $2^{60}$. Hence, except for ECM, it is more efficient to trial factor small primes up to a certain bound. (See comments below on the case for ECM) One additional point: ECM (specifically GMP-ECM, also from Inria) might be a good idea since the software is highly optimized. (With a research team coding it for a few years) On the other hand, the arithmetic is done modulo $N$. This might mean that there will be overflow during the multiplication steps. If you choose ECM, I can elaborate a little more. A common problem is the fact that ECM is probabilistic. This can be resolved if you know which curves to choose to cover all the prime factors. Inria has also published its work on this area, showing that 124 carefully chosen curves finds all prime factors up to $2^{32}$. The numbers are quite suitable for your case. Statistically speaking though, you find the factors with probability around 0.15 per curve, so usually 20 curves will do the job. As mentioned earlier, using these parameters you can skip the trial factorization part. During the search for bigger primes, you will also find the smaller ones in the process. If you want to push the efficiency even higher, the optimal approach is to first do a filtering based on $P-1$ and $P+1$ factorization method, followed by the actual ECM. This is a little tougher since you need to calibrate the parameters correctly. EDIT: Did not notice that all numbers are of the form $x^3-y^3$ with $ 0 < y < x < 50000 $. There are about $50000^2/2=2^{36.86}$ possibilities. Out of all these, a portion will be primes. A portion will be smooth with factors $< B$ for some $B$ that can be easily trial divided. The remain cases are composites with primes $> B$. Suppose you have $n$ remaining entries. Sort them in the following format, by $N_i$: $N_i L_i$, where $N_i$ is the entry's value, each a composite of factors $> B$, and $L_i$ is the offset to find the factorization. At offset $L_i$, store the distinct prime factors (may choose not to store multiplicity by doing trial division). Each time you get a number: 1) Do primality test 2) Do trial division 3) Do another primality test 4) If residue remains, do a binary search on the factorization I think this should be able to handle your 4 million factorization. Clearly there are more ways to tweak the method, but the idea here is you can do a one time computation and store the difficult computations as a look up table. 

This is not my area but a question occurred to me that I can not find the answer to. There is a very strong axiom of constructibility which ironically gives us highly non-constructive math (GCH is one of its implications). What would be an equally strong axiom in the opposite direction? And I mean direction in a philosophical sense, so what would be the strongest axiom that constructivists/intuitionists would approve of? My first idea was to find the largest $\kappa$ such that $2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_{\kappa}$ is consistent with ZF but this set is unbounded ($\kappa$ can be any finite number) and $2^{\aleph_0} < \aleph_{\omega}$. Which brings up the question, how much fundamental difference are there between CH and $2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_{118}$ for example? 

The universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is isomorphic to the algebra of distributions on the Lie group $G$ with support at the identity. The proof I have of this fact uses the universal property of the universal enveloping algebra and hence it is not constructive. I was wondering if there is an explicit map? For example what would happen for $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbf{C})$ and $G = SL(2, \mathbf{C})$? For an explicit monomial in $\mathscr{U} \ \left ( \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbf{C}) \right )$ can we write the corresponding distribution and how it acts on functions on $SL(2, \mathbf{C})$? 

A GCM is square matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ satisfying: (1) $a_{ij} \in \mathbf{Z}$ (2) $a_{ii} = 2$ for all $i$. (3) $a_{ij} \leq 0$ for $i \neq j$. (4) $a_{ij} = 0$ iff $a_{ji} = 0$. There is a standard notion of irreducibility among GCMs and the common term for it is "indecomposable". Now if you look at most books there is a standard basic classification of GCMs: An indecomposable GCM is of 3 kinds: finite, affine and another category which can be described as all-other-GCMs-that-I-know-little-about-so-I-will-bundle-them-together. There is also another classification based on whether the GCM is "symmetrizable" or not (the finite and affine GCMs are symmetric and hence symmetrizable). What I am looking for is a smart classification of the GCMs that are not finite or affine. For example here is a number of questions: 

And if not what is the simplest counterexample? A counterexample would be an infinite sequence of surfaces: $\{S_1, S_2, \cdots \}$ and infinite sequence of strictly increasing positive integers: $\{n_1, n_2, \cdots \}$ such that $S_i$ can not be embedded in $\mathbf{P}^{n_i}$. 

Are you running computer experiments to verify conjectures? If so, the GAP SmallGroups library will give you exactly what you want up to $n = 1023$. For example, the GAP commands 

Assuming $d>1$: If a simplicial complex $\Delta$ has a Morse matching with critical cells in dimensions 0 and $d$, then $\Delta$ is homotopy equivalent to a CW-complex with cells corresponding to the critical cells. A CW-complex is built up inductively by gluing $i$ cells along their (entire) boundary to the $i-1$ skeleton (see Hatcher). The $d-1$ skeleton consists of a set of disjoint vertices. There is no continuous map from $S^{d-1}$ to $S^0$, so each $d$ cell attaches to a single vertex. It now reduces to the case of a single vertex, where you're exactly attaching some number (possibly 0) of $d$-discs along their entire boundary to a point, giving either a bouquet of $d$-spheres or (in the case of 0 discs) a point. (If $d=1$, then one exactly gets a graph, which is also homotopy equivalent to a disjoint union of bouquets of 1-spheres plus isolated vertices by e.g. Hatcher.) References. The first explicit statement of Morse matchings in terms of acyclic matchings of the face poset that I know of is 

At a fairly non-detailed level, the Simons Foundation has a nice article on the subject, which I understand has also been picked up by Wired: $URL$ To summarize very briefly, he is building on work by Goldston, Pintz, and Yıldırım. The article describes his innovation as "... to use not the GPY sieve but a modified version of it, in which the sieve filters not by every number, but only by numbers that have no large prime factors." A lot of smart people were working very hard on this problem, and surely the overview article makes it sound a lot easier than it actually was! But the article does make one feel one understands a little of the overview or "philosophy" of the proof. 

Many finite simple groups are known to be (2,3)-generated, and this condition has been well-studied. ((2,3)-generated groups can be represented as quotients of $PSL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, explaining the high level of interest in this condition.) A. Liebeck and Shalev in "Classical groups, probabilistic methods, and the (2,3)-generation problem" showed that, excluding the groups $PSp_4(q)$, all but finitely many of the classical groups are (2,3)-generated. B. Di Martino and Cazzola in "$(2,3)$-generation of $PSp(4,q),\ q=p^n,\ p\neq 2,3$" showed that $PSp_4(q)$ is (2,3)-generated, except in characteristic 2 or 3. C. Malle, and Lübeck and Malle in a series of papers culminating in "(2,3)-generation of exceptional groups" show that all exceptional groups of Lie type are (2,3)-generated, except for the Suzuki groups and $G(2)' \cong PSU_2(9)$. (Nick Gill also referenced this paper in his comment to Alireza's answer.) D. Woldar in "On Hurwitz generation and genus actions of sporadic groups" showed the sporadic groups to be (2,3)-generated, except for $M_{11}$, $M_{22}$, $M_{23}$, and $McL$ E. GA Miller proved in 1901 that the alternating groups $A_n$ are (2,3)-generated for $n \neq 6,7,8$. $A_6, A_7, A_8$ are easily verified to all be (2,5)-generated. Liebeck and Shalev in Proposition 6.4 of the same paper referenced above show that all but finitely many of the groups $PSp_4(2^n)$ and $PSp_4(3^n)$ are (2,5)-generated. Suzuki, in his original paper on the topic, showed that the Suzuki groups are (2,4)-generated. For the remaining sporadics, $M_{11}$ and $M_{22}$ are (2,4)-generated, while $M_{23}$ and $McL$ are (2,5)-generated. (The best place I found to read about this is in a series of papers on symmetric genus of groups. These papers are by various authors, frequently including Conder and Woldar.)
