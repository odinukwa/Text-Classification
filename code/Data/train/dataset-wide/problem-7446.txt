For $\deg P>2$, there will rarely be any solutions. At the risk of confusion, I'm going to rename some variables: Our given solution to Pell's equation is $a^2 - d b^2 =1$, and our goal is to find integer polynomials $A(x)$, $B(x)$ and $D(x)$ such that $A(x)^2 - D(x) B(x)^2 = 1$ and $(A(0), B(0), D(0)) = (a,b,d)$. The degree of $A$ is $n$. (As Leonardo observes, we can always translate $x$ to assume the polynomials are being evaluated at $0$.) Cleaning up some of Leonardo's formulas, we get that $$(A(x), B(x), D(x)) = (T_{n}(\alpha (x+ \beta)), \ \gamma U_{n-1}(\alpha (x+\beta)), \ \gamma^{-2} (\alpha^2 (x + \beta)^2 - 1))$$ for some constants $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$, where $T_n$ and $U_{n-1}$ are Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds. Note the formula $T_n(x)^2 - (x^2-1) U_{n-1}(x)^2=1$. Taking the ratio of the $x^2$ and $x$ terms in $D(x)$, we see that $\beta$ is rational. The $x^n$ and $x^{n-2}$ terms in $A(x)$ are $2^{n-1} \alpha^n$ and $\alpha^{n-2} (n 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} \binom{n}{2} \beta \alpha^2 )$. Taking the ratio of these, we deduce that $n 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} \binom{n}{2} \beta \alpha^2$ is rational, so $\alpha^2$ is rational. For any given $n$, the equation $T_n(\alpha \beta) = a$ determines $\alpha \beta$ up to finitely many values. But we have also seen that $(\alpha \beta)^2$ is rational. But, for generic $a$, the Galois group of $T_n(x) = a$ should be dihedral of order $2n$, by Hilbert's irreducibility theorem. I suspect that you might be able to get solutions whenever $a$ happens to be of the form $T_n(\sqrt{m})$ for some $m$ and some Chebyshev polynomial $T_n$, but I haven't thought it through carefully. 

Now for the reverse bound. This argument is closely based on the proof of Fekete's Theorem here. (The original paper is here, but I don't speak German so I haven't checked whether they are the same argument.) Our first goal is to establish the following: Let $r < 1$. There exists a nonzero polynomial $q(u)$ with integer coefficients so that $|q(u)|<1$ on the circle $|u-\tau|<r$. Choose an integer $T$ large enough that, for any $N > T$, we have $$r^N + (1/2) r^{N-1} + (1/2) r^{N-2} + \cdots + (1/2) r^{T+1} + (1/2) r^T < 1/3.$$ Take $N$ larger than $T$. Define $q^N_N(u) = (u-\tau)^N$. Define $q^N_i(u)$ to be the unique polynomial of the form $$q^N_i(u) = q^N_{i+1}(u) + \theta_i \cdot (u-\tau)^{i}$$ so that $|\theta_i| \leq 1/2$ and the coefficient of $u^{i}$ in $q^N_i$ is an integer. Set $q^N(u) = q^N_T(u)$. So the coefficient of $u^k$ in $q^N(u)$ is an integer for $T \leq k \leq N$. For $u$ on the circle $|u-\tau|=r$, we get $$|q^N_T(u)| \leq r^N + (1/2) r^{N-1} + \cdots + (1/2) r^T < 1/3.$$ Let $(c^N_{T-1}, C^N_{T-2}, \ldots, c^T_0)$ be the last $T$, noninteger, coefficients of $q^N$. By the Pigeonhole principle, we can find $q^M$ and $q^N$ so that $$\sum_i |\{ c^N_i - c^M_i \}| r^i < 1/3$$ where $\{ x \}$ is the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer. We define $q(u)$ to be the result of taking $q^N(u) - q^M(u)$ and rounding the last $T$ coefficients to the nearest integer. We have now constructed $q$. We now undo the above argument. Since $|q(u)|<1$ for $|u-\tau|<r$, we have $|q(1/(1-z))|<1$ on the disc with diameter $(1-(\tau+r)^{-1}, 1-(\tau-r)^{-1})$. This contains the circle of radius $\tau^{-1} - \delta_1$ about $0$, where $\delta_1 \to 0$ as $r \to 1$. So Noam's argument constructs infinitely many polynomials bounded by $(\tau+\delta_2)^n$. 

Some brief literature searches suggest that little has changed since that statement was written in 2008. So you are probably out of luck to prove this result. 

I am a mathematician who finds countable choice more intuitive than arbitrary choice. I'll try to explain my intuition, although I fully admit it is not rigorous. Let $S_{n}$ be a sequence of nonempty sets, indexed by integers. There is some element $s_1$ in $S_1$. There is some element $s_2$ in $S_2$, so there is an element $(s_1, s_2)$ in $S_1 \times S_2$. There is some element $s_3$ in $S_3$, so there is an element $(s_1, s_2, s_3)$ in $S_1 \times S_2 \times S_3$. For any fixed integer $n$, I can use this logic to write down an element of $S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_n$. My intuition says that I can take the limit of this process as $n \to \infty$. Sure, it becomes an infinite process, but I can just think of that as "keep doing this, forever". I can even think of Achilles choosing an element of $S_i$ in time $2^{-i}$, so that I don't have to imagine infinite time. The axiom of countable choice makes my hazy intuition precise. Now, suppose that $S_a$ is a family of sets indexed by $a$ in an uncountable set $A$. Then, even after making infinitely many choices, I still have only chosen an representatives from a minute fraction of the $S_a$ from which I must choose. Even if $A$ can be well-ordered, it can't be embedded in $\mathbb{R}$ in a well-ordered way, which means I can't think of my choices taking place at specific times. I find that disquieting. 

One must then check that this constituent lies in the symmetric parts of the tensor powers, which is probably most easily done by pointing out that the $k \times k$ minors of a symmetric matrix give a nonzero $GL(V)$ equivariant map $(\bigwedge^k V)^{\otimes 2} \longrightarrow (S^2 V)^{\otimes k}$. Write weights as partitions $(\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n)$, so $S^2 V$ has height weight $(2,0,0,\ldots,0)$ and $\bigwedge^k V$ has highest weight $(\overbrace{1,1,\ldots,1}^k,0,0,\ldots,0)$. Tensoring with $S^k V$ and with $\bigwedge^k V$ is described by the Pieri rule and its transpose. From the Pieri rule, any irreducible constituent $V_{\lambda}$ of $(S^2 V)^{\otimes k}$ has $\sum \lambda_i=2k$ and $\lambda_{k+1} = \lambda_{k+2} = \cdots = \lambda_n=0$. From the transpose of the Pieri rule, any $V_{\lambda}$ in $(\bigwedge^k V)^{\otimes 2}$ has all $\lambda_i \leq 2$. The only way to satisfy these conditions is $\lambda = (\overbrace{2,2,\ldots,2}^k,0,0,\ldots,0)$. More generally, the only common constituent of $(S^{\ell} V)^{\otimes k}$ and $(\bigwedge^k V)^{\otimes \ell}$ is the representation of highest weight $\ell \alpha_k$. It is definitely in $S^{\ell} (\bigwedge^k V)$. If $\ell$ is even, then it is in $S^k(S^{\ell} V)$, otherwise it is in $\bigwedge^k (S^\ell V)$. 

I hesitate to call this an answer, since it is based on no actual experience, but I would make three points: (1) It is not clear to me that you have no use for a publisher. Publishers work to promote your book to libraries, book stores and to faculty looking for a textbook. They also may be willing to pay you an advance on your future royalties, which would opportunity risk of missing other forms of income by writing a textbook. I also would not assume that book publishers would not provide useful editing if you wanted it. You might be interested in Cory Doctorow's thoughts on the benefits of working with traditional publishers. Doctorow is a fiction writer and essayist who distributes all of his work under a very permissive CC license. Fiction isn't textbooks, of course, but I think there are some interesting ideas here. (2) If your goal is to print copies of a PDF file with no professional editing, Lulu has a good reputation for that sort of thing. I have no personal experience with them, and the people I do know who have experience were printing fiction and prose, not math, so take that for what it is worth. (3) The obvious person for you to talk to Allen Hatcher. His Algebraic Topology textbook is freely available for download, but is also sold in hard copy by Cambridge University Press (and is very good!). 

The following is the record of an incorrect solution, left as a warning to others. Let $A$ be the subvariety of all three planes which are of the form $u \wedge v \wedge w$ where $u$ and $v$ are in $\mathrm{Span}(e_1, e_2, e_3)$ and $w$ is in $\mathrm{Span}(e_4, e_5, e_6)$. Let $B$ be the similar subvariety where I switch the roles of $123$ and $456$. It is easy to show that $[A]-[B]$, in $H^4(MG(3,6))$, is orthogonal to the classes obtained by restriction from $G(3,6)$. This would suggest that $[A]-[B]$ is our missing class. Unfortunately, it turns out that $[A]-[B]=0$. Proof: Let $S$, in $G(3,6)$, be the locus of those $3$-planes which meet $\mathrm{Span}(e_1,e_2,e_3)$ in dimension $2$. Then $S \cap MG(3,6)=A$, and the intersection is transverse. Let $T$ be those $3$-planes which similarly meet $\mathrm{Span}(e_4,e_5,e_6)$; so $B=T \cap MG(3,6)$. But $S$ and $T$ are homologous in $G(3,6)$, so $A$ and $B$ are homologous in $MG(3,6)$. Grrrr...
