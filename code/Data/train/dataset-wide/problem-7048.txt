Assuming your home is safe, would you keep your money in a bank that only gave 96% of it back? (-4% interest rate) What if your home has mice which eat exactly 10% of your money? Would you then keep your money in the bank that only returns 96%? And finally, what if every bill has a 10% chance of being eaten? This means that in expected value you lose 10% of your money. In the above situations, what would be the lowest interest rate you would accept from the bank? 

As the companies doing the production will minimize costs in equilibrium $$ \begin{align*} |MRTS_c(K_c,L_c)| & = r/w \\ \\ |MRTS_w(K_w,L_w)| & = r/w \end{align*} $$ will hold. (Or you can also use the general form of your equations (1),(2),(5) and (6) to get this.) Given your particular production functions the marginal rates of technical substitution are $$ \begin{align*} |MRTS_c(K_c,L_c)| & = \frac{L_c}{K_c} \\ \\ |MRTS_w(K_w,L_w)| & = \frac{L_w}{K_w}. \end{align*} $$ Taken together, this means $$ \frac{L_c}{K_c} = r/w = \frac{L_w}{K_w}. $$ It follows that $$ L_c + L_w = (K_c + K_w) \cdot r/w. $$ The total amount of Labor and Capital are given in your exercise, and these will determine the factor price ratios as well as the $L_c/K_c = L_w/K_w$ ratio. Once you plug those in, your equation system will become linear. Notice that this is true both in autarky and in free trade equilibrium, we have not used demand functions so far at all. Setting the appropriate demand equal to the appropriate production will give you the remaining equations you need to determine the equilibrium price ratio. 

Elasticities tell economists how responsive changes in price are to changes in quantity, and this is useful because it tells you whether revenue will increase or decrease. Suppose you are the owner if a firm that is interested in expanding. It will be more informative for you to know that if you expand your production by 20%, the prices of your products will decrease by only 10% than to know that if you produce two more units per week, the price will drop by $1.00. The first description is informative because it tells you whether your revenue will increase or not (in this case it will, because demand is price elastic), whereas the second is an absolute reference which requires further calculation in order to understand what it means for your business. 

Reading my development economics textbook, I was informed that the opportunity cost of a private investment is the market value of the wages, goods and services used for the investment. Here's a hypothetical situation: suppose that the firm could invest in an alternative project with the same amount of resources but a higher return. Would it not be myopic to overlook this alternative investment when asserting that the opportunity cost is the market value of inputs? It leads me to wonder why the inputs weren't valued higher. It could be because others in the market don't have access to capital, knowledge of the opportunity or the expertise required to make the investment. Still, why would the opportunity cost not be the income that could potentially be created from the alternative investment? Is a 'market value' approach just a simplification? 

Depends on what you mean by 'possible'. The liquor stores in your example could form a union, and collectively bargain with brands. Then if a brand breaks a contract with one of them, they all break the contract. This would greatly disincentivize the brands' strong arm practice. In my opinion this is unlikely to work (it is very hard to organize), but it is 'possible'. 

Printing money causes inflation because someone (or some institution) will get the money and will spend it somehow. This increases demand for goods, but the number of goods, the supply was not affected by printing money. Hence demand at the old price level is larger than supply at the old price level. Prices will rise until a new equilibrium is reached. The problem is that you seem to think that the N dollars you give to China would be gone. But it wouldn't be, the people who got it in China can now spend it in the US. They can import things, come as tourists, make investment purchases etc. This increases demand and results in inflation again. 

I would say it exhibits no returns to scale. What follows is a counter argument to the idea that it can exhibit returns to scale. A 'return to scale' means that production will change in response to a change in the input. A 'constant return to scale' is a straight-line function (or a portion thereof) including the origin (0, 0), with the input on the horizontal axis and the output on the vertical axis. That is, a directly proportional relationship. A 'decreasing return to scale' means that, as more and more of the input is used, production changes with a decreasing effect. This means that the graph will have a gradient that gets more and more flat as the input increases. An 'increasing return to scale' means that production changes with increasing effect as the input increases - a function who's gradient increases. In conclusion, if the input has no effect on production, there is no 'return' from the input. 

I would like to find out what goods are compared across countries in the International Comparison Programme in order to calculate purchasing power parities. I know there are possibly thousands of specific types of products that are looked at, but I just want to get an idea of what the products are or to look at a list of the products. Please link to the source. 

Source Am I being too superficial in my examination? Are there more subtle effects, such as a lagged effect due to the pension and elderly care systems? 

I am not sure what you mean by looking, but there is no equilibrium in this market, so any equilibrium analysis is impossible. Situations like this are possible. Consider the Titanic. Supply of lifeboat spaces are limited and do not change depending on the price. People are willing to pay any price. 

This means that price changes have been taken into consideration and so this income change is already corrected for any inflation. It is possible that a trade deal results in more disposable income, for a basic example see Ricardo's theory of comparative advantages. I can't say how this figure was arrived at by the paper because no explanation is given. 

Minimalist guesses ("here are some profiles with $n = 4$") are fine, ideal solution would provide a proof that $n$ is minimal. 

The book Why Nations Fail deals with the first question extensively. It is a highly acclaimed work (though personally I was not always convinced by their reasoning) by renowned economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. Their basic argument is that inclusive democratic institutions lead to greater growth because it safeguards business and economic interests of the people. Hence they see the biggest obstacle in undemocratic cultural traditions and lack of institutions. An argument I read somewhere (perhaps it was the Dictator's Handbook) is that developed countries prefer dictators in power to fledgling democracies in other countries. The reason is that fledgling democracies are not very stable, and that is bad for investment. Also dictators may be bribed more cheaply to disregard their people's best interest. (For example they may not implement environmental regulation for a price. The same may be said for democracies, but the price is usually higher.) In this way business interests in developed countries may directly contribute to dictatorships, which according Acemoglu and Robinson is what hinders economic growth. 

Investment is inversely proportional to the interest rate and savings is proportional to the interest rate, but if the quantity of savings increases, investment also increases according to the equation $I = S + T-G+M-X$. You can illustrate this by graphing the demand and supply of loanable funds on a 2-D plane (savings affects the supply of loanable funds), which shows how the two curves determine the real interest rate. 

I recommend Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, for this topic. I don't know what you mean by "the society." Diamond makes it clear that there are many different societies around the world, progressing at different rates. To answer your question about why we have what we have today and why individual societies developed in the direction they did: some technologies are inevitable, such as farming, writing and mettalurgy. What differs is that a few societies developed these technologies much earlier than others. Diamond lays out the reasons why; differences in intelligence across races is not a reason but the geology and biogeography of people's habitats are ultimate causual factors. These ultimate factors lead to more proximate factors such as animal and plant domestication, leading to denser and more sedentary populations with more complex political organization. Technological development led to further economic development, with most technology arising from it being spread from other societiesâ€”and that transmission depends again on geography. Eurasia had the advantage of an east-west axis that made transfer of domestic food and animal species easier (along the same lines of latitude and hence similar climes), and thus the technology which accompanies more sedentary societies. More isolated societies such as Australia did not benefit from the spread of technology, and hence remained a hunting-gathering society until European conquest. His book is entertaining and interesting to read. I've learnt facts and a perspective of the differences amongst races that I couldn't do without. 

It appears, like a lot of other math economics uses, this one was lifted from fluid dynamics. From Wikipedia: 

Suppose the Netherlands had its current population of 16 million people but only 14th century technology. I hope you'll agree that the value of whatever they produced would be significantly less than the value of their current production. Another comparison: The Indian economy is currently smaller (in terms of value) than the US economy despite the difference in population. The reason for this is that the US has much more capital in advanced technology. To address the question whether value is a good indication of size is good question: There are several arguments for this. Imagine that a country produces something that it consumes very little of (e.g. cash crops). In this case they will not care at all about the weight, volume etc. of their production, they will want to know how much they can sell it for so they can import other things. I would say in such a case value is much more relevant then other measures. Another example: 

I think the general name for it is 'being a charlatan'. Hypotheses need to be put forward before testing. This is unfortunately not common practice in economics, as we do not have trials like other disciplines. The commonly used historical data is frequently available in the secrecy of one's home, so no one can tell if I have already performed some tests on the data before putting my hypothesis forward. 

Re-order the equation. $U=x-\frac 1 y\\ x-U=\frac 1 y\\ y=\frac 1{x-U}$ I'm sure you know how to draw that graph: 

The straight-line supply and demand curves can be thought of as a magnification of this graph, where the two intersect. Thus, the units on the axes would give you a clue as to how high up the graph is being drawn, or how far to the right (if the units start at a number other than 0 or skip an interval). This shows you why they are indeed called 'curves', even when they are sometimes straight lines. Supply and demand curves are drawn using straight lines for simplicity. For example, two straight-line equations may be given, from which it is relatively simple to calculate the point of intersection. In the real world Supply and demand curves are an approximation of what happens in real life. The curves are a simplified model which show the general trend in the two functions. In reality, supply and demand curves are approximated using data that is collected over many years, with many short-term variables affecting the results, if the curves are even drawn up at all (the curves are more a theoretical model than a calculative method). Economic factors which affect supply and demand 

A public goods game is a generalization of the prisoners dilemma that could cover this. In a public goods game all players set their individual contribution level $x_i \in [0,\bar{x}]$ where $\bar{x}$ is a given positive parameter. Sometimes instead of an interval there are several discrete options to choose from. Player $i$'s payoff is defined as $$ - x_i + c \cdot \sum_{j = 1}^{n} x_j $$ where $c$ is a parameter such that $\frac{1}{n} < c < 1$. In these games it is individually rational to defect (set $x_i = 0$) but the Pareto optimal outcome is to cooperate (meaning $\forall i: x_i = \bar{x}$). Seems to me that you could adapt this to your problem by narrowing the range of $c$ to $\frac{1}{n} < c < \frac{1}{2}$. In this case a player would prefer even dual defection to himself having to cooperate. Of course these games do not cover the whole game class you described, by they are part of it, and there is a lot of literature on public goods games, though mostly in behavioral economics. 

The market value of the inputs are determined by the most lucrative possible investment opportunity. Yes, the concept of market value is a simplification. If your firm alone can make the investment then the market is not functioning in a competitive way and hence is unable to assign prices in an informative way. If other firms cannot make the same investment but they can at least make investments with similar returns then the market value of the inputs would still be informative. 

My guess is that the ''elasticity of substitution'' means something like$$\frac{\%\Delta K}{\% \Delta L}=\mathrm{mrs} \times\frac lk, $$ but that is dependant on what point you are at (i.e. a coordinate $(l, k)$). To get $\mathrm{mrs} $, find $\frac {\mathrm d k} {\mathrm d l} $, and even that is dependent on the value of $f$. 

Another reason why inflation needs to be positive is so that interest rates can be cut in a recession in order to stimulate spending. When interest rates get too low, an economy encounters a liquidity trap and further expansionary monetary policy cannot be implemented. 

, the best way for me to respond is to explain how prices are relative to incomes (as well as them being dependent on the state of technology in a country). There is an alternative answer in that it would be practically difficult to have a universal monetary policy. The reason why different currencies exist is because it is politically difficult to co-ordinate monetary policy across several countries, let alone the entire world. Because different countries have separate monetary systems, with different currencies, there end up being differences in how valuable each currency is. The value of a currency derives from how many goods and services that country trades with other countries (as says, "poor countries ... cannot produce enough valuable goods and services"). In everyday life, people are generally not affected by prices in other countries. If a Coke costs double in an overseas country, so what? You don't go there often, so it shouldn't concern you. However, as with your holiday, people sometimes venture to a different country, and the exchange rate does make them think and wonder about why things cost less or more. The key here is that you only consider things to cost less or more because of your salary. The salary you earn is in a different currency, in a different country. Because it's in a different currency, the exchange rate affects what you can do with that money in a different country. But because you work in a different country, your employer will pay you what you need in order for you to live in your home country! (Employers don't generally think about it this way, but this underlies the level at which wages are set. Your employer will more likely observe the prevailing level of the wage for your type of job in the labour market and not deviate too far from that level.) So, I struggle (because of what I've learnt in economics) to understand what a more "expensive" life is. A life being more "expensive" sounds as if the person is poor and cannot afford to have as much. It depends on what job they have. If they have a job that actually pays what you would think is a "lot" of money, but that enables them to pay for "expensive" things, that would in my opinion be normal for somebody living in that country. It just means that prices are higher, but it also means that wages are higher. Perhaps what is confusing you is that their money can buy more in a poorer country (in that case I refer you to my argument above that employers simply pay wages that are needed in order for their employees to live in their own country). I believe that people living in a poor country generally can afford plane tickets, houses, food, etc. It's just that the strength of the currency they use is low when traded with other currencies. Now, after talking about how prices are relative to incomes, I want to go back to the important proviso in the brackets in my first sentence. Technology can certainly account for differences in living standards across countries. For example, cell phones, laptops, cars, production processes, infrastructure, human expertise and business management are technologies that can be more difficult to implement in a undeveloped country, or they can be technologies that are still in elementary forms in those countries. This is a game changer, because technology has a big impact on livelihoods, and the ability of people to access the same quality of life as those in richer countries. This is maybe why you think lives can be more "expensive" - because the same level of technology take a comparatively larger proportion of those people's incomes. 

Perhaps you overlooked something, as I think Oral and Jim do not have different indifference curves. Pat and Jim do have identical indifference curves, but whereas Jim prefers curves that are 'higher' or 'more to the right' in the x,y coordinate system Pat prefers curves that are 'lower or more to the left'. An analogy: If you would be looking at an altitude map you cannot tell if one line is higher or lower than the other without additional information. In micro this additional information is the utility value (corresponding to altitude) of the indifference curve. 

I find that @FooBar already gave the meaningful answer, all mine aims to do is provide a more technical perspective. Short answer: Because given the equilibrium price the income offer curves of the consumers do not perfectly complement each other. If the income of some increase while those of the others decrease the total change in demand is not zero. Given such a change no equilibrium belongs to old equilibrium price ratio. Long answer: Before addressing your question let us think about homothetic preferences a bit. A property of homothetic preferences is that if you move radially out of the origin all indifference curves that you intersect will have the same slope at the point of intersection. This means that if a consumer has homothetic preferences then any change in her income/value of her initial endowment will result in a proportional change in her consumption if prices are fixed. Another way of saying this is that the income offer curve is linear. Linear and Cobb-Douglas preferences are homothetic, quasilinear preferences are not. Now to your question: Suppose all consumers in your model had homothetic preferences. We want to test whether the current equilibrium price would also provide an equilibrium if a lump sum transfer was made. By making a transfer the social planner increases the wealth of some consumers and decreases the wealth of others. Because of homothetic preferences he also makes a proportional change in their consumption. The price ratio will only result in equilibrium if these proportional changes balance each other out perfectly so there is no change in aggregate demand. This is needed because the quantity of goods to be consumed is fixed. (Even if you allow for production because the price ratio is the same.) In terms of an Edgeworth box this would mean that the set of Pareto-optimal points is exactly the diagonal and the two consumers have the same income offer curve, which is again the diagonal. Now that we have seen what the problem is let us lose homothetic preferences. Still considering an Edgeworth box, lump sum transfers would not change the price ratio if and only if given the current price ratio both consumers have an income offer curve that coincides with the contract curve. Without homothetic preferences this can be non-linear and since the consumers are in different corners they are likely not identical: the income offer curve coincide with the contract curve in each consumer's own perspective. This condition is not fulfilled given generic utility functions (even if we severly restrict the class of utility functions considered).
