then the pushout map $Z_1 \cup_{Z_0} Z_2 \to B$ becomes a Serre fibration upon geometric realization. Mapping cylinders are a special case of pushouts. If $p \colon E \to B$ becomes a Serre fibration upon realization, then so do the obvious map $E \times \Delta^1 \to B$ and the identity map $B \to B$. The pushout map is your map $M_p \to B$, and our conclusion is that its realization is a Serre fibration. Our proof depends on working with simplicial sets. The technical condition on $B$ is that each nondegenerate simplex is embedded. 

The diffeomorphism groups $\text{Diff}(M)$ are sensitive to stabilization, say replacing $M$ by $M \times [0,1]$, so the direct contribution of the homotopy type of $M$ to $\text{Diff}(M)$ can be obscure. If you instead look at the concordance = pseudoisotopy spaces $$P(M) = \text{Diff}(M \times [0,1] \ \text{rel}\ M \times \{0\}),$$ then the stabilization maps $P(M) \to P(M \times [0,1])$ get highly connected as the dimension of $M$ grows (by Kiyoshi Igusa's stability theorem), hence the low-dimensional homotopy and (co-)homology of $P(M)$ agrees with that of the stable pseudoisotopy space $$\mathscr{P}(M) = \text{colim}_n P(M \times [0,1]^n).$$ The homotopy type of $M$, being the space of points in $M$, and the homotopy type of the free loop space $\mathscr{L}M = Map(S^1, M)$, being the space of closed loops in $M$, both contribute to $\mathscr{P}(M)$, basically through maps $$\mathscr{P}(*) \times M \to \mathscr{P}(M)$$ and $$\mathscr{P}(S^1) \times \mathscr{L}M \to \mathscr{P}(M).$$ See the paper $URL$ of Tom Farrell and Lowell Jones. There is a naturally defined involution on $P(M)$, and by the work of Allen Hatcher, Michael Weiss and Bruce Williams you can use it to largely recover $\text{Diff}(M)$ from $P(M)$. A more precise statement involves the block diffeomorphism group $\widetilde{\text{Diff}}(M)$, which is quite well understood by surgery theory. The survey "Automorphisms of manifolds" by Weiss and Williams might be a good source. By the stable parametrized $h$-cobordism theorem, written up by Friedhelm Waldhausen, Bjørn Jahren and myself, the spaces $\mathscr{P}(*)$ and $\mathscr{P}(S^1)$ are very close to Waldhausen's algebraic $K$-theory spaces $A(*)$ and $A(S^1)$, which agree with the algebraic $K$-theory spaces of the ring spectra $S$ and $S[\mathbb{Z}]$, respectively. I have some papers on $K(S)$, and Lars Hesselholt has more information about $K(S[\mathbb{Z}])$. I think this is one of the main reasons to be interested in the algebraic $K$-theory of ring spectra. 

Here is a little survey of the "bottom" of finite groups. It includes an answer to (2) in the case of finite nilpotent groups, and a correction to an anonymous comment. The subgroup generated by the minimal normal subgroups is called the socle of the finite group. It is a direct product A×S where A is elementary abelian and S is a direct product of (non-abelian) simple groups. If A=1, then the group is a subgroup of Aut(S), and so has a very restricted structure. In general, A and S are not enough to determine the structure of the group very precisely (for instance A=2 allows both cyclic groups of order 2^n and the insoluble groups SL(2,q) for odd primes q). However, in special cases they can exert more control. The socle of a finite abelian group is the subgroup consisting of the identity and the elements of prime order. The socle of a finite p-group (or finite nilpotent group) is the subgroup consisting of the identity and the central elements of prime order. Therefore you have very clear answers for (2) in the case of finite nilpotent groups: central of order dividing a prime. For finite solvable groups, things are a little more complicated. A minimal normal subgroup must be elementary abelian, and so if g is in Soc(G), then N, the normal subgroup generated by g, must be elementary abelian since N ≤ Soc(G), and Soc(G) is a (direct product of) elementary abelian group(s). In particular, g commutes with all of its conjugates and has order dividing a prime. As the non-abelian group of order 6 shows, g need not be central. If g commutes with all of its conjugates and has prime power order, then it is contained in every Sylow p-subgroup, but it need not be in the socle: the dihedral group of order 8 is already a counterexample. This indicates a subgroup that is easier to handle, exerts more control, but of course is larger: the Fitting subgroup. The Fitting subgroup F is the direct product of the p-cores, where the p-core is the intersection of all of the Sylow p-subgroups. The Fitting subgroup can be built from above, below, and by horizontal or vertical slices, so it is extremely commonly assumed to be known. It is the largest normal nilpotent subgroup, and so contains the A part, A ≤ F. In a solvable group G, one always has G/Z(F) ≤ Aut( F ), so that you can view the "top" part of G as acting on the "bottom" part. Often you want to do this with the socle, and there are (complicated) techniques for making it work in some cases, but the socle fails horribly for nilpotent groups: How can you understand the dihedral group of order 8 by the way it acts on its center of order 2? It cannot act at all on the center, it fixes both points. The product of the minimal normal subgroups is not usually contained within the Frattini subgroup. For instance this fails for elementary abelian groups and for S3. When a chief factor (minimal normal subgroup of a quotient group) of a finite solvable group is contained in the Frattini, then it is called a Frattini factor, otherwise it is called complemented, since the (quotient) group is a semi-direct product with normal kernel that chief factor, and complement a (non-normal) maximal subgroup. For insoluble groups, the socle is not very useful in general, but a very similar subgroup exerts an enormous amount of control, the so called layer L generated by all subnormal quasi-simple (nonabelian) subgroups. L contains S, but may intersect A a little: Fit(L) = A ∩ L. The subgroup F* generated by F and L is called the generalized Fitting subgroup, and it is large enough to detect the "top" of the group: G/Z(F) ≤ Aut(F*). The difference between L and S is very small conceptually: S is the subgroup generated by the subnormal simple (non-abelian) subgroups, and L is the subgroup generated by the subnormal quasi-simple (non-abelian) subgroups. A quasi-simple group X is one where X/Z(X) is simple, but X is not X/Z(X) × Z(X). Non-simple quasi-simple groups are one of those somewhat rare occasions when the socle is contained within the Frattini, and that is exactly why the socle escapes detection when viewing quasi-simple groups and p-groups as automorphism groups. As a rule of thumb, starting with the socle you can make bigger groups by either: 

There are homological stability results (due to Ruth Charney and Hendrik Maazen around 1979, if I recall correctly) saying that $H_*(GL_n(Z); Z) \to H_*(GL_{n+1}(Z); Z)$ is about $n/2$-connected. So in a range of degrees increasing to infinity with n you might just ask about the (co-)homology of $GL(Z) = GL_\infty(Z)$. The Serre spectral sequence implies that there is little difference between the case of $GL(Z)$ and $SL(Z)$. For the rational result, Armand Borel computed $H^*(SL(Z); Q)$ in his paper (MR0387496) "Stable real cohomology of arithmetic groups", in Ann. Sci. \'Ecole Norm. Sup. (1974). For integral results, Bill Dwyer and Steve Mitchell compute $H^*(GL(Z); Z)$ in their paper (MR1633505) "On the $K$-theory spectrum of a ring of algebraic integers", in $K$-Theory 14 (1998). See 1.5 and section 10 of their paper. They assume the now proven Lichtenbaum--Quillen conjecture (Voevodsky for $p=2$, Rost, Voevodsky, Weibel? for $p$ odd.) In both cases the results are more general, and suffice to compute the cohomology of $GL(R)$ and the (rational) algebraic K-theory of R for R any ring of integers in a number field. 

When $k=2$ and $n$ is even, $$ D_{k,r} S^n \simeq BB_{r+} \wedge S^{rn} $$ is the $rn$-fold unreduced suspension of the classifying space of the braid group $B_r$ on $r$ strings. I once cited Cohen-Mahowald-Milgram ``The stable decomposition for the double loop space of a sphere'' (1978) for this, and if I recall correctly they credited Arnold for the idea. Hence $rn$ is the maximal number of suspensions that can appear in this case. Edit: For $k=2$ and $n=2$ the map $F(\mathbb{R}^2,r) \times_{\Sigma_r} \mathbb{R}^{2r} \to \mathbb{R}^{2r}$ taking $[z,\xi] = [z_1, \dots, z_r, \xi_1, \dots, \xi_r]$ to $$ (\sum_i \xi_i, \sum_i z_i \xi_i, \dots, \sum_i z_i^{r-1} \xi_i) $$ trivializes the source as an $\mathbb{R}^{2r}$-bundle over $F(\mathbb{R}^2,r)/\Sigma_r$. Here the $z_i$ and $\xi_i$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are viewed as complex numbers, and the products in the displayed formula are formed in $\mathbb{C}$. A similar formula works for any even $n$, by taking the direct sum of $n/2$ copies of this $\mathbb{R}^{2r}$-bundle. Hence the Thom complex of this bundle, which is your $D_{2,r} S^n$, is the $rn$-th suspension of $(F(\mathbb{R}^2,r)/\Sigma_r)_+ \simeq BB_{r+}$. I recalled this in Proposition 9.10 of my paper "Topological logarithmic structures" GTM 16 (2009). For $k=2$ and $n=1$, or more generally for $n$ odd, the stable splitting of $\Omega^2 S^3$ is closely connected to the story of Brown-Gitler spectra. Regarding the case when $k$ is a higher power of $2$, you might first try $k=4$ and identify $\mathbb{R}^4$ with the quaternions. However, in that case the quaternionic Vandermonde matrix might well be singular. For instance, with $r=3$ and $z = (i,j,k)$ the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ i & j & k \\ -1 & -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ annihilates $\xi = (1,0,1)$, so Arnold's idea does not extend to this case. 

E = SmallGroup(32,28) is the first example. It has two central subgroups A1 and A2 isomorphic to A ≅ 2 with quotient isomorphic to SmallGroup(16,11), but A1 and A2 are not conjugate in Aut(E). Examples such as this are reasonably common in p-groups. Edit: You can even have such an example with G abelian: G = 4×2, A = 4×2, E = SmallGroup(64,3) = 8⋉8, Z(E) = 4×4. E has two central copies of A=4×2 that are not conjugate in Aut(G), but the quotients are both abelian and isomorphic to G. Edit: Vipul notes you can even have E abelian of order p7. 

BabAba = 1, where Bb=1 and Aa=1. SL(2,Z) does contain free subgroups, for instance on [1,2;0,1] and [1,0;2,1], so there is no reason it could not contain free subgroups, it just so happens that {a,b} does not generate one. Of course {a,b} generates SL(2,Z) since S4=aBa and S6=Ab. 

Let b(G) be the maximum degree of an irreducible character of the finite group G. This answer is mostly to address the solvable, but not nilpotent case. I already up-voted the other two excellent answers: Jim Humphreys mentioned how the groups of Lie type behave (showing that KG≈q2N can be enormous compared to b(G)≈qN), and Bugs Bunny gave the very clear example of the family of extraspecial p-groups showing the opposite extreme (with KG = p(2n+1)/(p(2n)+2) < p, and b(G) = pn). 

Ivy does not appear to be a common term in mathscinet. Integrable vector Young functions are called IVY-functions in MR2055989 and related papers. Otherwise all occurrences are the plant or a person. 

This is called a chief series or principal series. The quotients of the terms in the series are called chief factors, and the length of the series is called the chief length. Non-isomorphic groups can have isomorphic chief factors. It depends on your definition of isomorphism of chief series whether non-isomorphic groups can have isomorphic chief series (for instance, if G itself is part of the data of the chief series, then G is obviously determined by its series). The chief length is a group isomorphism invariant. There is a version of Schreier's refinement theorem that applies to chief series. Groups can have many chief series, though some groups have only one, like S4 and SL(2,3) (which have the same chief factors but in a different sort of order). 

In the context of Hochschild- and André--Quillen (co-)homology, this would be called the trivial square-zero extension of $A$ by $N$. See e.g. Quillen's paper on the (co-)homology of commutative rings (1970). 

Waldhausen, Jahren and myself proved a fiber gluing lemma for Serre fibrations, in the context of simplicial sets, that may be useful. In Propositions 2.7.10 and 2.7.12 of "Spaces of PL manifolds and categories of simple maps" $URL$ we prove that given: 

However, the answer is "yes" after stabilizing three times: The product $W \times J^3$ (where $J^3$ is a $3$-cube) is an $h$-cobordism from $M_0 \times J^3$ to the closure of the remaining part of the boundary. There are details in Remark 1.1.3 of my book project "Spaces of PL manifolds and categories of simple maps" with Jahren and Waldhausen. 

As far as I know that 1954 paper of Massey is faulty, and you cannot get multiplicative spectral sequences just from such stucture on an exact couple. The best I know that you can do is to use Cartan-Eilenberg systems. Pairings of Cartan-Eilenberg systems are discussed in Douady's Cartan seminar paper from 1958/59 on products in the Adams spectral sequence. You can find it at numdam.org. Edit: I should not have said "faulty", but rather that the conditions given in Massey's paper are close to tautologous, and therefore usually not helpful in establishing multiplicative structure in a spectral sequence. In practice, one needs information external to the exact couple to establish multiplicativity. One such external structure is that of a pairing of Cartan-Eilenberg systems. 

The answer to your third question is "yes". A little more generally, if $Sq^{n+1}$ acts nontrivially in the mod $2$ cohomology of $C$, then $Sq^{(k+1)(n+1)}$ acts nontrivially in the mod $2$ cohomology of $C^{\wedge k+1}$, by the Cartan formula. If $e$ smashed with the identity on $C^{\wedge k}$ were null-homotopic, then its mapping cone, which is $C^{\wedge k+1}$, would split in a way that is not compatible with this nontrivial cohomology operation. A similar argument works for $e = \alpha_1$, using the Steenrod operations in mod $p$ cohomology. I think this kind of argument goes back to Michael Barratt. There is a Cartan formula for secondary cohomology operations, due to Leif Kristensen, which might give similar results for some classes $e$ of Adams filtration $2$, but I have not looked at the details. 

The list of groups is fairly short, but I haven't had time to verify it; they are all far from simple, usually with a normal Sylow and nilpotent quotient. They have a result for n=4 too, on p. 239, but it is much less complete. Since your character is nonzero except on n classes, it can take on at most n nonzero values. It is fairly likely to be faithful, since every class contained in the kernel is a wasted class that cannot be zero. This allows some of the lemmas to be used. If Gagola's case is indicative, then the "all" versus "one" will not actually be a huge difference, at least mod the kernel of your single character.

Subnormality is a pretty critical idea, and many of Bender's insights use subnormality, so I would not suggest avoiding subnormality. Other characterizations of the Fitting subgroup in terms of subnormality are given in Huppert's textbooks. In particular, the Fitting subgroup as the elements that centralize chief factors is a very important viewpoint. It generalizes to F-subnormality in the finite soluble world, and Bender's p*-nilpotency in the finite insoluble world. Kegel and Carter have a number of nice papers that explore subnormality in ways that have heavily influenced both the soluble and the insoluble worlds. Robinson's group theory textbook (and Lennox–Stonehewer MR902857) have a good description of subnormality in the infinite case. Wielandt's collected works contains several good textbook style presentations of subnormality that are not properly contained in any other works that I have found. They avoid assuming finiteness, and tend to have very interesting relationships between perfect subgroups and subnormality, that complement Bender's work.
