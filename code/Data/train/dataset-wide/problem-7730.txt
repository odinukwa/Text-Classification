Every filtered category $\mathcal{J}$ admits a cofinal directed diagram, i.e. a cofinal functor $\mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{J}$ where $\mathcal{I}$ is directed. Every countable directed poset $\mathcal{I}$ admits a cofinal $\omega$-chain: just take an enumeration of the elements of $\mathcal{I}$ and repeatedly use directedness to get a cofinal chain of length $\omega$. Every directed poset $\mathcal{I}$ of cardinality $\lambda$ is the union of a $\lambda$-chain of directed subposets of cardinality $< \lambda$. (Observe that every infinite subset $S \subseteq \mathcal{I}$ is contained in a directed subposet of $\mathcal{I}$ of the same cardinality as $S$.) 

The right square is a pushout square as soon as the first downward arrow is an epimorphism, and we do not even need $f$ and $g$ to be monomorphisms. This is true in any abelian category. Since diagrams are not easy to draw, let me label the downward arrows as $a : A \to A'$ (which we assume is an epimorphism but not necessarily an isomorphism), $b : B \to E$ and $c : C \to F$. Suppose $h_1 : E \to G$ and $h_2 : C \to G$ are morphisms such that $h_1 \circ b = h_2 \circ q$. Then, $h_1 \circ b \circ f = h_2 \circ q \circ f = 0$, so $h_1 \circ g \circ a = 0$ (because $g \circ a = b \circ f$). Since $a$ is an epimorphism, we must have $h_1 \circ b = 0$, thus $h_1 = h \circ r$ for a unique $h$, by the universal property of cokernels. Moreover, $h \circ c \circ q = h \circ r \circ b = h_1 \circ b = h_2 \circ q$, so $h \circ c = h_2$, because $q$ is an epimorphism. So we indeed have a pushout square. 

Ideally, we'd like to define $\mathfrak{m}$ to be the subsheaf of nowhere invertible sections defined by $$\{ s \in \mathscr{O} : \nexists t . \; s \times t = 1 \}$$ but unfortunately $\nexists t . \; s \times t = 1$ is not a geometric formula. (The formula $\forall t . \; s \times t \ne 1$ is equivalent to the previous one but has the same defect.) We can salvage one half of the biimplication as the geometric sequent $$(a \in \mathfrak{m}) \land (\exists b . \; a \times b = 1) \vdash \bot$$ which merely expresses the requirement that "$a$ is not in $\mathfrak{m}$ if $a$ is invertible", but we also need to express the requirement that "$a$ is in $\mathfrak{m}$ if $a$ is not invertible". One possibility is the following: $$\top \vdash (\exists b . \; a \times b = 1) \lor (a \in \mathfrak{m})$$ These two axioms appear to give the correct characterisation of $\mathfrak{m}$ in intuitionistic first order logic: it is easy to derive from these axioms that $$a \in \mathfrak{m} \dashv \vdash \nexists b . \; a \times b = 1$$ so the interpretation of $\mathfrak{m}$ is completely determined by the axioms, at least in a topos. But does every local ring object (in the sense of the first paragraph) admit an $\mathfrak{m}$ satisfying these axioms? The answer appears to be no, for the reason that these axioms assert that a every section of a sheaf of a local ring admits an open cover of the space by open sets on which the restriction is either invertible or nowhere invertible – and this is certainly not true in the contexts of interest. Can this idea be rescued with a more clever approach? 

The algebras for this monad can be described in essentially the same way: they are sets in which it makes sense to to take "convex combinations" of countably many elements. More precisely, an algebra is a set $X$ together with an operation $$((a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots), (x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots)) \mapsto \sum_{i = 0}^\infty a_i x_i$$ defined for every sequence $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots)$ of non-negative real numbers such that $\sum_{i = 0}^\infty a_i = 1$ and every sequence $(x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ of elements of $X$, such that $$\sum_{i = 0}^\infty a_i \left( \sum_{j = 0}^\infty b_{i,j} x_{i,j} \right) = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \left( a_{p(k)} b_{p(k), q(k)} \right) x_{p(k), q(k)}$$ where $k \mapsto (p(k), q(k))$ is your favourite bijection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$, and $$\sum_{i = 0}^\infty a_i x_i = \sum_{j = 0}^\infty b_j y_j$$ whenever $\sum_{i : x_i = z} a_i = \sum_{j : y_j = z} b_j$ for all $z \in X$. The most concise way of giving the complete definition is to use the monad in your question. 

If I'm not mistaken, $\mathcal{M}$ is a locally finitely presentable category. At any rate, the forgetful functor $U : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbf{Cat}$ preserves all limits and filtered colimits, so under the assumption that $\mathcal{M}$ is l.f.p., we have a left adjoint $F : \mathbf{Cat} \to \mathcal{M}$. Question 1. Can the standard model structure on $\mathbf{Cat}$ be transferred to $\mathcal{M}$, i.e. does there exist a model structure on $\mathcal{M}$ where the weak equivalences and fibrations are created by $U : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbf{Cat}$? Question 2. Assuming the desired model structure on $\mathcal{M}$ exists, is it compatible with the obvious $\mathbf{Cat}$-enrichment, i.e. do we have a model 2-category? Question 3. Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be the 2-category whose objects and morphisms are as in $\mathcal{M}$ and whose 2-cells are natural transformations; and let $\mathfrak{A}$ be the 2-category whose objects are small abelian categories, whose morphisms are exact functors, and whose 2-cells are natural transformations. There is an evident 2-functor $\mathfrak{M} \to \mathfrak{A}$ which is surjective on objects, (locally) injective on morphisms, and (locally) bijective on 2-cells. Does this exhibit $\mathfrak{A}$ as the higher-categorical localisation of $\mathfrak{M}$ with respect to weak equivalences? 

Yes, this is a question of descent. More precisely you are asking whether the base change functor $F : \mathbf{Mfd}_{/ C} \to \prod_i \mathbf{Mfd}_{/ U_i}$ reflects pullbacks. It certainly preserves pullbacks (an easy exercise in abstract nonsense), so it suffices to show that $F$ is conservative (i.e. reflects isomorphisms). But this is easy enough: given a morphism $f$ in $\mathbf{Mfd}_{/ C}$ such that $F f$ is an isomorphism in $\prod_i \mathbf{Mfd}_{/ U_i}$, we can construct $f^{-1}$ by gluing together $(F f)^{-1}$. In short, $F$ is conservative because jointly surjective families of open embeddings satisfy the descent condition in $\mathbf{Mfd}$. By the way, I would not call $\mathbf{Mfd}$ a nice category. It has some terrible deficiencies. 

By algebraic theory I mean one in the sense of Lawvere, i.e. a collection of finitary operations, including projections, together with a multi-composition satisfying the obvious axioms. (I believe universal algebraists call these abstract clones?) A strict terminal object in a category is a terminal object $1$ such that every morphism with domain $1$ is an isomorphism. A well-known example of a category with strictly terminal objects is the category of (unital) rings: the only ring homomorphisms with domain $\{ 0 \}$ are isomorphisms. It is a fact that any model of an algebraic theory whose underlying set is a singleton must be a terminal object in the corresponding category of models. My question is, 

It is not hard to see that any contractible space is h-contractible, and so any path-connected space is h-path-connected. Of course, every h-contractible space is h-path-connected; less obviously, every h-path-connected space is connected. Question. Does there exist a connected (and preferably locally connected) topological space that is not h-path-connected? The square $X = [0, 1] \times [0, 1]$ with the lexicographic order topology is connected, locally connected, and not path-connected, but unfortunately it is h-contractible: since $X$ is linearly ordered, the operation $\min : X \times X \to X$ is continuous and yields the required contracting "homotopy". This also shows that h-contractibility (resp. h-path-connectedness) is strictly weaker than contractibility (resp. path-connectedness). What I want to know is whether h-path-connectedness is strictly weaker than connectedness. 

Hirschhorn's book, Model categories and their localizations, is a very thorough reference with many basic results explicitly stated and proved. The result you want is implied by axiom SM7 for simplicial model categories (see Proposition 9.6.1 in op. cit.), and for general model categories I suppose Corollary 16.5.4 is the closest analogue. 

The functor $i$ does not have the cover lifting property in general. If it did, then every epimorphism $X \to 1$ in $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathcal{C}, \tau)$ would be an isomorphism, or equivalently, every $\tau$-cover of $1$ in $\mathcal{C}$ must contain a split epimorphism. (Check the definition of "cover lifting property" carefully!) 

For reference, here are some standard definitions: The image of a locale morphism $f : X \to Y$ is the locale $\operatorname{Im} f$ corresponding to the frame $$\Omega (\operatorname{Im} f) = \{ v \in \Omega (Y) : f_* (f^* (v)) = v \}$$ where $f^* : \Omega (Y) \to \Omega (X)$ is the frame homomorphism corresponding to $f : X \to Y$ and $f_* : \Omega (X) \to \Omega (Y)$ is the right adjoint; the "inclusion" $\operatorname{Im} f \hookrightarrow Y$ corresponds to the frame homomorphism $v \mapsto f_* (f^* (v))$. An open sublocale of a locale $Y$ is a locale $Y_v$ that corresponds to a frame of the form $$\Omega (Y_v) = \{ v' \in \Omega (Y) : v' \le v \}$$ for some $v \in Y$; the "inclusion" $Y_v \hookrightarrow Y$ corresponds to the frame homomorphism $v' \mapsto v' \land v$. An open embedding of locales is a morphism $f : X \to Y$ that is isomorphic to the inclusion of some open sublocale of $Y$. An open map of locales is a morphism $f : X \to Y$ such that the image of every open sublocale of $X$ is an open sublocale of $Y$. A local homeomorphism of locales is a morphism $f : X \to Y$ for which there is a set $\mathfrak{U} \subseteq \Omega (X)$ such that: 

Let $S$ be the set of elements $a \in A$ such that $A [a^{-1}] \to B [a^{-1}]$ is an isomorphism. Then $S$ generates the unit ideal in $B$. $A \to B$ is a flat homomorphism of finite presentation. $A \to B$ is an étale homomorphism. 

Everything is happening in the category of locally fibrant presheaves, which has a homotopy calculus of right fractions in the sense of Dwyer and Kan (because it has suitable functorial factorisations), so the hammock spaces have the same homotopy type has Jardine's cocycle categories. Proposition 3.5 in Calculating simplicial localizations says that locally fibrant presheaves have the same hammock spaces as the whole model category. There is indeed a formula in terms of the simplicial hom spaces: writing $\mathcal{R}$ for the full subcategory of locally fibrant simplicial presheaves that are locally weakly equivalent to $1$, we have $$\Gamma (\hat{X}) \simeq \mathbf{R} \underline{\mathrm{Hom}} (1, X) \simeq {\mathrm{ho}{\varinjlim}}_{\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{op}} \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(U, X)$$ where $U : \mathcal{R} \to \mathbf{sPsh} (\mathcal{C})$ is the inclusion, essentially because $$N(H_\mathrm{hyp} (1, \Delta^{\bullet} \pitchfork X)) \simeq {\mathrm{ho}{\varinjlim}}_{\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{op}} \operatorname{disc} \underline{\mathrm{Hom}} (U, X)_n$$ by e.g. Thomason's homotopy colimit theorem. 

Of course, an aspheric functor is the same thing as a homotopy coinitial functor, so Thomason's homotopy colimit theorem implies that $N (v) : N (\mathcal{E}) \to N (\mathcal{F})$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, which is a strictly weaker conclusion. I believe I have a proof that the answer to my question is yes, so what I am really looking for is an answer in the literature. I would not be surprised if it appears in Pursuing Stacks, but perhaps someone more familiar with the document knows for sure? 

If $\mathcal{V}$ has countable colimits and is a well-powered regular category, then the forgetful functor $\textbf{Ab}(\mathcal{V}) \to \mathcal{V}$ is strictly monadic. (In particular, it has a left adjoint.) A proof can be extracted by chasing the references in theorem 2.4.21 of my notes. Moreover these hypotheses suffice to show $\textbf{Ab}(\mathcal{V})$ has coequalisers for all parallel pairs: combine proposition 2.4.7 (ii) and theorem 2.4.21 (ii). Once we know that $\textbf{Ab}(\mathcal{V})$ has coequalisers of reflexive pairs and that $\textbf{Ab}(\mathcal{V}) \to \mathcal{V}$ is monadic, we can construct tensor products the usual way using generators and relations. 

These conditions are easily seen to be analogues of the conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ to be locally finitely presentable, except for replacing "filtered" (or "directed") everywhere by "sifted". Incidentally, any such $\mathcal{C}$ is locally finitely presentable, and we may also replace "cocomplete" in condition (1) with "complete", just as for locally finitely presentable categories. 

One of Quillen's original examples was the category of chain complexes of finitely-generated modules over a ring – this is obviously equivalent to a small category, and of course, one has to use Quillen's original definition which only required limits and colimits for finite diagrams, rather than the usual definition nowadays which demands limits and colimits for all small diagram. 

I will answer the title question about computing homotopy limits. Let $A : \mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Cat}$ be a small (strict) diagram. By expanding the definitions of the cobar construction, one eventually discovers that $\operatorname{holim} A$ can be computed as the end $$\int_{[n] : \mathbf{\Delta}} \left[ \mathbf{I} [n], \prod_{(c_0, \ldots, c_n)} \mathcal{C} (c_n, c_{n-1}) \times \cdots \times \mathcal{C} (c_1, c_0), A c_0 \right]$$ where $\mathbf{I} [n]$ is the contractible groupoid with $n + 1$ objects. In more familiar terms, this is just the hom-category of all morphisms between a certain pair of cosimplicial categories. Here is a description of an object in $\operatorname{holim} A$: 

However, I have trouble finding any earlier appearances of the quote. I found something in that spirit in [Adams, 1978, Infinite loop spaces, §2.3]: 

There are other subtleties to think about. A well-known result of Kan implies that the category of presheaves on a small category $\mathcal{C}$ has $\mathcal{C}$ as a colimit dense subcategory via the Yoneda embedding $\mathcal{C} \to [\mathcal{C}^\textrm{op}, \textbf{Set}_\infty]$, but if $\mathcal{C}$ is only a locally small category, then this is in general false: in other words, the relative sizes of $\mathcal{C}$ and $\textbf{Set}_\infty$ matter!
