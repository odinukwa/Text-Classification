One kind of answer is as follows. A commutative ring $R$ is local iff for all $a\in R$, either $a$ is invertible or $1-a$ is invertible. The logical form of this statement is obviously much simpler than the usual definition in terms of maximal ideals, so one can easily interpret it in a wide range of categories. The pair (sheaves on spec($R$), structure sheaf) is in some sense the free locally-ringed topos generated by the ringed topos (sets,$R$). If I remember correctly, this is explained in more detail in Johnstone's book on Stone Spaces. (He probably talks about it in his topos theory books as well.) More generally, the structure sheaf on a scheme is always a local ring object in the sense just discussed. Concretely, this means that for any section $a$ of the structure sheaf over an open set $U$ we can write $U=V\cup W$ with $V$ and $W$ open, such that $a|_V$ and $(1-a)|_W$ are invertible. 

Let's take $C$ to be the category of chain complexes of abelian groups, and homotopy classes of maps. What do you want the cone functor to be? An object of $Ar(C)$ consists of a pair of chain complexes $X$ and $Y$, together with a homotopy class of chain maps between them. To construct the mapping cone in the usual way, you need an actual chain map, not just a homotopy class. I don't think that this $C$ supports the structure that you describe. You could instead take $C$ to be the more rigid category of chain complexes and chain maps, and try to axiomatise the structure that allows you to form $Ho(C)$ and to prove that $Ho(C)$ is triangulated. One approach is to demand that $C$ is a model category in the sense of Quillen, with an extra stability axiom. This is discussed in Hovey's book on model categories. If you want something closer to the approach outlined in your question, you could look at the work of Baues. He has axioms for a category with a cylinder functor, and he develops a rich theory of unstable homotopy based on that, including Puppe sequences. I don't think he ever discusses the additional stability condition needed to give a triangulation, but it can't be too hard. A third approach would be to use stable infinity categories. That route involves a lot of statements and constructions that look very simple on the surface, but there tend to be a lot of elaborate technicalities hidden by the formalism that can jump out and bite you unexpectedly. 

That's normally called a Galois connection (because of the example where $X$ is a field, $Y$ is a group of automorphisms of $X$, and $aRg$ means that $g(a)=a$). The Wikipedia article ($URL$ has a number of references. 

If $A\in GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ then you can just pick any nonzero complex number $\lambda$ such that $\arg(-\lambda)$ is different from the arguments of all the eigenvalues of $A$. Then the path $t\mapsto t\lambda I+(1-t)A$ joins $A$ to $\lambda I$ in $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$, and it is easy to join $\lambda I$ to $I$, so $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ is connected. Moreover, $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$ is homeomorphic to $U(n)\times\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ by Gram-Schmidt, so $U(n)$ is connected. I don't know if there are similar proofs for the other classical groups. 

We can define a map $\phi\colon\{0,1\}^{14}\to G$ by $$ \phi(u) = a_1^{u_1}\dotsb a_4^{u_4} b_{12}^{u_5} \dotsb b_{34}^{u_{10}} c_1^{u_{11}}c_2^{u_{12}}c_3^{u_{13}}d^{u_{14}} $$ One can check that this is bijective, and one can write formulae for the permutations of $\{0,1\}^{14}$ corresponding to right multiplication by the elements $a_i$, $b_{jk}$, $c_l$ and $d$. In particular, this proves that $|G|=2^{14}$. One can also check that $$ [b_{12},b_{34}] = [b_{13},b_{24}] = [b_{14},b_{23}] = d \neq 1, $$ so $G$ is not metabelian. In the paper "On certain varieties of groups", Macdonald states that it is easy to verify that the above group has $[x,y]^2=1$ for all $x,y\in G$. I don't see how to prove this myself. However, I have checked it by computer for 10000 randomly chosen pairs $(x,y)$, so it must be true. 

By digesting Neil Epstein's answer and references I arrived at the following more specific and concrete version. Let $k$ be a finite field. For $1\leq n\leq\infty$ put $$ R_n = k[x,y_0,\dotsc,y_n]/(y_i = xy_{i+1}+1). $$ Because the relations give $y_i$ in terms of $y_{i+1}$ we just have $R_n=k[x,y_n]$ for $n<\infty$, and this is a UFD. From this description it is clear that the map $R_n\to R_{n+1}$ is injective, and gives an isomorphism $R_n^\times\to R_{n+1}^\times$. Using this I think we can deduce that the colimit $R_\infty=\bigcup_nR_n$ is a UFD as well. We have $y_i=1\pmod{x}$ for all $i$ so $R_\infty/x=k$. On the other hand, we have $y_i=y_0-i\pmod{x-1}$ for all $i$, so $R_\infty/(x-1)=k[y_0]$. From this it follows that the ideal $(x-1,y_0)$ cannot be principal. 

It can be shown that any such functor is represented by some space $BF$. Indeed, this unstable, non-additive version is the original version of Brown representability. Now the main point is just that if $E^*$ is a generalised cohomology theory, then the representing spaces $BE^n$ form an $\Omega$-spectrum. This follows quite transparently from the definitions. 

First, if $q=rs$ with $(r,s)=1$ then $\mathbb{Z}_q^n=\mathbb{Z}_r^n\times\mathbb{Z}_s^n$, and every submodule of $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$ splits uniquely as a direct sum of a submodule of $\mathbb{Z}_r^n$ and a submodule of $\mathbb{Z}_s^n$. Using this, we reduce easily to the case where $q$ is a prime power, say $q=p^m$. Now let $F$ denote the set of free submodules of rank $k$ in $\mathbb{Z}_q^n$, and let $F_0$ be the corresponding set for $\mathbb{Z}_p^n$. By a standard argument which you say you have seen, we have $|F_0|=\pi(n)/(\pi(k)\pi(n-k))$, where $\pi(k)=(p-1)(p^2-1)\dotsb(p^k-1)$. The reduction map $\rho\colon F\to F_0$ is easily seen to be surjective, so you just need to understand $|\rho^{-1}\{A_0\}|$ for $A_0\in F_0$. We can choose $A\in\rho^{-1}\{A_0\}$, and then choose a complement $B$ such that $\mathbb{Z}_q^n=A\times B$. Now $\rho^{-1}\{A_0\}$ is the set of submodules $C\leq A\times B$ that are free of rank $r$ and agree with $A$ mod $p$. For any such $C$, we have projections $A\xleftarrow{f}C\xrightarrow{g}B$, and we see that $f(C)+pA=A$ and $g(C)\leq pB$. As $f(C)+pA=A$ we see that $f$ is surjective, but $|C|=|A|=q^r$ so $f$ is an isomorphism. It follows that $C=\{(a,h(a)):a\in A\}$, where $h=gf^{-1}\in\text{Hom}(A,pB)$. This construction gives a bijection from $\rho^{-1}\{A_0\}$ to $\text{Hom}(A,pB)$, so $|\rho^{-1}\{A_0\}|=p^{(m-1)r(n-r)}$. This is independent of $A_0$, so $$ |F| = p^{(m-1)r(n-r)} \pi(n)/(\pi(r)\pi(n-r)). $$ One can say interesting things about non-free subgroups as well, but I do not have time to write that now. 

They are thinking of the object $M=(S\times_RS)\times_S(S\times_RS)$ as a subobject of $S^4$, so there are four projections $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4:M\to S$. If $\mathcal{X}$ is some kind of category of sets with structure, then the composition map $(p_1,p_4)$ is just $((a_1,a_2),(a_3,a_4))\mapsto (a_1,a_4)$. (Here $a_2$ is actually the same as $a_3$ because the middle pullback is over $S$.) The other maps are $\tau(a_1,a_2)=(a_2,a_1)$ and $p_1(a_1,a_2)=a_1$ and $p_2(a_1,a_2)=a_2$ and $\Delta(a)=(a,a)$. The kernel pair of $\sigma$ is indeed $(p_1,p_2)$ rather than $(p_0,p_1)$, which is just a typo. If $\mathcal{X}$ is just the category of sets, you end up with the category whose object set is $S$, and there is a unique morphism from $a$ to $b$ if $\sigma(a)=\sigma(b)$, and no morphisms from $a$ to $b$ otherwise. 

Let me say that $X$ has property $CM'$ if for every field $F$ and every point $a\in X$, the map $H_*(X\setminus a;F)\to H_*(X;F)$ is injective but not surjective. Then orientable closed manifolds have $CM'$, and $CM'$ implies $CM$. Now suppose that $X$ and $Y$ both have $CM'$. After noting that $$ (X\times Y)\setminus (a,b) = ((X\setminus a)\times Y) \cup (X\times (Y\setminus b)) $$ we can use the Kunneth isomorphism and the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to see that $X\times Y$ also has $CM'$. (I switched to using homology to ensure that Kunneth works in a straightforward way even if the spaces have infinitely generated homology.) I think that a similar approach can be made to work for non-orientable manifolds if we modify the definition of $CM'$ to distinguish between fields that do or do not have characteristic $2$. Thus, to make progress you should investigate whether there are any spaces that have $CM$ but not $CM'$. Incidentally, contrary to your list of non-examples, I think that the figure 8 has $CM'$ (and therefore $CM$). 

There is an obvious map $i\colon S^n\to K(\mathbb{Z},n)$, with fibre $F$ say. The homotopy groups of $F$ are essentially the same as those of $S^n$. The mod $p$ cohomology of $K(\mathbb{Z},n)$ is polynomial tensor exterior, with a generator $u$ in degree $n$, and other generators obtained by applying Steenrod operations to $u$, which means they have dimension at least $n+2p-2$. Using this and the Serre spectral sequence we see that the mod $p$ cohomology of $F$ starts roughly in dimension $n+2p-2$, and it follows that the same is true of the $p$-torsion in the homotopy groups. A more careful argument along these lines gives the result stated in Wikipedia. 

I like the following characterisation. Consider a continuous function $f:G\to\mathbb{R}$ (for any compact Lie group $G$) and the set $T=\{t_g(f): g\in G\}$ of translates of $f$, where $t_g(f)(x)=f(gx)$. Let $C$ be the closure of the convex hull of $T$. It can be shown that $C$ contains a unique constant function, and the value of that function is the inegral of $f$ with respect to Haar measure. 

This is a complete rewrite of my original answer, combined with my comments on the original question and various other answers. Suppose we have a finite set $C$ of candidates, and a finite set $E$ of electors (with $|C|>1$ and $|E|>2$, to avoid some degenerate cases). I will assume that we are just modelling what happens in some kind of secret ballot after campaigning has finished, so each elector independently fills in some kind of form. Let $F(C)$ be the set of possible ways to fill in the form. If all candidates are treated equally, then $F(C)$ should be functorial for bijections of $C$. The collection of voter choices is a point $f\in\text{Map}(E,F(C))$. Some obvious candidates for $F(C)$ are 

Let $D$ be the divided power ring $$ D = \mathbb{Z}[a_0,a_1,a_2,\dotsc]/(a_0-1,a_na_m-(n,m)a_{n+m}) $$ (where $(n,m)$ denotes the binomial coefficient $(n+m)!/(n!\,m!)$). Then ring maps from $D$ to $R$ biject with power series $f(t)=\sum_ka_kx^k\in R[[x]]$ satisfying $f(s+t)=f(s)f(t)$ and $f(0)=1$, and thus with homomorphisms $F_a\to F_m$ over $R$. Now $\mathbb{Q}\otimes D$ is just the polynomial ring $\mathbb{Q}[a_1]$ and you recover the description that you mentioned for homomorphisms $F_a\to F_m$ over $\mathbb{Q}$-algebras. On the other hand, for any prime $p$ one can check that $$ D/p = \mathbb{Z}/p[a_1,a_p,a_{p^2},\dots]/(a_{p^i}^p=0) $$ This gives rise to a description of the exponential series over any $\mathbb{Z}/p$-algebra $R$. More explicitly, given $b\in R$ with $b^p=0$ we get an exponential series $$ E_b(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}(bx)^k/k! $$ and we find that every exponential series hs the form $$ f(x) = \prod_i E_{b_i}(t^{p^i}) $$ for some sequence of coefficients $b_i$ such that $b_i^p=0$.
