Note that your production function has the functional form of a Cobb-Douglas. These types of functions have some interesting properties. One of them is that the power of each input is simply its elasticity. In other words, $ε_k=1.4$ and $ε_l=0.5$. In order to see whether $f$ has diminishing or increasing returns you need -as @denesp pointed to me- to see $f(tk,tl)\gtrless tf(k,l)$, where $t>1$. One property of a Cobb-Douglas production function is that, $f(tk,tl)=t^{ε_l+ε_k}f(k,l)$. So, when you have a C-D production function you can conclude about its productivity by summing its inputs elasticities. In your case, you have an increasing returns Cobb-Douglas production function if $ε_l+ε_k> 1$, and you have a diminishing returns C-D production function if $ε_l+ε_k< 1$ 

In Europe, shop prices are typically displayed including VAT. This gives the impression that the seller is paying the VAT. They have to offer a competitive price, then a percentage of that is taken out as tax. But, if VAT didn't exist, sellers could offer a lower price. So in another sense, buyers pay the tax. In the US, sales tax is typically added at the till. This makes it feel like the buyer is paying the tax. But ultimately, VAT and sales tax are the same (at the point of final sale) - does it really make a difference how the prices are displayed? The same issue exists with income tax, stamp duty, and presumably many other taxes. It's quite integral to Western life that income tax is paid by the employee - you hear people say "I pay my taxes, I'm part of this society". But the need to pay income tax means that employers need to pay higher wages, so the employer is bearing the cost as well. Does it make a difference what happens when the rate changes? For example, if income tax rises, typically salaries do not rise to match. But if sales tax rises, the the amount added at the till immediately rises too. 

I got hold of this link from Journal of Statistics Education Using the notation in it, let $X\sim \log N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, i.e. $Y=\log(X) \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$. Hence, $E(X)=E(e^Y)=e^{\mu+\sigma^2/2}$. An estimator for $\log(E(X))$ is $$\bar Y+\frac{S_Y^2}{2}$$. Also, $Var(\hat\log(E(X)))=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}+\frac{\sigma^4}{2(n-1)}$, which gives $$\hat Var(\hat\log(E(X)))=\frac{S_Y^2}{n}+\frac{S_Y^4}{2(n-1)}$$. For large samples, using the CLT, we have $$\frac{\hat \log E(X)-\log E(X)}{\sqrt{\hat Var(\hat\log(E(X)))}}\sim^a N(0,1)$$ Thus, one possible CI from this perspective is $$CI(E(X))=\left]e^{\bar Y+\frac{S_Y^2}{2}\pm z_{1-\alpha}\sqrt{\frac{S_Y^2}{n}+\frac{S_Y^4}{2(n-1)}}}\right[$$. According to the link, this is the Cox method, while the modified Cox method substitutes the standard normal quantile for a $t(n)$ quantile. They simulate more than just the these two intervals. They also simulate the naive approach. If we look at table 5 of the link, we can see that the best method is the modified Cox, since for small samples, and large ones, the covering probability is the most close to the nominal level. Alecos answer, if I understood correctly, suggests adding a correction term to the naive approach, resulting in $CI(E(X))=\left]e^{\bar Y+\frac{1}{2}\frac{S_X^2}{(\bar X)^2}\pm t_{1-\alpha}\sqrt{\frac{S_Y^2}{n}}}\right[$. I've simulated his answer with the following code in Mathematica: 

Most people's main asset is their labour, and automation threatens that. Automation may reduce the value of human labour. If that happens, some people will lose out massively. While society as a whole becomes richer, these individuals will become poorer, and probably much poorer, to the point of destitution. It is not clear whether this will actually happen. The rise in automation over the past 200 years has changed but not removed the value of human labour. But the idea that automation should be feared comes from this uncertainty. If labour is devalued, governments could cause wealth redistribution with policies like a universal basic income. However, if this is not done, then enormous social problems could result. 

The usual LLN I've seen, the theorem states that $1/n \sum u_t \rightarrow^p E(u_t)=\mu$,where the expected value is independent of t. However, I cannot apply it to the exercise below. In the picture, the author seems to be using $ \displaystyle \frac{1}{n} \sum u_t \rightarrow^p \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{n} \sum E(u_t)$ 

«Popular market measures of US inflation expectations are climbing sharply higher in the wake of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting, which analysts say hinted at officials being willing to tolerate higher inflation before tightening monetary policy more aggressively. So-called “breakeven rates”, which are a rough estimate of expected inflation derived from comparing the yields of conventional and inflation-proof Treasuries, have jumped markedly this month, and have gone even higher since Wednesday’s Fed meeting» Could you please explain how are these breakeven rates estimated? And why they can be a 'rough estimate' of expected inflation? Any help would be appreciated. 

I believe that the author's answer is clear. GDP is the total product produced in a country. By increasing the unemployment benefits, the government does not increase the product. If you think GDP as the total income of a country, then a transfer payment means that the government pay you back what you have already pay with taxes. In other words, the total government earnings by taxation are 100 million, which they go back to people as an unemployment benefit. 

I wonder if there is a "general" functional form of a production/cost function in the agricultural sector, especially if we assume that the only input is the land. In that case, it would be unrealistic to assume a generalized Cobb-Douglas production function and a translog cost function? Thanks in advance 

We know that $M_X\mathbf{u}= \mathbf{\hat u}$, where $\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{x\beta}+\mathbf{u}$. So even if the error terms are independent, the residuals will not be independent of the other residuals. This is makes the usual assumption of no autocorrelation invalid. Of course, if we use a HAC estimator then we can circumvent the existence of autocorrelation. However, the HAC estimators that I know of are just of asymptotic behaviour. So, it wouldn't be useful for a small sample size. 

Let's designate the Net International Investment Position(NIIP:it's the net international wealth of a country), as $B_t$. Why can we see the current account at time t, as $CA_t=B_{t+1}-B_t$ , when we know that $CA_t=TB_t+i^wB_{t}$? $TB_t$ is trade balance at time $t$, and $i^w$ is world nominal interest rate. Intuitively it makes sense, since the variation of a country net international wealth should mimic its international 'consumption/expenditures'. However, I'm looking for a more formal derivation. I think it would probably be related to the Financial and Capital Accounts. Any help would be appreciated. 

There are 22,000 Vietnamese Dong to a USD, making it one of the world's least valued currency units. But denominations under 1,000 are rarely used (in tourist areas at least). They might as well say it's 22 Dong to a dollar - the zeros make no practical difference. The zeros remain because back in 1985 they revalued the Dong (1 new dong worth 10 old dong) and this led to inflation. So I understand their reluctance to repeat this. There is a general trend that poorer countries have less valuable currency units. But it's not a strict rule. Vietnam, for example, is not the poorest country in the world. Before the introduction of the Euro, the Italian Lira was a notable example of a developed economy with a low-valued currency unit. You see the locals' attitude to money expressed in the currency. While in developed countries people throw small change into jars at home, this is not the case in poorer countries. In India, coins are rarely used, and you can see from the heavily worn low-denomination notes, how these have been carefully kept inside clothes and shoes. Money is more precious with extreme poverty. I find the Thai Baht to have an especially convenient value - about 35 to a dollar. A very pleasant currency to use. Although technically subdivided into 100 satang, the satang is not much used. That makes the Western practice of pounds and pence or dollars and cents look like unnecessary complexity. 

I have an equation of the form(all vectors): $y=X_1\beta_1+X_2\beta_2+u$. I'm interested in knowing if the beta OLS estimators and respective residual for this equation are the same as for when we apply OLS to the following equations: 

On reading a textbook, the author state that after the 80's, and the serious consequences of thinking that inflation could be controlled by just targeting a monetary aggregate, modern central banks(CB) have shifted their paradigm to a targeting inflation by setting the interest rate. My question is if the CB sets the interest rate, does he need to target M0? Or does the CB just print money according to money demand? Any help would be appreciated. 

This is not a reasonable assumption. Constant prices would imply that there is government control of prices, in which case none of the usual economic models apply. 

I'm from the UK, where there is an extensive welfare system and extra investment in education in deprived areas, called the Pupil premium. Although, not nearly as much as suggested by the paper you reference. Many people do not support the pupil premium. There is a large "squeezed middle" in the UK, not poor enough for extra support, not rich enough for private schools, and this group sees extra support for deprived areas as unfair. 

Stocks are not money. The valuation of a company - the market captialisation - is the number of shares multiplied by the share price. The share price is the price people are willing to trade at right now. It does NOT mean all the shares have been traded at that price. If a company issues 1 million shares, at a starting price of £10, the market cap is £10 million. They may only sell a few of these shares, so much less than £10 million actually changes hands. If the price rises to £20, only a few of the shares changed hands at that price - but the market cap is reflected in all the shares, and is now £20 million. People have commented on the flaws in this methodology. The same happens in a crash. Only a fraction of the shares actually change hands, but the media report on the change in the market cap. If you want an analogy, consider a house burning down. You buy the house for £200,000. Then it sadly burns down (and without insurance). It is now worth £0. However, no money has been created or destroyed; it's a loss of value of an asset. 

I'm reading a macro book (Blanchard's) and the way he values shares is by calculating the net present value of all dividends we expect to receive by owning some stock, discounted by the interest rates (assuming investors are risk-neutral and only care about expected return). Well, by reading some newspapers and some chapters of a book on corporate finance, I've noticed that not many firms' shares pay dividends, being the paid dividends concentrated in a few firms only. In fact, in corporate finance, it seems managers are taught that with the existence of taxes on personal income(dividends apply), it's preferable to repurchase shares which increase the earnings per share ratio (EPS), which in turn multiplied by the price-per-earnings of the industry the firm is in, gives an expected price for the stock. My question is why should we value stock if no dividend is paid? Aren't selling stock and receiving dividend the only two sources of current income that owning shares give? Any help would be appreciated
