Because the velocity-dependent contribution is squared while the potential contribution is not, the gravitational time dilation could be more significant. Note that this does not include the contribution from the Sun itself, the vicinity to which is going to be more significant. However, if we're comparing time dilation for observers near similar stars at similar orbits from their stars, that difference will cancel out. Unfortunately, the gravitational potential is rather model-dependent due to the many uncertainties involved in the observations, but you can play with some of the values given in that paper if you wish. 

The light pressure on any surface is proportional to the light energy density incident on it. Thus we can check this line of reasoning directly by observing that the sky is dark at night. Why it is dark at night is probably deserves its own question (cf. also Olbers' paradox), but it is pretty clear that it is in fact quite small. To be fair, we should check more than the visible range, but even so the sky is pretty dark. Thus on average, light pressure is very small. We have the privilege of being close to a star, but even during the day, the light pressure due to the Sun is on the order of micropascals. 

A cosmological constant should be considered a special case of dark energy. The effective stress-energy tensor for a cosmological constant is proportional to the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, so in a local inertial frame will be proportional $\mathrm{diag}(-1,+1,+1,+1)$. This is equivalent to perfect fluid with energy density and pressure directly opposite one another, but more importantly, it is the only possible form for the stress-energy that would give the exact same energy density and pressure in all local inertial frames. If by 'dark energy', we understand it to mean all the contributions to stress-energy in the above form, then there is no reason for this to be constant, and plenty of reasons why it might not be, as this situation is not exceptional in fundamental physics. For example, there could be false vacua with various different energy densities, and they must be invariant across inertial frames. In particular, the basic idea of inflation considers a flat FRW universe with expansion driven by a scalar field $\phi$ at a local extremum of its potential, $V'(\phi_0) = 0$, which yields an exponential expansion with constant energy density $T^0{}_0 = V(\phi_0)$. More refined models, such as slow-roll inflation, could therefore be directly interpreted as a time-varying dark energy density, while eternal inflation would also include spatial variability. There's plenty of other inflationary models besides. One the interpretational flip-side, one could always have a $\Lambda$ that corresponds to the energy density of the true vacuum, and the rest as separate contributions on top of that. It's just not as useful in a cosmological context compared to grouping all 'dark energies' together, as all stress-energy gravitates equally. 

As barrycarter already pointed out, it is due to the huge time it takes for the milky way to rotate. For once, as he pointed out, the stars in an orbit similar like the sun take about 250 million years for one full revolution around the center of the galaxy. If you put that in a relation to an earth year and take our civilization of roughy 6000 years of keeping records in comparison, we exist roughy 12 minutes of our galactic year. If you only take the last 150 years of the modern era, it's down to 18 seconds. So if you compare that, how much does Earth move around the sun in 18 seconds? That is about how much Andromeda has apparently moved relative to the constellations in the night sky since we can capture visual images on film. 

Yes (and somewhat No apparently too) If you follow Einstein's theory of general relativity then gravity has no direct effect on electro magnetic waves itself. Gravity however affects space time itself warping it towards the gravity source. Thus any electro magnetic wave passing close enough to the gravity source will bend towards that source when observed from the outside. From the point of the wave however, it follows a straight path and is not affected by gravity at all. If you mix in quantum theory, it's getting even more wierd, because suddenly parts that work well for general relativity no longer work within the quantum model. This is part of current research in physics to bring general relativity and quantum theory into alignment. 

It only matters if that mass is iron or not. The state doesn't really matter as it will turn to plasma sooner or later due to gravitational energy transformed to heat. If a planet continues to accrete mass, if it would be any element before iron in the periodic table, it will - given enough mass - become a star. If it is iron, it will collapse down to a neutron star or black hole if the mass is enough. If it is anything heavier than iron, it either does the same as with iron or will go critical and explode in a nuclear fission reaction. Since most mass in the universe however is either hydrogen or helium, usually the first thing is what happens. 

Don't know about the energy transfer but from a rough assumption we can calculate the energy amount that actually passed through Earth depending on the mass converted and the distance of the event. The energy absorbed by Earth would be far less than that obviously. The measured event was two black holes merging with a total mass loss of $3 M_{\odot}$. While the distance for that event was calculated to $1.3*10^9 ly$. With comparing the total energy released (assuming full conversion of mass to gravitational wave energy) over the released area: $$ E_{Earth} = \pi r_{Earth}^2*\frac{m_{conv}c^2}{4\pi r_{dist}^2} $$ $$ E_{Earth} \approx (6378km)^2*\frac{3M_{\odot}*c^2}{4*(1.3*10^9years*c)^2} $$ $$ E_{Earth} \approx 4.0*10^{13}m^2*\frac{5.7*10^{30}kg}{6.72*10^{33}s^2} $$ $$ E_{Earth} \approx 3.39 * 10^{10}J $$ So the maximum amount of energy passing through earth would have been roughly $34 GJ$. That is about the kinetic energy of three Boeing 747 in flight - or neglectable on a planetary scale. So even IF the total energy would have been absorbed by Earth, the amount would still have been - not much. 

Not within general relativity. Except in special circumstances, such as an asymptotically flat spacetime, there is no definable total energy in general relativity. The Friedmann–Roberston–Walker family of spacetimes that describe a homogeneous and isotropic universe are not an exception, although there's a separate argument that can be made for the case of spatially compact universes towards their total energy being exactly zero, no matter how they expand or contract. For the matter distributions, gravitational potential can be useful in the weak-field limit of general relativity when the matter covers a finite region of space, but in general it's not present in general relativity. Or rather, the metric itself can be thought of as taking the role of a 'gravitational potential', but the way it does so is very different from the Newtonian theory. A Newtonian cosmology having formally analogous behavior to the pressureless FRW cosmology with kinetic and potential terms can be done: $$E = \frac{1}{2}\sum_k m_k\dot{r}_k^2 - G\sum_{j\neq k}\frac{m_jm_k}{|\mathbf{r}_j-\mathbf{r}_k|} - \frac{1}{6}\Lambda\sum_k m_kr_k^2\text{.}$$ However, this is incompatible with an infinite universe, and is neither homogeneous nor isotropic (being rather spherically symmetric with a distinguished center), and therefore violates the cosmological principle. That issue can be fixed by introducing a potential for the scale factor itself, but in that case interpreting it as the gravitational potential of the individual gravitating masses is problematic. 

It simply means that the scale is such that the relative abundance of silicon is $10^6$. For example, if you see a statement on this scale that in atom number $\mathrm{C} = 1.17\times 10^7$, that would tell you that carbon atoms are $11.7$ times as numerous as silicon ones. What you're probably looking at is sometimes cosmochemical scale, normalized to this way. A common alternative scale in astronomy is to measure things in $10^{12}$ hydrogen atoms and logarithmically (so that abundance of hydrogen is exactly $12$ and $11$ would mean one-tenth as abundant as hydrogen). 

On a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, a curve $\gamma$ is an affine geodesic whenever it can be parametrized in such a way as to keep the same velocity vector $u = \dot{\gamma}$, or slightly more formally, whenever its velocity vector parallel-transported along the curve remains the same. Equivalently, one can think of affine geodesics are curves of zero acceleration along themselves, which is expressed by the geodesic equation: $$\nabla_uu = 0\text{.}$$ There is an obvious intuitive connection between this and inertial motion, so we can think of these geodesics as describing the motion of free test particles. Unless the length along the geodesic is zero (which can happen on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold), we can take the length along it to be the affine parametrization. Later in physics, the length along the worldline of a massive particle is the time measured by a clock going along it--its proper time $\tau$. If you have you have two nearby geodesics with the same velocity $u$ but separated by a vector $n$ (i.e., this vector connects points of equal affine parameter), we can talk about the relative acceleration between those geodesics. This is known as the geodesic deviation equation, and in terms of the Riemann curvature $R$, one of its forms would be: $$\nabla^2_{u,u}n + R(n,u)u = 0\text{,}$$ or equivalently in coordinates: $$\frac{\mathrm{D}^2n^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\tau^2} + \underbrace{R^\alpha{}_{\mu\beta\nu}u^\mu u^\nu}_{\mathbb{E}^\alpha{}_\beta}\,x^\beta = 0\text{,}$$ where the tidal tensor $\mathbb{E}^\alpha{}_\beta$ is sometimes called the 'electric' part of the Riemann curvature tensor. If you're not familiar with how tensors work, for now just imagine the Riemann tensor as a mathematical machine that takes three vectors and spits out another one in a certain way. In four dimensions, the tensor has $256$ components, although only $20$ of them are algebraically independent. Anyway, once you get used to the idea that nearby geodesics can deviate from one another due to the presence of curvature, we can ask a similar question: suppose you have a small ball (size $\epsilon$) of test particles, all initially comoving with the same velocity $u$. Since their geodesics will have some relative acceleration, the ball generally won't stay of the same volume (or stay a ball, for that matter). In an inertial frame comoving with the test particles, we can consider the initial fraction acceleration of its volume in the limit of zero size of the ball: $$\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\left.\frac{\ddot{V}}{V}\right|_{t=0}\!= -\underbrace{R^\alpha{}_{\mu\alpha\nu}}_{R_{\mu\nu}} u^\mu u^\nu = -\mathbb{E}^\alpha{}_{\alpha}\text{,}$$ where the Ricci curvature $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the trace of the Riemann curvature, and the whole expression is equivalent to the trace of the tidal tensor. A more general situation is described by the Raychaudhuri equation. The takeaway is this: the Ricci curvature tells us whether small balls of initially comoving test particles will expand or contract, i.e. move towards or away from each other. (NB: There's almost no physics in this section--other than borrowing some vocabulary to help frame these issues in a way that will more readily connect to physics, these are facts of differential geometry.)
