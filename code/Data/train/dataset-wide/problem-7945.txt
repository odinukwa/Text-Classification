You could symmetrize an arbitrary function by averaging it over the symmetric group. Explicitly: take your favourite function $h$ in $n$ variables, and set $f(r_1, ..., r_n) = \frac{1}{n!}\sum_{\sigma} h(r_{\sigma(1)}, ..., r_{\sigma(n)})$ where the sum is taken over all permutations $\sigma$ of the numbers $1,...,n$. I'd love to hear of an example which isn't obtained by symmetrization! edit: heh. Any such example would be its own symmetrization. So I guess in some sense this is a complete, if overly glib, answer. 

None of the other obvious statistics that describe this map are in the OEIS yet. Here are naive python implementations of $B_L, B_R, B_L^{-1}, B_R^{-1}$ if you want to check these assertions. 

Originally I had written: "We know that $B(X)$ is always weak*-dense in $B(X^*)$. (In general, this is weaker then being $1$-norming.) Translating back to $\alpha$, this means that $\alpha$ is always injective." However, as pointed out by Bill Johnson below, not even that is the case. So the answer to my question is a big "NO". If $X$ is reflexive, then $\beta$ is surjective, and so $\alpha$ is isometric. (This can also be seen more directly.) If $X$ has the metric approximation property, then already the unit ball of $F(X)$, the finite rank operators on $X$, is weak*-dense in the unit ball of $B(X^*)$. Thus, also in this case, $\alpha$ is isometric. 

You probably know the following already. Oh, well. Anyway, Eric Nordenstam and I answered exactly this problem. It is a special case of Theorem 1 in our preprint, $URL$ and it also appears in the proceedings of FPSAC 2012. Our method was inspired (and suggested) by Krattenthaler: We guessed the answer from empirical data, and then proved our guess was right by multiplying the matrices out and confirming that the answer was the identity matrix. 

where v is the vector [0, 0, ... 0, 1]. I'm pretty sure it'd be easy to prove this inductively, as A itself has a similar block structure - though I confess I haven't done it. EDIT: Here's the sage code that produces the matrix. Obviously it's not the smartest way to go about doing things, but it was adequate. If anyone knows a smarter but equally terse way of iterating over the power set than converting it to a list, let me know! 

It's well-known, due to work of Fontaine (see e.g. this), that if $k$ is a perfect field of characteristic $p$, then one can classify $p$-divisible groups over $W(k)$ by Honda systems. Namely, these are pairs $(L,D)$ where $D$ is a Dieudonne-module over $k$ (free as a $W(k)$-module) and a sub $W(k)$-module $L$ such that composition $L\to W(k)/FW(k)$ induces an isomorphism $L/pL\to W(k)/FW(k)$. I have always interpreted this in the following way. A $p$-divisible group $G$ over $\text{Spec}(W(k))$ is (by algebraizability) a $p$-divisible group over $\text{Spf}(W(k))$. One can interpret such data as a $p$-divisible group $G_0$ over $k$ and, thanks to Grothendieck-Messing, a submodule $L_n\subseteq D(G_0)(W_n(k))$ for each $n$, where $L_n$ is required to be free, and to be 'admissible' (in the sense that $L_n/p L_n$ is supposed to be $\omega_{G_0^\vee}$ (note that I'm using, to be consistent with Messing, covariant Dieudonne theory). Of course such data needs to be compatible in $n$. It seems to me that one recovers precisely the notion of Honda systems by taking this system and taking the limit. Thus, one seems to recover the classification of $p$-divisible groups over $W(k)$ from Grothendieck-Messing. But, as far as I can tell, the approach that people usually take to the equality between Honda systems and $p$-divisible groups is via (the admittedly more concrete) approach of Fontaine using the logarithm map. It seems strange to me that if one can recover this interpretation of the Honda system classification of $p$-divisible groups over $W(k)$ that it wouldn't be mentioned in the above article of B. Conrad. Also brief searches in google with the key words "Grothendieck-Messing" and "Honda systems" turn up nought. Is there some subtlety that I'm missing, or does the above actually explain the classification of $p$-divisible groups over $W(k)$ by Honda systems. Thanks! EDIT: User nfdc23 states below that one does obtain this classification of $p$-divisible groups over $W(k)$, but it is not so obvious that it mathces, on the nose, Fontaine's classification. Namely, if $L\subseteq D(G_0)(W(k))$ is the admissible submodule from Grothendieck-Messing is it true that $L$ is the kernel logarithm map from Fontaine's work? I will think on this, but if anyone has a quick answer, I'd love to hear it! 

This is an answer, but my insight is hardly a mathematical one. Nonetheless, here we go: The 1955 paper of Turán is, in fact, published in both English and Chinese in the same journal. The Chinese version is pages 411-417 in the journal; the English language version is pages 417 - 423. Turán writes: "I am pretty sure that on the way one can evaluate $M_n(6)$ or $S_n(6)$ after a little longer calculations and also further." But he doesn't give a formula. 

Archimedes might have tried to bound the arclength of the $i$th whorl of the spiral between the circumferences of two circles (of radii $ki$ and $k(i+1)$). If you consistently take, say, the lower bound, or the upper bound, or any sensible weighted average of the two, then you're adding a constant amount of arclength with each whorl. The particle can traverse this extra length in the same time by accelerating uniformly. Of course, this isn't completely accurate, as mentioned by Aaron Meyerowitz in the comments. But as the angle between the tangent vectors to the spiral and to the circle decreases, the error approaches zero. Archimedes was fairly comfortable handling the error intuitively in limiting arguments like this, as far as I know. But this is a boring story. I prefer to imagine that one day Archmedes carefully cut an unrolled papyrus scroll in half along one of its diagonals (either on a whim, or out of frustration with the math that he'd been trying to write on it). When the halves are rolled back up, they're approximately parabolic in cross-section. He would have instantly recognized the parabola, after all that time he spent cutting cones in half. I don't know whether Archimedes knew that the parabola is the curve of constant acceleration, though. 

The category Mon of commutative monoids has plenty of projective (and even free) objects. Indeed, for every set $X$ one can consider the commutative monoid $\mathbb{N}[X]$, with generators $\delta_x$ for $x\in X$. Then, for every commutative monoid $M$ one can consider the free monoid $P_0:=\mathbb{N}[M]$ together with the canonical surjective homomorphism $\varphi_0\colon P_0\to M$, which sends the (formal) sum $\sum_m c_m \delta_m$ in $P_0$ (with $c_m\in\mathbb{N}$, and all but finitely many $c_m$ zero) to the sum $\sum_m c_m m$ in $M$. One can consider this as the first step in building a projective resolution for $M$. In the category of groups, one would next consider the kernel of $\varphi_0$ and find a free group surjecting onto that kernel. However, the notion of kernel in Mon is more subtle. If one simply considers $L:=\{x\in P_0 : \varphi_0(x)=0\}$, then it is in general not true that $M$ is isomorphic to $P_0 / L$. One needs to consider kernel pairs, which categorically are the pullbacks of the two maps $(\varphi_0,\varphi_0)$. Thus, a "better" definition of kernel for the map $\varphi_0$ is $$ K_0 := \{(x,y)\in P_0\oplus P_0 : \varphi_0(x)=\varphi_1(y) \}, $$ together with the two natural maps $p_0,p_1\colon K_0\to P_0$ satisfying $p_0(x,y)=x$ and $p_1(x,y)=y$. Then, it is true that $M$ is isomorphic to the quotient of $P_0$ by the congruence relation generated by $p_0$ and $p_1$. Categorically, $\varphi_0$ is the co-equalizer of $p_0$ and $p_1$. Next, I can set $P_1:=\mathbb{N}[K_1]$ and consider the natural surjection $\varphi_1\colon P_1\to K_1$. Doing this, I obtain two maps from $P_1$ to $P_0$, namely $p_0\varphi_1$ and $p_1\varphi_1$. Thus, we have obtained the following situation: $$P_1 \rightrightarrows P_0 \to M.$$ What is the next step? I could consider the kernels of the two maps from $P_1$ to $P_0$. This would mean to construct two free monoids with two morphisms each. Thus, at each next level it seems that this (naive) approach doubles the number of arrows. Is this really how it should be done? Has this been considered? Are there better (simpler) notions of projective resolutions for commutative monoids? In either case, the following seems like an interesting question to aks as well: 

It seems to me you should be able to work out a formula for $p_{ij}$ explicitly, by solving that system of linear equations you wrote down. More to the point, you can do this before deciding on what algorithm you're going to use to assign the ranks. For this solution to correspond to a real-world solution to your problem, it seems to me that the matrix $P = (p_{ij})$ ought to be doubly stochastic (its rows and columns should sum to 1), because everyone should get a rank, and every rank should get a person. If this doesn't happen, you're out of luck. Once you've done this, your doubly stochastic matrix $P$ can be expressed as a convex combination of permutation matrices (this is the Birkhoff-Von Neumann theorem). Each of these permutation matrices corresponds to a rank assignment. You should be able to come up with your algorithm, then, by finding a constructive proof of Birkhoff-Von Neumann and realizing it with code. I sort of doubt that this would be efficient without further cleverness, but it might be a place to start. 

Background Let $F$ be a $p$-adic local field, and let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $F$. Recall that there is a rich theory of compact open subgroups of $G(F)$ which is, essentially, encapsulated in the theory of Bruhat-Tits. There they associate to $G$ a combinatorial object called a building $B(G,F)$ upon which $G(F)$-actions, and for which many classes of 'nice' compact open subgroups of $G(F)$ can be understood as stabilizers of certain 'nice' combinatorial subobjects of $B(G,F)$. These are incredibly valuable since these 'nice' compact open subgroups of $G(F)$ are pivotal in understanding many aspects of the structure of $G(F)$ (e.g. in the construction of representations of $G(F)$ in the form of the Moy-Prasad filtration or as 'reasonable levels' in Shimura varieties). This combinatorial data can be somewhat daunting, and so it is sometimes (at least for me) more convenient to have a way of understanding these 'nice' compact open subgroups of $G(F)$ without needing to understand the inner workings of the Bruhat-Tits machine. As an example, one type of 'nice' compact open subgroup of $G(F)$ are the so-called hyperspecial subgroups. One can define these purely in terms of $B(G,F)$, but one can also define them as $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{O}_F)$ where $\mathcal{G}$ is a reductive model of $G$ over $\mathcal{O}_F$. This allows one to work with hyperspecial subgroups without having to understand the whole definition of $G(\mathcal{O}_F)$. The question below is whether another class of 'nice' subgroups can be understand in a similar way. Actual question Let $F$ be a $p$-adic local field with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_F$ and residue field $k$. Let $G$ be a connected unramified reductive group over $F$. To what extent is it true that parahoric subgroups of $G(F)$ are pullbacks of parabolic subgroups of $\mathcal{G}_k$ for $\mathcal{G}$ a reductive model of $G$ over $\mathcal{O}_F$? Namely, if $\mathcal{G}$ is a reductive model of $G$ over $\mathcal{O}_F$, and $P$ is a parabolic subgroup of $\mathcal{G}_k$, then is $\mathrm{red}^{-1}(P(k))\subseteq \mathcal{G}(\mathcal{O}_F)$ a parahoric subgroup of $G(F)$ (here $\mathrm{red}:\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{O})\to \mathcal{G}(k)$ is the reduction map) a parahoric subgroup of $G(F)$? Do they all arise in this manner? I know that one can define parahorics as the $\mathcal{O}_F$-points of 'parahoric group schemes', but the definition of these is very opaque to me. Do these generalize the above construction in some sense? If one can say more, feel free to assume that $G$ is split. 

I think it's a typo. It's probably rather more common than other typos, because the letters "t,h,g" are very close to each other on a standard keyboard. As a result, it actually does appear in the literature rather more often than you'd expect, and always without definition. (As such, I believe this post qualifies as a legitimate research question and shouldn't be closed, despite the fact that it's about a trivial typographical error. Hilarious!) For instance, here it is in a google books search result. It appears in the second page of an article in a collection of proceedings of a conference, without any definition. Elsewhere in the article it seems to be talking about orthogonality. Of course I'd be happy to be proven wrong - probably the best thing to do is to contact someone who's used the word in print. Maybe they know what it means. Edit: More evidence: compare the title to that of the pdf link, Also this: where the previous sentence uses the word "orthogonal") 

(1) If $A$ is $1$-complemented in its bidual, then $A$ is an AW*-algebra. Indeed, assume that $A$ is $1$-complemented in its bidual, via a contractive projection $p\colon A^{**}\to A$. By a theorem of Tomiyama, $p$ is a conditional expectation. This implies that $A$ is monotone closed, that is, every upward directed family of self-adjoint elements in $A$ has a supremum. In particular, $A$ is an AW*-algebra. (A C*-algebra is an AW*-algebra if every maximal abelian $*$-subalgebra is monotone complete, see [1].) (2) Every separable AW*-algebra is finite-dimensional. Indeed, assume $A$ is a separable AW*-algebra. Consider a maximal abelian $*$-subalgebra (=masa) $B$ of $A$. Then $B\cong C(X)$ for some compact, Hausdorff, extremally disconnected space $X$ (such spaces are also called Stonean). Every metrizable, extremally disconnected space is discrete. Therefore, $X$ is finite. Thus, every masa in $A$ is finite-dimensional. This implies that $A$ is finite-dimensional. (Every infinite-dimensional C*-algebra contains a positive element with infinite spectrum, and hence an infinite-dimensional masa.) Combining (1) and (2) we obtain that a separable, infinite-dimensional C*-algebra is never $1$-complemented in its bidual. [1] arxiv.org/abs/1501.02434
