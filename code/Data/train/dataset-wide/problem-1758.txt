Thats not quite true. Have a look at Wikipedia where you can read this: "Extrapolation of the expansion of the universe backwards in time using general relativity yields an infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past.[18] This singularity signals the breakdown of general relativity and thus, all the laws of physics. How closely this can be extrapolated toward the singularity is debated—certainly no closer than the end of the Planck epoch. This singularity is sometimes called "the Big Bang",[19] but the term can also refer to the early hot, dense phase itself,[20][notes 1] which can be considered the "birth" of our universe." You can't necessarily extrapolate back all the way to a point singularity. 

I'm afraid I don't know why it's moving. Perhaps it's because the Universe is full of things moving in fairly random directions. Like a gas. 

Yes, like pela said, before 1998 people thought the expanding universe was slowing down. There are other changes too. Some people used to say the universe was once the size of a grapefruit. Now since WMAP some people say the observable universe was once the size of a grapefruit, and the universe is infinite. For myself I cannot see how that fits with big bang cosmology, which I think is largely correct. 

Getty Images identifies it as: "Space galaxy - Blue and purple space galaxy", by 'sololos', Creative #: 91633822. That is most likely the original source. It's also available in a smaller size from the same person at iStock and is called: "Constellations. Cepheus (Cep) - Stock image". The image is purchased by various places to use unrestricted, for example the Irish Times wrote an article and used the image. The "Large" size (assuming that's the size used by the place you plan on purchasing a copy from, to produce their enlarged version) is 4327 x 3245 px (36.64 x 27.47 cm) 300 dpi | 14.0 MP - a 14MP image blown up to 236 x 370 cm will be quite grainy close up. Every pixel will be a 10x10 block, if that was printed at 300 DPI (don't count on it) then 10 pixels would be 1/30th of an inch (~ 1mm). It's more likely to be 1/4 of that resolution, or 4x4 mm blocks. The Wikipedia webpage for Cepheus and the Hubble Telescope image for Cepheus cause me to wonder if the image is correctly titled. 

I'm a "relativist", but I'm not on that page. Because of the CMBR. Google on CMBR reference frame and check out the CMBR dipole anisotropy. It isn't an absolute frame in the strict sense of the word. But you can use it to gauge your speed through the universe. And the universe is as absolute as it gets. 

The horizontals curve down, and because of this the position changes. The photon in its gedanken mirror-box falls down. Then if you were to throw it fast past the Sun you'd say it was deflected - it's moving fast from left to right, but it falls down too. But note that the verticals are not affected. Only half the light path is curved by the Sun. The electron is affected in a similar fashion because of the wave nature of matter. This is why the deflection of matter is half the deflection of light. 

It's a billion miles to Saturn. Well actually the distance varies with the orbits, but see this Space.com article: "At their most distant, when they lie on opposite sides of the sun from one another, they are just over a billion miles (1.7 billion km) apart". The Andromeda galaxy is circa fifteen billion billion miles away. Or circa fifteen quintillion miles. 

Yes, that's a totally different question ... See one of the earliest papers: "Expanding Confusion: Common Misconceptions of Cosmological Horizons and the Superluminal Expansion of the Universe" by Davis and Lineweaver (2003). Newer works: "The Shared Causal Pasts and Futures of Cosmological Events", by Friedman, Kaiser, and Gallicchio (2013). 

Buyer beware. Huge printers are expensive, few places have them; you don't want wallpaper that's too skinny or paper that's not actually "wallpaper". If you check that artists work he photographs a lot of vegetables too. 

Planck's law describes the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature $T$. The spectral radiance of a body, $B_ν$, describes the amount of energy it gives off as radiation of different frequencies. It is measured in terms of the power emitted per unit area of the body, per unit solid angle that the radiation is measured over, per unit frequency. Planck showed that the spectral radiance of a body for frequency $ν$ at absolute temperature $T$ is given by: $$ B_{\nu }(\nu ,T)={\frac {2h\nu ^{3}}{c^{2}}}{\frac {1}{e^{\frac {h\nu }{k_{\mathrm {B} }T}}-1}}$$ where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light in the medium, whether material or vacuum. The spectral radiance can also be measured per unit wavelength $\lambda$ instead of per unit frequency. In this case, it is given by: $$B_{\lambda }(\lambda ,T)={\frac {2hc^{2}}{\lambda ^{5}}}{\frac {1}{e^{\frac {hc}{\lambda k_{\mathrm {B} }T}}-1}}.$$ The law may also be expressed in other terms, such as the number of photons emitted at a certain wavelength, or the energy density in a volume of radiation. The SI units of $B_ν$ are $W·sr^{−1}·m^{−2}·Hz^{−1}$, while those of $B_\lambda$ are $W·sr^{−1}·m^{−3}$. The "Planck Calculator for Infrared Remote Sensing" can be used to make some calculations: 

By doing experiments. Pela mentioned the Michelson-Morley experiment. That's what got Einstein thinking. That's why he came up with the theory of relativity. However other experiments will prove that the speed of light is not the same for every observer. It's the same for every inertial observer, because of the wave nature of matter. But see Is The Speed of Light Everywhere the Same? on the PhysicsFAQ website. It's written by Don Koks, a physicist in Adelaide. He says this: "That the speed of light depends on position when measured by a non-inertial observer is a fact routinely used by laser gyroscopes that form the core of some inertial navigation systems. These gyroscopes send light around a closed loop, and if the loop rotates, an observer riding on the loop will measure light to travel more slowly when it traverses the loop in one direction than when it traverses the loop in the opposite direction. This is known as the Sagnac Effect. The gyroscope does employ such an observer: it is the electronics that sits within the gyro. This electronic observer detects the difference in those light speeds, and attributes that difference to the gyro's not being inertial: it is accelerating within some inertial frame. That measurement of an acceleration allows the body's orientation to be calculated, which keeps it on track and in the right position as it flies". Your measurement of the speed of light is not totally constant, it depends on your acceleration. If you were in a room in an accelerating rocket, you would be what Koks called the "global" observer, and you would say that light at the ceiling travels faster than light down near the floor.
