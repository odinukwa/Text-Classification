Edit (to answer the OP's request in the comment) Proposition: let $K$ be a field and $D$ a commutative $K$-algebra. Suppose that the nilradical $N$ of $D$ is a hyperplane. Then $D$ is local artinian. Proof: since on an arbitrary commutative ring every prime ideal contains the nilradical, it follows from the assumption that $N$ is the only prime ideal, and thus $D$ is artinian. Also it follows that $N$ is the unique maximal ideal, and hence $D$ is local. 

I'll suggest an approach. I'll not focus on $T$ especially: let $H$ be a finitely presentable group, pick a generating set $S$; how can we prove that the unlabeled Cayley graph (denoted $(H,S)$) is isolated among vertex-transitive graphs? 1) a necessary condition for this isolation statement is that $(H,S)$ of $H$ is isolated among labeled Cayley graphs. This condition is simply called, for a group, "isolated", because it does not depend on the generating subset. It is equivalent to be finitely presented and finitely discriminable, where the latter means: having a finite subset $\Omega\subset H\smallsetminus\{1\}$ such that every nontrivial subgroup $N$ of $H$ satisfies $N\cap\Omega\neq\emptyset$. Simple groups, finite groups, are finitely discriminable, but there are many others; for instance Thompson's group $F$. 2) Now here is a condition (X) for $(H,S)$ which implies, if $H$ is isolated, that $(H,S)$ is isolated among vertex-transitive graphs: (X): there exists $R_0\ge 1$ such that every automorphism of the $R_0$-ball in $(H,S)$ fixing 1 is the identity. Indeed, assume that $(H,S)$ satisfies (X). Let $Y$ be a (non-empty) vertex-transitive graph whose $R_0$-balls are isomorphic to the balls of $(H,S)$. Let $G$ be the automorphism group of $Y$. We claim that $G$ acts freely on $Y$. Indeed, assume otherwise, hence there exists a vertex $v$ and $g\in G$ fixing $v$ but not fixing some neighbor $w$ of $v$. Since $g$ is an automorphism of the $R_0$-ball around $v$ and by (X), we deduce that $g$ fixes $w$, a contradiction. Now let us be more precise on the labeling: $(H,S)$ has oriented edges labeled by generators (we can assume wlog $1\notin S$). Now let $v$ be a vertex in $Y$ and $e$ an oriented edge in $Y$ (here I just mean an ordered pair of vertices in $Y$ linked by an edge, since $Y$ is not an oriented graph!), contained in the $R_0$-ball around $v$. Then there exists a unique isomorphism $f_v$ from $B_Y(v,R_0)$ to $B_1((G,S),R_0)$ mapping $v$ to 1, let $s(v,e)\in S$ be the label of the image of $e$ by this isomorphism. Let us show that $s(v,e)$ does not depend on $v$: it is enough to show that $s(v,e)=s(v',e)$ if $v,v'$ are neighboring vertices such that $e$ is in the $R_0$-ball around both. $f_v$ maps $v'$ to some element $t\in S$. Hence, writing $L_g(h)=gh$ in $H$, we see that $L_t^{-1}f_v$ maps $v'$ to 1, and by uniqueness we get $f_{v'}=L_t^{-1}f_v$. $L_t$ preserves the labeling, we deduce that $s(v,e)=s(v',e)$. Hence with this labeling, $Y$ has the same $R_0$-balls as $(H,S)$. On the other hand, the definition of the labeling was canonical and therefore it is invariant by isometries of $Y$. Since, after fixing some vertex 1 in $Y$, $Y$ is the Cayley graph of $G$ with respect to its 1-sphere (call it $S'$), this shows that this is the Cayley labeling of $S'$, modulo the canonical bijection $S'\to S$ mapping $s'$ to the label of $(1,s')$. If now $H$ is isolated and $R_0$ has been chosen large enough, this implies that $S'\to S$ extends to an isomorphism $G\to H$. So you should check (X). You first need to check that the isometry group of the Cayley graph is reduced to $H$, I don't know if it holds for $T$, and maybe this requires a good choice of generating set to avoid obvious symmetries. 

By (a), we can suppose that $F$ is generated by $a,b,c$. If $d$ is the rank of $F$, it is also the rank of its abelianization, and the relation $[a,b]=c^n$ then forces $d\le 2$. Also $d\ge 2$ since $a,b$ don't commute. So $F$ is free on 2 generators (up to now this is exactly Baumslag's argument). Hence $L=F/[F,[F,F]]$ is free 2-step nilpotent on 2 generators. Denote by $A,B,C$ the images of $a,b,c$ in $L$. Since $L/[L,L]$ is torsion-free and $C^n\in [L,L]$, we have $C\in [L,L]$. By (d), we deduce that $L$ is generated by $A,B$. So the endomorphism of $L$ mapping the two free generators to $A$ and $B$ is surjective. By (c) deduce that $L$ is free 2-step nilpotent on $(A,B)$. Since $[A,B]=C^n$, we can use (a) to get a contradiction. (Baumslag's conclusion of the argument also uses a 2-step nilpotent group, but I haven't followed as it's more technical) 

This is beyond the question, but when the dimension $n$ is even, $G$ might be non-irreducible, but in this case it can be viewed as an irreducible subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_{n/2}(\mathbf{C})$, and the same argument (over the field of complex numbers) shows that it's conjugate into unitary matrices, which means that originally $G$ is conjugate into orthogonal matrices. 

7 years ago I wrote in an unfinished paper a proof of this result; I didn't know then if it was original but it indeed seems to be known to a number of specialists although I'm not aware of a written complete proof. Since I don't want anymore to complete this paper, I reproduce the proof here (not self-contained, relying on [LW] below) as Proposition 5; possibly Uri has a more direct approach. I include closely related Proposition 1, which was my original goal. Proposition 1 Let $G$ be a compact group (not necessarily Lie). Consider the action by $G$ by conjugation on $\mathcal{S}(G)$ (the space of subgroups of $G$, endowed with the Chabauty topology). Then the orbits of $G_0$ (connected component of 1) coincide with the connected components of $\mathcal{S}(G)$. As a corollary, for $G$ a compact group, $\mathcal{S}(G)$ is totally disconnected if and only if $G_0$ is central in $G$ (equivalently, $G/Z(G)$ is totally disconnected), a result obtained in [FG]. More generally, it can be checked that for an arbitrary locally compact group $G$, $\mathcal{S}(G)$ is totally disconnected if and only if either totally disconnected, or $G$ is pointwise elliptic with $G_0$ central. ($G$ pointwise elliptic means that every single element generates a cyclic subgroup with compact closure.) Lemma 2 Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $F$ be a finite group. Then there are finitely many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $F\to G$. Proof. The space $\mathrm{Hom}(F,G)$ can be described as a real algebraic variety, so has finitely many components. By [LW], all homomorphisms in a given component are conjugate under $G_0$. \end{proof} Lemma 3 Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $S$ be a connected compact semisimple Lie group. Then there are finitely many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $S\to G$. Proof. The space $\mathrm{Hom}(S,G)$ is canonically identified with the space of Lie algebra homomorphisms $\mathfrak{s}\to\mathfrak{g}$, which is an algebraic variety as well, so has finitely many connected components. So we can again use [LW]. Lemma 4 Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. Let $D$ be a connected compact abelian Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of homomorphisms $D\to G$. Proof. Any such homomorphism maps into a maximal torus, and all maximal tori are conjugate [Bourbaki, Groupes et Algèbres de Lie, Chap 9, §2.2]. This reduces to the case when $G$ is a torus, but then the result just follows from the fact that $\mathrm{Hom}((\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z})^a,(\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z})^b)\simeq\mathbf{Z}^{ab}$, which is countable. Lemma 5 Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of closed connected subgroups in $G$. Proof. Since there are finitely many isomorphism types of compact semisimple groups in a given dimension, we can fix this type, so by Lemma 3, it is enough to consider the set of closed connected subgroups whose semisimple part is a given subgroup $S$. Therefore, it is enough to count conjugacy classes of closed abelian connected subgroups in $N(S)/S$, where $N(\cdot)$ denotes the normalizer, and Lemma 4 applies. Proposition 6 Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. Then there are countably many conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in $G$. Proof. By Lemma 5, we can consider those subgroups for which $H_0=L$ is given. So it is enough to count conjugacy classes of finite subgroups in $N(L)/L$, there are countably many because of Lemma 2. Proof of Proposition 1 We begin with the case when $G$ is a Lie group. Since $G_0$ has finite index in $G$, Proposition 6 implies that there are countably many $G_0$-conjugacy classes of closed subgroups in $G$. Let $C$ be a connected component of $\mathcal{S}(G)$. Clearly, it is invariant under conjugation by $G_0$. We just obtained that the quotient of $C$ by the action of $G_0$ is countable. It is also a compact connected Hausdorff space, so is reduced to a point (it is Hausdorff because the acting group is compact, see [Bourbaki, Topologie Générale, III, §4.1]. This means that $G_0$ acts transitively on each connected component of $\mathcal{S}(G)$, and we are done. Now let us deal with a general compact group $G$. (It is no longer true in general that the set of connected components of $\mathcal{S}(G)$ is countable). We write $G$ as a projective limit of compact Lie groups $G/K_i$. Clearly, if two elements $H,H'$ of $\mathcal{S}(G)$ are conjugate under $G_0$, then they lie in the same component. Conversely, suppose they belong to the same connected component of $\mathcal{S}(G)$. Then since $K_i$ is compact, the projection map $\mathcal{S}(G)\to\mathcal{S}(G/K_i)$ is continuous. Because of the case of Lie groups, there exists $g_i\in G_0$ such that $(g_iHg_i^{-1}K_i=H'K_i)$ (we use the fact that the inverse image of the unit component of $G/K_i$ is the unit component of $G$). Let $g$ be a limit point of $(g_i)$. If $h\in H$, then $g_ihg_i^{-1}$ can be written as $h'_ik_i$ with $h'_i\in H'$ and $k_i\in K_i$. Necessarily $k_i\to 1$, so $h'_i=g_ihg_i^{-1}k_i^{-1}$ also converges, necessarily to an element $h'$ of $H'$. We have $ghg^{-1}=h'$. This proves that $gHg^{-1}\subset H'$, and the converse inclusion $g^{-1}H'g\subset H'$ is strictly similar. [FG] S. Fisher, P. Gartside. On the space of subgroups of a compact group II. Topology Appl. 156 (2009) 855-861 [LW] D.H. Lee, T.S. Wu. On conjugacy of homomorphisms of topological groups. Illinois J. Math. 13 1969 694-699 in [LW] I refer to Theorem 2.6: if $G,H$ are compact Lie groups, then the connected components of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ are precisely the $H_0$-orbits (for action by post-conjugation). 

Here's a counterexample. Let $p$ be any prime; let $G$ be the upper unipotent group in dimension 4 over the field $F_p$ ($G$ has order $p^6$). Then $G$ does not satisfy the property you call "normal", i.e. $G$ has two non-conjugate cyclic subgroups with the same normal closure. For $i<j$, let $e_{ij}=1+E_{ij}\in G$ be the elementary matrix (1 on the diagonal and at the entry $ij$, 0 elsewhere). The center of $G$ has order $p$ with generator $e_{14}$. Let $U$ and $V$ be the cyclic subgroups generated by $e_{23}$ and $e_{23}e_{14}$ respectively (both have order $p$). Since $U$ and $V$ coincide modulo the center and since, in every nilpotent group, every nontrivial normal subgroup of $G$ has nontrivial intersection with the center, $U$ and $V$ have the same normal closure. We claim that $U$ and $V$ are not conjugate. Indeed, otherwise, $e_{23}$ is conjugate to some power $(e_{23}e_{14})^k$ ($1\le k\le p-1$), and projecting on the abelianization shows that $k=1$. So, for some $g$, we have $ge_{23}g^{-1}=e_{23}e_{14}$. But a direct computation shows that if $g=\begin{pmatrix}1 & a & * & *\\ 0 & 1 & b & *\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & c\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$, then $e_{23}^{-1}ge_{23}g^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & a & -ac\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & c\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$. The latter matrix cannot be equal to $e_{14}$ and we have a contradiction; thus $U$ and $V$ are not conjugate. 

$O_K$ is a discrete cocompact subring in $K=\mathbf{R}^{r_1}\times\mathbf{C}^{r_2}$. So the group $U_K^\times$ of invertible elements of $O_K$ is a discrete subgroup in $K^\times$, the group of invertible elements of $K$, which is isomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^{r_1+r_2}\times W$ with $W$ compact (isomorphic to $(\mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z})^{r_1}\times(\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z})^{r_2}$). A discrete subgroup of such a Lie group is finitely generated and its $\mathbf{Q}$-rank is bounded above by $r_1+r_2$. Indeed the composite homomorphism $U_K\to \mathbf{R}^{r_1+r_2}$ is proper and hence maps injectively $U_K$ to a discrete subgroup of $\mathbf{R}^{r_1+r_2}$. (Probably the upper bound by $r_1+r_2-1$ comes from an additional argument saying that $U_K$ goes into some subgroup of elements of norm one, but the point here is precisely that we don't need this to get the above weaker upper bound $r_1+r_2$.) 

Let us first prove (a). The proof of the easier (b) is below. Let $T$ be the group of translations in $\Gamma$. We distinguish two cases (the main one being the third). 1) $T$ is cyclic (either trivial or infinite). Assuming that $X$ is not transfixed, since $\Gamma$ is finitely generated, by (Prop. 4B2 here), there exists a $\Gamma$-orbit $\Omega$ such that $\Omega\cap X$ is non-transfixed. Fixing a point $\xi$ in $\Omega$, write $\Omega=\Gamma/\Lambda$; that $\Omega\cap X$ is not transfixed implies that the number $e(\Gamma,\Lambda)$ of ends of the coset space $\Gamma/\Lambda$ is $\ge 2$ (by definition $e(\Gamma,\Lambda)>1$ means that $\Gamma/\Lambda$ has a $\Gamma$-commensurated subset that is not transfixed, or equivalently that is neither finite nor cofinite). Then $\Gamma$ is a polycyclic group. Houghton (1982) proved that for a polycyclic group $\Gamma$, a subgroup $\Lambda$ satisfies $e(\Gamma,\Lambda)>1$ iff $\Lambda$ has Hirsch length 1 less than $\Gamma$ and has normalizer of finite index in $\Gamma$. Hence here, let $P$ be this normalizer and $P_+$ the set of motions in $P$ (of index at most 2 in $P$). Let $Y$ be the set of points in the plane fixed by $\Lambda$. Then $\xi\in Y$ and $Y$ is $P$-invariant. Then $Y$ is an affine subspace. If $Y=\{\xi\}$, then $\xi$ is fixed by $P_+$, which is thus a group of rotations. Since $\Gamma$ is infinite, so is $P_+$, and so is some finite index subgroup $Q$ of $P_+$ that is normal in $\Gamma$; then $\xi$ is the unique fixed point of $Q$, and hence is fixed by $\Gamma$, a contradiction since $\Omega=\{\xi\}$ was supposed to contained a non-transfixed subset. If $Y$ is the plane, then $P_+$ is trivial, so $\Gamma$ is finite, a contradiction. If $Y$ is a line, then $P_+$ acts by translations parallel to this line. Since $\Gamma$ is not virtually cyclic, $P_+$ is a finitely generated abelian group of $\mathbf{Q}$-rank $\ge 2$ and thus is 1-ended; it acts freely on the plane and hence transfixes every subset it commensurates, again a contradiction. 2) $T$ is not cyclic (hence either it contains a free abelian group of rank 2, or a rank 1 infinitely generated abelian group of rank 1). A result of Oxley (Math Z, 1972) implies that $T$ is 1-ended, in the sense that every subset of $T$ commensurated by $T$-translations is finite or cofinite (from his paper, use Proposition 3.3 in rank $\ge 2$ and Proposition 3.11 in the infinitely generated rank 1 case). Hence the intersection of $X$ with every $T$-orbit is either finite or cofinite. Actually this intersection is empty or the whole orbit for all but finitely many orbits [*]. Hence we can find a subset $X'$ with $X'\Delta X$ finite, that is $T$-invariant. Since $T$ is normalized by $\Gamma$, $\Gamma$ permutes the $T$-cosets. Hence $X'\Delta\gamma X'$, for $\gamma\in\Gamma$, is a union of $T$-cosets, and thus either infinite or empty. Since $X'$ is commensurated by the $\Gamma$-action, it is thus empty and $X'$ is $\Gamma$-invariant, so $X$ is $\Gamma$-transfixed. [*] Suppose the contrary. Consider a countable infinite disjoint union $T\times I$ of copies of $T$ and for all $i$ a subset $F_i$ of $T$ (nonempty finite or a proper cofinite subset) such that the disjoint union $\bigcup F_i\times\{i\}$ is commensurated by $T$. Passing to complements, we can suppose that all $F_i$ are nonempty finite. Fix an infinite cyclic subgroup $Z$ of $T$. We can find elements $t_i\in T$ such that the $F_i+t_i\subset T$ are pairwise disjoint, and disjoint of $Z$. Then $\bigcup F_i+t_i$ is commensurated, infinite, disjoint from $Z$ and hence with infinite complement. This contradicts that $T$ is 1-ended.
