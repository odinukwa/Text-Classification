Accept that the formalized versions of Godel's Theorems follow from whatever axioms are used, but only because you believe those axioms are inconsistent. Deny that the formalized versions of Godel's Theorems mean what they're supposed to mean, and just regard what's happening in point 1 as a valid string of symbolic manipulations. Accept the natural language meaning of Godel's Theorems, in spite of point 2, for trivial reasons, since they say, "if PA is consistent, ..." 

$$2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1$$ The Continuum Hypothesis is an example of an undecidable statement par excellence. It is an example of a problem that is: 

My question: What are some combinatorial/order-theoretic conditions on a poset that are necessary and/or sufficient for the poset to never/not always add a dominating real? 

so $f$ is not dominated by $\dot{g}$, contradiction. For the forward implication, it should suffice to show it in the case where for each $m$, the set $\{ u _{m,k} : k \in \omega \}$ is an antichain with least upper bound $u$ independent of $m$ (I haven't checked this detail personally). So let $\{ u _{m,k}\}$ be such a collection for which the identity fails. Consider the name: 

In other words this is saying there's a strategy $\Sigma$ for player II such that for any play from player I, consisting of a condition $p$ and a (partial) $\omega$-sequence of $P$-names for ordinals $\pi$, $\Sigma (p, \pi)$ produces a condition $q$ extending $p$, and a (partial) $\omega$-sequence of ordinals $\sigma$ such that $\forall n \in \mathrm{dom} (\pi),\\ q \Vdash \exists k \in \mathrm{dom} (\sigma) (\pi (n) = \sigma (k))$. 

Let us say that a poset $P$ is $\mathbf{\kappa}$-directed iff every collection of fewer than $\kappa$-many elements in $P$ has an upper bound in $P$. $P$ has the $\mathbf{\kappa}$ chain condition iff every antichain in $P$ has size less than $\kappa$. Consider statements of the form: 

I've been told that when applying for a teaching position, your reference letters can be written by anyone who is familiar with your teaching capabilities in detail. I feel that this primarily just means students, but I wonder if there's some unspoken rule that reference letters should come from people in positions of authority, e.g. professors for whom I've served as TA, administrative staff in the math department, etc. In reality, it's the students who know my teaching capabilities in detail, and perhaps to a lesser degree my friends, whereas professors and administrators have no direct knowledge my teaching abilities whatsoever, and might only have heard things here or there from students, or have read my student evaluations and seen the scores. 

Vopenka - no, take models of the empty language of different (finite) sizes huge - no, obviously (taking the elementary embedding definition) 

Let $\mathcal{G}$ denote the class of all groups. Define $$\mathcal{M} = \left\{ f : \mathcal{G} \dashrightarrow \bigcup\mathcal{G} : \left(\forall G \in \mathrm{dom}(f)\right)\left(f(G) \in G\setminus\{\mathrm{id}_G\}\right)\right\}$$ In other words, $\mathcal{M}$ consists of all set-sized partial choice functions on the class of all groups, excluding choice functions that ever pick the identity. The empty function is the identity of this class group, the inverse of a function in $\mathcal{M}$ is its point-wise inverse, and multiplication is defined as follows: 

My question is simply a reference request: does anyone know where I can find a proof of this statement? 

This is (a variation on) exercise 20.4 in Jech's "Set Theory." Let $j : V \to M$ witness $\lambda$-supercompactness of $\kappa$, and consider the normal measure $U$ on $P_{\kappa}(\lambda)$ consisting of those $x$ such that $j[\lambda] \in j(x)$. (How do you make the left quotation mark symbol to denote 'j-image-of-lambda'?) We want to show that this measure extends the club filter. This hint is as follows: Suppose $C$ is club. Then define $D = j[C]$. Then: 

$C_{\alpha}$ is a club in $\alpha$ of order type $< \alpha$, and $C_{\alpha} = C_{\beta} \cap \alpha$ whenever $\alpha$ is a limit point of $C_{\beta}$ 

Galvin's conjecture, restricted to posets $P$ which are the Cartesian product of two linear orders (with the obvious product ordering). GC restricted to posets which are the Cartesian product of countably many linear orders (countable = finite or denumerable). GC restricted to posets which are subsets of some Cartesian product of countably many linear orders. 

You can easily generalize this to talking about functions $\kappa \to \lambda$; the above two results so generalized are precisely Theorem 15.38 and Lemma 15.39 in Jech, "Set Theory". 

EDIT: (in response to your edit) So we're assuming PA proves FTA, PA is consistent, and FTA might be false? What do you mean by "false," you mean false in the standard intepretation? In that case, PA would be false in the standard interpretation. Now if we take Godel's first theorem to say, "If PA is consistent, then there is a true formula in the standard interpretation which is not provable from PA," then this meta-theorem is certainly true. EDIT: Ignas requested an explanation of some of the basics to make sense of my claim, "If PA proves FTA, and FTA fails in the standard model, then so does PA." It's too big to fit in a comment so I'm adding it to my response: Let $\mathcal{L}$ denote the first order language of number theory, we'll have lower case Greek letters vary over sentences of $\mathcal{L}$, upper case Greek letters vary over sets of sentences of $\mathcal{L}$, and upper case Roman letters vary over $\mathcal{L}$ structures. We write $M \vDash \varphi$ to denote that $\varphi$ is true in the model $M$, i.e. when its symbols are interpreted according to $M$. Tarski's definition of truth for a sentence in a given model is by recursion on the complexity of the sentence. We write $M \vDash \Sigma$ if every member of $\Sigma$ is true in $M$. We write $\Sigma \vDash \varphi$ if for every $M$, $M \vDash \Sigma$ implies $M \vDash \varphi$, i.e. if every model of $\Sigma$ is also a model of $\varphi$. For provability, we write $\Sigma \vdash \varphi$ to say that there is a (finite) proof of $\varphi$ using (finitely many) sentences from $\Sigma$ as axioms. The Soundness Theorem states that for all $\Sigma ,\ \varphi$, if $\Sigma \vdash \varphi$ then $\Sigma \vDash \varphi$. It's this theorem, with PA in place of $\Sigma$ and FTA in place of $\varphi$, that I'm using to establish the claim you're asking about. The converse of this theorem is also true; it's Godel's Completeness Theorem. Putting these two theorems together, they say that the relations $\vdash$ and $\vDash$ are the same relation between sets of sentences and sentences. One (perhaps not immediately obvious) way to rephrase this is, "being true in every model is the same as being provable from no axioms." Contrast this Godel's Incompletness Theorem, which says that "being true in the standard model of number theory is not the same as being provable from PA." 

I can't believe this formula is $\Delta _0$, but in order to apply the previous lemma we really only need it to be $\Sigma _1$, which I might believe is the case. We would also need to throw in $\omega _1$ as a parameter, but we're free to do that since we could take $\{ a, \omega _1 \}$ to be our parameter from $H _{\omega _2}$ in applying the above lemma. I can see why most of this is $\Sigma _1$ but there is a subformula for which I can't see this, and the problem I'm having is that I don't know the complexity of $C$. Specific Questions: Consider the subformula: $\forall \alpha, \beta \in x$, $(\alpha \in \mathrm{lim}(C_{\beta}) \rightarrow y(\alpha) \neq y(\beta))$ 

Here's an answer to a related question which involves much more standard terminology. Say $A \subset L$ is an antichain iff $\forall x, y \in A(x \neq y \rightarrow x \wedge y = 0)$. If $A_1$ and $A_2$ are two antichains, then $A_1 \wedge A_2$ is yet another antichain which we say "refines" both $A_1$ and $A_2$. Proof: If $x_i, y_i \in A_i$ with $x_i \wedge y_i = 0$, then clearly $(x_1 \wedge x_2) \wedge (y_1 \wedge y_2) = 0. \\ \\ \square $ The notion of antichain makes sense even if the joins $\bigvee (S - \{ x \})$ aren't defined. If $L$ satisfies $\forall x \in L\ \forall S \subset L\ (x \wedge \bigvee S = \bigvee (\{ x \} \wedge S)$ then the notions of "antichain" and "mutually disjoint" coincide. 

strong - no, obviously (taking the elementary embedding definition) Woodin - ditto strongly compact: 

In modern notation, it says, "if $\kappa$ is a cardinal and $\kappa ^{< \kappa} = \kappa$, then $\kappa$ is strongly inaccessible." This isn't entirely true since the antecedent holds for $\kappa = \omega$ but $\omega$ isn't considered strongly inaccessible, but that's not a big deal. More importantly, under CH the antecedent will hold of $\aleph _1$ but $\aleph _1$ isn't a limit cardinal. So we need to add the assumptions that $\kappa$ is an uncountable limit cardinal. Given that, we can proceed: So let's assume $\kappa ^{< \kappa} = \kappa$. First we show $\kappa$ is strong limit: $\kappa \leq 2^{< \kappa} \leq \kappa ^{< \kappa} = \kappa$. Next we show $\kappa$ is regular: Suppose not, then $\kappa ^{< \kappa} = \kappa < \kappa ^{ \mathrm{cf} ( \kappa) } \leq \kappa ^{< \kappa}$, contradiction. 

The intuitive idea here is you want to take the Cartesian product of all the groups. In other words, your mother group would consist of all the class-sized choice functions on $\mathcal{G}$. Of course, a class can't have class-sized elements, so we try to settle for taking the class of all set-sized partial choice functions on $\mathcal{G}$. The problem with that boils down to what to take as the identity element? Or in other words, how do you differentiate a partial choice function from one that is similar, but additionally picks out some identity elements from groups in its domain? The solution is to "disallow" choosing the identity. This leads us to make the identity of this mother group the empty choice function, and to define multiplication essentially like point-wise multiplication, except that we remove any identities in the result. 

Given any bijection $f : \mathbb{Q} \to R$ where $(R,\oplus,\otimes)$ is some (necessarily countable) ring, you'll be able to get a new ring structure $(\mathbb{Q},\boxplus,\boxtimes)$ isomorphic to $(R,\oplus,\otimes)$, by setting: $a \boxplus b = f^{-1}(f(a)\oplus f(b))$ $a \boxtimes b = f^{-1}(f(a)\otimes f(b))$ The nicer $f$ is, the nicer the expressions for $\boxplus$ and $\boxtimes$ will be. Perhaps the simplest examples are if $p \in \mathbb{Q}^\times,\ q\in \mathbb{Q}$, $R = \mathbb{Q}$, then $f(x) = px+q$ will work. This generalizes Neil's and Pace's answers. The "converse" is trivially true, in that if $f : (\mathbb{Q},\boxplus,\boxtimes) \to (R,\oplus,\otimes)$ is an isomorphism from some ring structure on $\mathbb{Q}$ to a ring $R$, then $f$ is a bijection $\mathbb{Q} \to R$ and $a \boxplus b = f^{-1}(f(a)\oplus f(b))$ $a \boxtimes b = f^{-1}(f(a)\otimes f(b))$ So in some sense, the above method for getting a ring structure on $\mathbb{Q}$ is the only way to do it. The question (more or less) boils down to, "for which rings $(R,\oplus,\otimes)$ is there a 'nice' bijection $\mathbb{Q} \to R$?" It depends, of course, on what you think "nice" means. 

I should add that if we think of $u _{m,n}$ as saying "$\dot{g}(m) = n$" and replace the Boolean operations with the corresponding quantifiers, then the left side says "$\dot{g}$ is a real," and the right side says "$\dot{g}$ doesn't dominate every real in the ground model." This suggests how we can characterize forcings that don't add any unbounded reals, for example, namely the following identity holds: 

Is it $\Sigma _1$, and if so why? It would suffice to know that $c = C_{\beta}$ is $\Sigma _1$ in $c$ and $\beta$. Later on in the proof it seems to be tacitly assumed that $H _{\omega _2}$ computes $C$ correctly. Can I be sure that $H _{\omega _2}$ computes $C$ correctly (up to $\omega _2$ of course)? Stevo proves the lemma in question using some pretty big guns - the Covering Lemma and the canonical constructible square sequence. He also uses a proper forcing which, unless you knew how it was going to be used beforehand, appears like it would be of no use in proving the lemma. Does anyone know of a more direct proof of the lemma I'm talking about? Or, since I often find in reading Stevo's work that he uses forcing posets which I would never think to use, can anyone put this proof in perspective, and motivate why it makes sense to do the proof this way? 

I've come across the same issue (that it's difficult to explain math to non-mathematicians) many times, but inspired by this thread I decided to think more precisely about possible causes and solutions to this problem. I was further inspired because my dad happens to be in town, and when I tried to explain set theory to him, one response I got from him was essentially the same one you got, "so you're trying to describe ultimate reality." First, I think the following important features about mathematics in general (i.e. not just set theory specifically) are unknown to most people: 

The first two will guarantee that we have a copy of $R$ sitting inside our resulting structure, the third guarantees that this structure is a commutative ring, and the last guarantees that everything in $A$ has a unit. 

These responses implicitly appear to justify large cardinal axioms on some non-classical, non-platonist notion of truth - some combination of an aesthetic/pragmatic/coherentist theory of truth. So perhaps I should refine my question to be: What motivates many set theorists to evaluate new axioms by these non-classical standards (or am I way off base)? I should emphasize that I'm not only interested in the justification of these new axioms, but the motivation behind justifying these axioms the way that set theorists appear to justify them, as these axioms seem to be justified in a categorically different way from how Peano's axioms or Zermelo's axioms are justified. [/EDIT] ${}^{\dagger}$This Wikipedia article on Large Cardinals mentions the Cabal for instance. Secondary Question I've made some specific claims about specific statements in specific theories that I feel ought to be true or ought to at least be decidable. Admittedly I haven't given any general explanations for what sort of things ought to be true, false, decidable, or neither, I've just stated my opinion on a few specific sentences. I doubt one could give a totally general account distinguishing the class of problems that ought to be decidable from the class of problems that needn't be (e.g. make a categorical distinction between statements "like" CH versus statements "like" Godel's self-referential sentence). I don't think it's the type of question amenable to total generalization or formalization. Nonetheless: Can anyone shed some light on the apparent distinction between questions that a good theory ought to decide and those a good theory needn't decide?
