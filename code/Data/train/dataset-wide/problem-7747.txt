Given a quadratic form in $5$ variables, the theta series is a weight $5/2$ modular form. For a weight $3/2$ modular form we know that there always is a linear combination of theta series that work via the solution to the basis problem. But I have not found a reference addressing this in the $5/2$ case: it seems that Pizer adds weight instead of dimensions in his work to get higher weight classical forms. 

The linear case is Siegel's lemma. I do not know the quadratic case: Cassels does not have it, perhaps O'Meara does. Note that the regulator is closely related where we seek a representation of $1$ by $x^2-dy^2$ in integers, and bounds on the regulator are hard. 

The Galois group of the splitting field is D4, the symmetries of a square. D4 has a unique normal cyclic subgroup of order 4, the rotations. Therefore we can write the Galois closure as a unique C4 extension of a quadratic field over $\mathbb{Q}$. The quadratic field will be classified by its discriminant, which should be some function in $a$ and $b$. The C4 extension will be determined by class field theory. If we work over $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ instead the C4 extension will be represented by an element that can be written down in terms of $a$ and $b$. The criterion for isomorphism then becomes the discriminant and the element being equal. 

Consider the quadratic form $5x^2+6y^2$. This has Conway Sloan $2$-adic symbol $[1^{-1}2^{-1}]_0$. After a sign walk from $1$ to $2$ the symbol becomes $[1^{+1}2^{+1}]_4$. However, there doesn't exist a form with this symbol as the oddities of each summand are limited to $1$ and $7$ and there is no solution modulo $8$ to the equation. This seems to contradict the statement on page 384 of Conway-Sloan about existence that the existence condition for compartments is that the total oddity have the same parity as the total dimension. It is still possible to ensure any compartment in a train not the first one has an even number of minus signs in it, and all such expressions will have the same oddities and sequence of dimensions for each compartment. But it is not clear the compartments will be isomorphic given the above failure to carry out intracompartment sign-walking, and so I don't know if normalizing the compartments will produce a normal form. My question then: if two trains are isomorphic, and both trains have been normalized so that any compartment that is not the first compartment (or if the train starts with a Type II form, all compartments) has an even number of minus signs, are the compartments necessarily isomorphic over the $2$-adic integers? 

In Ralf Schmidt's appendix to "Jacquet-Langlands-Shimizu correspondence for theta lifts to $\mathrm{GSp}(2)$ and its inner forms" by Narita and Okazaki , he computes the representations of $\mathrm{GSp}(1,1)$ by examining the tables in his book and discarding the representations whose Weil-Deligne representations fall in the Siegel parabolic. He obtains the answer of IIa, IVa, IVc, Va, Vb, Vc, and VIc. When I try to replicate the calculation I run into the following problem: representations of type VIa and VIb look almost identical to those of Va. But Va is included and VIa and VIb are not. Furthermore, as written almost all the nilpotent matrices seem to fall neatly into the Siegel parabolic, and the representations are diagonal. My guess is that we have to compute the image of the Galois representation, and that this cannot be easily read off from the Weil-Deligne representation. Unfortunately I've not succeeded in seeing how to do this either: the discussion in chapter $2$ of Local Newforms for $\mathrm{GSp}(4)$ is not helping. 

Given any admissible representation of $G(\mathbb{R})$ one can construct a $(\mathfrak{g}, K)$ module from it. Isomorphism of the admissible representations is not the same as isomorphism of the $(\mathfrak{g}, K)$ modules (called infinitesimal isomorphism), but these notions agree for unitary representations. Therefore we lose nothing in looking at $(\mathfrak{g}, K)$ modules if we're working with forms that are going to have unitary real representation. So it is a purely representation theoretic reason to introduce this terminology. 

Suppose $\rho:G _{\mathbb{Q}} \rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is a Galois rep. It has a uniquely defined (up to semisimplification residual rep $\bar{\rho}$. $\bar{\rho}$ is unramified where $\rho$ is. I have examples where it becomes good at a prime where $\rho$ is bad. Can it become more ramified then $\rho$? What constraints on the degree of the ramification of $\bar{\rho}$ do we know in terms of ramification of $\rho$. Suppose now we have an $L$ function, and know the bad factors of the $L$ function. Does this help us further? What if $p$ is itself a bad prime: can we still say anything? Note that I cannot assume that this Galois rep is motivic. 

Tits' Corvallis article introduces a map on special fibers of group schemes associated to the elements fixing sets pointwise in a building from $\bar{\mathcal{P}_\Omega}$ to $\bar{\mathcal{P}_{\Omega'}}$ where $\Omega' \subset \Omega$, but that is all he does with this map. In particular there is nothing about injectivity. Is it injective when we look at the maximal reductive quotients of the $\mathcal{P}$? By the discussion in $3.5$ it is enough to answer for facets. I've looked in Bruhat-Tits' 5 articles and have not found anything about this, but it is very possible I am not looking in the right places for it. 

You might want to try Brandt matrices and lattice methods instead. If you can write your function as a theta series, then the computation of the terms can be done very quickly through multiplication of power series. See $URL$ for an introduction to the theory, and note that $\sum q^{ax^2+by^2+cz^2}=\sum q^{ax^2} \cdot \sum q^{by^2} \cdot \sum q^{cy^2}$, and the product can be evaluated very quickly. There is a complication given by the fact you want a character, but you can twist theta series to get them to transform with a particular character. 

This question is probably very open if we want to be rigorous. With the roughest heuristics, the chance $p$ divides a polynomial value $f_i$ is $1/p$, and so the chance of recovering $p$ is $1/p^n$ where $n$ is the number of polynomials. Now if we sum over all primes and $n>2$ the expected number of solutions is less than $1$. While we know there is a solution, we won't find it by random search by this heuristic argument. 

I know how to construct the space of isogenies as a scheme. We start by noting that isogenies are exactly the elements of the $\mathrm{Hom}(E_1, E_2)$ that map the identity to the identity. Since $\mathrm{Hom}$ is representable for projective $E_1$ and $E_2$ by carving the graphs out of the Hilbert scheme of $E_1 \times E_2$, we have some kind of representation of the isogenies as a scheme, and it may be very explicit if you write down parts of the Hilbert scheme explicitly. What I don't know is what geometric properties it has that can be proven from this description.
