Let $f: S \to \Bbb R$ be a Morse function on a Riemann surface. Let $x_0$ be a saddle point of $f$. Since $x_0$ is a critical point of $f$, it makes sense to talk about the bilinear forms $f_{z\overline{z}}(x_0)$, $f_{zz}(x_0)$ and $f_{\overline{z}\overline{z}}(x_0)$ as components of the real Hessian of $f$ at $x_0$ (if one only allows only complex coordinates). Can $f$ be arranged so that the Hermitian form $f_{z\overline{z}}$, which can be defined on all $S$, is arbitrarily small (compared to some fixed Hermitian metric) and $|f_{zz}(x_0)|$(as a number) is arbitrarily big in a fixed coordinate system around $x_0$? 

I am looking for an example of a u.p (unique product) group which is not Right ordered. Almost any group I pick up (obviously torsion free, as u.p. group cannot have torsion element, so no use looking in groups with torsion ) turns out to be $RO$, whether it be easy groups like integers, modulo n etc, or groups on matrices, or free groups , etc. Also I have not seen any example of a non- $RO$ group(torsion free), yet. Which is the easiest example of a non-$RO$ group (torsion free)? A group $G$ is said to be u.p., if given any two finite non empty subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G$, there exist at least one element $x$ which has a unique representation $x=ab$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. 

I suspect that the following matrix inequality is well known, but I can't find a reference or proof: Given $n \times n$ symmetric matrices $A,B$ such that $I_n \leq A,B$, is the following true? $${Tr}\big[\big( \log A^{\frac{1}{2}} B A^{\frac{1}{2}}\big)^p\big] \geq {Tr}\big[\big( \log B \big)^p\big] + {Tr}\big[\big( \log A\big)^p\big].$$ For clarity, for a continuous function $f$ and symmetric matrix $C$, $f(C)$ is simply equal to $U {diag}(f(\lambda_1),...,f(\lambda_n))U^t$, where $U$ is a unitary matrix diagonalizing $C$, i.e., $C = U diag(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n)U^t$. UPDATE: after the discussion with amakelov below, I edited the statement to be more aesthetic. 

Let G be a finite solvable group. If p,q,r are distinct primes dividing |G|, then G contains an element of order the product of two of these three primes. This is lucido's three prime lemma. I encountered it in a paper. Could not solve it yet, but also had a thought that will there be a bigger class of finite groups for which it holds, a class which contains all solvable groups. Can somebody give a proof of original, and tell me has there been some research in the direction of classes for which it is true? 

I don't know how late this is for an answer, but as long as at point $x_0$ of $\partial \Omega$ where the assumptions of the Hopf Boundary lemma are satisfied, $l(x_0)$ is not tangential to the boundary(outgoing) then the bound $\partial u/ \partial l(x_0) >0$ will be satisfied. Infact you don't even need smoothness of the boundary, as it is detailed in page 34 of Gilbarg and Trudinger. 

I recently came across a Dirichlet problem for a vector valued functions. In broad terms the problem is as follows. Suppose $\Omega \subset \Bbb R^n$ is a smooth bounded domain, $P:C^\infty(X)^n \to C^\infty(X)^n$ is a second order vector valued differential operator with elliptic symbol (in my case the second order part is just the Laplacian on each component) and $f \in C^\infty(\bar \Omega)^n$. Under what conditions does the boundary value problem $P(u)=f$ $u|_{\partial \Omega}=0$ have a unique solution for $u \in C^\infty(X)$? Clearly, to provide a weak solution one can still apply the Fredholm alternative to see that uniqueness guarantees existence. So then the obvious question arises: what guarantees uniqueness? In the scalar case, when the zero order term is negative this is automatic by a weak version of the maximum principle. But I don't know what is the analogous condition in the vector valued case. It would be nice to have a reference for these type of "PDE systems". 

The zero divisor conjecture implies the idempotent conjecture as $1$ and $0$ are the only idempotents in a ring with unity and no zero-divisors, nothing sure about the other way around 

Here $\Delta(G) = \{ g \in G : |G:C_G(g)| < \infty \}$ and $U_1(\mathbb{Z}G) $ is the set of normalized units of the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z}G$ i.e. units with augmentation $1$ In the proof, author first reduces to the case that $G=\Delta(G)$ (which is fine) but after that he says that as we are assuming $G= \Delta {G}$, there is no loss in generality in taking $G$ to be finitely generated. Now for $G=\Delta(G)$, why we do not lose any generality by proving it only for finitely generated groups. Is there some result like, there is no infinitely generated group which has all its conjugacy classes of finite cardinality? I do not think I am aware of any such result. Also $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} \dots$ being abelian has only singelton conjugacy classes. Title of Paper- "Trivial Units in Group Rings" Authors- Daniel R. Farkas and Peter A.

I'm not sure if this is a complete answer to your question, but hopefully it's helpful. First, I'm going to constantly use the fact that I can go back and forth between thinking about ideals in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ with codimension $n$, $n$-dimensional quotient algebras of $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$, and certain zero-dimensional closed subschemes of $\mathbb{A}^2$. Each of these quotient algebras is going to be a finite product of local algebras. Each factor gives a maximal ideal in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$, so we can think of the algebra as being supported at finitely many points of the plane. Each of these local algebras has finite dimension as a complex vector space, and we will call this dimension the multiplicity of the subscheme at the corresponding point. The sum of the multiplicities will be $n$. The crux of the matter is then to understand these zero-dimensional local algebras. There is another space, which I will call $\mathcal{H}^m$, which is confusingly also called the punctual Hilbert scheme, which parametrizes $m$-dimensional quotient algebras of $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ supported at a given point. Since this is the same as $m$-dimensional quotient algebras of the power series ring $\mathbb{C}[[x,y]]$, it doesn't matter which point we're looking at, or even which (smooth) surface. For low $m$, it's not too hard to describe $\mathcal{H}^m$. For $m=1$, the punctual Hilbert scheme consists of a single point corresponding to the ideal $(x,y)$. For $m=2$, the ideals are all of the form $(ax+by)$, which consist of polynomials with vanishing directional derivative in a specified direction. For $m=3$, there are two types of points: there's the so-called "fat point" $(x,y)^2=(x^2,xy,y^2)$, which consists of polynomials with both partials vanishing, and the curvilinear points $(ax+by,cx^2+dxy+ey^2)$ consisting of polynomials with vanishing first and second derivatives in a specified direction. Now let's talk about the relationship between the $\mathcal{H}^n$ and your punctual Hilbert schemes. We're going to want to start with something somewhat similar to the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points, called the Chow variety of $n$ points. The Chow variety can be defined as $(\mathbb{A}^2)^n/S_n$, where $S_n$ is the symmetric group. We can think of it as parametrizing points in $\mathbb{A}^2$ with multiplicities. There's a Hilbert-Chow morphism from the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points to the Chow variety of $n$ points which sends an ideal to its support with multiplicity. The fibers of the Hilbert-Chow morphism are going to be products of punctual Hilbert schemes. Let's see how this works for Hilbert schemes of small numbers of points. If we're dealing with two points, we have two types of points in the Chow variety. If we write points of the Chow variety additively, we have things of the form $p+q$ with $p$ and $q$ distinct, and we have points of the form $2p$. The fiber of the Hilbert-Chow morphism over $p+q$ will be a single point. The fiber over $2p$ will be $\mathcal{H}^2$. For three points, we have $p+q+r$, $p+2q$, and $3p$, and we can completely understand the fibers of the Hilbert-Chow morphism over each of these three types of points. For four points, the only sort of newish behavior is with things like $2p+2q$, where the fiber of the Hilbert-Chow morphism is $\mathcal{H}^2 \times \mathcal{H}^2$. 

Similarly, a two unique product group , (t.u.p group) is a group $G$ such that if given any two finite non empty subsets $A$ and $B$ of $G$ with $|A|+|B| > 2$, there exist at least two elements $x$ and $y$ which has a unique representations $x=ab$ and $y=cd$ where $a,c \in A$ and $b,d \in B$. 2) Also Is there a u.p. group which is not t.u.p, as clearly, every t.u.p. group is a u.p. group. As every $RO$ (right ordered)-group is a t.u.p. group which in turn is u.p. group, it was a natural question that came to my find, i.e. does there exist any u.p. group (or t.u.p) which is not $RO$? 

Clearly, if one is given a $C^1$ sub-bundle $V$ of the tangent space of a smooth manifold $M$, wheather $V$ comes from a $C^2$ foliation of the manifold is decided by the conditions of the Frobenius theorem. Of course one can define a $C^1$ foliation of a $C^0$ sub-bundle $V$ as well. However the conditions of the Frobenius theorem are not applicable anymore since $V$ is not differentiable hence there is no good? notion of Lie product. Does anyone know of an analog of the Frobenius theorem for $C^0$ sub-bundles, or any result in this direction?
