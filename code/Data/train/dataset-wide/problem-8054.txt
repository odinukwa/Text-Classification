I recently learned from a knowledgeable person that for a Morse function $f: M \to R$ with a critical point $x_0$, one can perturb $f$ in such a fashion that the new function has the same critical points and the Hessian at $x_0$ can be arbitrarily arranged if the index is unchanged. I have managed to prove this result, but it would be nice to know a textbook where this result can be found, since I need to refer to it. I think people who know more Morse theory than I do can help out. 

I suspect that the following matrix inequality is well known, but I can't find a reference or proof: Given $n \times n$ symmetric matrices $A,B$ such that $I_n \leq A,B$, is the following true? $${Tr}\big[\big( \log A^{\frac{1}{2}} B A^{\frac{1}{2}}\big)^p\big] \geq {Tr}\big[\big( \log B \big)^p\big] + {Tr}\big[\big( \log A\big)^p\big].$$ For clarity, for a continuous function $f$ and symmetric matrix $C$, $f(C)$ is simply equal to $U {diag}(f(\lambda_1),...,f(\lambda_n))U^t$, where $U$ is a unitary matrix diagonalizing $C$, i.e., $C = U diag(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n)U^t$. UPDATE: after the discussion with amakelov below, I edited the statement to be more aesthetic. 

Given a smooth projective variety $X \subset \Bbb{CP}^k$ why is it true that global sections of $O(l)|_X, l >> 0 $ are just global sections of $O(l)$ on $\Bbb{CP}^k$ restricted to $X$? Here $O(l)$ is just an appropriate power of the anti-tautological line bundle on $\Bbb{CP}^k$. 

I want to learn about parabolic PDE and it seems to me that there is no established reference as far as where one should look if one wants to learn the subject from basics. I think I have a firm grip on elliptic PDE after going through the first part of Gilbarg and Trudinger + some Monge-Ampere stuff. But that concludes my PDE background at this moment. Can someone provide me with a good textbook for parabolic PDE? Any chunk of information will be appreciated. EDIT: I would like to learn about parabolic PDE arising in geometry, mostly the Kahler-Ricci flow and related questions. But since I am new to this approach perhaps a more broad introduction would be appropriate. 

I've been reading a preprint by David Hansen (with appendix by James Newton) called Universal eigenvarieties, trianguline Galois representations and p-adic Langlands functoriality. In it he talks about using overconvergent cohomology to construct eigenvarieties. Now I was wondering if I could get a reference/ explanation as to why these eigenvarieties will be related to the ones one make coming from overconvergent modular forms (as in Kevin Buzzard's- Eigenvarieties) I don't quite see the relation between this OC cohomology and OC modular forms. I have a feeling it has something to do (as I think Hansen says on p42) with the classical Eichler--Shimura and Theorem 3.2.5 on the above paper, which is a generalization of Stevens control theorem. But it's not clear to me what the relation is. Thank you. 

I'm trying to relate the slope decomposition of a product of linear operators to the slope decompositions with regard to each of the operators in the product. First I'll give some background, for which I'm following section 2.3 of Urban's Eigenvarietes for reductive groups. If $L/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a finite extension. say a polynomial $P(X)$ of degree $d$ has slope $\leq h$ if $P(0)$ is a unit in the ring of integers of $L$ and the roots of $P^*(X)=X^dP(1/X)$ in $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p$ have $p$-adic valuation less than $h$. Then if $M$ is a vector space over $L$ and $U$ is a continuous linear operator $M$, we say that $M$ has a slope $\leq h$ decomposition with respect to $U$, if we can write $M:=M_1 \oplus M_2$, where both $M_1,M_2$ are stable under the action of $U$ and we have: (1) $M_1$ is finite dimensional over $L$. (2) The polynomial $\det(1-X\cdot U)|M_1$ is of slope $\leq h$. (3) For any polynomial $P$ of slope $\leq h$, the restriction of $P^*(U)$ to $M_2$ is an invertible endomorphism of $M_2$. Now my question is that if I have $U=\prod_{i=1}^{n} U_i$, where $U,U_i$ are all linear operators on $M$. Then if I take an element that has slope $\leq h$ with respect to $U$, does it follow that it will have slope $\leq h$ with respect to all the $U_i$. Or more generally is there a relation between the slope decomposition of with respect to $U$ and the slope decomposition with respect to the $U_i$. Note: For the case I'm looking at I can actually take the operators to be compact operators, and my $M$ will be spaces of modular forms. But I don't know how much this helps. 

I am able to give a proof to the following inequality for convex functions. Most likely this is well known, but I am unable to find a reference. I would appreciate if someone more knowledgeable in the literature of convex analysis could help. Suppose $P$ is an open bounded convex subset of $\Bbb R^n$ and $f: P \to \Bbb R$ is a convex function such that $\int_P f =0$. Then there exists positive constants $\alpha,\beta>0$ (not dependent on $f$) such that $$-\alpha\inf_P f \leq \int_P |f(x)|dx^n \leq -\beta \inf_P f .$$ EDIT: per Fedja's observation, I removed the unnecessary constants from the ineqilities. Also, it is specified that $P$ has to be open and bounded. Also, in lack of a good reference, if someone can furnish a short proof of the first estimate, that would work for me as well. 

You are given a complex Hilbert space $H$ with two equivalent Hilbert space structures $<,>$ and $<,>'$. Define $<,>''=<,> + <,>'$ to be the sum of our two scalar products. Suppose you are given a complex symmetric bilinear form $B: H\times H \to \Bbb C$, with norm $c$ over $<,>''$ i.e. $$B(x,x) \leq c(|x|^2 + |x|'^2) , \ x \in H. $$ Does there exist complex symmetric bilinear forms $A$ and $C$, such that $B=A+C$ and $$A(x,x) \leq c|x|^2 , \ x \in H, $$ $$C(x,x) \leq c|x|'^2 , \ x \in H. $$ It is clear that if $A$ and $C$ have norm less then $c$ with respect to the respective norms, then $B$ has norm less then $c$ with respect to the "sum" norm. My questions is, do all operatods $B$ arise this way? Probably not. However I keep thinking about this on and off, and as embarassing as it is, I can't come up with a counterexample even in the $\Bbb C^n$ case. 

I'm looking to learn about integral structures (or models?) on classical algebraic groups. To begin with I have been learning about algebraic groups, quadratic forms and lattices. And also looking at this paper by Jonathan Hanke called "Algorithms for computing maximal lattices in bilinear (and quadratic) spaces over number fields" available here $URL$ The thing is I want to learn about these integral structures but can't seem to find a good place to learn about them. Thanks 

I've just come across this paper by Coleman and Edixhoven called "On the semi-simplicity of the $U_p$ operator on modular forms", where (as the title says) they show that the $U_p$ operator is semi-simple on the spaces of cusp forms (Theorem 4.2) under some conditions on the level and $p$. I was wondering if there is a similar result for Hilbert modular forms or even for quaternionic modular forms? By similar I mean a result saying that the $U_p$ operator acting in the spaces of cuspidal HMFs or on Quaternionic modular forms is semi-simple given some conditions on the weight, level and $p$. Thank you 

I'm wondering if someone can shed some light onto the following, which most likely is just a silly coincidence, but I would be interested to know if there is more to it. I found myself needing to compute some dimensions of spaces of Hilbert modular cusp forms over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$ of parallel weight $[2k,2k]$ and level $\Gamma_0(\mathfrak{p}_{11})$ where $\mathfrak{p}_{11} $ is a prime ideal dividing $11$. Now I started by doing the naive thing of simply going to MAGMA and asking for Dimension(HilbertModularCuspForms(...)). Now this is not a good idea since it will become very slow very quickly. But still, if you wait a bit you find that the sequence [Dimension, weight] is $[ 1, 4 ],[ 5, 6 ] ,[ 9, 8 ] ,[ 17, 10 ] ,[ 25, 12 ] ,[ 33, 14 ] ,[ 45, 16 ] ,[ 57, 18 ] ,[ 73, 20 ] ,[ 89, 22 ] ,[ 105, 24 ] ,[ 125, 26 ] ,[ 145, 28 ] ,[ 169, 30 ]$ Now I looked at the sequence of dimensions and wondered if there was a pattern, so I did the usual trick of typing OEIS into google and then putting in the dimensions. It turns out the dimensions match up (as far as I've computed) with the number of (integer) solutions of $w+2x+5y=0$ for $x,y,w \in [-k \dots k]$. So my question is: Is this nothing more than a coincidence? or is there any connection here? The dimension formulas for Hilbert modular forms seem to usually be a bit messy so I can't really see how the two things are connected (but this likely just because I haven't looked at them carefully yet). My hope was to eventually have a quick way of computing these dimensions and having such a description would make computations much easier. Full disclosure: The sequence on OEIS actually starts $1,1,5,9,17,$.. and the first "1" would correspond to the dimension in weight $[2,2]$, which is actually zero, so the sequences don't match up in the first term. But if you look at the corresponding space on the quarternionic side (via the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence), then in weight $[2,2]$ one needs to quotient out the space by the stuff factoring through the reduced norm map, which in this case is 1-dimensional, so this might be the where the "1" is. Thank you. 

Suppose $D \subset \Bbb C$ with smooth boundary. Let $f \in C^{1,1}(D)$. Let $\varphi$ be the supremum of all members in the set $$\lbrace g \in C^{\infty}(\overline{D})| g \ is \ subharmonic \ and \ g \leq f\rbrace$$ It is known that $\varphi$ is subharmonic in $D$ and harmonic on $E =\lbrace \varphi < f\rbrace$, the complement of the contact set. It is also known that $\varphi$ is C^{1,1}. Suppose now that $\lbrace f_t \rbrace$, $t \in(0,1)$ is a smooth family of smooth obstacles. Will the variation of the family $\lbrace \varphi_t \rbrace$ be at least $C^1$? If this is too much to ask, then let $\tilde E \subset (0,1)\times D$, be the open? domain for which each $t-$slice $E_t$ is the set where $\varphi_t$ will be harmonic. Will the variation of $\lbrace \varphi_t\rbrace$ be $C^1$ on $\tilde E$? Any reference or chunk of information will be appreciated. I don't know almost anything about obstacle problems (but you know this by now :D). There seems to be no obvious reference out there. Can someone recommend something to a grad student who is faimiliar with the Gilbarg and Trudinger stuff but not much more? 

I don't know how late this is for an answer, but as long as at point $x_0$ of $\partial \Omega$ where the assumptions of the Hopf Boundary lemma are satisfied, $l(x_0)$ is not tangential to the boundary(outgoing) then the bound $\partial u/ \partial l(x_0) >0$ will be satisfied. Infact you don't even need smoothness of the boundary, as it is detailed in page 34 of Gilbarg and Trudinger.
