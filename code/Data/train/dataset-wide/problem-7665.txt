In the second part of their article they deal with the question how certain discriminant divisors can be used to show that the polynomial is not solvable. The context of your question is not clear to me: if you want polynomials with Galois group different from $S_n$, you can of course take the cyclotomic polynomial or $f(x) = x^n-a$, but you know that. For less trivial examples, check out the book 

No: there are units that are norms of elements but not norms of units. The simplest example are real quadratic number fields $Q(\sqrt{m}\,)$ with $m$ a sum of two squares such that the fundamental unit has positive norm, for example $m = 34$. For finding other examples, one may look at the ambiguous class number formulas for cyclic extensions $L/K$ of prime degree $p$: $$ Am(L/K) = h_K \frac{\prod e(P)}{p(E_K : E_K \cap NL^\times)}, \qquad Am_s(L/K) = h_K \frac{\prod e(P)}{p(E_K : N E_L)}. $$ Here $Am$ denotes the subgroup of ideal classes fixed by the Galois group $G$, $Am_s$ the subgroup of classes generated by ideals fixed by $G$, and $e(P)$ is the ramification index of the prime $P$. The index $$ (Am:Am_s) = (E_K \cap NL^\times : NE_L) $$ is the obstruction to the local-global principle for units. Edit. Let me, however, point out that D. Folk (When are global units norms of units?, Acta Arith. 76 (1996), 145-147) has proved the following result: if $L/K$ is normal and if $H$ denotes the Hilbert class field of $L$, then a unit from $K$ that is a local norm in all completions of $H/K$ is the norm of a unit from $L$. This suggests the following question: given a cyclic extension $L/K$, is there an unramified abelian extension $E/L$ with the property that a unit from $K$ is the norm of a unit from $L$ if and only if it is a local norm in all completions of $E/K$? 

I guess the standard answer is that, in the field of $p$-the roots of unity, the prime $p$ behaves differently. In the rationals, which contain the 2nd roots of unity, the prime $2$ is expected to show a strange behaviour. In my experience, the prime $2$ behaves half as odd if it is replaced by $4$. 

In addition to Paul's comment let me point out that the structure of the underlying group was investigated in 

Consider the form $$ Q(x) = 2q(x) = (x_1+x_2)^2 + (x_2+x_3)^2 + \ldots + (x_7+x_1)^2.$$ You have to show that it has Euclidean minimum $\frac74$ attained at $X_1 = x_1+x_2 = \frac12$, ..., $X_7 = x_7 + x_1 = \frac12$, but unfortunately not over the lattice ${\mathbb Z}^7$, where it would be trivial, but over a lattice of index $2$ defined by the condition $y_1 + y_2 + \ldots + y_7 \equiv 0 \bmod 2$. It is clear that $(\frac12, \ldots, \frac12)$ has Euclidean minimum $\frac 74$, and it remains to show that all other points in the fundamental domain of the lattice have a minimum at most $\frac74$. This is not difficult to see: assume you have the point $(\frac12 + \delta, \frac12 + \varepsilon, ...)$ for small $\delta, \varepsilon \ge 0$. Subtracting the point $(1,1,0,\ldots, 0)$ you will get a point with coordinates $(-\frac12 + \delta, -\frac12 + \varepsilon, ...)$. Repeating this procedure you will eventually reach a point with $|X_2|, \ldots, |X_7| \le \frac12$. If $|X_1| \le\frac12$, we are done. If not, you can make $|X_1| < \frac12$ at the cost of making another coordinate $> \frac12$ in absolute values. If you think about this for a minute you will see that we can always reach a point of the form $$ X = \Big(\frac12 + \delta_1, \frac12 - \delta_2, . . . , \frac12 - \delta_7\Big)$$ with $0 \le \delta_j \le \frac12$ and $\delta_1 \le \delta_i$ for all $i > 1$. It remains to show that $q(X) \le \frac74$, which is equivalent to $$ \delta_1 - \delta_2 - \ldots - \delta_7 + \delta_1^2 + \ldots + \delta_7^2 \le 0. $$ Does this inequality hold? 

This elaborates quim's answer. Kummer did indeed use $\lambda$ for denoting primes (in connection with cyclotomic fields); he borrowed the notation from Jacobi's articles on cyclotomy as well as from his notes of the number theory lectures in 1836/37. When Hilbert rewrote Kummer's contributions in his Zahlbericht, he started the chapter on cyclotomic fields with "Let $l$ denote an odd prime number". The reason for switching from the Greek to the Latin alphabet was Hilbert's custom to use Latin letters for rational numbers. Hilbert also used ${\mathfrak l}$ for prime ideals above $2$. Edit. For what it's worth: Euler used primes $\lambda n + 1$ in art. 92 of his article E449. 

Artin (1923) wrote that Dedekind proved the case of this conjecture concerning pure cubic number fields. Dedekind published his article in 1900, but writes that it is a reworking of a draft he had written in 1871/72. The conjecture was named after Dedekind by van der Waall in 1974. Despite Artin's claim, the integrality of the quotient $\zeta_K(s)/\zeta(s)$ is not addressed at all by Dedekind (Hecke proved that $\zeta_K(s)$ extends to a meromorphic function on the complex plane in 1917). Dedekind proved that $\zeta_K(s)/\zeta(s)$ for pure cubic extensions may be written as a linear combination of Epstein zeta functions. Epstein proved in 1903 that these are meromorphic with simple poles in $s = 1$, and Artin realized in 1923 that this implies that the quotient is entire - I guess this explains his remark. In any case Dedekind had nothing to do with this conjecture. Edit. Landau [Über die Wurzeln der Zetafunktion eines algebraischen Zahlkörpers, Math. Ann. 79 (1919), 388-401] writes on p. 390: "I have to be careful with its formulation since it is not known whether $\zeta_k(s)/\zeta(s)$ is always an entire function". 

Perhaps the article Class field theory summarized (Rocky Mt. J. Math. 11, 195-225 (1981)) by Dennis Garbanati should be contained in such a list as a very accessible introduction. For those who can read German, both Hasse's Marburg lectures and Deuring's notes from Goettingen are excellent. Neukirch's cohomological approach (Klassenkoerpertheorie in regenbogen's list) will be translated into English this year. Edit: I am a little bit reluctant to put this link here as I can't access this web page anymore; but a couple of links are still working, and google will probably find the rest. 

This "almost" answers Zoran Škoda's question: Otto Grün (his theorems in group theory are still well known) published his first paper at the age of 46. 

In the 1-dimensional case we are talking about class field theory, and I can't recall having seen anything better than Cox's book (already mentioned by Emerton) in this direction (undergrad etc.). With Artin's reciprocity law (the central role of the Frobenius elements in connection with reciprocity laws wasn't exactly kept secret 8-) under your belt you might want to check out 

I'm not sure that I will be answering your question, so let me first recall the background. The equivalence classes of primitive binary cubic forms with discriminant $\Delta$ correspond to $SL_2(\mathbb Z)$-equivalence classes of triply symmetric Bhargava cubes. There is a natural homomorphism from this group to the strict class group of binary quadratic forms with discriminant $\Delta$, and in fact the image has order dividing three for (almost trivial) reasons. The kernel of this homomorphism has order $(U:U^3)$, where $U$ is the unit group of the quadratic order with discriminant $\Delta$. The group structure on the set of binary cubic forms is defined via the group structure on the group of $\Gamma$-equivalence classes of Bhargava cubes, where $\Gamma$ is the direct product of three copies of $SL_2(\mathbb Z)$. Given a binary quadratic form $Q$ with discriminant $\Delta$ it is easy to see that there is exactly one $\Gamma$-equivalence class of triply symmetric cubes belonging to $(Q,Q,Q)$. Your problem seems to come from confusing the $\Gamma$-equivalence classes of cubes in the second paragraph with the $SL_2(\mathbb Z)$-equivalence classes of cubes from the first one, and I think that this is what you asked in your comment - observe that an element $S \in SL_2(\mathbb Z)$ acts on a cube via the action of $(S,S,S)$. I do not understand your question in the numerical example; perhaps you can clarify this part by editing the question.
