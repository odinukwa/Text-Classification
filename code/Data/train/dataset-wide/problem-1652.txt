Not necessarily. We can artificially induce VLF emissions using ground-based transmitters. But otherwise yes, there needs to be free energy for the radiation of electromagnetic waves. 

Velocity The solar wind speed has a large range of variation, between ~250–820 km/s [e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Gopalswamy, 2006; Jian et al., 2011, 2014; Kasper et al., 2012; Maksimovic et al., 1998; Marsch, 1983; McComas et al., 2013; Schwenn, 1983; Stverak et al., 2008, 2009] near the ecliptic plane. These values are not including interplanetary shocks, which can have speeds exceeding 2000 km/s. The speed is generally higher at higher latitudes out of the ecliptic plane, tending to be over 650 km/s [e.g., McComas et al., 2008; 2013]. Number Density The number density also has a large range of values, from ~2–90 $cm^{-3}$ [e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Gopalswamy, 2006; Jian et al., 2011, 2014; Kasper et al., 2012; Maksimovic et al., 1998; Marsch, 1983; McComas et al., 2013; Schwenn, 1983; Stverak et al., 2008, 2009]. Again, these do not include interplanetary shocks or coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Charge State The alpha particle to proton number density ratio varies between ~1-5%, depending on solar cycle and solar wind speed [e.g., Kasper et al., 2012; Schwadron et al., 2014]. We have also measured the ratio of $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ and $C^{6+}/C^{5+}$, finding ~1-30% and ~20-200%, respectively [e.g., Schwadron et al., 2014]. 

So, servo motors and presumably, calibration are what enables this accuracy. The Lovell telescope has 2 elevation drive motors with gearboxes on each side of the dish. These can be driven so that one motor pulls the dish, and the dish drags along the second motor. This eliminates gear backlash in the system: the two gear trains are "wound up" in opposite directions. This means they can make adjustments without gear backlash interfering.

As the other answers have said, it's a matter of distance. Not just directly (large distance = small gravitational effect), but also because large distance = long orbital period. If Planet 9's orbit is 10,000 years long, it has moved across a very small portion of its orbit over the past 100 years, so the force vector of its gravitational attraction has moved across a very small angle. That alone makes the wobble much harder to detect than the wobble caused by e.g. Mercury with its 3-month orbital period. Here's a graph that illustrates which objects we can see with current technology, and which are below the limits of current technology. 

so they seem to have repeat observations a bit more often than once a month. Cepheids have a period of typically 2 to 45 days (says german Wikipedia - didn't find it in the english article). If your sampling is regular, you should be able to get a decent light curve for at least some Cepheids. Complete guesswork on my part: Apparently, longer period Cepheids are redder at the minimum. Perhaps they use that to distinguish between the actual period and higher harmonics? 

No, the more I read about it, the more difficult it seems to be. In principle, if you sample regularly and often, you should eventually get a light curve, unless the period is the same as or a multiple of your sampling period. It's not easy to find how often GAIA observes a given patch of sky, but here it says that after one year of observing 

There are a number of conceptual and numeric problems with your code. They contribute, but I haven't found the conceptual problem yet. I will edit this answer if / when I find it. To start, you set the half-light radius for an exponential profile at 1, create a profile out to 1000, and with a resolution of 1. You need more resolution at the centre, and the last 990 or so bins (probably more than that) are useless. I changed your to 

The properties of the terrestrial magnetosphere vary so widely, you would need to narrow down this question. For instance, the charge states are completely different (e.g., we observe $O^{1+}$ but not $O^{7+}$) but the number densities range from ~$10^{-2}-10^{3} \ cm^{-3}$. 

Generally, waves with $f < f_{pe}$ experience damping as they propagate through a plasma. This is because the wave fields oscillate slow enough to interact with the particles, thus adding an effective inertia term to the system. ELF and VLF waves generally damp through cyclotron and Landau resonances. Note, however, that both of these resonances are also the processes responsible for wave growth in the presence of sufficient free energy (e.g., free energy from beams is often related to a Landau-like or Cerenkov-like emission). 

We don't have any measurements near 1 AU that are at high latitudes. Some spacecraft have done out of ecliptic polar orbits with high apogees, but the heliocentric latitudes were still within ~$10^{\circ}$ of the ecliptic plane. The notes above discuss our only real measurements out of the ecliptic by the Ulysses spacecraft. 

There is no net internal magnetic field to perturb, so how could one induce currents? The effect arises on Earth because some transient event (e.g., coronal mass ejection or CME) hits Earth's magnetosphere and causes a sudden $\tfrac{dB}{dt}$ which, from Faraday's law, results in induced electric fields. These induced electric fields then drive currents in things like power grids (typically long-distance wires running east-west at high latitudes), oil pipelines, etc. The only changing magnetic field would be that of the solar wind and the small, localized magnetic anomalies on the surface of Mars. However, these fields are incredibly small so the $\tfrac{dB}{dt}$ would be even smaller. 

This would not be a giant version of eLISA, but a small (and complicated) one. The distance between the LISA satellites will be 1 million kilometers, while the moon is on average 380.000km from Earth. So that arm would be less than half as long. Geosynchronous orbit is at 36.000km, not even 10% of the distance to the moon. The difference in length between your proposed detector arms is much shorter than the coherence length of any laser, so your interferometer would not work. Further problems: 

First off, I'm not going to calculate an answer to the "significance level of 1%" part. This is more a rule of thumb kind of answer. We're moving in a spaceship and want to see 

You can see the problem: the interpolation counts bins and assumes a width of 1. Next, I did a small test to see what I'd get: 

In other words, the red- and blueshift due to our motion must exceed the peculiar motion of the individual galaxies. Cosmologists have been dealing with a very similar problem trying to measure the Hubble constant. I remember from a cosmology class (can't find a source at the moment) that the Coma cluster is the first cluster whose redshift is dominated by the Hubble flow as opposed to peculiar motion. This is mainly due to the fact that the local group is moving towards the nearer Virgo cluster. From the above wikipedia link: Distance ca. $100 \textrm{MPc}$, apparent recession velocity ca. $7000 \textrm{km s}^{-1}$. So, at that speed, you would definitely see a systematic difference in redshift of galaxies ahead of and behind you. How long to get to that speed at constant acceleration of $10 \frac{m}{s^2}$? \begin{equation} a = \frac{v}{t} \Rightarrow t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{7\cdot 10^6 m s^{-1}}{10 m s^{-2}} = 7 \cdot 10^5 s \simeq 8\, \textrm{days.} \end{equation} Note that this is a worst-case scenario. People have used much closer galaxies to determine the Hubble constant. This paper's abstract says 

The solar wind ram(dynamic) pressure is typically only ~1 nPa or $10^{-9} \ J \ m^{-3}$. This is highly variable and can change in milliseconds (e.g., interplanetary shocks), but that would still only be $10^{-6} \ W \ m^{-3}$. If we make a hand-wavy argument that this drops to zero in ~3 $R_{E}$ (i.e., upper bound on thickness of magnetosheath), then the power per unit area can be up to ~20 W $m^{-2}$. However, I would not read too much into that number as the actual power dissipated per unit area is different for numerous reasons. References 

In space plasmas, ELF is used to describe waves in the frequency band ~3 Hz to ~3 kHz. Very low frequency (VLF) is used to describe waves in the frequency band ~3 kHz to ~30 kHz. Generally the cutoff frequency of the Earth's ionosphere prevents waves at such low frequencies from freely passing through it. In plasmas, this tends to be any wave at or below the local electron plasma frequency, which can be approximated as $f_{pe} \approx 8.9787 \ \sqrt{n_{e} \left[ cm^{-3} \right]}$ kHz (where the $\left[ cm^{-3} \right]$ implies that the electron number density, $n_{e}$, should be in units of $cm^{-3}$). The densities in the ionosphere are ~$10^{3} - 10^{6} \ cm^{-3}$, which corresponds to $f_{pe}$ ~ 280 kHz to ~9 MHz. Early studies found a relationship between lightning and a VLF emissions called whistlers. It is now known that high energy electron beams, associated with the lightning, escape into the magnetosphere. These beams radiate the whistlers through a plasma instability (i.e., free energy due to a fast beam streaming through an otherwise homogeneous plasma). So the free energy sources can escape the lower atmosphere, but the electromagnetic emissions at such low frequencies cannot. 

Like the other answer stated, stars usually emit a good approximation to black body radiation. However, under certain conditions, a star can emit monochromatic microwaves. This is known as a MASER. For this to happen, the star has to be either very cool (since the emission is from molecular gas) or embedded in a star forming region - in the latter case, it's not the actual star emitting the radiation but the molecular cloud it is embedded in. Now, the "normal" starlight is still present even if you have a MASER, and the emission is highly directional. So you might not see the MASER if you're looking from the wrong direction at the star, and it will not be purely monochromatic, but the MASER emission might be quite dominant. 

That should be in western China, since all of China uses Beijing's time zone. Reference: $URL$ --- Edit below --- In response to the comment by @adrianmcmenamin: I'll leave this as guesswork since I simply don't know the peculiarities of every timezone there is. Here's a back-of-the-envelope calculation for local noon in western China. The Sun covers 15 degrees in a period of 1 hour. All of China is on Beijing time (UTC + 8 hours). With the above, it's centred on $15 \cdot 8 = 120^{\circ}$ east. As a consistency check, Beijing is at $116^{\circ}$ east. The westernmost part of China is at about $73^\circ$ east (See here). Local noon there is delayed by $(120^\circ - 73^\circ)/(15^\circ/h) \simeq 3h$. So, local noon is a little later than 3pm. This is discounting daylight savings time, which is not currently observed in China. 

The second critical parameter is the beam width. Beam width depends highly on frequency: beamwidth = wave length/dish diameter When you use several dishes in an interferometer, you can increase their effective accuracy and decrease their collective beam width. A bit more info on the mechanics of the Lovell telescope: 

The easiest way is to look it up, e.g. here: $URL$ Because the moons' positions change, and they are too small to distinguish in a small telescope, there are no general rules. 

Some of those "far more difficult feats" (like detecting planets that orbit other stars) are done by "cheating": we (mostly) can't see those planets directly, but we can detect their presence by the effect it has on the light of its star. That's a technique we can't use for objects in the outer solar system. Here's another visualization, one that shows the rapid progress we've made in how much of the solar system we can detect. In 1980, we had identified about 8000 asteroids. By 2010, we'd found half a million. The red area in the graph above is shrinking steadily. Asteroid visualization 

(emphasis mine). So they're not saying dark matter is exactly like a fluid, they're saying dark matter has some properties that are comparable to the behavior of fluids. 

Lastly, it is not clear to me how you want to replace precision measurement by calculation. What is PLL? How do you get meaningful interference patterns with lasers of different wavelengths? Also note that the "exact distance", if you want to count waves, must be better than half the wavelength of your laser, so a few hundred nanometers. At the distance of the moon, that is better than $1 : 10^{15}$ (hope that calculation is correct). 

The half-light radius doesn't change if you go from an upper end of 1000 to 100 or even to 10. It does change quite dramatically, though, if you change the resolution from 1 to 0.1 to 0.01. If we increase it to 0.001, it starts to slowly stabilize. This brings us to the next problem: These are the results I get when I increase the resolution: 

and they've been going for a number of years by now. So, it would be technically challenging but possible. Politically, it might not be so easy: Every observatory wants to make the best use of the observing time they have, and most are oversubscribed (more time asked for than available). You need a fairly solid science case to block several telescopes around the world for several years, but the result you'd get if all goes well is merely confirmation of someone else's result.
