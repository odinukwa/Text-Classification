Gehring shows (for p=n=3) in the first equality of Theorem 1 in his paper Extremal length definitions for the conformal capacity of rings in space. $URL$ that the conformal modulus of a ring domain $R$ (defined via measurable functions) can equivalently be defined as the infimum of $\int |Df|^p$ where $f$ varies among $ACL$ functions having boundary values 0 and 1 on the two boundary components of $R$. Moreover he cites on p.138 another paper of himself showing that $ACL$ may be replaced by $C^1$. It seems quite likely that a corresponding characterization also holds for general n and $p$ (not necessarily equal to $n$), maybe even the same proof goes through, see edit below. Assuming that these results also hold for general $p$ and $n$, it follows immediately from the argument on p.142 of the same paper that the conformal modulus of $R$ can also be reached as the infimum over continuous admissible functions. Edit: Actually the whole argument seems to be essentially spelled out in Rickman's book on quasiregular mappings, starting on p.53, section 10. 

Question 2: Yes, there are conformal metrics on a divergent sequence of tori with Area=1 and bounded diameter: Cutting the torus open along an embedded essential curve, you obtain a cylinder, conformally equivalent to $[0,R] \times S^1$. The fact that the sequence of conformal structures diverges, means that we can choose the cutting curve such that $R_n\rightarrow \infty$. However this is not really relevant here and we just directly construct such a conformal metric for any such cylinder (which gives rise to a conformal metric on the torus). Note that any conformal metric on such a standard cylinder has the form $h|dz|^2$. If $R\leq 5$ choose just any function $1\leq h\leq 2$ which glues nicely back to a metric on the torus; up to rescaling we obtain conformal metric of area 1 and bounded diameter. If $R\geq 5$, choose $h\leq 2$ everywhere and $h\geq 1$ on a neighborhood $[0,1]\times S^1 \cup [R-1,R]\times S^1$ of the boundary (and such that it glues nicely) and arbitrary small away from the boundary, say $h=1/R^2$ on $[2,R-2]\times S^1$. Up to rescaling by a factor in $[1,10]$, we can ensure that the area is 1 and clearly the diameter is bounded. Question 3: The argument of Thomas Richard shows you can embed any cylinder of the form $[0,R)\times S^1$ for $R\in (0,\infty]$ into any torus. The cylinder $\mathbb{R}\times S^1$ cannot be embedded into any compact Riemann surface $S\neq S^2$, since it would extend to an embedding of $S^2$. On the other hand, covering maps give immersions from $\mathbb{R}\times S^1$ into any torus (but no such immersions exist into surfaces of hyperbolic type). If the embedding is supposed to be $\pi_1$-injective, then the maximal $R$ such that $(0,R)\times S^1$ embeds into a complex torus $(T^2,j)$ is determined by the length $l_j$ of the systole of the torus in the conformal class determined by $j$. Indeed one can see that the maximal $R$ satisfies $R=1/l_j^2$. 

Here is a more recent paper: Roman Drnovšek, On the S-matrix conjecture. It (re-) proves for the case of $n$ odd the conjecture restated here for convenience: If $A$ is a nonsingular $n\times n$ matrix with all entries in the interval $[0,1]$, then $$||A^{-1}||_F\ge\frac{2n}{n+1}$$ with equality iff $A$ is an $S$-matrix. 

Let $G$ be a simple connected graph that has at least one 1-factor. We'll define: $G$ has property A iff it is edge-transitive. $G$ has property B iff each edge belongs to the same number of 1-factors. 

e.g. the shifts are 8 and 72=9*8 in the first example above, and 3 and 12=4*3 in the second one. (There can also be more than two different shifts.) The minimal period lengths are quite irregular, but it looks like the following holds: 

Now, as we mathematicians do not necessarily worry about constraints of real life and such things, let's feel free to also consider a continuous version of the problem (which may even be more easy to treat): instead of $N$ counters in a row, we can imagine a circle or more generally a unit sphere $S_n$, each point of which is a potential counter. The (rather small) customers still arrive at an average of 1 per minute. Though the counters aren't discrete anymore, the customers still are as discreet as possible, so each one chooses a point on $S_n$ furthest away from all occupied points and does his business, which takes $k$ minutes. (E.g. on $S_2$ for $k$ big enough, there are very good chances that the six first customers are at the corners of an octahedron. Note that if the two first ones occupy the poles and thus the third one a point on the equator, then the fourth one would not only be somewhere on a half of the equator, but he must choose the antipodal point of the third one, to be as far away as possible from him, too. So I mean 'furthest away from all of them' in a stricter sense, hopefully well-defined, which might make the question more interesting by the possibly more frequent presence of certain patterns, see below.) For a threshold $\epsilon$, we'll define $f_n(k,\epsilon)$ as the average proportion of time when any two customers on the sphere are more than $\epsilon$ away from each other in Euclidean distance. 

existence of a subword (then the part can be pivoted out of the a-b-plane) more generally, existence of two segments which are collinear in $\mathbb R^3$ (then each of the two remaining paths can be pivoted around this line). existence of four vertices forming a parallelogram which are 'surrounded' by the four subwords (in cyclic order) as illustrated in the left picture: leaving rigid the two blue parts, we can pivot simultaneously the two black parts around an axis parallel to or to (!) in a way that again maintains the orthogonality at each moment. Likewise if the four subwords are (right picture) or . 

The study of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of Riemann surfaces with boundary can be reduced to the study of the Deligne-Mumford compactification of closed Riemann surfaces together with the study of separating antiholomorphic involutions on them. More precisely, the data of a compact Riemann surface A with (nonempty) boundary can be recovered from its double S=double(A) (a closed Riemann surface), the natural antiholomorphic involution $\iota$ on $S$ and the choice of one connected component C of $S\setminus Fix(\iota)$. Thus Isomorphism classes of compact Riemann surfaces A of a given type are naturally identified with Isomorphism classes of triples $(S,\iota,C)$ (for a separating antiholomorphic involution $\iota$) such that C is of the same topological type as A. In your specific case, the doubles are tori. As Riemann surfaces these doubles can only degenerate in one way, but there are two distinct isomorphism types of involutions on the limit: In one case the fixed point set of the involution has a component consisting of the node and a circle disjoint from the node; in the other case the fixed point set consists of two circles, both passing through the node, but otherwise disjoint. The first case gives rise to a disk with an interior puncture, the second to a disk, meeting with two punctures on the boundary, which form together a boundary node. If the conformal modulus of the annulus A goes to zero (i.e. $R\rightarrow 0$, the latter case), then the geodesic contracting is simply obtained by doubling a segment joining the two boundary components of $A$. 

The following relies on the answer of Anton Petrunin and his explanations. Set $X:=\cap_{n\geq 1} f^n(M)$. Claim 0: Each $x\in X$ is a limit point of a sequence $f^n(y)$ for some $y\in M$. Moreover, if $x\in X\cap M^\circ$, then $y$ can be chosen in $M^\circ$. Proof of Claim 0: Assume $x\in X$. Then $x=f^n(y_n)$ for some $y_n\in M$ and each $n\geq 1$. After passing to a subsequence, we may assume that $y_{n_l}\rightarrow y$. Fix $\varepsilon>0$ and $K\geq 1$; we show that for some $k\geq K$, $f^k(y)\in B_\varepsilon(x)$. Choose $l\geq 1$, such that $k:=n_l\geq K$ and $y_{k}\in B_\varepsilon(y)$. Then, since $f$ is distance non-increasing, $dist(f^k(y),f^k(y_k))\leq dist(y,y_k)<\varepsilon$. The 'moreover' statement follows, since we can replace $y$ by $f^{k_0}(y)$, and choose $k_0$ such that $f^{k_0}(y)\in M^\circ$; the latter is possible, since a subsequence of $f^n(y)$ converges to $x\in M^\circ$. Claim 1: For any $x\in M^\circ$ and $r>0$ such that $B_r(x)\subset M^\circ$ and $n\geq 1$, we have $f^n(B_r(x))=B_r(f^n(x))$. We defer a proof of Claim 1 to the end. Claim 2: $X^\circ$ is nonempty, indeed it coincides with the set of all limit points of sequences $f^n(y)$ for $y\in M^\circ$. Proof Claim 2: By Claim 0, each $x\in X\cap M^\circ \supset X^\circ$ is such a limit point. Conversely, if $x$ is such a limit point, then $x\in B_r(f^k(y))=f^k(B_r(y))\subset f^k(M)$ for (certain) arbitrary large $k$; here we choose $r$ such that $B_r(y)\in M^\circ$ and use Claim 1. Therefore $x\in X=\cap_{n\geq 1} f^n(M)$, since the intersection is decreasing. Actually the same argument shows, that $B_s(x)\subset X$ for each $s<r$ (or also $s\leq r$). As a consequence $x\in X^\circ$. Claim 3: $X\cap M^\circ$ is open in $M^\circ$. (Clearly it is also closed, as $M$ is compact and nonempty by Claim 2). Proof Claim 3: Combining Claim 1 and 2, we see that $X\cap M^\circ=X^\circ=X^\circ \cap M^\circ$ is open in $M^\circ$. As $M^\circ$ is connected, Claim 3 implies: Claim 4: $X\cap M^\circ=M^\circ$. Since $X\subset M$ is closed, it follows that $X=M$, and thus $f(M)=M$. Conclusion:Claim 4 implies that $f$ is a distance preserving homeomorphism by Całka, Corollary 3.5 and Corollary 4.4. In particular, $f(\partial M)=\partial M$. A (standard) proof of Claim 1: First assume n=1: Since $f$ is $1$-Lipschitz, we have $f(B_r(x))\subset B_r(f(x))$ for any $x\in M^\circ$. To show equality, let $y\in B_r(f(x))$ arbitrary. There exists a path (of constant speed) $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow M^\circ$ of length $<r$ with $\gamma(0)=f(x)$ and $\gamma(1)=y$. There exists a unique lifting of $\gamma$, i.e. a path $\eta:[0,1]\rightarrow M^\circ$ with $f\circ \eta=\gamma$ and $\eta(0)=x$. (The set $T\subset [0,1]$ of $t$'s for which there is a unique lifting of $\gamma$ on the intervall $[0,t]$ contains $0$. $T$ is open since $f$ is a local diffeomorphism on $M^\circ$. In addition, $T$ is closed: If $t_k\in T$ converges to $t\in [0,1]$, then there is a unique lift $\eta_0$ of $\gamma$ on $[0,t)$. Since $M$ is compact and $\eta_0$ is Lipschitz, we can extend it to a path $\eta_1:[0,t]\rightarrow M$, and we have automatically $f(\eta_1(s))=\gamma(s)$ for $s\in [0,t]$. Since $length(\eta_1)=length(\gamma\vert_{[0,t]})<r$ as $f$ is an infinitesimal isometry, we have $\eta_1(t)\in B_r(x)\subset M^\circ$ and therefore $t\in T$, as desired.) Since $f$ is an (infinitesimal) isometry, length($\eta$)=length$(\gamma)<r$ and thus $\eta(1)\in B_r(x)$. Therefore $y=f(\eta(1))\in f(B_r(x))$, as claimed for $n=1$. For arbitrary $n\geq 2$, note that $f^{n-1}(B_r(x))=B_r(f^{n-1}(x))$ by induction. The domain invariance theorem (applied locally to $f^{n-1}$) implies that $f^{n-1}(M^\circ)\subset M^\circ$; hence if $B_r(x)\in M^\circ$, then so is $f^{n-1}(B_r(x))$. Applying Claim 1 for $n=1$ to the ball $B_r(f^{n-1}(y))$ yields Claim 1 for $n$. 

Of course, any composite pernicious Mersenne number which is a product of two primes defines two "dual" groups in a similar way. Is there any interesting relationship between the groups of such a pair? Disclaimer: I am not a group theorist. 

I'll prove that the modified question 1 has an affirmative answer by showing conversely that an infinite word $u\in\{0,1\}^{\mathbb Z}$ which avoids all $0w01\widetilde w1 $ and $1w10\widetilde w0 $ (call these factors forbidden) is necessarily balanced. If $u\ne...0101...$, there is wlog a factor 00. (Otherwise, swap all 0's and 1's). For $k\ge1$, define a $k$-patch (or $p_k$ for short) as a 'maximal' run of $k$ consecutive zeros in $u$, i.e. it is preceded and followed by a 1. As 0011 and 1100 are forbidden, these 1's are isolated if $k\ge 2$, so each $10_k1$ (where indices mean repetition) is preceded and followed by patches $p_a$ and $p_b$, and the forbidden factors imply $k-1\le a,b\le k+1$. The same holds trivially for $k=1$. So two 'neighboring' patches have a difference of length of at most 1. Now suppose that there is a $k\ge 1$ such that $u$ contains a $p_{k-1}$ and a $p_{k+1}$. (It makes sense to define a $0$-patch $p_0$ as the empty set in the middle of a factor 11 forcing those two 1's.) Suppose they are closest possible to each other, i.e. between them there is only a number, say $n$, of $k$-patches (each separated by an isolated 1). So $u$ has a factor $$ 10_{k-1}\overbrace{10_k\cdots10_k}^n10_{k+1}1$$ (or the other way round, in which case inverse the whole sequence wlog). Which entries must follow to the right? In fact we must have $$ 10_{k-1}\overbrace{10_k\cdots10_k}^n\underbrace{10}_{(x)}0_{k-1} \underbrace{01}_{(y)}\overbrace{\color{red}{0_k1\cdots0_k1}}^{n-1}\color{red}{0_k}$$ because each red 0 is forced by the fact that the string 01 marked by $(y)$ must not be the center of a forbidden factor, and each red 1 is forced by the fact that the string 10 marked by $(x)$ must not be the center of a forbidden factor. But due to the initial 1, the whole string above is a forbidden one with center $(x)$. Contradiction. So there is a $k$ such that $u$ consists only of patches of lengths $k$ and $k+1$, separated by isolated 1's. It is easy to see that such a $u$ is balanced. qed. EDIT: this was wrong, but the proof can be rescued by the following completion. Suppose $u$ is not balanced. Then take the smallest $r$ such that there are two factors $s$ and $t$ of length $r$ where $t$ has 2 more 1's than $s$. So $s$ starts and ends with $0_{k+1}$ and $t$ starts and ends with $10_k1$. Let $n$ be the number of interior 1's of each $s$ and $t$. Suppose there are $i$ instances of $p_k$ and $j$ instances of $p_{k+1}$ with both $i,j>0$, then the interior of $t$ must have the same numbers of each (note that $s$ and $t$ have the same number of 1's in their interior). EDIT after the last remark of Harry Altman (the one starting with "Yay") : I have found a way to repare the proof again, making it at the same time more elegant. We'll now introduce the process of reduction: put $a^0=1,b^0=0$ and $u^0=u$. For $\nu=0,1,...$ proceed as follows: As the $a^\nu$-$b^\nu$-word $u^\nu$ contains no forbidden factors (in terms of $a^\nu$ and $b^\nu$), the boldface statement above about 'neighboring' patches applies also to $u^\nu$, so there must be a $k^\nu$ such that $u^\nu$ is composed either (1) of runs $a^\nu_{k^\nu}$ and $a^\nu_{k^\nu+1}$, interspearsed by isolated $b^\nu$'s, or (2) of runs $b^\nu_{k^\nu}$ and $b^\nu_{k^\nu+1}$, interspearsed by isolated $a^\nu$'s. Then denote in case (1) $a^{\nu+1}:=b^\nu a^\nu_{k^\nu}, b^{\nu+1}:=b^\nu a^\nu_{k^\nu+1}$, and in case (2) $a^{\nu+1}:=a^\nu b^\nu_{k^\nu}, b^{\nu+1}:=a^\nu b^\nu_{k^\nu+1}$, further define $u^{\nu+1}$ as the sequence $u$ written as a $a^{\nu+1}$-$b^{\nu+1}$-word. This reduction can be traced back, and it is easy to see that that $u^{\nu+1}$ cannot contain $a^{\nu+1}$-$b^{\nu+1}$-words as forbidden factors. (Looking at the $a^{\nu+1}b^{\nu+1}$ or $b^{\nu+1}a^{\nu+1}$ in the center of a forbidden factor, it is clear that this gives rise to a forbidden factor in $u^\nu$, which is excluded.) $s^\nu$ and $t^\nu$ can be written as factors of $u^\nu$, one of them starts and ends with $a^\nu$’s, the other one of them starts and ends with $b^\nu$’s. By the minimality of $s$ and $t$ and the fact that they have the same number of letters, it is easy to see that, up to an initial or final isolated letter (like in the $\nu=0$ case : a missing 1 before $s$ and the final 1of $t$), they must factor also in terms of the ‘new letters’ $a^{\nu+1}$’s and $b^{\nu+1}$, and their numbers of occurrences in the interior must again coincide. (To illustrate this, think of $s=bbbabbbabbabbabbb$ and $t=abbabbabbabbbabba$ omitting the $\nu$’s. Here $k=2$, as there are runs in $b$ of lengths 2 and 3.. Then the reduction would be $abbb\to b$ and $abb\to a$ with $s$ (or rather $as$) $\to bbaab$ ant $t$ (or rather $t$ with the final $a$ omitted) $\to aaaba$.) It is clear that $s^{\nu+1}$ has less letters $a^{\nu+1}$ and $b^{\nu+1}$ than $s^\nu$ has letters $a^\nu$ and $b^\nu$, and that by minimality, one of them starts and ends with $a^{\nu+1}$’s, the other one of them starts and ends with $b^{\nu+1}$’s. Iterating this reduction, we must thus come to a point where (omitting again the $\nu$’s) either $s$ or $t$, say $s$, consists only of letters of the same kind, say $a$. But at that moment, $t$ must have the form $baa\cdots ab$, thus it has a run of two less $a$’s. Contradiction. We conclude that the initial $s$ and $t$ cannot exist, thus $u$ is balanced. Qed.
