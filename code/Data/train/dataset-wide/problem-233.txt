The force on him is $F$, and so the force on the puncher is $-F$. The vertical component of this force is $-F\sin\theta$. Let's assume that $\theta=90^\circ$, i.e. the opponent goes straight up. We see then that the vertical component of the force has a magnitude of 770,000 Newtons. Assuming the person has the same mass as the opponent, he will then have a kinetic energy of $4.235\times10^9\text{ Joules}$, the equivalent of roughly one ton of TNT. This will be aimed directly at the ground. That's like aiming two Tomahawk missiles at one spot ($\theta=30^\circ$ would be as much as one). One is bad enough. Both opponents may walk away unharmed, but there should be a fairly large crater. 

The computation for any length is simple. At some height $h$, we have $$\text{Length of tangent line}=\sqrt{R_{\text{planet}}^2+(R_{\text{planet}}+h)^2}$$ We also have $$\text{Angle between point on surface and horizontal}=\arccos\left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{planet}}+h}\right)$$ You should be able to find the area from this, which I leave as an exercise for the reader. Hint: Use the arc length of the central cross-section of the planet. This whole approach fails, however, if we consider that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, and is not smooth. A better approximation is to treat it as an oblate spheroid. We can describe it in Cartesian coordinates by the equation $$\frac{x^2}{6,378,137^2}+\frac{y^2}{6,378,137^2}+\frac{z^2}{6,356,752^2}=1$$ Using spherical coordinates, we then have $$\frac{r^2\sin^2\theta\cos^2\varphi}{6,378,137^2}+\frac{r^2\sin^2\theta\sin^2\varphi}{6,378,137^2}+\frac{r^2\cos^2\theta}{6,356,752^2}=1$$ Doing some algebra, we have $$r=r(\theta,\varphi)=\left(\sqrt{\frac{\sin^2\theta\cos^2\varphi}{6,378,137^2}+\frac{\sin^2\theta\sin^2\varphi}{6,378,137^2}+\frac{\cos^2\theta}{6,356,752^2}}\right)^{-1}$$ We can then set some $(\theta_0,\varphi_0)$ to be the location of the elevator, and make the changes $$\theta\to\theta-\theta_0,\qquad\varphi\to\varphi-\varphi_0$$ At this point, you can use a similar method to the one used in the spherical approximation part. Part 2: Accounting for visibility problems Here, we need to discuss angular diameter. The angular diameter of an object $d$ meters wide at a distance of $D$ meters is $$\delta=2\arctan\left(\frac{d}{2D}\right)$$ In your case, $d=$10 mile$=s$16,000 meters. According to Wikipedia, the minimum angular resolution the human eye can see is about 60 arcseconds, or 1/60 of a degree. Plugging this in, we have $$D=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{16,000}{\tan(1/120)}\right)$$ I find a distance of about 55,000 kilometers. [Under construction] 

Either give the rulers hereditary diseases, or put the Empire under siege. I'm choosing to focus on the later period of Francia, during the Carolingian Empire. The major issue with states in the 6th to 11th centuries was that the very idea of a state was not at all common. The Carolingians - though, starting with Charlemagne, carrying the title of Holy Roman Emperor - came from societies which had "barbarian" (i.e. non-Roman) origins, dating back many centuries. The "barbarian" cultures were held together through kin-groups and personal loyalty to a particular king, not to some abstract entity like a country. Enduring state-building in Europe was not a result of the Greeks or the Romans, but of later times. States that would survive the reigns of many rulers fully intact were not to be, during the Carolingian Empire (or the Frankish Empire, as you called it). You might doubt this, given the fact that such an empire was even able to form, but I'd point you to three important dates: 

2.2 kilometers is about 7,200 feet, so most of these aquifers wouldn't be deep enough. Even the lower depths of some of the large ones contain dissolved solid minerals, that could be hazardous to human health. The USGS National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program has a variety of maps and data detailing water quality nationwide. Various sources of terror for groundwater include 

Time Light travels at 300,000 km/s. In the largest battles, you'd want to station your control ships on the edge of the fighting. Let's say that each one is responsible for controlling ships in a sphere with radius 150,000 km. This means that if a fighter detects something and needs to avoid it, it has to send a signal to the control ship (which will take half a second). Someone on that ship needs to make a decision; let's say they make an evasive maneuver within one second. The signal then takes a half second to travel back to the fighter. This adds an extra second - which can be critical with projectiles and ships traveling so fast. You said projectiles can travel at 20 km/s; if a ship can send a guided missile of sorts at that speed from 10 km away, it will hit the target in half a second - and the control ship won't have been able to do anything. Most shots will likely be fired at closer ranges, which gives even less time to react. That's also bad enough, but having a control ship half a light-second away makes thinks worse. You need to reduce the distance of the control ships drastically. Ideally, transmission should happen both ways in less than half a second, maybe less. So that puts you maybe four times closer to the ships - and also puts you in range of enemy attackers. I would say that, in terms of timing alone, you'd want to be less than 40,000 km away from the section of the battle you're controlling. How to attack a control ship Say an enemy fighter can travel, in battle, at a kilometer each second. That means that it would take 40,000 seconds traveling at that speed to reach the control ship, from the thick of the fighting. That is, give or take, half a day. Even if you increase this by a factor of ten, it would take an hour. That's not feasible. You'd be detected long in advance and destroyed with ease. You can't surprise the control ships. The alternative? Jump through hyperspace. On an attack run, a fighter picks up speed, then jumps to about 10 km away from a control ship. If their pre-jump speed was 1 km/s, they've got 10 seconds to start their attack, and the control ship has 10 seconds to respond. If the fighter does things just right, and aims properly, they'll be able to get in a strafing run or two. A big problem could be suicide attacks. Increase your speed to 10 km/s pre-jump and aim just for the center of the control ship, the bridge, the engines, or the communications structures. Assuming you did it right, you'll hit your target in 1 second, and the control ship won't have time to move away. So, how do you guard against these? I don't have great ideas here. You could have the control ship be constantly moving, but it can't turn too quickly - it's got humans aboard! It's defending against an attacker that has the ultimate element of surprise, and can be there in an instant, once the shields are knocked down. So here's the problem: The enemy will always bring the battle to the control ship. They might try an attack plan like the following: 

The trees are close enough that it's impossible for any vehicles larger than a small car (e.g. a Mini Cooper) to feasibly go through. 

Shuttle security breach The plausibility of a stowaway, as others have said, is doubtful. It would very difficult for the person to board the shuttle at all; it's a few orders of magnitude harder than breaking into a car, for example. Post-9/11, public access to Kennedy Space Center was restricted around the time of shuttle launches. In the first mission or two after the attacks, even the planned launch time was kept secret, meaning that this would-be stowaway would have to either be on the inside (which would help with other aspects of the plot) or be a very good guesser. Even then, the launch could be scrubbed and moved back because of things like inclement weather. The person could be kept hiding for days, likely with minimal provisions and supplies. Military personnel have often been used for security (for instance, before Columbia's final mission, because Israeli astronaut Col. Ilan Ramon was one of the members). We're not talking about a few security guards with nightsticks; we're talking about military-grade weapons used by the actual military. 1. T-0 to T+8:30 In this case, you probably want to abort the mission as soon as possible. Someone unknown is in a spaceship and could have a weapon, bomb or other harmful device. They could hijack the mission and cause serious problems. There's very little this person can do in the early stages of the launch, so that's when the crew need to act. Once the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) were ignited, no abort could be performed before SRB separation, roughly two minutes into the flight. After that, there were several abort options[1], [2]: 

Slightly simplified, this means that you can't use gravitational waves for propulsion because they don't transfer energy quite in the same way that water waves do. The analogy breaks down further because gravitational waves are plane waves, not sinusoidal waves - so you shouldn't try to visualize them as being anything like water waves. 

$R_{\text{syn}}$ is the radius at which an orbit is synchronous with the planet's rotation. Essentially, at small $L_*$, the rings should be stable at almost all radii. In regimes where $0.5<L_*<10$, there are fewer stable regions, and you can't have large stable rings. This does become less of a problem with large $L_*$, but there are still instabilities, more than for $L_*\ll1$. 

Locally, you'd want a forecast of sunny, with a high in the upper 1650's (degrees Celsius). Wikipedia indicates that your scenario involves vitrified sand, which can form at that temperature and become glass-like. The page notes that types of vitrified sand can form from interactions with lightning, nuclear detonations, or meteor strikes (note that it does not cite sources, but these events seem plausbile). I'd aim for a couple thousand degrees Celsius. The page also notes that volcanic glass does not fall into this category.

According to Wikipedia, titanium (which I have chosen to use, even though it's not a requirement) is diamagnetic but not ferromagnetic. That means that direct diamagnetic levitation is possible. Diamagnetic levitation will work when $$B\frac{dB}{dz}\geq\mu_0\rho\frac{g}{\chi}$$ where $B$ is the magnetic field, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, and $\chi$ is magnetic susceptibility. According to this, $\chi\approx1.51\times10^{-4}\text{ cm}^3\text{ mol}^{-1}$. Changing the units, we get $1.51\times10^2\text{ m}^3\text{ mol}^{-1}$ The molar mass of titanium is $0.047867\text{ kg mol}^{-1}$, so $\chi\approx3155\text{ m}^3\text{ kg}^{-1}$. This means that diamagnetic levitation will work when $$B\frac{dB}{dz}\geq1.76\times10^{-5}\text{ T}^2/\text{m}$$ This sounds surprisingly easy, so I suspect that I messed up somewhere. Anyway, the point is, we might be able to levitate a mountain made of titanium. Stronger magnetic fields might be needed to lift up the base if I'm wrong in my calculations, but making the machine mainly hollow might do the trick. The reason this is important is that you need to lift these creatures off the ground to move them forward. This will reduce friction a lot. For propulsion, I would suggest going in the direction of maglev trains. Granted, they use methods other than diamagnetism for levitation, but you could write up some of the same electromagnets for forwards/backwards motion.
