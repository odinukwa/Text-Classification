The inflation tax is a one-dimensional instrument. Your income tax may depend for example on household size, since the government believes that if your income is shared by a large family, you should pay less taxes. Or the amount of VAT you pay will in many countries depend whether you spend it on luxury cars or food. An inflation tax cannot make such distinctions. This is probably the prime answer to almost all questions of the kind "why don't we simplify taxation by doing X". It would be not very hard to remove a lot of bureaucratic costs by simplifying taxation systems. But the result will often conflict with what the population/government perceives as "fair". Inflation taxes are (more or less) equivalent to taxes on cash holdings. However, cash holdings for example in the U.S. are less than 1/20 of annual GDP. Thus, you would need massive inflation taxes of about 200% to get anywhere near the current federal government revenue (>10% of GDP). At this point it is no longer clear (read: very unlikely) whether the reduction in bureaucracy outweighs the costs of inflation. It is hard to create reliable institutions which would guarantee a fixed stream of income to the current government and resist pressure from the government to increase this income. Even in countries with independent central banks, it is not uncommon for political parties to argue for reducing central bank independence. The costs of tax reforms: this is maybe the most interesting answer to the question why switching from inefficient system A to efficient system B may be...inefficient! Suppose you just sold your house and gave a credit to the person who bought the house. You plan to live from mortgage payments of the new house owner. The next day the government announces that it will switch to an inflation based system of government revenue. Suddenly, the mortgage payments are almost worthless. The loss is of course equivalent to the gain of the new house owner. However, this redistribution may conflict with the government's redistribution goal. The government then must expend costly effort to reverse the distributional effects of the tax reform. If these costs are too high, it is inefficient to switch from A to B, even though in the long run B may be more efficient. 

In what follows, I'm going to be very hand wavy - take with a grain of salt. If you think about it, a demand shock is like a scenario of multiple equilibria (given the fixed levels of wages and prices): 

I thought that the St Louis FED was the ultimative resource for macro data, but even they don't appear to have a time series of state level unemployment numbers for the United States. Who does? 

Yes and no; it depends on which interest rate you look at. You are right in that risk aversion affects interest rates, but the direction can go both ways. In what follows I look at an economy with risky (stochastic) and non risky assets and risk averse agents. For the thought experiment, we increase the volatility of the risky asset, "increasing its riskiness". Risky Asset Despite having the same expected return, due to Jensen's inequality, the risky asset gives less utility to the agents. The risky asset will need to pay a higher interest, a risk premium, to attract investors. Safe Asset We have increased the aggregate risk of the economy by making the stochastic asset more volatile. Agent's added utility from insurance (through safe assets) has increased. Demand for safe assets at the old interest increases. Holding the supply of safe assets fixed, this means that the safe asset's interest rate will go down. To understand this fully, you might want to write down a two period model with two different assets, one standard normal with standard deviation $\sigma$ and one deterministic. Examine how interest rates for both assets change if you increase $\sigma$. 

Consider the following version of KPR preferences (with $l$ being leisure): $$ U(c,l) = \left(\left(c\right)^\gamma l^\omega\right)^{1-\sigma}$$ I'm after the Frisch elasticity: $$ \frac{\partial(1-l)}{\partial w} \frac{w}{1-l}$$ Note that $\frac{\partial(1-l)}{\partial w} = -\frac{\partial(l)}{\partial w}$. In general, one can compute the first component as $$ w\frac{\partial l}{\partial w} = \frac{u_l}{u_{ll} - \frac{u^2_{lc}}{u_cc}}$$ Hence, the Frisch elasticity is given by $$ \eta = \frac{u_l}{\frac{u^2_{lc}}{u_cc} - u_{ll}}\frac{1}{1-l}$$ With the given preferences, I have that $$ u_l = \omega l^{\omega-1} c^\gamma K\\ u_c = \gamma c^{\gamma-1}l^\omega K\\ u_{cc} = (2\gamma-1)\gamma c^{\gamma-2}l^\omega K\\ u_{ll} = (2\omega-1)\omega l^{\omega-2}c^\gamma K \\ u_{cl} = 2\gamma c^{\gamma-1} \omega l^{\omega-1}K $$ and then the Frisch elasticity boils down to $$ \eta = \frac{1}{\frac{4\omega}{2\gamma-1} + 1 - 2\omega}\frac{l}{1-l}$$ It makes sense to some degree: as $\sigma$ is the inter temporal elasticity of substitution, it does not appear here. However, the relative curvatures on $c$ and $l$ appear, which is fine. However, the elasticity is not independent of $l$. As I'm somewhat in the KPR environment (despite adding curvature to $c$), I didn't expect this. Are my result correct? Does anyone have more insights on this matter? 

According to standard textbooks on public finance (e.g., Tresch, Public Finance, 3rd ed., p. 272) the tax incidence includes the deadweight loss. This is because we are interested in the burden of the tax on consumers and producers and the deadweight loss can be a large part of this. (However, see $URL$ which does not include the deadweight loss.) There are some difficulties, however. First, the deadweight loss is only a meaningful concept in partial equilibrium settings. The incidence as you described it cannot be used in general equilibrium settings as supply and demand curves shift with the introduction of the tax. Thus, the more common approach in general equilibrium is to determine the welfare loss of different individuals. 

Actually there is a large literature on the estimation of production functions. Usually, one starts out with assuming a particular functional form (CES, Cobb-Douglas, etc.) and then estimating the parameters of the model. As indicated, the mathematics of this estimation are often nontrivial. However, here are some early references which can provide you with an entry point to the literature: Aigner, D., Lovell, C. K., & Schmidt, P. (1977). Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models. Journal of Econometrics, 6(1), 21-37. FÃ¸rsund, F. R., Lovell, C. K., & Schmidt, P. (1980). A survey of frontier production functions and of their relationship to efficiency measurement. Journal of Econometrics, 13(1), 5-25. 

Regarding your first question: Usually public economists assume that utility is a concave function of income. Therefore, the utility gain from one additional dollar of income is lower for a rich person than for a poor person. This is consistent with risk averse behavior of individuals which we often observe when individuals face risky choices. If utility is concave in income and the total income is fixed, then the optimal utilitarian distribution would be that all individuals receive the same amount of income. Any deviation from this optimal income generates some loss in social welfare, which you may call "social harm". However, in many cases the optimal utilitarian distribution of income will still be unequal if a higher level of total income can be reached by allowing for inequality. Reasons for this may be asymmetric information or labor market incentives. Thus, higher inequality alone does not necessarily mean lower social welfare. But higher inequality with lower or equal income means lower social welfare in a utilitarian framework. Disclaimer: notice that if your definition of social welfare is not utilitarian, none of this applies. Extended reading: in case you are interested in this subject, I recommend you to read an introductory textbook on public finance or public economics. For a more detailed survey of how social welfare and inequality are related, see: Lambert, Peter J. "Evaluating impact effects of tax reforms." Journal of Economic Surveys 7.3 (1993): 205-242. 

Now here's the problem, on page 10, they look at it from a seller's point of view. Conditional of the seller of being matched with a buyer, what is the probability of the buyer being matched with another seller? $$ Prob(\text{being matched second seller} | \text{being matched with first seller}) = \frac{Prob(\text{being matched with first and second seller})}{Prob(\text{being matched with first seller})} \\ = \frac{\text{search twice and find both times}}{\text{search once and find a seller or search twice and find one or two sellers }} \\ = \frac{\psi_u\nu^2}{((1-\psi_u) * \nu) + (\psi_u)*(\nu + \nu)}\\ = \frac{\psi_u\nu}{1+\psi_u}\\ $$ However, what they get is $$ \frac{2\psi_u\nu}{1+\psi_u}$$ They compute some "intermediate probabilities" on page 8, but I don't see how they help get their result. How does one get their result? 

A similar thing exists with credit cards, which both facilitate the payment process and also make people care less about the amounts they're spending [reference needed]. 

While it is typically hard to assess that something is not a term/thing, a google search for "intelligent money" only returned an investment company. 

Setup Blanchard-Diamond (1994) have a model where each unemployed has a single ball (application) that she tosses into urns (vacancies). With probability $a$ the application lands in the urn - the unemployed manages to fill out the form, and his application is "valid". Vacancies are open for a fixed period and then evaluate their application pool, leading to multiple applications per vacancy. Under some conditions, the distribution of applications per vacancy (denoted as $g(x)$) will be Poisson with expected value $au/v$. Firm-based job-finding rate The number of matches is hence given by the measure of vacancies that have at least one application, times the number of vacancies $$M = (1-g(0))v$$ and the job-finding rate is given by $$ M/u = (1-g(0))v/u$$ Unemployed-based job-finding rate Instead of looking at the firms, one can look at the unemployed. As firms randomly draw from the pool of applicants, the average chance of an unemployed matching is the probability of matching times the inverse of the number of contestants that he will face: $$ f = a\frac{1}{E[x | x > 0]} \\ = a\frac{1}{\frac{E[x]}{1-g(0)}}\\ = a\frac{1-g(0)}{au/v}\\ = (1-g(0))v/u$$ Which is turns out to be the same job-finding rate as calculated from the firm's perspective. This makes sense, as it needs to be an identity. Firm-state-based job-finding rate Finally, to the part where I am struggling: An alternative way of computing this job-finding rate should be $$ \tilde f = a \sum_{x=1}^\infty Prob(\text{applicant matches with firm with $x$ many applications} | \text{ she matched}) \frac{1}{x}$$ Which basically has the same logic, but is more detailed. This is interesting when one wants to analyze the $x$-component to the job-finding rate (i.e.: How relevant are firms with 5 applicants to the job-finding rate). However, the probability appears to be complicated. How do I compute this job-finding rate? 

Note first that if an individual generally reacts to increases in the wage by a decrease in labor supply, then the individual must have maximal labor supply at a wage of 0. I will supply such an example but the example can be adjusted to a more realistic setting. Let's start with the consumer problem. Suppose there is no capital income, such that $c=w\cdot l$ where $w$ is the real wage. If we think of a reason why labor supply is decreasing in income, then one idea is that the higher the consumption, the larger the disutility from labor. (This is actually not that far fetched, think of how lovely leisure can be with a yacht.) So let's take a standard quasilinear utility function and adjust it to $u=\ln c+(1-l\cdot c)$. Inserting the budget constraint yields: $u=\ln (w \cdot l) + (1-w\cdot l^2)$. As the function is concave in $l$, first order conditions are necessary and sufficient for a maximum: $$1/l - 2wl = 0$$ from which follows $l=(1/(2w))^{.5}$ and labor supply is decreasing in the wage. We could generalize this function by adding an offset to $c$ and $l$ in order to create the income effect dominance only after a certain wage rate. 

We know that if we start with a connected, separable product space $V_1\times,...,\times V_n$ and a complete, transitive, and continuous preference relation $\succsim$ on this product space, that there exists a continuous! utility representation $u:V_1\times,...,\times V_n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. However, continuity $\neq$ differentiability. Thus, I am curious under which conditions there even exists a differentiable utility function. My first idea would be to at least restrict the product space to $\mathbb{R}^n$, but there may be counterexamples. For example, if $n=1$ and $u$ is the Weierstrass function, $u$ is continuous, but not differentiable. Since in Economics we constantly work with differentiable utility, I am wondering which assumptions are necessary to ensure differentiability. 

This is quite a common response to an exchange rate crisis (which normally also suggests broader economic problems). The consequences depend on how diligently the government applies the ban, the relationship between government and businesses that trade internationally and how far the official rate strays from the true (black market) rate. First, it is almost always possible to buy and sell currency on the black market, and perhaps legally in neighbouring countries. The black market rate is likely to follow the downward trajectory of the currency prior to the ban. Exchange controls create risk for currency traders, so buying and selling on the black market tends to be expensive (i.e. the rates for buying and selling move further apart). Second, lots of businesses urgently need foreign currency to import inputs and goods for retail sale. They will try and find a strategy for obtaining that currency. They may be able to buy it on the black market. If the government is able to sell some local currency at the official (overvalued) rate, it may also sell foreign currency at the official rate to firms it sees as a priority (e.g. oil importers or friends of the regime). For instance, tourists entering East Germany were forced to buy a certain quantity of local currency per day of their visit at the official rate, giving the government a source of forex. If these strategies are not possible, companies may try to create symmetry in their import/export businesses, so that they can use the foreign exchange they earn themselves to cover their imports. Government may or may not intervene to prevent this. Importing firms without a viable strategy are likely to fail. All in all it makes international trade more difficult and expensive, so prices of imported goods are likely to rise even more quickly than they were under the sliding exchange rate. The most reasonable motivation for this type of exchange control is to prevent people and companies from shifting their savings into another currency, which could cause a general banking collapse. If you see the exchange rate falling continuously, you would be tempted to convert your savings from local currency to dollars, which hold their value. If everyone does this, the exchange rate slide accelerates, banks can't cover their liabilities, loans are called in, and banks and businesses may fold. The Soviet bloc is a common example of the use of official exchange rates but they've been used by governments in trouble all over the world, recently in various African countries, a few in South America and less recently in Asia.
