It is possible to do this. Here is a sketch of the construction: 1) Let $w = (|x|-1)h(x/|x|)$. Then $w$ satisfies the desired boundary conditions, and is smooth away from the origin with $\Delta w = (n-1)h > 0$ on $\partial B_1$. The idea is to find an appropriate extension of $w$ from a neighborhood of the boundary to the interior. 2) Let $v_0 = \max\{w, \, c_0(|x|^2 - 1) - c_0\}$. For $c_0 > 0$ small, $v_0 = w$ near the boundary and $v_0$ is the quadratic on a set $E$ whose boundary is a radial graph just inside of $\partial B_1$. Furthermore, $\Delta v_0 > c_1 > 0$ in the distributional sense. 3) Now let $\eta$ be a smooth cutoff function that is $1$ near $\partial B_1$ and $0$ in a neighborhood of $E$. Take $$v = \eta v_0 + (1-\eta) v_{\epsilon},$$ where $v_{\epsilon}$ is a mollification of $v_0$ (so $\Delta v_{\epsilon} > c_1$). Then $v = w$ near $\partial B_1$. Since $v_0 = w$ is smooth where the derivatives of $\eta$ are supported, it is straightforward to check that $\Delta v$ is smooth and positive in $B_1$ for $\epsilon$ small, completing the construction. 

In the real case, one can also use a Harnack inequality for the linearized equation due to Caffarelli and Gutierrez (here). The idea goes as follows. If $\det D^2u = 1$, then by the concavity of the equation, $\varphi = \Delta u$ is a positive subsolution to the linearized equation: $$u^{ij}\varphi_{ij} \geq 0.$$ A version of the mean value inequality holds for subsolutions to this equation, in an ellipsoidal geometry in which the balls are replaced by the level sets of $u$. If $u$ has zero boundary data on a domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ equivalent to $B_1$ up to dilations, then Caffarelli and Gutierrez show that these level sets have covering properties that are good enough to imitate the proof of the Krylov-Safonov Harnack inequality, giving $$\varphi(0) \leq C(n) \int_{B_{1/2}} \varphi \,dx$$ (since $B_{1/2}$ contains some reasonably round level set of $u$), and since $\varphi = \Delta u$ and $u$ is locally Lipschitz, one sees that the right side is bounded by integrating by parts. (Actually, The Harnack inequality for linearized Monge-Ampere only requires that $\det D^2u$ is bounded above and below by positive constants, but we need the right side to be nice to say that $\Delta u$ is a subsolution.) Both this and the Pogorelov computation are based on on the observation that $\Delta u$ has no local maxima. While this method is more involved, advantages are that it doesn't require one to guess tricky cutoff quantities, and that it gives a helpful geometric understanding of the degeneracy/ affine invariance of the equation. A disadvantage is that it heavily relies on the convexity of $u$, which doesn't hold in e.g. the complex setting. 

Consider $u_{\epsilon} = \rho_{\epsilon} \ast \log$ in $B_{1/2} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, where $\rho_{\epsilon}$ are standard mollifiers. Then $|u_{\epsilon}(0)|$ blows up as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$, and $\Delta u_{\epsilon} = \rho_{\epsilon}$ (representation formula) has unit mass independent of $\epsilon$. Taking $V = \rho_{\epsilon}/u_{\epsilon}$ and $f = 0$, we see that the estimate doesn't hold. Unbounded examples include $u = \log\log(r^{-1})$ in $B_{1/8} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \geq 2$ (taking $V = \Delta u / u$ and $f = 0$). In the case $n = 2$ the Laplace is $(r|\log r|)^{-2}$ which is integrable near the origin, and in the case $n \geq 3$ the Laplace is order $r^{-2}|\log r|^{-1}$ which is $L^{n/2}$. The underlying reason the estimate fails is that $\int |\Delta u|^{n/2}\,dx$ is invariant under the scaling $u \rightarrow u(Rx)$. This gives another approach to constructing examples: for $n = 1$ start with the building block $u_0$ that smoothly connects $0$ to the left and $x$ to the right, and take a weighted sum of translations, e.g. $u = 1 + \sum_{k > 0} k^{-3}u_0(k^3(x + 1/k))$ (a modification of $\log$). (In fact, by summing Lipschitz rescalings $a_k^{-1} u_0(a_k(x + 1/k))$ with $a_k$ as large as we like we can make $\int |u''|^{1/2}$ arbitrarily small). 

I think that $H_0$ grows like $e^{A}$, which is optimal in light of the example $u(x,t) = e^{-At}\cos(x)$ which solves $u_t - A\Delta u = 0$. Say we fix $C_i$ and the corresponding Harnack constant is $H$, and that $u$ is positive in $B_2 \times [-4,0]$. The proof is by applying the Harnack inequality to the rescaling you suggested, $\tilde{u}(x,t) = u(x, t/A)$, which is defined on $B_2 \times [-4A,0]$. Iterating the Harnack inequality we have that $\tilde{u}|_{B_1 \times \{-A\}} < H\tilde{u}(0,-A + 1) < H^2 \tilde{u}(0,-A + 2) ... < H^A\tilde{u}(0,0)$. Scaling back gives the Harnack inequality $u|_{B_1 \times \{-1\}} \leq H^Au(0,0)$. Remark: I think the dependence on the ellipticity ratio $\Lambda = C_1/C_0$ (say we fix $C_0 = 1$ and let $C_1$ get large) can be understood similarly, with dependence going exponentially in $\sqrt{\Lambda}$ as suggested by the stationary example $u = e^{\sqrt{\Lambda}x}\cos(y)$, which solves the elliptic equation $tr(A \cdot D^2u) = 0$ where $A = \text{diag}(1,\Lambda)$. This is because $u$ is harmonic in an ``ellipsoidal geometry'' where the balls are ellipsoids with vertical axis $1$ and horizontal axis $1/\sqrt{\Lambda}$, and the proof by rescaling/iterating in overlapping ellipsoids for constant coefficients works. This is intuitively the worst case scenario, since if the coefficients jump around then the ellipsoids "rotate" and one iterates the Harnack inequality fewer times, but to do things rigorously I think one needs to go through the original proof. (Maybe there is a good probabilistic interpretation of this too.) 

In my view, the key point the ABP estimate is that it ties pointwise information (the PDE) to information in measure (the contact set). This is crucial to regularity theory for non-divergence equations; it enables the proof of a Harnack inequality (due to Krylov and Safonov), and $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear elliptic equations. For divergence equations, whose solutions are already defined by integrals, it is a bit easier to obtain regularity. Note that the technique of looking at a local maximum, we only use the equation at a single point. In the proof of ABP that I know, we use the equation at many points. Here's the theorem I'd like to discuss: If $a^{ij}(x)u_{ij} \leq 1$ in $B_1$ (uniformly elliptic)and $u|_{\partial B_1} \geq 0$ then $|inf_{B_1}u| \leq C |A|^{1/n}$ where $A$ is the set where $u$ agrees with its convex envelope. (The contact set). Another way to describe $A$ is the collection of points in $B_1$ for which the graph of $u$ can be touched below by a supporting hyperplane. It is reasonable to believe that, given a supersolution, it doesn't have "cone-like" behavior, i.e. few points in $A$, roughly because the Hessian would be too large and contradict the equation at these points. This observation is made rigorous by the Area Formula; all the planes of slope $c|inf_{B_1}u|$ touch $u$ by below somewhere in $B_1$, so the derivative mapping $Du(B_1)$ contains a ball of radius $c|\inf_{B_1}u|$. The Jacobian determinant of this mapping is $detD^2u$, which tells us locally "how much we curved", i.e. the measure of the set of slopes of supporting hyperplanes nearby. The PDE tells us that at each of these points in $A$, $det D^2u$ is not too large, completing the proof. Prof. Ovidiu Savin uses a similar technique in his paper "Small Perturbation Solutions of Elliptic Equations" to prove an ABP-type estimate; in this version, we slide paraboloids up from below the solution until they touch and show that the set of contact points has measure controlled below by the set of vertices of these paraboloids. This gives information in measure that can be exploited to prove a Harnack inequality and $C^{\alpha}$ regularity in the setting of the paper. I hope this helps! 

This version is still true: if $u$ had a local maximum at $(x,\,T)$, say with $u(x,\,T) = 0$, then $u \leq 0$ in a small parabolic cylinder centered at $(x,\,T)$. After rescaling we can assume that $u \leq 0$ in $\overline{B_1} \times [0,\,1]$, with $u(0,\,1) = 0$. Replacing $u$ with $u - \frac{\epsilon}{4n}t(|x|^2-1) - \frac{\epsilon}{8n}$ we may assume that $(\partial_t - \Delta)u < 0$, with $u \leq -\epsilon / 8n$ on $(B_1 \times \{0\}) \cup (\partial B_1 \times [0,1])$ and $u(0,1) = \epsilon / 8n$. However, by the maximum principle, on the cylinders $\overline{B_1} \times [0,1-\delta]$, $u$ achieves its maximum on the sides or bottom, so $u \leq 0$ on all such cylinders. Taking $\delta \rightarrow 0$ we get a contradiction. 

Boundedness of $f$ isn't enough to get extra regularity for $\phi_1$. Take for example $\phi = r^{\gamma}\sin(\theta)$, which solves an equation of the desired form with $f = (\gamma^2-1)\sin(\theta)$, which is discontinuous at the origin. Then $$\phi_1(1/{\sqrt{2}},1/{\sqrt{2}}) = \frac{1}{2}(\gamma-1),$$ so by homogeneity $$\phi_1(\epsilon,\epsilon) \sim \epsilon^{\gamma-1}$$ and the estimate you got from scaling can't be improved. 

Observe that if $u$ is homogeneous of degree $\alpha$, then $N(r) \equiv \alpha$. (After integrating by parts, the numerator becomes $r \int_{\partial B_r} u u_{\nu} = \alpha \int_{\partial B_r} u^2$.) In addition, harmonic functions that are homogeneous of degree $\alpha$ tend to oscillate over distance $\sim \alpha^{-1}$ on $\partial B_1$ (think $r^{\alpha}\cos(\alpha\theta)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$). Roughly, the monotonicity of $N$ says that the dominant frequency represented in $u$ at scale $r$ is increasing. Some intuition comes from the expansion of $u$ in harmonic polynomials. For $r$ small, $N(r)$ only sees the lowest frequency (the first term in the expansion dominates), and as $r$ grows, the higher frequencies become more and more relevant. One proof of monotonicity comes directly from the expansion. In the context of unique continuation, monotonicity says "if the dominant frequency at $r = 0$ is $\infty$, then the same is true at all larger scales, so $u$ has to vanish in $B_1$." Another perspective (which I find more general and illuminating) is variational. Note that $N$ is invariant under transformations that preserve harmonicity (that is, under $w \rightarrow \tilde{w} := Aw(rx)$ we have $N_w(r) = N_{\tilde{w}}(1)$). In particular, $N_w$ is constant when $w$ is homogeneous of any degree. To show monotonicity of $N_u$ when $u$ is harmonic, a useful idea is to compare $u$ with the function $w$ that is homogeneous of degree $\gamma:= N_u(1)$ (the dominant frequency of $u$ in $B_1$) and has the same boundary values as $u$ on $\partial B_1$. Roughly, since $u$ is a minimizer of the Dirichlet energy, $N_u$ has to grow faster than $N_w$ (which is constant) at $r = 1$. More precisely, the condition $N_u'(1) \geq 0$ becomes $$\int_{\partial B_1} (|\nabla u|^2 - 2\gamma u u_{\nu}) - (n-2) \int_{B_1} |\nabla u|^2 \geq 0.$$ The second term is larger than the corresponding quantity for $w$ by energy minimality. The first term is $$\int_{\partial B_1} |\nabla_{\partial B_1} w|^2 + (u_{\nu} - \gamma u)^2 - \gamma^2w^2 = \int_{\partial B_1} |\nabla w|^2 - 2\gamma ww_{\nu} + (u_{\nu} - \gamma u)^2$$ which is larger than the corresponding quantity for $w$, completing the proof. In my view, monotonicity formulae in variational problems (free boundary problems, minimal surfaces, etc.) come from playing with quantities that are invariant under the natural scaling of the problem, and involve the energy. (This is the way I remember the Almgren quantity). The monotonicity of these quantities on minimizers comes from comparison with the scaling-invariant objects with the same boundary data. The clearest example is minimal surfaces: if $0$ is in a surface of dimension $n-1$, the quantity ($A(r)$:= area in $B_r$)/$r^{n-1}$ is dilation-invariant and constant on cones. The monotonicity on a minimal surface comes from comparing with the cone over the intersection of the surface with $\partial B_1$. Indeed, the area of the cone in $B_r$ grows more slowly at $r = 1$ since it crosses $\partial B_1$ orthogonally, and its area in $B_1$ is larger than that of the minimal surface, so $A'(1) - (n-1)A(1)$ for the minimal surface is larger than the corresponding quantity for the cone, which vanishes. I hope this helps!
