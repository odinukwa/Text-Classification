I had pretty much forgotten, but Craig Huneke and I needed to know something about traces a few years ago, and couldn't find a good reference, so we put some facts as an appendix in this paper. Our context forced us to define the trace of a module, rather than an algebra, but of course you can just ignore the algebra structure on $B$. The setup for us was this: Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring and $M$ a finitely generated torsion-free $R$-module. The trace of $M$ is an $R$-homomorphism $\mathrm{End}_R(M) \to R$, which matches the one you're describing if $M$ is free. It's obtained as follows: let $\alpha : Hom(M,R)\otimes_R M \rightarrow End(M)$ be the natural homomorphism defined by $\alpha(f\otimes x)(y) = f(y) \cdot x$. If the dual of $\alpha$, that is $\alpha^*$, is an isomorphism from $Hom(End_R(M),R)$ to $End_R(Hom(M,R))$, then the trace of $M$ is $(\alpha*)^{-1}$ of the identity on $Hom(M,R)$. We say then that $M$ "has a trace." [Exercise: if $M$ has $R$-torsion, then the trace of $M$ is the same as the trace of $M/\mathrm{torsion}$, so defining the trace in the torsion-free situation is enough.] Now, here's the sufficient condition we needed (Prop A.2): if $R$ satisfies $(S_2)$ and $M_p$ is free over $R_p$ for all height-one primes $p$, then $M$ has a trace. This is a jazzed-up version of your (3), and maybe helps with (4). (Parenthetically, we also needed to know when the trace was surjective, which is where the characteristic comes in, and I conflated it with the trace existing in one of my comments earlier.) 

For the always existence of Hilbert space ‎$H‎$ need some conditions about Banach space and structure of Gaussian measure to be satisfied as montioned in the below theorem where the uniqness is the strong condition for existence but in your case it's not always Hilbert space ‎$H‎$ exist : 

The transfert operator describe an expression or formula of a transform that $\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{a_k x^k}{k!}$ into $ \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{a_k B_k(x)}{k!}$ is the p-adic operator such that :The eigenvalues of the p-adic transfer operator are the Bernoulli polynomials,and are associated with the eigenvalues $p^{-n}$ , Try to check this paper by LINAS VEPŠTAS, page 8. Theorem with proof show that 

For more informations look this paper about "Gaussian Measures on a Banach Space" theorem 8.2.5 with a complet proof. Edit: I edited my answer because I don't meant the existence of Hilbert space $H‎$ related to the given question but i meant the existence will be satisfied if and only if the conditions cited in theorem 8.2.5 hold 

Note: The Motivation of this question is to find a Series representation of :$\int _{0}^{t}\exp(-x^2 \operatorname{erf}(x))dx$ 

Note: Here i present the method assuming GRH when the rank is large compared to the conductor .may this helping you . Take $f(x)$ to be a function such that $f(0)=1$ and $f(x)\geq0$ for all real $x$ Then, assuming the Riemann hypothesis, the sum :$\sum f(\beta)$ where $1/2+i\beta$ runs over the nontrivial zeros of $L(s,E)$,will be an upper bound for the analytic rank of $E$ Moreover, for certain choices of $f(x)$ this sum may be efficiently evaluated using the explicit formula for the $L$-function attached to $E$ , The method, is available as part of William Stein’s (W. A. Stein et al., Purple PSAGE, The PSAGE Development Team, 2011,) 

Self-advertisement alert: In Chapter 1 of my book with Roger Wiegand we give a complete proof for complete local rings. It follows from a more general fact about additive categories in which every idempotent splits, that the key property is that endomorphism rings of indecomposable modules must be local (in the non-commutative sense). We don't have much use for graded rings, so don't address them, 

On page 2163, the second line, the authors say "therefore ... is exact". I, and some others, believe this is a gap. The authors have been contacted (in 2010) and have not clarified. 

Levin-Vasconcelos (journal link): for $R$ a local ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$, the existence of a finitely generated $R$-module $M$ such that $\mathfrak{m}M$ has finite projective dimension and $\mathfrak{m}M\neq 0$ implies R is regular. Applied to $M=\mathfrak{m}^{n-1}$, this implies that if any nonzero power of the maximal ideal has finite projective dimension, then $R$ is regular. 

Nothing. Assume $R=k$, a field, for specificity. Then $k[x_1]$ is a principal ideal domain, as you know, but $k[x_1,x_2]$ has ideals with unbounded number of generators. Specifically, $(x_1,x_2)^n$ is minimally generated by $n+1$ elements for all $n$. One can get higher rates of growth by adding more variables. 

The McKay correspondence mentioned in Hailong's and Mike's answers extends to maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over the invariant rings $R=k[x,y]^G$, where $G$ is a finite subgroup of $GL(2,k)$ (with $|G|$ invertible in $k$). In particular (Herzog) all such subrings have only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable MCM modules, that is, they have finite CM type. The converse is true in characteristic zero -- that a two-dimensional complete normal domain over $\mathbb{C}$ of finite CM type is a ring of invariants -- by a result of Auslander. The case $G \subset SL(2,k)$ corresponds to $R$ being Gorenstein, and in particular a hypersurface -- namely the ADE hypersurfaces listed in Mike's answer. The correspondence between the irreducible representations of $G$ and the components of the exceptional fiber extends to include the irreducible MCM modules, and the McKay quiver (aka Dynkin diagram) is the same as the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver. The modules are directly connected to the irreps by Auslander, and directly connected to the components of the fiber by Gonzales-Sprinberg--Verdier and Artin--Verdier, extended to the non-Gorenstein case by Esnault and Wunram. Most of this is in the current draft of my notes with Roger Wiegand on MCM modules, chapters 4, 5, and 6. (Ignore the geometry in Chapter 5 -- it's riddled with errors and I'm currently rewriting it. Or you're welcome to point out errors I might not have noticed yet.) The question of what happens to the Auslander-Reiten-McKay correspondence for $G \not\subset SL(2)$ is addressed in some recent papers of Iyama and Wemyss. (You only get some of the indecomposable MCMs, the so-called special ones.) 

If $E$ is not CM, then the action of complex conjugation on $E$ depends on how it is embedded into $\mathbb{C}$. In particular, it could have different real subfields depending on which embedding you are using. When $E$ is CM, so that it is a totally imaginary quadratic extension of the totally real subfield $F$, then it has a unique complex conjugation that commutes with all automorphisms of $E$, such that $F$ contains precisely the elements that are fixed by complex conjugation in all embeddings. This lets you talk about unitarity and hermiticity for the abstract field $E$, and not just for some particular embedding. Or, to put it another way, there can be more than one way to consistently define a complex conjugation on your field, unless it is CM, in which case there is a unique way to define it. 

Just a thought, but maybe you should have a look at sage. It's a big open source project that is currently under very active development. If you're interested in contributing, I would suggest that you post to the sage-devel Google group with this same question. Some thoughts for things to do would be to improve the support for relative extensions of number fields and for function fields. 

I believe the double cover you are looking for is just $\tilde{U}(n) = \tilde{U}(1) \times SU(n)$, where $$\tilde{U}(1) = \lbrace\exp(\phi T) : 0 \leq \phi < 4\pi\rbrace$$ is the double cover of $U(1)$ and $T$ is a formal generator of its Lie algebra. This cover factors through the usual cover $U(1)\times SU(n) \to U(n)$ as $$(\exp(\phi T),U) \mapsto (e^{i\phi/2},U) \mapsto e^{i\phi/2} U.$$ So the problem reduces to classifying the $\tilde{U}(1)$ representations and the $SU(n)$ ones, and the answer is straightforward. First decompose $$L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) \simeq \bigoplus_{N=0}^\infty V_N,$$ where $V_N$ is the eigenspace of $H$ with eigenvalue $2N+1$. Then $\tilde{U}(1)\times SU(n)$ should act irreducibly on each $V_N$ as $$(\exp(\phi T),U) \mapsto e^{iN\phi/2} \cdot \mathrm{Sym}^N U.$$ It is easy to see this. The $\tilde{U}(1)$ action is the same as with the usual $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ case. You can easily derive the $SU(n)$ representations using the Fock space isomorphism of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with a Hilbert space of analytic functions: $$L^2(\mathbb{R}^n) \simeq L^2_\mathrm{hol}\(\mathbb{C}^n,\pi^{-n}e^{-||z||^2/2}dz).$$ Under this isomorphism, $V_N$ maps to the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $N$, and $SU(n)$ acts on polynomials in the usual way as $(Uf)(z) = f(Uz)$. This is probably all contained in Bargmann's classic paper. 

No. $R = k[x,y]/(xy)$, $M = R/(x)$. The zero module has infinite depth and support of dimension $-\infty$, so should not be considered MCM. 

One inequality is obvious -- a surjection $M \longrightarrow R^r$ will give a subspace of dimension $r$. 

edit: this answer is garbage (or, rather, answers a question that the asker did not ask). I leave it here because Hailong's answer refers to some of its ingredients. $3$ is the least possible. Ingredient 1: For a one-dimensional complete local ring $R$ with integral closure $\tilde R$, the $k$-dimension of $\tilde{R}/R$ is one less than the multiplicity $e(R)$ of the ring (this is false: I confused $\tilde{R}/\mathfrak{m}$ with $\tilde{R}/\mathfrak{m}\tilde{R}$). This is because $e(R) = \dim_k (\tilde {R}/\mathfrak{m}\tilde{R})$, which is due to Greither in 1982. Ingredient 2: There is an inequality due to Abhyankar for the multiplicity of a CM local ring: $$e(R) \geq \mu_R(\mathfrak{m}) - \dim R + 1$$ where $\mu$ denotes the minimal number of generators. Ingredient 3: It's relatively easy to see that for a Gorenstein local ring that is not a hypersurface (e.g. a one-dimensional non-planar Gorenstein local ring) we can do one better than Abhyankar's bound. Namely, if we had equality in Abhyankar's bound, then $\mathfrak m^2 = \mathbf{x}\mathfrak m$ for some minimal reduction $\mathbf{x}$ of the maximal ideal. Count lengths in $\bar{R} = R/(\mathbf{x})$, remembering that it has one-dimensional socle since $R$ is Gorenstein, to see that $\dim R = \mu_R(\mathfrak m) -1$. Therefore we have $$e(R) \geq \mu_R(\mathfrak{m}) - \dim R + 2$$ for a Gorenstein non-hypersurface $R$. Applying this formula with $\mu_R(\mathfrak m) \geq 3$ and $\dim R = 1$, we get that the multiplicity is at least $4$, so the degree is at least 3. 

This question is related to my question here such that i want to find a closed form of $\int_{-1}^1 x^{2k} (\operatorname{erf}(x))^k \,dx $ , for $k$ is even integer because for odd integer is $0$ as we have integrand of odd function , Really for $k=2$ it gives a nice closed form as shown here in wolfram alpha, Now my question here is : 

I'm interesting to know if there is general solution for the below equation and it's geometrical interpretation then my question here is : 

Hint: try to check this online book under this title The math encyclopedia of smarandach type notion in number theory include also arithmitic function , And bellow papers , However they include iterate sum of divisor function, but you w'ill find solution of your problem , papers include " meta perfect number:" Cohen, Graeme L., and Herman JJ te Riele. "Iterating the sum-of-divisors function." Kátai, I. "On the prime power divisors of the iterates of $\phi(n)$ and $\sigma(n)$, Šiauliai Math." Semin 4.12 (2009): 125-143 Experimental Mathematics 5.2 (1996): 91-100. 

Hint: This is not an answer but probably helping you . For $\beta =0 $ the request polynomial is Hermite polynomial with the weight $e^{-x²}$ , but for $\beta >0 $ it seems the polynomial is $p_n(x)= x^n$ , with $n$ is odd integer and you have $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} p_n(x)p_m(x)2\cosh(\beta x)e^{-x^2}=0$ ,with $m$ is even integer, Here we have :$$\int_{-a}^a f(x) \rm{d} x =0$$ because $f(x)$ is an odd function.,and this means the orthogonality polynomials . 

For example Recurrence relations of this type:$b_{n+1}+b_{n-1}=(n\alpha + \beta)b_n, n\geq 1 , b(0) = 0, b(1) = 1.$. with $\alpha, \beta$ real or complex appear in several contexts see sequences :A053983, A053984, A058797, A058798 

The first reference I know for dominant dimension is Nakayama's 1958 paper, where he (among other things) conjectured [something equivalent to] a finite-dimensional algebra of infinite dominant dimension is quasi-Frobenius. See Auslander and Reiten's generalized Nakayama conjecture paper from 1975. Auslander's Queen Mary notes (not widely available online, but here's a Google books link to a later, similar, Auslander paper) are the canonical place for the phrase "dominant dimension two", I think. He characterized the Artin algebras $\Gamma$ of global dimension at most two and dominant dimension at least two: they are obtained by taking an Artin algebra $\Lambda$ of finite representation type, with representation generator $M$, and setting $\Gamma = \mathrm{End}_\Lambda(M)$. (Now called the Auslander algebra of $\Lambda$.) This gives a bijection on Morita equivalence classes of finite-representation type algebras and such algebras $\Gamma$. 

This is so transparent in commutative algebra that it doesn't even merit a name. Reversing the arrows apparently gives it some kind of status, usually called "the projection formula". Given a ring map $R \longrightarrow S$, an $R$-module $M$, and an $S$-module $N$, you can either (a) consider $N$ as an $R$-module and tensor it with $M$, getting $M \otimes_R N$, or (b) tensor $M$ up to $S$, tensor there with $N$, and consider the result as an $R$-module, getting ${}_R(M \otimes_R S \otimes_S N)$. The two are identified via the associativity of the tensor product. 

In general, there are many many more reflexive modules than projective modules. As pointed out in another answer, every second syzygy is reflexive, and not necessarily projective (unless your ring happens to be regular of dimension at most $2$). Thus the converse of that answer is, I think, more interesting. In particular, assume that $R$ is (semi)local. Then there are only finitely many indecomposable projectives. If there are finitely many indecomposable reflexives, then $R$ must have dimension at most $2$, and thus finite Cohen-Macaulay type (which is a very rare condition). The moral is that reflexivity is a (very) much weaker condition than projectivity. 

If you are interested in developing quantum algorithms, there is a nice up-to-date survey by Childs and van Dam called Quantum algorithms for algebraic problems, available at $URL$ For PDE's, you might look into hyperbolic polynomials and hyperbolicity cones. The latter are characterized algebraically, there are lots of open questions about them, and their study is also practially relevant to engineering applications like convex optimization (in case practical applications, or perhaps hot funding areas, are what you're looking for). 

It sounds to me that you need to detect the tempo of the music, and not the pitch. If you are trying to use a pitch-detection algorithms, then these are going to fluctuate rapidly, as they will lock onto the high frequences in your music. It sounds like you need something that filters out all but the lowest frequencies and allows you to determine how many BPM (beat per minute) the music is, as well as the phase of the beat also, so that you can do beatmatching as you originally mention. However, I don't think that anyone here is going to be able to give you a simple formula for doing this directly from the samples. Digital signal processing is, by its very nature, a fairly mathematical subject. I do think that if you try Googling for "beat-matching signal-processing", or "beat-matching matlab", you will be pointed in the right direction, as you might find a published algorithm for doing exactly what you need. For instance, I found the following paper by searching: Design of an Automatic Beat-Matching Algorithm for Portable Media Devices. It might be worth looking at if you can get it without paying, say through a university with a subscription. Otherwise, I'm sure there are 100's of similar papers you can find on this subject. Also, many universities teach an audio signal processing class, and often the notes from these classes are online. Beat-matching is a common project for students to try in such classes and I'm sure you will be able to find some examples where people have done it. Sorry I couldn't give you more explicit advice, but I hope I understood your question correctly and have pointed you in the right direction. Good luck.
