One of the nice features of the first admissible ordinal after $\omega$, i.e. $\omega_1^{CK}$, is that it is the collection of ordinals whose order type is that of a computable well-ordering on $\omega$. Is a similar thing true for all other admissible sets? Specifically suppose $\alpha$ is an admissible ordinal, $\alpha^+$ is the next admissible after $\alpha$ and $\alpha \leq \gamma < \alpha^+$. Is there always an $\alpha$-computable well-ordering on $\alpha$ of order type $\gamma$? If so can someone also provide a reference for the result? 

Suppose there is a bag with $M$ white marbles and $N - M$ black marbles. Let $H(n, N, M)$ be a random variable which is number of white marbles in a draw, without replacement, of $n$ marbles from a bag. It is known (see [1]) that $$ Pr\left[ \frac{H(n, N, M)}{n} \geq \frac{M}{N} + t\right] \leq e^{-2t^2 n} $$ and $$ Pr\left[ \frac{H(n, N, M)}{n} \leq \frac{M}{N} - t\right] \leq e^{-2t^2 n} $$ I am looking for a similar lower bound to the left hand side. Specifically a function $f(n, N, M, t)$ such that 

I would like to second Andrej's answer as that was my first instinct as well. However I thought I would also give some links to related concepts. In particular if you are willing to change the natural numbers to some other set and use a different "notion of computability" then this idea appears in several places. For example: Represented spaces and Type Two Effectivity (TTE) Underlying set: Baire space ($\omega^\omega$) Notion of Computable Function: Extensions of computable functions from $\omega^{<\omega}$ to $\omega^{<\omega}$.

It is worth noting that if $T$ is a first order theory or a sentence of $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$ (2) can't happen. This is connected with Barr's Covering Theorem. Next I want to talk about your question on the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem and your observation about in local presentability giving a notion of cardinality in a Grothendieck topos. While the notion of presentability does give a nice notion of size in a Grothendieck topos, once we are in this framework there are several other notions of size which are useful. For a discussion of several of them as well as several model theoretic results that lift to Grothendieck toposes (including the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem) you might look at: On transferring model theoretic theorems of $L_{\infty, \omega}$ in the category of sets to a fixed Grothendieck topos. This paper also discusses Morley's theorem on the number of models in a Grothendieck topos: The Number Of Countable Models In Categories of Sheaves. Also if you are interested in model theory in realizability toposes you can also check out: The Number Of Countable Models In A Realizability Topos. While the specific case of presentability rank isn't discussed in these papers it should be relatively straightforward to prove a Lowenheim-Skolem theorem with respect to presentability rank. Specifically, given a theory $T$ which has a model in a Grothendieck topos $G$ it should be relatively straight forward to find a model with presentability rank at most $|T| + |(C, J)|$ where $G \cong Sh(C, J).$ Roughly the argument should go something like the following: 

$\eta_g$ is a de Rham representative of the Poincare dual of the diagonal; The pullback under the diagonal inclusion $\iota:M\to M\times M$ is proportional to the curvature Pfaffian: $\iota^*\eta_g=\tfrac{1}{(2\pi)^n}\text{Pf}(\text{Rm})$. 

Example. As in the previous example, let $E$ be a holomorphic line bundle over a Riemann surface $M$. By manipulating the Cauchy-Riemann equations, one can (I think!) classify the possible local rings of zeroes of a holomorphic section, and show that all of them have positive signature. Theorem 2 then yields an alternative proof of the quoted result that zeroes of holomorphic functions have positive degree. 

EDIT: It was quickly pointed out by Anton Petrunin, Pietro Majer and Vitali Kapovitch that for the compact-open topology, the answer to the first question is no (and that the second question is vacuous). Is it possible that there is some finer topology on (perhaps some subspace of) the space of curves in a length space, for which the answer to these questions is yes? For instance, consider the following property that a length space $X$ (with length functional $\mathcal{L}$) might possess: 

Let $\pi:E\to M$ be a smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold, with $\text{rank}(E)=\text{dim}(M)$. For a section $\sigma$ of $E$ with a zero at $p\in M$, define the degree of the zero at $p$ to be the topological degree of the induced map from a small sphere in $T_pM$ to a small sphere in $E_p$. One motivation for studying degrees of zeros is that they contain information about the topology of $E$. I think the following is true, although I couldn't find a good reference: Theorem 1 (Hopf index theorem). Suppose the zeroes of $\sigma$ are the isolated points $p_1, \ldots p_k$, with degrees $d_1,\ldots d_k$ respectively. Then the Euler class of $E$ is $\chi(E)=\sum_{i=1}^kd_i$. With this as motivation, my first question, the one stated in the title, is roughly (see the Example for an idea of what I'm getting at, and feel free to suggest a sharper version): 

Suppose $\Omega$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure space (I'm happy to take $\Omega = \mathbb{N}$) and let $X$ be a Banach space. It's pretty well known that the Banach dual of $L^\infty(\Omega)$ can be identified with the space of finitely additive measures of bounded variation on $\Omega$, but is there a corresponding result for the Bochner space $L^\infty(\Omega;X)$? Edit: for clarity, I define $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{N};X)$ to be the space of all bounded functions $\mathbb{N} \to X$. When $X$ is infinite dimensional, the set of simple functions (i.e. functions with finite range) is not dense in $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{N};X)$, because bounded sets in $X$ are not totally bounded. I only know the answer to this question in the `trivial' case where $X = L^\infty(\Omega)$ for some $\Omega$. 

Let $(X,d,\mu)$ be a metric measure space (i.e. $(X,d)$ is a metric space and $\mu$ is a Borel measure on $X$). Let's say that $X$ is doubling if there exists a constant $C \geq 1$ such that $0 < \mu(B(x,2r)) \leq C\mu(B(x,r)) < \infty$ for all $x \in X$ and $r > 0$ (note the finiteness and positivity conditions which don't always appear in this definition). The metric space $(X,d)$ is Polish if it is separable and completely metrisable (i.e. there exists a complete metric, not necessarily $d$, which determines the same topology). Are there any examples of metric measure spaces $(X,d,\mu)$ which are doubling but not Polish? One can prove that if $\mu(B(x,r)) \in (0,\infty)$ for all $x \in X$ and $r > 0$, then $(X,d)$ is separable, so we only need to concern ourselves with complete metrisability. (I haven't seen this in the literature anywhere, so I have no idea if this is already known, but I have a proof of my own.) My approach to this problem was to take a non-Polish metric space which is geometrically doubling (every ball can be covered by uniformly finitely many balls of half the radius) and invoke the theorem which guarantees the existence of a doubling measure (Theorem 13.3 in Heinonen's Lectures on Analysis on Metric Spaces). But alas, a key hypothesis of this theorem is that $(X,d)$ is complete (hence Polish), so this doesn't work. 

The pointed Gromov-Hausdorff limit is a line. Pulling back by the diffeomorphisms $(x,y)\mapsto (nx, 1/n y)$, we get a sequence of metrics $n^2dx^2+1/n^2dy^2$ all on the "same" torus $\mathbb{R}^2/\Lambda_1$, satisfying the above and also your extra assumption of having the same area element. These metric tensors have no ($\mathcal{W}^{k,p}$, say) limit. 

There are plenty of "non-canonical" such forms, I think. For instance, pick a neighbourhood of the diagonal which is diffeomorphic to $TM$, and transfer the Mathai-Quillen Thom form on $TM$ to this neighbourhood using a suitable diffeomorphism. (By the way, the Mathai-Quillen Thom form on the total space of a bundle-with-metric-and-connection is the model I have in mind here for what "canonical" should mean -- a form whose value at each point depends only on local invariants.) Motivation: Such a form would yield a proof of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem which is both quick and natural. Namely, $\chi(M)=PD(\Delta)\cup PD(\Delta)=\int_\Delta \eta_g =\tfrac{1}{(2\pi)^n}\int_M \text{Pf}(\text{Rm})$. 

Question: What are the connected components of the familiar spaces of functions between two (let's say compact and smooth, for simplicity) manifolds $M$ and $N$? Specifically, I'm thinking of the HÃ¶lder spaces $\mathcal{C}^{k,\alpha}(M, N)$ and the Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{W}^{k,p}(M, N)$. Some comments: 

Geometric motivation: By Clairaut's relation, if for some $T$, $$\int_c^{T}\frac{c}{t}\sqrt\frac{1+t^2}{t^2-c^2}dt=\frac{\pi}{2},$$ then there are two three distinct geodesics between the points $(T,0, \tfrac{1}{2}T^2)$ and $(-T,0, \tfrac{1}{2}T^2)$ on the paraboloid of revolution $z=\tfrac{1}{2}r^2$: one through the point $(0,0,0)$, $(0, c, \tfrac{1}{2}c^2)$ and one through the point $(0, -c, \tfrac{1}{2}c^2)$. Edit: Deleted the comment about injectivity radius which concluded my original question -- it was false. Note that the answers of Nemo and Christian Remling, below, appear to work for any integration bound $T$, not just for $T=\pi/2$: for any $T>0$, $$\lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_c^{T}\frac{c}{t}\sqrt\frac{1+t^2}{t^2-c^2}dt=\frac{\pi}{2}.$$ 

Here's an idea I had for trying to prove a theorem of the sort I ask for in Question 1. Recall the definition of the local ring of a zero $p\in M$ of a section of E: Write $\mathcal{O}_p$ for the ring of germs of smooth functions about $p$. Definition. Let $\sigma\in\Gamma(E)$ be a smooth section which vanishes at $p$. The local ring of the germ $[\sigma]_p$, denoted $Q([\sigma]_p)$, is the quotient $\mathcal{O}_p/([\sigma]_p)$, where $([\sigma]_p)$ is the ideal of $\mathcal{O}_p$ generated by "components of $\sigma$": $([\sigma]_p)=\ <\{[v(\sigma)]_p:v\text{ a nonvanishing section of }E^*\}> \ \subseteq \mathcal{O}_p$. Theorem 2 (Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili). Suppose $p$ is a zero of $\sigma$, and the local ring $Q([\sigma]_p)$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over $\mathbb{R}$. Then there is a canonical quadratic form on $Q([\sigma]_p)$, such that the degree of the zero of $\sigma$ at $p$ can be calculated as this quadratic form's signature. Because a system of PDE is precisely a constraint on the local behaviour of a section, it seems plausible that local rings of zeros of solutions of a PDE might have interesting properties. 

For $p,q \in (0,\infty)$ and $s \in \mathbb{R}$, one can define certain function spaces, $B_s^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $F_s^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces respectively. The definition of these spaces is a bit complicated, and it probably won't offer any new insight to anybody who hasn't already considered these spaces, but it can be found for example in Triebel's 'Theory of Function Spaces II' (section 2.3.1) or Grafakos' 'Modern Fourier Analysis' (section 6.5.1). For both of these spaces, one can rightfully refer to $p$ as the 'integrability index' and to $s$ as the 'regularity index'; for example, the spaces $F_s^{p,2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ are equivalent to the Sobolev spaces $W_s^{p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and one can justify the integrability/regularity interpretations when $q \neq 2$ or for the spaces $B^{p,q}_s(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Is there a simple way of describing the role of the $q$ index? Or are stuck with referring to it as 'the third index'? 

The lecture notes of the various Internet Seminars on Evolution Equations ($URL$ sound like something you'll enjoy. The topics vary with each seminar, but all are based on semigroup theory. I participated in the 16th internet seminar, and I found the lecture notes from this seminar quite illuminating (particularly when paired with Engel-Nagel). The notes are at $URL$ Enjoy! 

On a noncompact Riemannian manifold $M$, the $L^2$-spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ sits inside $\mathbb{R}$ (by self-adjointness), either to the left or to the right of $0$ depending on sign convention. I know that under various curvature assumptions one can show that the $L^p$-spectrum is equal to the $L^2$-spectrum for $p \neq 2$. Without making any geometric assumptions on $M$, is it possible to conclude that the $L^p$-spectrum of $\Delta$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$? If not, is there anything we can say about the $L^p$-spectrum without having to make any additional assumptions?
