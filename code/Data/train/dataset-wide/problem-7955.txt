Santa Claus has $N+1$ reindeer whose noses are of varying redness. Every year, Santa needs $n+1$ reindeer to pull his sleigh. The reddest-nosed reindeer always leads the sleigh. The way Santa chooses the reindeer is as follows. First, Santa chooses one reindeer to lead the sleigh; call it the $(j+1)$th reindeer. Then out of the $j$ reindeer whose noses are less red, Santa chooses $n$ more reindeer to complete the team. One year, Santa learns (on MistletOverflow) that he can simply choose $n+1$ reindeer, and then see which of them has the reddest nose. 

For instance, $P$ can't be a linear order, except in the pretty trivial case that $M$ has at most one nonzero entry. All the same questions can be asked for the poset of square submatrices of $M$ with nonzero permanent. The questions were inspired by this MO question. 

It seems unlikely that the Betti numbers can be determined by the data you list (bigraded Hilbert function and ranks of multiplication maps). Consider the following possibility: $\dim M_{1,0} = \dim M_{0,1} = 1$, $\dim M_{1,1} = 2$, and all other $M_{a,b}$ are zero; and the maps $y : M_{1,0} \to M_{1,1}$, $x : M_{0,1} \to M_{1,1}$ each have rank $1$ (all other multiplication maps are apparently zero). Given this data and nothing else, it's impossible to tell if the maps from $M_{1,0}$ and $M_{0,1}$ to $M_{1,1}$ have the same image in $M_{1,1}$, or not. An example where they have different images is $$M = (x)/(x^2,xy^2) \oplus (y)/(x^2y,y^2)$$ (where parentheses denote ideals). An example where they have the same image is $$M' = (x,y)/(x^2,y^2) \oplus (xy)/(x^2y,xy^2).$$ $M$ is generated by $x,y$ in bidegrees $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$, while $M'$ requires generators $x,y$, and an "extra" copy of $xy$, in bidegrees $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,1)$. So, not even the first Betti degrees are determined by the data that you have. Sometimes you’ll be able to read off some information. If one of the incoming maps is zero or surjective then you’ll know how many generators there are in that bidegree. At the moment I can’t think of any other cases, or anything for higher Betti numbers. 

The fat point supported at $Z$ with multiplicity $k$ is the non-reduced scheme defined by $I(Z)^k$. This is often denoted $kZ$ in the fat points literature; it must not be confused with a zero-cycle. Slightly more generally, the fat point scheme supported at distinct points $Z_1,\dotsc,Z_t$ with multiplicities $k_1,\dotsc,k_t$ is the union of the fat points, that is the scheme defined by $\bigcap I(Z_i)^{k_i}$. This is often denoted $k_1 Z_1 + \dotsb + k_t Z_t$. For a fat point scheme in affine or projective $n$-dimensional space, $\deg(kZ) = \binom{k+n-1}{n}$ and $\deg(k_1 Z_1 + \dotsb + k_t Z_t) = \sum \binom{k_i + n-1}{n}$ (not degree $k$ or $k_1+\dotsb+k_t$). 

I don't know if this is really research-level math, but here is a quick answer. For each $i=1,\dotsc,6$, let $P_i$ be the center of circle (i) and write $P_i=(x_i,y_i)$. We have $P_1=(-1,0)$, $P_3=(1,0)$, and $P_2=(x,0)$. Since Circle (4) is stacked on top of circles (1) and (2), $x_4 = \frac{x_1+x_2}{2} = \frac{-1+x}{2}$. Similarly $x_5 = \frac{1+x}{2}$. Now, the points $P_2,P_4,P_5,P_6$ form a rhombus, so the segment $\overline{P_4 P_6}$ is parallel to the segment $\overline{P_2 P_5}$. And these segments have the same length (namely $2r$) (we already said it's a rhombus...). Therefore the horizontal offsets are equal: $x_6 - x_4 = x_5-x_2$. Then $$ x_6 = x_4 + x_5 - x_2 = \frac{1+x}{2} + \frac{-1+x}{2} - x = 0. $$ 

This question was posed on MSE here three days ago, but hasn't gotten any answers or suggestions. I hope it's okay to ask it on MO, but if I should wait a little longer, please just let me know. Say $M$ is a (finite) matrix with entries in your favorite field. Let $P$ be the collection of nonvanishing minors of $M$, ordered by inclusion in the natural way. The height of $P$ is the rank of $M$. What else can one say about $P$? For example, here are some naive questions: 

A general expression of $\langle f, g \rangle$ not using integral expressions is quite simple: interpret $f$ as acting on $g$ by differentiation, i.e., replace each $x_i$ in $f$ with $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$. 

In characteristic zero, a point $a$ is in $\mathcal{Q}$ if and only if $p$ vanishes identically on each line through $a$ parallel to one of the coordinate axes, i.e., all lines given by fixing all but one of the coordinates of $a$ and allowing the remaining coordinate to vary. Indeed, the partial derivatives $\partial^i p/\partial x_k^i$ vanish at $a$ for all orders $i \geq 0$ if and only if $p$ vanishes identically on the line through $a$ parallel to the $k$th coordinate axis. (And $a \in \mathcal{Q}$ if and only if this occurs for each $k$.) This is because, when we restrict $p$ to this line and expand the resulting univariate polynomial in a Taylor series centered at $a$, the Taylor coefficients are given by the partials $\partial^i p/\partial x_k^i$, evaluated at $a$ (up to some factorial factors). So $p$ vanishes on the line if and only if its restriction to the line vanishes identically, if and only if the Taylor coefficients vanish, if and only if the pure partials of $p$ vanish at $a$. The set $\mathcal{Q}$ can be nonempty. For example, if $p$ is any linear combination of polynomial multiples of $x_j x_k$ for $j \neq k$—that is, if $p$ is any element of the ideal generated by the $x_j x_k$, $1 \leq j < k \leq n$, in the polynomial ring—then the origin $0 \in \mathcal{Q}$. One way to see this is that in any pure derivative by, say, $x_k$ to order $i$, every term of $p$ either is killed (if it has $x_k$ to a power less than $i$) or else survives, but even then that term still involves some $x_j$, $j \neq k$. So every pure derivative of $p$ vanishes term-by-term at the origin. Another way to see it, using a touch of algebraic geometry, is that the ideal generated by the products $x_j x_k$ is exactly the ideal of polynomials that vanish on the union of the coordinate axes (left to the reader), so $p$ is in the ideal if and only if $p$ vanishes identically on the coordinate axes, which is apparently equivalent to $0 \in \mathcal{Q}$. Conversely, if $0 \in \mathcal{Q}$, then $p$ can't have any "pure" terms $x_k^i$ (with a nonzero coefficient), otherwise $\partial^i p/\partial x_k^i$ would fail to vanish at the origin. This proves that in characteristic $0$, the origin $0 \in \mathcal{Q}$ if and only if $p$ is a linear combination of polynomials divisible by $x_j x_k$ for $j \neq k$, that is, $p$ is in the ideal generated by the $x_j x_k$, $j \neq k$. More generally, $a = (a_1,\dotsc,a_n) \in \mathcal{Q}$ if and only if $p$ is in the ideal generated by the products $(x_j-a_j)(x_k-a_k)$, $j \neq k$. Unlike the situation in positive characteristic, in characteristic zero, $\mathcal{Q}$ can't coincide with the zero set of $p$, except if the zero set of $p$ is empty or $p=0$. This is because if the zero set of $p$ is nonempty and coincides with $\mathcal{Q}$, then $\mathcal{Q}$ contains some point; then the union of coordinate lines through the point; then the union of all the coordinate lines through those lines, which gives all the coordinate $2$-planes through the original point; then the union of all the coordinate lines through those, which gives all the coordinate $3$-planes through the original point... In the end, the zero set of $p$ is the whole space, so $p=0$. All of the above statements hold in positive characteristic, too, if the degree of the polynomial $p$ is strictly less than the characteristic. More generally (briefly) for $m \geq 1$ let $\mathcal{Q}_m$ be the set of points where $p$ vanishes along with all of $p$'s partial derivatives of all orders that involve at most $m$ variables. The original question and above discussion are for $m=1$. In characteristic $0$, or characteristic strictly greater than the degree of $p$, $a \in \mathcal{Q}_m$ if and only if $p$ vanishes identically on the union of the $m$-dimensional planes through $a$ that are translates of coordinate $m$-planes, i.e., spanned by standard basis vectors. The origin $0 \in \mathcal{Q}_m$ if and only if $p$ lies in the ideal generated by products of $m+1$ distinct variables, $x_{i_1} \dotsm x_{i_{m+1}}$ for $1 \leq i_1 < \dotsb < i_{m+1} \leq n$. 

Yes, the flattening rank is a lower bound for border rank. First note that flattening rank is a lower bound for rank. If $T$ is a decomposable tensor (simple tensor, rank one tensor) then every flattening of $T$ has rank one. If $T$ has rank $r$, then $T$ is a sum of $r$ decomposable tensors, and so every flattening of $T$ is a sum of the corresponding $r$ flattenings of decomposable tensors. Each of those flattenings has rank $1$. A sum of $r$ linear maps of rank $1$ has rank at most $r$, so every flattening of $T$ has rank at most $r$. Now, the set of tensors of border rank less than or equal to $r$ is the Zariski closure of the set of tensors of rank $r$. (A digression: This is the $r$th secant variety of the variety of decomposable tensors, i.e., a Segre variety—at least if you set the $k$th secant variety of a variety $X$ to be the closure of the union of $(k-1)$-planes spanned by $k$ points of $X$. In this numbering the "ordinary" secant variety of lines is the $2$nd secant variety. ... At some point in writing this I have rather glossed over any distinction between affine varieties, such as sets of tensors, and projective varieties. But it doesn't matter much for discussions of rank—all the sets of tensors here are cones, so they might as well be projective varieties.) On the other hand, the set of tensors with flattening rank less than or equal to an integer $k$ is also a Zariski closed set. Indeed it is defined precisely by the vanishing of the $(k+1) \times (k+1)$ minors of the flattenings. (I am being intentionally vague as to which flattenings. You may decide if you want to consider $1$-flattenings only, or all flattenings $V_I^* \to V_{[n]\setminus I}$ for $I \subset [n]$, where $V_I = \bigotimes_{i \in I} V_i$, etc.) Putting it all together, the set of tensors of (ordinary) rank less than or equal to $r$ is contained in the set of tensors of flattening rank less than or equal to $r$. The latter is Zariski closed. Therefore the Zariski closure of the first set, the set of tensors of border rank less than or equal to $r$, is also contained in the set of tensors of flattening rank less than or equal to $r$. This is just to say that if $T$ has border rank $r$ (or less), then the flattening rank of $T$ is also less than or equal to $r$. Hence yes, as you asked, the flattening rank of $T$ is less than or equal to the border rank of $T$. It is also true for symmetric tensors with (symmetric) border rank, either by the same argument, or by an inequality between symmetric border rank and (ordinary, non-symmetric) tensor border rank. Some introductions include Landsberg, Tensors: Geometry and Applications (bonus: has a ridiculous drawing of a pickle) or Carlini, Grieve, Oeding, Four Lectures on Secant Varieties (no pickles). 

Theorem 2.2.26 of Lazarsfeld's Positivity in Algebraic Geometry, 2004, is the following: Theorem: The big cone is the interior of the pseudoeffective cone and the pseudoeffective cone is the closure of the big cone. These are convex cones. So the sum of a big class and a pseudoeffective class is in the interior of the cone, i.e., once again a big class. The proof of this theorem is pretty much along the lines of the above answer. So not an independent answer here, just offering a citation. 

Let $G$ be the (infinite) graph with vertex set $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and the following edges. When $x+y < 0$, the vertex $(x,y)$ has outgoing edges to $(x+1,y)$ and to $(x,y+1)$. When $x+y \geq 0$, the vertex $(x,y)$ has outgoing edges to $(x+1-k,y+k)$ for all $k \geq 0$. That is, to $(x+1,y)$, $(x,y+1)$, $(x-1,y+2)$, and so on. These vertices have infinite outdegree (and when $x+y>0$, infinite indegree) but we will only use finite subgraphs, with finite degrees. Now the number of directed paths in $G$ from $(-a,0)$ to $(b+1-k,k)$ is equal to $S(a,b)$. Indeed, each edge in $G$ increases the sum of coordinates $x+y$ by $1$. So every path from $(-a,0)$ to $(b+1-k,k)$ has length $a+b+1$. For a given path, label each of the $a+b+1$ steps by their vertical travel ($0$ for a step east, $1$ for a step north, $2$ for a step in direction $(-1,2)$, etc.). The total of the labels is $k$. The first $a$ steps have labels $0$ or $1$. Subsequent steps have labels $\geq 0$. The pair $(-a,0)$, $(b+1-k,k)$ may be translated by $(m,-m)$ for any $m$. In your original question you did not say exactly what determinant you are trying to evaluate. But at least some determinants of values $S(a,b)$ can now be interpreted as counting disjoint path systems in the graph $G$. Well, I don't know how easy it will be to count those paths, but anyway I hope it helps. 

Let $I = \{(T_j,T') : 1 \leq j \leq L, T_j \subseteq T', |T'|=m\}$. Projection on the first factor is $\binom{n-k}{m-k}$-to-$1$, so $|I|=\binom{n-k}{m-k}L$. Projection on the second factor is at most $\binom{m}{k}$-to-$1$, so $|I| \leq \binom{m}{k}|S|$. This shows $$ |S| \geq \frac{\binom{n-k}{m-k}}{\binom{m}{k}}L . $$ Edit: And note that $$ \frac{\binom{n-k}{m-k}}{\binom{m}{k}} = \frac{\binom{n}{m}}{\binom{n}{k}} $$ which proves the bound you were looking for. 

Tensor: for some people, a tensor is an element of a tensor product of vector spaces. For others it’s a section of a tensor product of tangent and cotangent bundles on a manifold. Members of the first group would call that latter notion a tensor field. More interestingly: Tensor rank: a tensor of rank $r$ is either a sum of $r$ simple tensors (outer products) or an element of a tensor product of $r$ vector spaces (an “$r$-dimensional array of numbers”). For example, a matrix is a rank $2$ tensor in the latter sense. I speculate that at least 25% of Math Stack Exchange questions about tensors are about confusion over one or both of the above. 

The very nice paper "Cayley-Bacharach theorems and conjectures" by David Eisenbud, Mark Green, and Joe Harris ($URL$ gives an introduction to some related theory, including in particular a theorem which they number Theorem CB4: If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are two plane curves of degrees $d$ and $e$ meeting at $de$ distinct points, and if $C$ is any curve of degree $d+e-3$ containing all but one of the intersection points of $X_1$ and $X_2$, then $C$ contains all of the intersection points. In particular, if any collection of $m+n-3$ lines covers $mn-1$ of the intersection points of the red and blue lines, then they have to cover all $mn$ intersection points (it's impossible to cover $mn-1$ and miss $1$, with $m+n-3$ or fewer lines). This shows that $m+n-2$ is the least number of lines that can cover $mn-1$ of the points and miss $1$. Credit: I couldn't for the life of me dredge up the memory of "Cayley-Bacharach" until I read Douglas Zare's answer.
