Yes. Let $a_1$ be a generator of $K_3$ over $K_1$ and let $a_2$, $a_3$, and $a_4$ be the other three roots of the polynomial of $a_1$. Then say that $a_2$ is the other root of the polynomial of $a_1$ over $K_2$. Then The Galois group of $K_4/K_1$ acts on the partitioned set $\{\{a_1,a_2\},\{a_3,a_4\}\}$, and is therefore a transitive subgroup of $D_4$, either $D_4$ itself or $C_4$ or $C_2 \times C_2$. I think that the following is a more general fact that can be proven in the same way. If $K_2/K_1$ is separable and its Galois closure has Galois group $G$, and if $K_3/K_2$ is separable and its Galois closure has Galois group $H$, then the Galois group of the Galois closure of $K_3/K_1$ is a subgroup of a wreath product of $G$ and $H$. If you take a longer chain of extensions you get an iterated wreath product. 

Here are some other comments in the spirit of Terry's and Anton's answers. There is nothing special about the symbols $\pm 1$ in the question; the spaces of binary strings $(\mathbb{Z}/2)^\mathbb{N}$ and $(\mathbb{Z}/2)^\mathbb{Z}$ are a more standard notation. As Terry says, you can switch between singly infinite and doubly infinite sequences. The process of taking pointwise limits of translates over and over again until no more data can be removed is exactly equivalent to finding a minimal set with respect to the dynamical action of the shift map. If $x$ does not lie in a minimal set, then the closure of its orbit contains a $y$ whose orbit has a smaller closure; thus $y$ is a limit of translates of $x$ in which something has been lost. On the other hand, all points in a minimal set are limits of translates of each other, so once you are in a minimal set, there is no way to erase any more data. Birkhoff established that a symbolic sequence $x$ is minimal, or lies in a minimal set, if and only if it is "almost periodic". Anton used the term "quasiperiodic", but this is a confusing term that sometimes means almost periodic and sometimes means other things. It is true that a quasiperiodic pattern such as a Penrose tiling or a quasicrystal is almost periodic. (These are higher-dimensional examples, but the issues are the same for all locally compact abelian groups.) Sometimes quasiperiodic examples have the additional property that the recurrence length $L(\ell)$ is linear in $\ell$ or $O(\ell)$. Penrose tilings are already related to one interesting class of examples in one dimension: If $\alpha$ is an irrational number between 0 and 1, then the sequence $a_n = \lfloor (n+1)\alpha \rfloor - \lfloor n \alpha \rfloor$ is an almost periodic binary sequence. What Anton could mean by the statement "you will not get more" is two things. First, that every almost periodic sequence is minimal, and therefore that you can't simplify it further by taking a limit of its translates. Second, that there isn't any simpler characterization of minimal shifts than that they are almost periodic. Section 13.7 of the book "An introduction to symbolic dynamics and coding" by Douglas Lind gives a survey of properties of minimal shifts in symbolic dynamics. Lind says that that a widely studied example is the Morse-Thue sequence, which is an example of an almost periodic sequence obtained by substitution rules. Lind says that any substitution-type almost periodic sequence, or substitution shift, has zero entropy, but that Furstenburg found an example of a minimal shift with positive entropy. This suggests that it is not always possible to "get rid of the randomness", as Tim (?) asks, even though all limits are highly structured in the sense of being almost periodic. 

Well, there are some easy points on $C_R$. The point $((1+R)/2, (1-R)/(2i))$, for example. More generally, the equation $x^2+y^2=R$ is equivalent to $(x+iy)(x-iy) = R$. So finding a rational point on $C_R$ is exactly equivalent to finding $u$ and $v$ in $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ with $uv=R$. You can do that by choosing $u$ at random, and computing $v=R/u$, $x=(u+v)/2$ and $y=(u-v)/(2i)$. I took $u=1$ above. But, as you say, if we had any way to find nontrivial solutions with $u$ and $v$ Gaussian integers, then we would have a way to factor Gaussian integers, and that is believed to be difficult. 

I am not sure I know what multilinear means. If the following $R$ is multilinear, it is a counterexample. Take $R(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = (x_1 x_2+x_3 x_4)/(x_2 x_4) = x_1/x_4 + x_3/x_2$. I claim that there is no nonconstant rational function $G$ for which $G \circ R$ is polynomial. Proof: If there were, then $G(R(t,t,1,1))$ would be polynomial in $t$, which is to say, $G(t+t^{-1})$ would be polynomial in $t$. Suppose that there is a rational function $G$ for which $G(t+t^{-1})$ is polynomial. For any complex number $t$, the function $G$ cannot have a pole at $t+t^{-1}$. But, as $t$ ranges over $\mathbb{C}$, the function $t+t^{-1}$ ranges over the entire Riemann sphere $\mathbb{C} \cup \{ \infty \}$. So $G$ has no poles at all, and is a constant. 

Just in case you don't know this, the extension of $v$ to $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ is done as follows: If $x$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}_p$, let $x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots a_0=0$ be the minimal polynomial of $x$. Then $v(x) = (1/n) v(a_0)$. Turning this into a valuation on $\mathbb{C}$ requires noncanonical choices of two kinds. For the first kind of choice, consider let $p=7$. The equation $x^2-6x+7=0$ has two roots in $\mathbb{R}$: one is roughly $4.414\ldots $ and the other is roughly $1.585\ldots $. It also has two roots in $\mathbb{Q}_7$: one is roughly $(\ldots 60)_7$ and the other is roughly $(\ldots16)_7$. You have to decide which one will be identified with which. For the second kind, there are transcendental elements of $\mathbb{C}$, such as $\pi$. You can choose their valuation freely. (More precisely, you can choose the valuations of a transcendence base freely.) 

Ryan gives a very nice answer in dimension 3, leaving the higher-dimensional case of the question open. I can't discuss the question with as much authority as I would like, but I can start to piece together an answer. My impression is that in any dimension $n$, an $(n-2)$-knot $K$ that is unknotted in $M$ is already unknotted in $B$ in the continuous category. In the smooth and PL categories, it should be the same except in $n=4$ dimensions, where the question runs into a lack of understanding of smooth (or equivalently PL) structures on 4-manifolds. First, my impression from skimming some geometric group theory is that a finitely presented group cannot be an infinite free product. Moreover, that it if it is a finite free product, the factors have unique isomorphism types. If this impression is correct, then you can identify the knot group $\pi_1(S^n \setminus K)$ from the embedded fundamental group $\pi_1(M \setminus K)$. In order to be trivial in $M$, the knot group of $K$ would have to be $\mathbb{Z}$. Then, Aspherical manifolds and higher-dimensional knots, by Bruno Eckmann, begins: 

There is a good paper of Goresky, "Triangulation of Stratified Objects", that I think reasonably quickly implies Milnor's result and its generalization to non-isolated singularities. The result is that any Whitney-stratified set, and in particular any algebraic variety in $\mathbb{C}^n$, is supported on a smooth triangulation. I think that you just need that and the inverse function theorem. As I meant to explain in the comments, this theorem has sometimes been regarded as a "chore" theorem. You can look at what Goresky says: "Triangulation theorems for stratified objects have been obtained independently by Hendricks (unpublished), Johnson (unpublished), and Kato (in Japanese)". When Goresky wrote his paper, it was a messy question that did not have a well-defined status. Now the situation is a bit better and I think that this generalization of Milnor's result can be called settled. Sometimes a good author not only proves a chore theorem, but also cleans it up an elevates it to non-chore status. But a lot of chore theorems are never proven in a clean form or are never proven at all. 

Theorem 31 is given here with proof. Schechter's Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations, Th. 20.33, p. 544, is provided as a reference for Theorem 31. The proof given there is from the paper Miller and Živaljevic, Remarks on the zero-one law, Mathematica Slovaca, vol. 34 (1984), issue 4, pp. 375-384, $URL$ 

Proof of the existence of Mazurkiewicz two-point set is in somewhat similar vein, see also this question: Subset of the plane that intersects every line exactly twice. 

The set $M$ has the desired properties. Clearly, $M$ intersects each $l_\alpha$. Moreover, if $m\in M$ and $m=m_\alpha$, then $m$ is the only point on the line $l_\alpha$. (If $m$ was added in the $\alpha$'s step, then $l_\alpha$ does not contain any of the points from $\bigcup\limits_{\beta<\alpha} M_\beta$, i.e., the points added in the preceding steps. And the construction is done in such way that no new point on $l_\alpha$ can be added in the steps after $\alpha$.) 

Perhaps it is worth mentioning that several important journals have been digitized by GDZ. It is one of reasonable places where to look for older papers. (If you can't find it through the subscription of your institution.) Here is list of mathematical journals available at GDZ. In fact, Google Scholar search finds several versions of the paper mentioned in the question. One of them is eudml link which links further to GDZ. Several other reasonable possibilities are mentioned in the answers to this question: Finding a paper. 

I tried to search for renault ideal "generalized limit" to see whether I will find some related works where the definition of this notion is included. 

Let me quote relevant parts from Blass, Andreas (2010), "Ultrafilters and set theory", Ultrafilters across mathematics, Contemporary Mathematics, 530, Providence, RI: American Mathematical Society, pp. 49–71, doi: 10.1090/conm/530/10440 (From the beginning of section 6. Ultrafilters, Descriptive Set Theory, and Determinacy, page 64.) This paper is also mentioned as a reference in the current revision of the Wikipedia article Property of Baire, where the fact that ultrafilters do not have Baire property is also mentioned. 

This is a very common theme in enumerative combinatorics. You can find a lot of examples with the Google search "no bijective proof" (with quotes). First, I can say something about why you might care about bijective proofs. Combinatorial species are certainly a nice theory, but they are a fairly specific and elaborate answer related to generating functions. A more general reason is that a bijective proof categorifies an equality in combinatorics to the category of sets. In other words, it promotes an equality $|A| = |B|$ to an isomorphism $A \cong B$. In my opinion, it is just as important to find any other categorification, for instance to the category of vector spaces. Instead of showing that two sets are the same size with a bijection, you would show that they are the same size using an invertible matrix. Second, of the many examples, I can name one that I encountered. This example is interesting because the objects in question seem very similar. Recall that an alternating sign matrix is a matrix whose non-zero entries in each row and column alternate between $1$ and $-1$, and such that the first and last non-zero entry in each row and column is $1$. One interesting subclass is the ASMs of order $2n+1$ which are symmetric about a vertical line. Another interesting subclass is the ASMs of order $2n$ which are diagonally symmetric and have 0s on the diagonal. (ASMs of either type of the opposite parity do not exist.) The first class was discovered by David Robbins and I found the second class. I proved David's product formula for the first class and I established the same product formula for the second class. So these two classes of ASMs are equinumerous, but no bijective proof is known. 

We should distinguish between thinking locally and thinking globally. Locally, any differential $k$-form is built out of wedging together $1$ forms and taking linear cmobinations. Globally, a closed $k$-form need not be a wedge of closed $1$-forms. So the statement that everything is built out of $1$-forms is only a local statement, whereas cohomology is precisely about the difference between the local and the global. (Indeed, cohomology measures the extent to which a locally exact $k$-form need not be exact.) For this reason, I don't like your statement that the de-Rham complex is all built from $1$-forms. I want to say that there should be a similar story in singular cohomology: that any closed $k$-co-chain should be locally a wedge of closed-$1$-co-chains. The picture I want to give is that any $k$-simplex "is" the wedge of the $k$ edges coming out of a single vertex, and so singular cohomology is locally built from $1$ dimensional objects to the same extent that deRham cohomology is. But I am hazy as to how to make this precise. 

One more comment on this frequently answered question: Let $a_0 x^{2n} + a_1 x^{2n-1} + \cdots + a_{n} x^{n} + \cdots a_1 x + a_0$ be a palindromic polynomial with real coefficients and $2k$ isolated roots on the unit circle. Then any sufficiently small perturbation of this polynomial to another real palindromic polynomial also has $2k$ roots on the unit circle. Proof: Notice that $e^{\pm i \theta}$ is a root of this polynomial if and only if $a_0 \cos (n \theta) + a_1 \cos ((n-1) \theta) + \cdots + a_{n/2-1} \cos \theta + a_0/2=0$. Write $f(\theta)$ for the right hand side of this equation. Our hypothesis is that $f$ has $k$ isolated roots, $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, ..., $\theta_k$. Then we can find $\epsilon>0$ and disjoint intervals $(a_i, b_i)$ around each $\theta_i$ such that (1) We have $f((a_i, b_i)) \supseteq (-\epsilon, \epsilon)$. (2) On $(a_i, b_i)$, we have $|f'|<\epsilon$ (3) Off of the $(a_i, b_i)$, we have $|f|>\epsilon/2$. Then, if our perturbation is small enough that $f$ and $f'$ change by less than $\epsilon/4$ everywhere, then the perturbed $f$ still has one root in each $(a_i, b_i)$, and no roots elsewhere. QED Why do I point this out? Take any of the above examples and perturb its coefficients slightly, while keeping them rational and palindromic. Then you get another example! This observation destroys most attempts to classify such polynomials by number theoretic criteria. 

Here another way to state the proposal without any direct use of center of mass, although it is still suggested by the fact that the set of centers of mass is compact. For any $0 \le p \le 1$, there is a binary operation $x \heartsuit_p y$ on points in $X$. By defintion, $x \heartsuit_p y$ is the point $z$ such that $d(x,z) = pd(x,y)$ and $d(y,z) = (1-p)d(x,y)$. Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ be a list of points in $K$, possibly with repetitions. Then every word $w$ in the points of $K$ written in this notation defines a point $z \in X$. We can also compute the same word in the vertices of a Euclidean simplex $\Delta_{n-1}$. We thus obtain a continuous map $f_T:\Delta_{n-1} \to X$ that only depends on the tree structure $T$ of $w$. How far away are these maps from each other for two different trees? (There are $(2n-3)!!$ distinct trees.) If you have enough control over the distance, then the closed convex hull of $K$ is compact. More precisely, the hope is to find a compactification of the space of words such that the evaluation map extends continuously. For example, if $n=3$, we can define three tree centers of three points $x,y,z$, namely $x \heartsuit_{1/3} (y \heartsuit_{1/2} z)$ and its cyclic permutations. How far apart can they be in a $\text{CAT}(0)$ space? For instance, in a tree, which is one kind of opposite to a Euclidean space, the tree centers of a unit equilateral triangle are at most 1/3 away from each other. 

The importance of the Laplacian is a reflection of the importance of Riemannian geometry, both for its own sake and in these other fields. (Obviously, absent a generalization, you can't have a Laplacian without a Riemannian metric.) In Riemannian geometry, the Laplacian is the first scalar linear differential operator available which is "covariant", i.e., that depends only on the Riemannian structure and not on extra choices such as coordinates. It's natural for the first non-trivial possible structure of a given type to be fundamental. One reason is that it can be an approximation to something else with higher-order terms. For example, in the wave equation, if it is meant as a realistic model of sound waves, actually there are all kinds of higher order, non-linear effects; but one begins with the Laplace operator as the correct approximation for small waves. It has to be correct because it's the only one available. The same thing happens with heat and the heat equation. Actually, something interesting happens if you relax the use of the word "scalar". If you have a spin manifold, then there is a Dirac operator, which is a Laplacian-like operator that is just as important. But even apart from that construction, there are various other operators, such as the Hodge Laplacian, that act on vector and tensor fields rather than on scalar functions. These are not exactly the same as the original Laplacian, but they tend to get the same name.
