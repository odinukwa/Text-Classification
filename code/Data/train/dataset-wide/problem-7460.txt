Intuitively, it seems that every time you should pick a subset of bins and add balls to it $k$ times in a row. This would give a bound of $\approx\Omega(k\log_{1/x} n)$ iterations. Is it possible to make more iterations? How can we prove that this is optimal? 

For example, if $A= \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0.3 & 0.6 \\ 0.4 & 0.2 \\ \end{array} \right) $ Then $z=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0.8 \\ 0.2 \\ \end{array} \right)$ , $x=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{array} \right)$ , $y=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0 \\ 1 \\ \end{array} \right)$ Satisfy the conditions and $$x^tAy+x^tA^ty = 0.6 + 0.4 > 0.36 + 0.36 = z^tAz\ + z^tA^tz$$ 

Notice that if condition (4) isn't true, then the claim doesn't hold, e.g.: $A= \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ \end{array} \right) $ And $z=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{array} \right)$ , $x=y=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0.5 \\ 0.5 \\ \end{array} \right)$ 

Is there a closed-form formula for the distribution of $Y_N$ and $M_N$? If not, what is $E(Y_N)$ and $E(M_N)$? If the answer in (1) is negative, how fast can we compute $\Pr(Y_N = y)$? 

I like the proof in: Schwarz, Gerald W., The topology of algebraic quotients. Topological methods in algebraic transformation groups (New Brunswick, NJ, 1988), 135–151, Progr. Math., 80, Birkhäuser Boston, Boston, MA, 1989. Summary: Suppose $Gv$ is not closed, then there is a 1-parameter subgroup $\lambda:\mathbb{C}^*\to G$ such that $\lim_{z\to 0} \lambda(z)v\notin Gv$. Then $||\lambda(e^s)v||^2=\sum e^{2n_js}|v_j|^2$ and since $\lim_{s\to -\infty}\lambda(e^s)v$ exists we must have $n_j\geq 0$ for all $j$, with at least one strict inequality since the limit is not in $Gv$. Therefore $\frac{d}{ds}||\lambda(e^s)v||^2\not=0$ at $s=0$, and so $p_v$ is not critical at $g=e$. Here is one possible way to understand the parts of Nakajima's proof that you highlight: 

Let $V$ be an algebraic variety. If there is a finite ascending chain of Zariski closed sets $\emptyset=V_0\subset V_1\subset \cdots \subset V_n=V$ such that $V_i-V_{i-1}$ is a fintie disjoint union of copies of affine space $\mathbb{A}^i$ we say $V$ is affine paved (so $V$ is "algebraically cellular"). Note: there are non-equivalent variations of this definition (see here). One can deduce that an affine paved variety (over $\mathbb{C}$) has no odd cohomology and its even cohomology is free abelian. Examples: 

I understand that in your solution you use an approach by considering martingales $X_n$ and ${X^2}_n - n$ and applying optimal stopping theorem. To calculate the mgf, you need to use a discrete analog of an exponential martingale. As in here $URL$ page 476. 

$URL$ (page 13) In the above paper by Danny Calegari he says that the result $\text{scl}(g) \geq 1/2$ (i.e. a stable commutator length $\text{scl}(g) := \displaystyle{\lim_n}\ cl(g^n) / n$, where $\text{cl}(g)$ is the smallest $k$ such that $g$ is a product of $k$ commutators) follows (apart from the Howie-Duncan result) from the paper by Comerford-Edmunds. "Products of commutators and products of squares in a free group" by Leo P. Comerford , Jr. , Charles C. Edmunds, 1994. Although I am familiar with that paper, I do not immediately see how that result follows from the description of solutions of quadratic equations described in Comerford&Edmunds. Here is a reference to the paper: $URL$ Could anyone clarify the link between the two results? thanks! 

I am not sure exactly what this question means, but it sounds like you are asking for examples of families of irreducible algebraic sets. If that is your question, then $\mathrm{SL}_n$ is an irreducible affine algebraic group since the determinant is an irreducible polynomial. More generally, any connected affine algebraic group $G$ is irreducible. You can find many examples of "arbitrary dimension" there. Although looking at examples is generally a good practice, irreducible algebraic sets are fairly common place, and so might be too large of a class to examine for your particular problem. Maybe a better question would be: What general methods exist to determine if an algebraic set is irreducible? For example, over $\mathbb{C}$ an affine algebraic set is irreducible if and only if it contains a dense open path-connected subset of smooth points (in the strong topology). 

This is covered in Chapter 2, Section 9 (starting on page 52) in Weyl's The Classical Groups, Their Invariants and Representations. As already answered, there you will find: Theorem (Theorem 2.9.A) Every orthogonal invariant in vectors $x^1,...,x^m$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is expressible in terms of the $m^2$ scalar products $(x^i,x^j)$. 

Hello, Does anyone know if there is a result that relates a quantity such as an average degree to the fact the a (simple and connected graph) has no cut vertices? e.g. if a graph has a Hamiltoninan cycle then it has not cut vertex. By Ore's theorem, if deg(v) >= n/2 for each vertex v (n is the number of vertices of a graph), then the graph is Hamiltoninan. Hence deg(v) >= n/2 implies no cut vertices (non-separable). I am looking for a result similar to Ore's theorem, but w.r.t. non-separability e.g. something like if the deg(v) >= f(n) for each v (or some statement about the average degree), then the number of cut vertices is zero. Thank you. 

Let $F$ be a free group of finite rank, and $p, b \in F$, where $b$ is a root element (i.e. not a proper power). I have a case where $p^{n_k} = V_{n_k}^{-1}b^{-1} V_{n_k} \cdot U_{n_k}^{-1}b U_{n_k}$, for some $n_k \in \mathbb{Z}$ ...i.e. some powers of $p$ are products of two conjugates of $b$ and $b^{-1}$. What can be said about $p$ and $b$ ? Some immediate implications: By Karras-Magnus-Solitair, since $b$ is root, one-relator group $ < F \ | \ b >$ is torsion-free, so if a proper power of $p$ is in $ncl(b)$ then $p\in ncl(b)$. Also, by going to an abelianization of $F$, it is clear that $p\in \[ F, F \]$. I was hoping that $p$ is conjugate to $b$...by Magnus, if we can show that $b$ is also in the the normal closure of $p$ then that would be the case. I also have a somewhat related general question. Say, if we have $b$ as normal root of $p$ i.e. $p \in ncl(b)$, so that $p = \displaystyle{\prod_{i=1}^{n}} T_i^{-1} b^{\epsilon _i} T_i$, where $\epsilon _i = \pm 1$. Clearly the above product is not unique. Is there a notion of associating to $p$ a minimal integer $n_p \geq 1$ so that $p$ can be decomposed to the product $p = \displaystyle{\prod_{i=1}^{n_p}} T_i^{-1} b^{\epsilon _i} T_i$? For example if $n_p=1$ then $p$ and $b$ are conjugate. Apologies if I missed something obvious or the question(s) doesn't make sense. Thanks!

In case it is useful to the OP, here is a reference: Richardson, R. A rigidity theorem for subalgebras of Lie and associative algebras. Illinois J. Math. 11 1967 92–110. Proposition 12.1 seems to be the relevant result. 

With Example 1 in mind, in general, I intuitively think of the trace as a measure of length. As it is the derivative of the determinant, whose absolute value measures volume, this is not unreasonable for geometric intuition (sum versus a product in the spectra). In particular, $|\mathrm{tr}(X-Y)|$ reminds one of the taxi cab metric in the spectra of $X,Y$. With Example 3 in mind, one gets mileage from thinking of "words" as homotopy classes in a manifold and evaluating those words at representations and taking the trace as computing the length of a geodesic representative of the homotopy class. Again, this is more of "geometric intuition" than precise formulation, but there are examples where this is more precise.
