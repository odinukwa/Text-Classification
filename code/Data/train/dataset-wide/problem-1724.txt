An exact answer would require a rather specific and mathematical formulation of the multiverse in consideration. As a simple approximating example, suppose we have a countably infinite number of (observable) universes of the same mass $M$. Suppose the dimension of the full multiverse is one higher than each individual universe, and suppose the universes are all separated by the same minimum distance $\epsilon>0$ from each other. In a 2-D picture, this would just look like a bunch of parallel lines all separated by the same distance. Pick your home universe and put an observer. Another universe of distance $n\epsilon$ away (meaning they're $n$ universes up or down from you in the 2-D picture) exerts a gravitational force on the observer in its direction approximately proportional to $\displaystyle{\frac{M}{n^2\epsilon^2}}.$ With the right units, we can just say "approximately". The maximum gravitational force occurs when the observer is at the bottom (or top) of the picture, and all over universes are above it (or below): universes on each side will pull in opposing directions and so lead to cancellations. So the net gravitational force from the other universes (in the right units) is at most $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{M}{n^2\epsilon^2} = \frac{M}{\epsilon^2}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2 M}{6\epsilon^2}<\infty.$$ If the observer was "in the middle"—infinitely many universes above and below, with the distribution identical in either direction— the net gravitational force from the other universes is exactly 0. 

So in all of the three listed models, as well as the snow line inferred from asteroid properties, it seems that the 3.5 AU starting distance for Jupiter in the Grand Tack hypothesis remains comfortably behind the snow line (for water, at least, which is still an advantage over the inner planets). Since it ultimately fell well within the snow line for a time, one would expect any exposed ices to rapidly sublimate. I would guess that it made up for this by accreting the rockier planetesimals found in the inner parts of the Solar System, which could then shield the remaining ices. 

In addition to Mark's answer, we also have reasons to expect a spherical distribution. The following makes some assumptions on how our solar system formed. They are standard, but we are not completely certain on its correctness. What I use is usually considered noncontroversial--it's how the planets themselves arose that is most problematic, but is not needed here. Early in the formation of the solar system the gas and dust would have had a fairly uniform and spherical distribution. It is unlikely that the cloud would have exactly 0 net angular momentum, meaning it would have net angular momentum in some direction. Now the gas that is sufficiently close to the sun will be dense enough that the particles will be interacting and colliding regularly. This causes the angular momentum of the particles to align in the direction of the original net angular momentum. This is due to the conservation of angular momentum. This process creates the dominant protoplanetary disc you are familiar with, leaving a thin layer of low density gas and dust in the same sphere. Low density particle distributions will be essentially collisionless. They will therefore not align themselves into a disc, whether they have a net angular momentum or not. Each particle orbits on whatever plane it just happens to be aligned on. Now to the Oort cloud... Get far enough from the center of the formation of our sun and the gas becomes less dense. As such the gas becomes mostly collisionless, and preferential alignment on a disc becomes less likely. Stay just close enough and sufficient interactions and random inhomogeneities arise for planetesimals to build up, each one aligned essentially independently of the others. They remain sparsely distributed and collisionless as a whole (basically the particles just got bigger), and so do not align. The models you see with a doughnut-like region are ones that are expecting a region where the dust and gas was still interacting enough with itself, and the rest of the solar system as we know it, to still (partially) fall into the preferred alignment. 

So as long as we have measurements of the quantities on the right-hand side, we can just plug them in to get a value for the rate of change in the period. The hardest to measure is usually the moment of inertia (where the mass, $M$, and radius, $R$, terms come from). These are easier to get from eclipsing binary systems, since then there are nice relations between their orbital paths and masses. 

For exoplanets with significant atmospheres, we can only expect to see the spectra for its upper atmosphere. All other signals will be muted out by the rest of the atmosphere. We will not be able to tell what the surface looks like, or what it is made of. 

The ones in the halo have blue colors, which is the "old" part of the spectrum. Each type of metallicity is usually measured using a form of logarithmic scale, since the flat percentage of metals (especially iron peak elements) of any star will be very small. In this case, we have $$[Fe/H] = \log(N_{\text{Fe}}/N_H)_{\text{star}} - \log(N_{\text{Fe}}/N_H)_{\text{sun}},$$ So we take the ratio of iron to hydrogen in the target star, measure it as well in our own sun, then take the ratio of those two and take the logarithm of that value. Since the $\log$ function is monotonic and has $\log(1)=0$, a negative value of $[Fe/H]$ means our Sun has more iron in it (relative to the amount of hydrogen). A value of $[Fe/H]=-1$ means our sun has an iron to hydrogen ratio that is 10 times greater than the given star's, for example. The more negative this value, the more metal-poor the star is (or, at least, iron poor) than our own sun, which is considered of a fairly recent generation. Lower metallicities are typical of earlier generations of stars, and so may be described as "old". Note, however, that they need not necessarily be old stars. In principle it is possible for a recently formed star to have formed in an unusually metal-poor region, or otherwise been unable to accrete the normal quantity of metals. 

Gravity travels at light speed (or less, possibly), so even in an infinite non-expanding universe of finite age you'd only be gravitationally interacting with a finite mass in a finite volume. Our universe is observed to be expanding, further inhibiting us from coming into contact with new objects. Furthermore, a common assumption of cosmological models is that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. Meaning it is pretty much identical in all directions. Observations support this assumption. One net effect of this is that the gravitational potential energy you experience from objects outside (roughly) your supercluster is zero (and really close to it from things outside your own galaxy, actually). They just balance each other out. 

This is known as spectroscopy. Every molecule and atom in the universe emits and absorbs light at specific frequencies. This is a result of the quantization of the energy levels (for electrons) in an atom. Although there are lots of complicating factors, such as redshift, to account for, the patterns are usually so distinctive that the complications can be accounted for, and do not prevent scientists from figuring out chemical compositions (and even, to some extent, how abundant each chemical is). For example, here are the emission spectra of several common atoms at rest (with respect to the observer): 

Absorption spectra, on the other hand, appear as darker regions in the band. Here's an example of an absorption spectra, which identities several elements by knowing that it is distinguished by absorbing light at specific wavelengths that others do not: 

The moon's "atmosphere" isn't much of an atmosphere, and is sometimes called an exosphere. The particle density in the moon's atmosphere is low enough to be considered a very good vacuum for Earth experiments. The discovery is mentioned in this article on phys.org, which specifically says 

Definitely too small to measure. The expansion isn't even enough to measurably impact galaxy superclusters. What you are otherwise thinking of is known as the Big Rip. This is not guaranteed to happen, though. It depends on a constant describing the density of dark energy over time, usually denoted $w$. When $w<-1$ the Big Rip occurs in finite time, separating all parts of a structure in the sense that lightspeed signals can no longer be transmitted between the parts. This includes hadrons like protons, so in the very last moments the quarks will no longer be able to communicate and will thus cease to be bound together. Disclaimer: That ignores quantum gravity and QCD in highly curved spacetime. We can barely manage QCD in the flat case, and quantum gravity has been a holy grail for decades. Since a definitive answer to your question requires both of these things, the only definitive answer is "nobody knows for sure". When $w=-1$ we have constant density and structures smaller than galaxies survive. Our solar system, assuming it survives a very long time, will remain bound together. Star clusters will remain together. Note, however, that we would still, technically, be able to see everything we could see before. Telescopes can already see galaxies which are currently receding at superluminal speeds. We just see those last moments before such speeds were hit get smeared over ever longer time frames, and heavily redshifted. But we will never receive new signals from the moment it hit superluminal speeds. Only ever the faint remnants of those last moments. The redshifts will eventually be so extreme that everything at galactic distances and beyond becomes effectively impossible to detect these remnants from. At which point it's just you and your closest neighbors. Current observations put $w$ close to -1, but we cannot currently distinguish between $w<-1$, $w=-1$, and $w>-1$ 

This is just an amusing addition to the existing answer. It turns out that a metallic hydrogen layer (which lets electrons move freely, and moving electrons means a magnetic field can form) is not enough to account for the size of Jupiter's magnetosphere. It's off by a factor of approximately 2. The rest of it is mostly thanks to Io. The wiki page will give a more complete description (of a rather complex system) and references, but here's the short of the matter. Io is on an eccentric orbit, thanks to a resonance with the other Galilean moons. This gives it significant tidal heating (and as it is the closest of the Galilean moons, it has the most significant heating effect of them all). This gives it volcanic activity, which puts new gaseous materials (sulfur, oxygen, and chlorine mostly) into its atmosphere. Jupiter strips material from Io's upper atmosphere at about 1 metric ton per second. This material ultimately forms ionized bands that generate substantial electric current, and significantly increases the magnetosphere around Jupiter as a result. 

Under the assumption that there is some sort of "Big Bang" scenario, then we are assuming an expanding universe. General relativity does not require the conservation of mass-energy on a universal scale in a changing spacetime (arguably, GR doesn't even have a concept of energy on a universal scale), so there is no a priori reason why this black-hole-universe cannot be comparable to our own (in whatever senses we pick). A simple way to see why energy conservation must be violated, even in a vaccuum, is to first observe that the vacuum energy density is fixed. So if spacetime is expanding (or contracting), then we are changing the total volume without changing this vacuum energy density. Keeping the density the same but increasing the volume means more total energy; decreasing the volume with the same density means less total energy. We can also easily observe this violation. You may be familiar with the concept of redshift: light coming to you from a source that is moving away from you (or emitted from a gravitating source) is shifted towards the red side of the spectrum. This stretches out the wavelength, so the light has less energy. The energy doesn't go anywhere, it's just gone.${}^*$ We might also note that, with Noether's theorem in hand, we know that time translation invariance implies conservation of energy. But a non-static spacetime is inherently not time translation invariant, so conservation of energy is not required. ${}^*$ Well, some may try to regain conservation of energy by asserting that there is an energy of the gravitational field to consider. This isn't adopted by everyone, but it can be done if you're careful with your definitions. It just doesn't work as generally and easily as you might naively hope for. 

The CMB lets us measure how close to flat the universe is right now. On the other hand, inflation tries to explain how we got from whatever the early universe was to right now. The motivation for the latter being that even extremely small deviations from perfect flatness in the early universe should have resulted in very obvious deviations from flatness today. That we don't see obvious deviations then suggests the universe was amazingly close to perfectly flat early on, and such perfect tuning seems bizarre. Inflation basically lets a (in some sense "very") non-flat early universe get flattened to this precision, thereby resolving the "problem" of having an almost perfectly flat early universe. It takes the situation from an extremely narrow range of initial conditions for the flatness of the universe and gives us a broad range of equally valid possibilities, instead. Inflation is also commonly used to explain the remarkable homogeneity of the CMB, which suggests that parts of the universe that cannot ever have received light speed signals from each nevertheless achieved thermal equilibrium (an at-most light speed process). Inflation throws in a super-luminal expansion to allow these regions to be within light speed communications of each other in the very early universe, with just enough time to achieve thermal equilibrium, and then inflates them beyond light speed communication.
