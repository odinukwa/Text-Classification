Let $\{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_r\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ be a finite subset of lattice points and let $\Phi: (\mathbb{C}^*)^n \to \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r$ be the corresponding map from the algebraic torus to the projective space defined by: $$\Phi(x) = (x^{\alpha_0}: \cdots : x^{\alpha_r}).$$ Here $x^\alpha$ is short for $x_1^{a_1} \cdots x_n^{a_n}$, $\alpha = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$. For simplicity let us assume that $\Phi$ is an embedding. Consider the standard Fubini-Study metric on $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r$ and equip the torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ with the pull-back metric which we call $g$. It is clearly a metric invariant by the action of the compact subgroup $(S^1)^n$. Let us decompose $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ as $\mathbb{R}^n \times (S^1)^n$ by $(r, \theta) \mapsto e^{r+i\theta}$. Then we can consider $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a subset of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$. My question is if one can describe the geodesics of $g$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$? Is it true that the geodesics are straight lines? 

Consider the complex algebraic torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ where $\mathbb{C}^*$ stands for $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$. Fix a finite set of lattice points $A = \{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_r\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ and define the map $$\phi_A: (\mathbb{C}^*)^n \to \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r,$$ by $x \mapsto (x^{\alpha_0}:\cdots:x^{\alpha_r})$. Let us assume that $\phi_A$ is an embedding and equip the torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ with the Kahler form $\omega_A = \phi_A^*(\omega_{FS})$ which is the pull-back, via $\phi_A$, of the standard Kahler form (the Fubini-Study form) on the projective space $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r$. We regard $((\mathbb{C}^*)^n, \omega_A)$ as a symplectic manifold. The compact torus $(S^1)^n$ acts on $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ in a Hamiltonian fashion and the image of its moment map is the interior of the convex hull of the finite set $A$. Two important notions of capacity for a symplectic manifold are the Gromov width and the Hofer-Zehnder capacity. One can give estimates for the Gromov width of $((\mathbb{C}^*)^n, \omega_A)$ in terms of the moment polytope, i.e. the convex hull of $A$. My question is: are there any estimates known for the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of $((\mathbb{C}^*)^n, \omega_A)$ in terms of the finite set $A$ or its convex hull? Any statement in this regard would be interesting. 

Freyd and Scedrov, in their book Categories, Allegories, use for this 'directed equality' a peculiar symbol that they call a Venturi tube and that looks a bit like $\mathrel{>=}$, so that $x \mathrel{>=} y$ means if $x$ is defined then so is $y$ and $x=y$. You can find some discussion at the nLab page on Kleene equality (the symmetric version of this) and in this nForum thread. 

Realizability: An Introduction To Its Categorical Side by Jaap van Oosten is all about realizability toposes. There are some lecture notes online by Wesley Phoa entitled An introduction to fibrations, topos theory, the effective topos and modest sets, which do exactly what it says on the tin. There is also some good material in Freyd and Scedrov's book Categories, Allegories. 

Adjunctions 'up to adjointness' have been considered before. Marta Bunge (Coherent extensions and relational algebras, Trans. AMS 197, 1974) called them 'lax adjunctions', John Gray (Formal category theory: Adjointness for 2-categories, LNM 391, 1974) called them 'quasi-adjunctions' (of some sort) and Barry Jay (Local adjunctions, JPAA 53, 1988) called them 'local adjunctions'. The formulations differ somewhat, but what they have in common is a family of adjunctions $$ D(F A, X) \leftrightarrows C(A, G X) $$ between hom categories. Another way to generalize, of course, is to turn the triangle equalities into coherent modifications (3-cells), and these two should be Yonedily equivalent. Often the functors F and G here are allowed to be lax, which complicates things because they can't in general be whiskered onto lax transformations. The unit and counit are often only lax too. There is a Yoneda lemma for lax transformations, written down here (by me, so any mistakes are my fault), but I for one haven't yet managed to massage it into a form that would be useful for these local/lax adjunctions. 

Hi, Can one define a Fubini-Study metric/Kaehler metric on the projective space of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, i.e. using the formula $\partial \bar{\partial} \log |Z|^2$? This should be very well-known to the experts. Anyhow I don't have much experience with infinite dimension and worried that something may go wrong. I appreciate any comments or references. 

Let $G$ be a connected reductive group acting on a projective variety $X$. Let $L$ be a $G$-linearized (very) ample line bundle on $X$, and let $R$ be the ring of sections (or homogeneous coordinate ring of $(X, L)$). Let $R_k = H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$ denote the $k$-th graded piece of $R$, and $R_{k, \lambda}$ its $\lambda$ isotypic component where $\lambda$ is a dominant weight. Consider the GIT quotient $X //_\lambda G$ i.e. $Proj(\bigoplus_k R_{k, k\lambda})$. Then one can define the volume of this GIT quotient $f(\lambda) = vol(X //_\lambda G)$ say as the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial of the graded algebra $\bigoplus_k R_{k, k\lambda}$ times $d!$ where $d = dim(X //_\lambda G)$. By homogeneity one can extend f to rational values of $\lambda$. (When $X$ is smooth $f$ is just the Duistermaat-Heckman function in symplectic geometry on the moment/Kirwan polytope.) Question: Under what conditions is f continuous at 0, i.e. as \lambda approaches $0$, $f(\lambda)$ approaches $f(0)$ (we consider $f$ as a function on the moment polytope and we assume that $0$ in on the boundary of the moment polytope)? Little bit weaker questions is: when can we find a sequence of regular dominant $\lambda_i$ approaching $0$ such that $f(\lambda_i)$ approaches $f(0)$? Clearly a sufficient condition for continuity of $f$ is that $X$ is smooth and $0$ is a regular value of the moment map. For example, is $f$ continuous under the assumption that generic orbits of the action of $G$ on $Spec(R)$ (cone over $X$) are closed? 

Here is a class of examples different to Tom's: if your underlying monoidal category C is closed, then a strong monad on C is the same as a C-enriched monad, i.e. one that respects the enrichment of C given by its internal hom (this is why every monad on Set is strong, as Andrej points out). So one example would be the monad on Cat (considered as a Set-category) whose algebras are cartesian closed categories -- it is known that this is not a Cat-monad (although it does extend to Cat as a groupoid-enriched category). I would imagine that the same is true for the monad for monoidal closed categories, or in general for categories with any one sort of mixed-variance structure. 

A flat internal presheaf/discrete fibration $F \to C$ is simply one whose total category F is filtered in the internal sense (see Topos Theory 2.51 (filteredness), 4.31 (flatness); Elephant B.2.6.2, B.3.2.3). The definition just reexpresses filteredness by requiring that certain maps (e.g. $F_0 \to 1$) are regular epis (presumably you can replace these with covers for your favourite Grothendieck topology). I think that if C = BG is a group then these are exactly the G-torsors in E. I'm not sure whether this extends to flat = locally representable for C a general internal category, though. 

I was wondering what are some standard general references/books/survey articles about: (1) crystal bases, and string parameterizations and (2) Demazure modules, and Schubert varieties (containing basic definitions and proofs of most of the basic statements). I need to cite some general references on these subjects in a paper of mine. 

Let $X$ be a set with a collection of subsets $\mathcal{A}$. A finitely additive measure on $(X, \mathcal{A})$ is a function $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ such that for any two subsets $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$ we have $\mu(A \cup B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B) - \mu(A \cap B)$. Now consider the set $\mathcal{L}$ of all linear subspaces of a given finite dimensional vector space $V$. The dimension of subspaces satisfies an equality similar to a finitely additive measure. That is, for any two subspaces $W, U \in \mathcal{L}$ we have $\dim(U+W) = \dim(U) + \dim(W) - \dim(U \cap W)$. My question: Is there a generalized notion of measure which includes dimension of vector spaces (and one can define analogues of integration for it)? For example is there a generalized notion of a measure on a lattice (where intersection and union are replaced with meet and join)? Thanks 

First, a disclaimer: I am not even close to being an analyst. Second, I don't know of any applications of category theory to the areas of analysis that you mention. I don't think we have got to that point yet, for the reason given below. But here is an answer to a more general question that I hope you'll find illuminating. I think the thing to remember here is that category theory is 'structural mathematics'. That is, it seeks to understand mathematical objects and constructions purely in terms of abstract external structure, as opposed to internal details about how an object is put together. In areas like algebra and computer science, this sort of structure is already there and visible, so for example it's easy to define the notion of 'group object' or 'monoid action', and to discuss constructions like quotients and semidirect products and so on in purely structural terms. My impression of analysis is that the structures involved are less unequivocal and less clearly visible, and consequently it's harder to give a broad unified structural picture of the kind that we're used to in algebra. So the category-theoretic or structural understanding of analysis is a good deal less well-developed. But there are some interesting facts about certain structures found in (very elementary) analysis and topology: 

Let $X_\sigma$ be an affine toric variety for an action of a torus $T$ and let $\mathcal{P}$ be a toric principal $G$-bundle over $X_\sigma$ where $G$ is an affine algebraic group (here base field $k$ is algebraically closed and characteristic $0$, in fact I am content with $k = \mathbb{C}$). By a toric principal $G$-bundle $\mathcal{P}$ we mean $T$ acts on $\mathcal{P}$ lifting its action on $X_\sigma$ and the $T$-action and $G$-action on $\mathcal{P}$ commute. My question is wether $\mathcal{P}$ is $T$-equivariantly trivial. By this, we mean the following: there exists a homomorphism $\phi: T \to G$ such that $\mathcal{P}$ is $T$-equivariantly isomorphic to $X_\sigma \times G$ where $T$ acts on this product diagonally by acting on $G$ via $\phi$ and left multiplication, that is, $t \cdot (x, g) = (t \cdot x, \phi(x)g)$. It is well-known and not difficult to show that this is true when $G = GL(n)$ (that is, one has a toric vector bundle). As far as I know by a result of Biswas-Dey-Poddar (2015) which itself relies on an earlier result of Heinzner-Kutzschebauch (1995), this is true for when $X_\sigma$ is complex affine space. I was wondering if this is known for other affine toric varieties. 

Your suspicion is correct: in general, a V-category has all weighted V-limits if it has all conical V-limits and is cotensored over V (see Kelly's Basic Concepts of Enriched Category Theory, section 3.10). For V = Cat (and this is true for bicategories too), cotensors can be constructed from conical limits and cotensors with the arrow category 2, although I don't know the original reference for that. 'Finite' limits are a bit more complicated in the enriched case, but see Street's 'Limits indexed by category-valued 2-functors', JPAA 1972, for the 2-case. 

Kepler by John Banville is a sort of 'fictional biography'. Banville is a Booker prize winner, very highly regarded. His prose is some of the most beautiful, dense and lyrical I've ever read, and I'd recommend Kepler to anyone with an interest in mathematics and a taste for masterful writing. (Banville also wrote Doctor Copernicus, which I haven't read.) 

This is exactly the notion of a closed category. See Eilenberg and Kelly's article in the 1965 La Jolla proceedings (Springer 1966). I think they also describe categories enriched in a closed category. 

Let $\Delta$ be a convex body (i.e. a compact convex subset) or a convex polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $x$ be a point inside $\Delta$ and consider a (uniform) random walk starting at $x$ inside $\Delta$. I am interested in the probability distribution of the first time the random walk hits a point in boundary $\partial \Delta$. We consider a uniform random walk were $x$ with equal probability can go to any point in a small neighborhood of radius $\delta$ of $x$. We are interested in the probability distribution (on the boundary) that the random walk hits a boundary point. Is there a "nice" formula for this distribution on the boundary points (in terms of $x$ and $\Delta$)? If $\Delta$ is a polytope one expects that this distribution should be related to the distance of $x$ to different facets of $\Delta$. In general are there nice formula relating geometry of $\Delta$ and relative position of $x$ in $\Delta$ to probability distributions (associated to random walks)? I am from algebraic geometry and don't know much about random walks. I thought this problem might be known to the experts. 

According to the Elephant, and these notes, an object X in a category C is indecomposable if given an isomorphism $X \cong \coprod_i U_i$ there is a unique $i$ such that $X \cong U_i$ and $U_j \cong 0$ for $j\neq i$ where 0 is the initial object. If C is extensive, then X is indecomposable iff it is connected (proof and details here). Lambek and Scott give a different definition: they say that X is indecomposable if given an epi $[k,l] \colon U + V \twoheadrightarrow X$, one of k or l is epi. I suppose this can be generalised to say that X is indecomposable if any jointly epic family into X contains at least one epi. Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, but I can't see that either definition implies the other. So my question is 

A monoidal functor preserves the unit and tensor only 'laxly', so that $1_X$ is not the local unit but comes with a 2-cell $I \Rightarrow 1_X$. If you're talking about strong monoidal functors then enriching over SymMonCat will by definition imply that identities are (isomorphic to) local units. I don't know what you're trying to do exactly, but it seems it's just a matter of picking the right kind of functor, and thus the right category to enrich over. 

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $k$. I was wondering if there is a standard terminology for a function $v: V \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$ which is invariant under multiplication by nonzero scalars and satisfies non-Archimedean inequality $v(x+y) \geq \min\{v(x), v(y)\}$? In the paper "Newton-Okounkov bodies, semigroups of intergral points, graded algebras and intersection theory", the authors call such a function a "pre-valuation", I was wondering if this concept has been introduced before and if there are other terms used for it. Of course, this is related to the notion of ultra-metric. Thanks 

Hi, Let $I$ be an ideal in a polynomial ring $S = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Fix a term order on $S$ (e.g. a lexicographic order) and let $in(I)$ denote the initial ideal of $I$, that is, the monomial ideal generated by all the initial terms of elements of $I$. It is clear that for any $k > 0$ one has $in(I)^k \subset in(I^k)$, with equality if $I$ itself is a monomial ideal.
