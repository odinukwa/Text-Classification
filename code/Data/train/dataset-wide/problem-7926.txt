some inequalities relating the two ideas are given as well as a few reasonably strong results. If the Sylow 2-subgroups are dihedral or large enough semi-dihedral, then a quaternionic representation exists iff a non-strongly real but real element of odd order exists (theorems are spread out in the paper). In the case of a 2-nilpotent group (the last section) more precise relationships are given, with the number of quaternionic reps being a mixture of the number of strongly and weakly real elements. Beware of wanting to generalize the real case too broadly. An F-rational character is a C-irreducible character whose values are in F. An F-rational element is an element conjugate to the correct powers given the (cyclotomic) Galois group of C/F. In p-groups for odd p, the F-rational classes are 1–1 with F-rational characters, but not in general for 2-groups or groups of odd order. 

If I understand your question, then no. The finite group SL(2,5) has a projective, reducible, indecomposable representation of dimension 5 over the field of 5 elements, namely the projective cover of the principal module 5^1. It has composition series 5^1, 5^3, 5^1. This gives you an example of a non-completely-reducible module of dimension p-1 = 4 too if you'd like. You probably only need to concern yourself with indecomposable modules, and since SL(2,p) has a cyclic Sylow p-subgroup, you can use the Brauer tree to write down the indecomposable modules. The projective indecomposables for SL(2,p) are described on 48–49 of Alperin's Local representation theory book (MR 860771 google). 

For larger orders, one needs to be more careful calculating the Schur multiplier, or applying a little theory since the naive method is dealing with larger index subgroups and then larger integer matrices. 

I'd much prefer to use B, but if I cannot even see the scalar matrices in this form, then it seems like a very poor form indeed. For those curious the other leading canonical form of B is: $\hat B = \begin{bmatrix} .&1&.&.&.&.\\% .&.&1&.&.&.\\% .&.&.&1&.&.\\% .&.&.&.&1&.\\% .&.&.&.&.&1\\% 1&3&0&-5&0&3\\% \end{bmatrix}$ It is pretty, but also non-obvious what its composition factors are. This form (along with the Z/6Z style grouping of irreducible factors) is used by GP/Pari. Transposes and alternate groupings of factors allow for a wide variety of canonical forms. The best answer will address the ease of explicitly writing down generators of the centralizer of B over a finite prime field given just (irr,pow), or will address both writing down the canonical form from (irr,pow) and the centralizer. An inductive answer might prefer to allow non-prime fields, but added generality at the cost of clarity and explicit algorithms is not useful to me. Edit: Both B and $\hat B$ have the nice property that given a generator w for the indecomposable module acted on by the original operator M, a basis realizing the matrix is easy to find. For B this is vi = w⋅Mj⋅irr(M)k where i−1 = k⋅deg(irr) + j and 0 ≤ j < deg(irr), for i = 1, 2, … deg(irr)⋅pow. For $\hat B$ this is vi = w⋅Mi−1, for i = 1, 2, … deg(irr)⋅pow. In order to use $\tilde B$, I need a similar explicit understanding of the basis defining it. 

Suzuki's proof is given in Gorenstein's Finite Groups, 3.8.2, p. 105. It also avoids subnormality, rather using ideas about fusion of p-elements, and is probably how Bender thought of it. 

I believe you are just asking if every central division algebra over F is a crossed product. This is not true, and the first example was given in: Amitsur, S. A. "On central division algebras." Israel J. Math. 12 (1972), 408-420. MR 318216 DOI: 10.1007/BF02764632 A survey of Amitsur's contributions on division algebras which mentions this point in particular is the introduction by Saltman starting on page 109 of: Amitsur, S. A. Selected papers of S. A. Amitsur with commentary. Part 2. Edited by Avinoam Mann, Amitai Regev, Louis Rowen, David J. Saltman and Lance W. Small.

Lots of results in group cohomology only have topological proofs using the techniques of Bob Oliver and his (generalized) collaborators. For instance, many results along the lines of "controls fusion iff controls cohomology" only have topological proofs using the same techniques that Bob Oliver called fusion systems (though I think some of the papers stick to the topological language). "Controls fusion" is a very old term predating fusion systems by 50 years, so I think of this as a pretty pure finite group cohomology result. I think it is common to call these topological results by the name "fusion" results, even if fusion systems are not used directly, but rather p-completed classifying spaces are used (also known as p-local groups and such), even if the fusion system used to define the topological space is not prominent. Allowing such abuse of language, one of my favorite examples is the topological proof that the famous Z*-theorem holds for odd primes too: MR1125010. It was proven later using more pure finite group theory, but I suspect lots of people prefer the topological proof. In modular representation theory, the work of Puig on nilpotent blocks is (as far as I know) literally defined in terms of fusion systems and gets results on the representation theory using only conditions on the fusion systems. One also has some nice descriptions of the representation type of blocks of dihedral defect in terms of the fusion system induced on the block (I believe Linckelmann's introduction gives this as an example). More historically, the classification of finite groups with dihedral (and then for semi-dihedral/wreathed) begins by dividing clearly into cases based on which fusion system occurs. This just organizes the (couple hundred page) papers, so I guess whether it is essential depends on how practical you are. Perhaps the most "exciting" answer is not quite ready yet, but Michael Aschbacher and collaborators have begun to recast the classification of finite simple groups in terms of fusion systems. It is quite surprising and comforting that several very important steps in the classification are radically easier in the fusion system case. The fusion system theorems would also have as side-effects corresponding theorems in modular representation theory and the theory of p-local groups. Let me know if you want references for any of the wishy washy terms, but basically read Linckelmann's introduction, read a few papers of BLO (Broto–Levi–Oliver), and check out the slides from any recent finite group theory conference, and you should have some pretty convincing evidence that fusion systems are opening up a very bright future for finite group theory. 

Kash 2.5 is the old version, but I never really learned the new version, KASH3. Both are available from $URL$ Kash 2.5 syntax is similar to GAP, and it is should be easy to loop over the polynomials. SAGE has interfaces to both magma and kash if for some reason you need to produce the polynomials in one program and filter them in the other. I don't know much about function fields, but Kash says your MinP has galois group A5 over Z/2Z, but S5 over Z/3Z. Your magma code had some typos: 

See section 8.7.2 p307ff of Holt, Eick, O'Brien's Handbook of Computational Group Theory. Also see TwoCohomology in the GAP manual. Roughly speaking normalized cocycles are determined by their values on rule overlaps, and those values are independent of how you overlap. So for instance if A was cyclic of order 8 with generator a, then ζ( a^i, a^(8-i) ) has a constant value for each 0 < i < 8, namely the element b of B such that in your extension G, the image α of a satisfies α^8 = b. It is important to normalize the cocycles, otherwise the formulas get messy. In other words, in the extension G you take a sane transversal of B consisting of reduced words, so there is no loss of generality, just encouragement to keep good hygiene. If A is a general finite group, then you can replace the confluent polycyclic rewriting system by any confluent rewriting system and still have a very effective algorithm. You can also replace it by a general finite presentation, but then determining values of the cocycle become "word problems" in a finitely presented group, and are not very suited to algorithmic determination (though as long as A and B are finite, the problems are only practical). Roughly 1-cohomology corresponds to the bridge between generators and relations, 2-cohomology between relations and associativity (known as "overlaps" when the relations are a rewrite system).
