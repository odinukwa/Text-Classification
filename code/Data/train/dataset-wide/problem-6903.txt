Source: Notes On Adjusting the HP-Filter for the Frequency of Observations Mueller's result is not obvious to me given this rule. By that rule of thumb, a monthly parameter given an quarterly parameter of 900,000 is $900,000 / 3^4 \approx 11,111$ (because there 3 months in a quarter). It also gives a yearly parameter of $900,000 / 12^4 \approx 43$ (12 months in a year). The following quote seems to support Mueller. 

A good cannot be inferior over the entire income range. The paper A Convenient Utility Function with Giffen Behaviour shows that for a person with utility of the form: $$U(x,y) = \alpha_1 \ln(x-\gamma_x)- \alpha_2 \ln(\gamma_y - y) $$ X is inferior if $\gamma_x$ and $\gamma_y$ are positive, $0<\alpha_1<\alpha_2$, and in the domain $x>\gamma_x$ and $0\leq y<\gamma_y$. Update: $$U(x,v) = x + \ln(v)$$ If the budget is $w$, $v^* = \min(P_x / P_V, w)$ so for $w>P_x / P_V$ $v$ is inferior sticky good. Realized this is actually a zero income elasticity not a negative one so it is not inferior. I found another funky functional form for a utility function where one good is inferior but it too has increasing marginal utility of the other good: An Inferior Good and a Novel Indifference Map $$U = A_1 \ln(x) + y^2 /2 $$ That function gives a crazy indifference map. The classic example to me of inferior goods are things like cheap food, where delicious food which is much more expensive crowds it out because there is an additional constraint (stomach capacity) which eventually binds. It should be readily possible to make an example where inferiority is a consequence of this second constraint rather than the utility function. 

Setting the members' marginal utilities equal. Allocating inputs efficiently so the output lies on the production possibility frontier (Production Efficiency) Choosing the mix out outputs to put to their most valuable purpose (Product-Mix Efficiency) Allocating outputs efficiently such that no resources can be redeployed to make someone better off without making anyone worse off. 

Does having sons make you more conservative? Maybe, maybe not. A problem with controlling for an intermediate outcome Regarding your comment that "Leave those control variables out and they lead to omitted variable bias themselves.", this seems to depend what sort of instrument you get. A good instrument, one that really satisfies the requirements, has to be independent of of the error term in the second stage and be independent of everything else you control for directly. That is, the instrument changes Y only through X. So a suitable instrument for inequality has to be independent of growth and development (good luck finding that!) if we believe that the violence equation is the structural equation for violence. 

One solution to this problem is to use monopolistic competition (sometimes called the differentiated goods monopoly) in the final good sector. For example, households might consume a continuum of final goods, each different, and aggregated with a constant elasticity of substitution utility function. This is the setting in the hugely influential Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) paper. The approach of Dixit and Stiglitz is heavily used directly or as motivation in new Keynesian modeling because monopoly pricing power allows for sticky prices. 

Rational expectations seems to have a similar joint hypothesis problem as the efficient market hypothesis. In the efficient market hypothesis, this means "If efficiency is rejected, this could be because the market is truly inefficient or because an incorrect equilibrium model has been assumed." Similarly here, if rational expectations is rejected this could be because rational expectations is truly false or that the model of rational expectations is incorrect. For a contrived example of this consider what happens if agents know the the true distributions of shocks in the economy but the econometrician does not. If the econometrician guesses the wrong process for these shocks and discovers that agents are not rationally expecting this incorrect process. This clearly does not constitute a rejection of rational expectations even though that is often what is claimed. . 

The reason for this is essentially Jensen's inequality. We can model the value of an option as a convex function $f(x)$ where $x$ is the underlying. The value of the option is $g(x) = E[f(x)]$ This implies $g(x)$ is increasing in the variance of $x$. We can see this because when we do the Taylor expansion of the function f : $$g(x) \approx E[f(x_0) + (x - x_0)\cdot f'(x_0) + (x - x_0)^2 \cdot f''(x_0)]$$ Because of the convexity, the second order term $f''(x_0)$ will be positive. The additive part $E[(x - x_0)^2 \cdot f''(x_0)] = E[(x - x_0)^2] \cdot f''(x_0)$ is increasing in the variance $E[(x - \bar{x})^2]$ so the value of the option is increasing in the variance. 

Ted Bergstrom has Lecture Notes on Separable Preferences that seem to have what you are looking for. For example: 

Say you have a portfolio with returns described by a random variable X. Call the lowest possible realization of X: xmin. If you take a levered position in that portfolio with leverage A and financing cost r your returns are r(A-1)+AX. There will exist a value of A no larger than 1/xmin where when you get the worst return of X and the levered portfolio returns -100%. That's game over for your wealth. So if you invest for the long run and reinvest after each period it should be clear that you can't simply arbitrarily maximize leverage to maximize long run returns. That expected log return maximization objective function is exactly the objective function of long run return maximization. This objective treats -100% returns as -infinity utility and so avoids it at all cost. If instead you maximized expected returns this wouldn't happen. Your preference would be for unboundedly large leverage, in line with your intuition. Another way to think about this is risk aversion. Log utility in wealth is analogous to a CRRA utility parameter of 1, while the expected return utility function a CRRA parameter of 0 (risk neutral). Since the risk neutral guy doesn't care about risk, he sees an asset with positive expected returns and wants a gigantic levered bet on it. The log utility guy is relatively risk tolerant but still worries about extreme outcomes and so doesn't want too much leverage. And if the range of values taken by X are mostly in the range of +/- 30%, it turns out that E[log(X)] is nicely approximated by E[X]+0.5Var(X) so can be well approximated with Markowitz mean-variance portfolio optimization where lambda is 1/2. Where as E[X] preferences is analogous to lambda of zero which won't have a bounded solution without an additional constraint. 

Mobility and Mortgages: Evidence from the PSID (Colson and Greece (2013)) The NLSY may also have this data. 

On the Wall Street Journal Op-Ed page (Trump’s Real Trade Problem Is Money ), John D. Mueller discusses the gold standard and claims something that I've either never heard before, don't understand, or both. 

Quantitative easing (QE) is an historically unusual monetary policy tool that involves the purchase of financial assets by the central bank. Unlike similar assete purchases used for moving exchange rates, these assets are typically local currency denominated and not sterilized. Although central bank purchase of government debt occurs in both QE and monetization (like what occurred in Zimbabwe and the Weimar inflation), they are actually quite different. Under QE asset purchases are usually expected to be temporary and accumulated assets (money) ultimately resold (returned in exchange for assets). Monetization has neither expectation. QE is typically been employed as a way of increasing the monetary base when interest rates at or close to the zero lower bound and therefore conventional monetary policy tools like changing the federal funds rate are (thought to be) ineffective. Many African countries are poor candidates for QE because they have pegged currencies, participate in a currency union, or have high inflation. 

Most global commodities are quoted (priced) in US dollars. The more valuable a dollar becomes relative to other currencies, all other things equal, the more commodity prices have to fall to equilibrate. Imagine everything was priced in corn and people start to value corn more or the amount of corn falls. Either way, all the prices in terms of corn (e.g. ears per barrel of oil) would have to fall as a result. 

From the Alchian–Allen Wikipedia page, emphasis mine. I learned about this paradox in the context of Why the Best Washington Apples are Shipped out of State, discussed in a chapter of a fun popular economics book Puzzles and Paradoxes in Economics which also happens to be a great source of undergraduate economics exam questions. 

Robot taxation is a bit like corporate income taxation. Like corporations, robots don't pay taxes, people pay taxes. In the words of Herb Stein: 

1 Kings 3:16-28 Contemporary English Version (CEV) The book Biblical Games: Game Theory and the Hebrew Bible argues that many of the stories in the Hebrew bible can be understood as reputation games between the creator of the universe and the Jewish people. Further, in many cases the equilibrium outcomes of these games are consistent with traditional understanding of the meaning of these stories. According to the Documentary hypothesis many of the earliest such stories of the bible were written about 1,000 BCE but the earliest stories are set about 2,000 BCE or even earlier. 

If spending on banking services increases more slowly than account balances and the sums involved don't make it worth the trouble of having multiple accounts then banks will be willing to offer higher rates on smaller balances. But, empirically, my impression is that this is atypical. It is more common to see higher rates on higher balances, because the transaction costs on serving one \$100k account are smaller than those of 10 \$10k accounts, and so they can pass some of those economies along as higher rates. 

There is only a change in GDP to the extent there are market goods and services used in the sale and only those goods and services are counted. The actual sales revenue are irrelevant. For example, the home inspection, appraisal, brokerage fees, and, I believe mortgage closing costs, would be in GDP. If you and your sister swapped houses in as-is condition without getting the market, bank, or tax authority involved, there would be no change in GDP. 

Cross-national comparisons of internal migration: An update on global patterns and trends (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2013)) Depending on methodology, annual and 5-year rates can't exactly be compared because some people will move to another area and move back within five years, so asking people if they live in the same state as 5 years ago won't give the same result as asking someone if they lived in a different state last year for five years. That said, if we can make some rough comparisons if we treat the five year rate as roughly comparable to five times the annual rate. The USA rate is about 9 percent every 5 years or 1.8 percent per year. This would be higher (but not much higher) than the West-East, East-East, and East-West German internal migration rates but quite a bit lower than the internal migration rate within West Germany. It might be that this converts the 5-year rates to annual ones that are too low, but the sizes seem roughly comparable. This is just two sources but they provide little or no evidence for Feldstein's claim that the German rates are far lower than in the US.
