This answer is a response to Daniel Litt's answer above. First, let me distill his point. Given a diagram of finite-dimensional vector spaces, every term $A$ has a dimension which is a non-negative integer. In addition, every morphism $f:A \to B$ has a non-negative rank which is at most $\min(\dim A,\dim B)$. If a pair of morphisms $$A \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B \stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow} C,$$ then you get a linear relation $$\mathrm{rank}\ f + \mathrm{rank}\ g = \dim B.$$ Thus, there is an integer programming problem to express whether the dimensions and ranks are feasible. Since such an integer programming problem is homogeneous, you can instead treat it as a rational linear programming problem and later clear denominators. There is an algorithm to determine feasibility, even a polynomial time algorithm. As Daniel points out, this is enough to establish the nine lemma in the special case of finite-dimensional vector spaces. The argument/algorithm even works in many categories other than finite-dimensional vector spaces. For instance it works for finite abelian groups. On the other hand, the algorithm doesn't use the fact that any polygons in the diagram commute (see below), other than perhaps a preprocessing stage in which commutative polygons are filled in by commutative triangles. Like me, Daniel asked to restrict to acyclic diagrams. However, I realized that this restriction is ineffectual for my entire question. (Thus, his algorithm can't need it.) You can convert any diagram into an acyclic one using the fact that $$0 \longrightarrow A \stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow} A' \longrightarrow 0$$ makes $\phi$ into an isomorphism. If $\mathcal{D}$ is a diagram, you should first triangulate all commutative polygons in to make commutative triangles. Then make three copies $A, A', A''$ of each object $A \in \mathcal{D}$ together with isomorphisms $$A \stackrel{\phi}{\longrightarrow} A' \stackrel{\phi'}{\longrightarrow} A'.$$ Then a homomorphism $f:A \to B$ in $\mathcal{D}$ can be expressed acyclically as this commutative square: $$\begin{matrix} A & \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} & B' \\ \downarrow && \downarrow \\ A' & \stackrel{f'}{\longrightarrow} & B'' \end{matrix}$$ Finally, a commutative triangle $h = f \circ g$ can be expressed as a commutative square $h' \circ \phi = f' \circ g$. Or if $f$ and $g$ are an exact pair, you can require that $f'$ and $g$ make an exact pair. Daniel also says without explanation that if there is a solution to the dimension and rank equations, then there are ways to fill in all of the maps. But without a lot more work, I don't think that this inference is reasonable. The hard part is satisfying commutative triangles. It is certainly not true that there is simply a canonical choice for each map using a skeleton $\{k^n\}$ of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces. Because, if $f$ and $g$ each have some rank, then their composition $f \circ g$ might also have some desired rank, and that rank depends on the choices of $f$ and $g$. One interesting remark here is that $$\mathrm{rank}\ f \circ g \le \min(\mathrm{rank}\ f,\mathrm{rank}\ g),$$ and there is a similar inequality on the other side. However, I think that there is more going on than that. Finally, it is worth giving a simple example to show that feasibility in finite-dimensional vector spaces is not the same as feasibility in vector spaces. Given the exact sequence $$0 \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow 0,$$ you can conclude (using the dimension equations that Daniel suggests) that $A = 0$ if it is finite-dimensional. But if it is infinite-dimensional, then there are non-trivial solutions. 

Here is a proposal along the lines of what Ben Weiss said: Let $s(n)$, the "smoothness" of $n$, be the largest prime factor of $n$. Then as a necessary condition, $$s\left[\binom{n}{k}\right]! \le \binom{n}{k}.$$ Otherwise you can say that the binomial coefficient is not smooth enough for its size to be a factorial. This criterion eliminates large swaths of Pascal's triangle from consideration. A boneheaded somewhat informed (see below) run with Sage up to $n = 10^7$ found the solutions $n=10$ and $50$ for $k=3$ to the above inequality, and the following values of $n$ for $k=2$: $$4\quad 9\quad 16\quad 25\quad 81\quad 126\quad 225\quad 2401\quad 4375\quad 9801\quad 123201$$ It did not find any solutions with $\min(k,n-k) \ge 4$. 

My impression is that the surgery methods in dimension $n \ge 5$ used to prove the unknottedness assertion are valid in the smooth, PL, and continuous categories. Dimension $n=3$ is of course a special case where you do not need to consider algebraic topology, but instead prove things with direct cut-and-paste arguments as Ryan describes. In dimension $n=4$, the surgery theory is (a) much more difficult in the continuous category, and (b) non-existent in the smooth/PL category. The paper The algebraic characterization of the exteriors of certain 2-knots, by Jonathan Hillman, credits Freedman with the result that a 2-knot with knot group $\mathbb{Z}$ is unknotted. If this requires Freedman's work, then I would think that it is open in the smooth/PL case. What would be open is whether the 4-manifold with boundary $B^3 \times S^1$ has more than one smooth structure. If it does, I have seen a principle that smooth structures on a 4-manifold can merge together when you take a connected sum with manifolds such as $\pm \mathbb{C}P^2$ an $S^2 \times S^2$. I do not know if this principle is established for manifolds with a fundamental group. But at the very least, I have heard that the semigroup of smooth structures on $S^4$ is completely unknown, and its action on the smooth structures on another 4-manifold is completely unknown. So if the smooth Poincare conjecture is sufficiently false, presumably you could have a non-trivial 2-knot in $B$ that becomes trivial in $M$. 

The heart of the matter is to define a canonical inner product for any norm in finite dimensions. Since it is canonical, an $X$-isometry is also an isometry of the inner product. If the group is transitive on lines, you thus immediately get that norm is Euclidean. There are two popular ways to do this. One is John's theorem: The ellipsoid in the unit ball $K$ of $X$ (which is any convex, centrally symmetric body) with the largest volume is unique. Or of course you could use John's theorem dually, taking the smallest ellipsoid that contains $K$. The other popular, canonical ellipsoid is the Legendre ellipsoid of $K$, by definition the ellipsoid $L$ that has the same moment of inertia matrix as $K$, assuming that both $L$ and $K$ have uniformly distributed mass. 

There is a survey paper on this general topic by Robert Connelly and Erik Demaine. As David Eppstein just posted, the answer is yes in 3D. However, it is a famous result of those two authors and Gunter Rote that the answer is no in 2D: all polygonal planar cyclic linkages can be made convex. This second problem was a long-standing conjecture called the "Carpenter's Rule Problem". There are at least two beautiful proofs of the conjecture: the original, and a second one using pseudo-triangulations due to Ileana Streinu. 

There are many cases of the question as stated that follow quickly from the standard Sylvester-Gallai theorem. If $V$ is an $r$-dimensional variety, then its intersection with a generic $(n-r)$-plane is a finite set of points. You can then apply the standard Sylvester-Gallai theorem, or the high-dimensional generalization stated here. There are cases where nothing can be said for singular varieties. As a warm-up, let's consider a set which is not an algebraic variety but a union of line segments. Then it could be the union of all of the interior diagonals of a convex polytope $P$ with complicated facets. For instance you could take all of the interior diagonals of the Cartesian product of two $n$-gons. Any 3-plane that intersects $P$ 3-dimensionally has to intersect many of the edges. A line segment is not a real algebraic variety. However, it can be replaced by a thin needle with cusps at the ends that is a real algebraic variety. You can replace all of the diagonals with these needles, as long as you skip the edges of $P$ itself, and the result will still lie in the convex hull of $P$. A needle of this type can have a cross-section of any dimension and very complicated topology. If you asked for a hyperplane that specifically intersects in more than a finite set, then the diagonal-needle construction can force a lot of topology. You could specifically look at non-singular varieties. I don't have a rigorous result here, but the smooth restriction would make it difficult to avoid hyperplanes that do something at the boundary of the convex hull of $V$. The Sylvester-Gallai theorem is more about things that have to happen in the interior if they do not happen at the boundary of the convex hull. You could bound the degree of the variety $V$. Then a simple compactness argument bounds the complexity of intersects, and there are a lot of interesting bounds on the topology of $V$ itself. But that also goes against the spirit of Sylvester-Gallai, because the number of points in that result is not bounded. Maybe a more interesting variation is to keep a finite intersection, but replace the hyperplane with a $V$ with bounded degree. However, that is no longer the question posted. The question is a bit open-ended. I can think of several constructions that seem to ask for a less open-ended question, or a question which is open-ended in a different way.
