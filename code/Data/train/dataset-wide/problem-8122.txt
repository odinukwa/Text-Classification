Note that the Montgomery's estimate (1) for $\psi(q,a,x)$ follows immediately from (2) by summing over $a$ invertible mod $q$ and dividing by $\phi(q)$. However, it is not clear that (1) implies (2) as the error term seems to get multiplied by $\phi(q)$. Yet, I have made some numerical computation, and the estimate for Dirichlet character seems to hold. Now assuming that the first question has a positive answer, I want to generalize it boldly to Artin's representations. Let $\rho : Gal(K/\mathbb Q) \rightarrow Gl_d(\mathbb C)$ be an irreducible, non-trivial representation of dimension $d$, Artin's conductor $q$ and let $\chi$ be its character. In this context, I define (also as usual): $$\psi(\chi,x)=\sum_{p^\alpha < x} \chi(Frob_p^\alpha) \log p.$$ 

Here $G_{K,S}$ is as usual the Galois group of the maximal algebraic extension of $K$ un ramified outside $S$ and places at infinity, the $H^2$ is continuous cohomology. Now, one of the most natural way to get a class in an $H^2$ is as a cup-product of two classes in an $H^1$. For example, if $\chi : G_{K,S} \rightarrow Q_p^\ast $ is a continuous character, then there is a cup-product map $$H^1(G_{K,S},\chi) \times H^1(G_{K,S},\chi^{-1}) \rightarrow H^2(G_{K,S},\mathbb{Q}_p),$$ which, according to Leopoldt's conjecture, should be zero. 

The answer to question 1 as states is no. For example if $i=0$, $V$ will be the trivial Galois representation (assuming your variety to be geometrically connected). But the answer to question 2 is yes (which implies that some corrected version of question 1 holds as well): a "generalized Weil pairing" is given by the theory of Poincaré duality in étale cohomology: there is a Galois-equivariant pairing $H^i_{et}(X_{\bar K},\mathbb Q_p)\times H^{2n-i}_{et}(X_{\overline K},\mathbb Q_p) \rightarrow \mathbb Q_p(1)$, where $n$ is the dimension of your variety. When $X$ is an elliptic curve, $n=1$, and taking $i=1$ gives you exactly the Weil pairing. There is more to say about your question 2: there is a Lefschetz isomorphism $H^i_{et} \rightarrow H^{2n-i}_{et}$ which is a also Galois equivariant up to a suitable Tate twist. Hence you get a perfect equivariant pairing $H^i_{et} \times H^i_{et} \rightarrow \mathbb Q_p(i)$. Hence back to your question 1, you see that $\ker \rho$ is contained in the kernel of the power $i$ of the cyclotomic character, hence that your field $F$ contains if $i>0$ a subfield $K'$ of $K(\mu_{p^\infty})$ such that $K(\mu_{p^\infty})$ is finite degree over $K'$. Moreover, if $i$ is relatively prime to $2(p-1)$, the answer to your question 1 is yes, as the $i$-th power of the cyclotomic character has then same kernel as the cyclotomic character itself. 

There are several ways to see it, some low-level and some more conceptual. I assume that you are talking of an eigenform $g$ for $U_p$ of level $\Gamma_1(N) \cap \Gamma_0(p)$, with $p$ prime to $N$ (otherwise the result may be false: the slope may be infinite). For a low-level proof, there are two cases to consider. The most important (because it is generic in a $p$-adic family sense) is when $g$ is old at $p$. That is, when $g$ is a linear combination of the form $f(z)$, $f(pz)$, for $f$ a form of level $\Gamma_1(N)$, eigenform for $T_p$, say with eigenvalue $a_p$. Then one can compute the matrix of $U_p$ in the basis $f(z)$, $f(pz)$. This is not hard since $T_p h$ is $U_p h $ plus an explicit scalar times $h(pz)$, by the very definitions of the Hecke operators $T_p$ and $U_p$, and one find that that the characteristic polynomial of $U_p$ is $X^2 - a_pX + p^{k-1} \epsilon(p)$, where $\epsilon$ is the nebentypus of $f$. (you can remove this term if $f$ is of level $\Gamma_0(N)$, say). Then the eigenvalue of $U_p$ on $G$ has to be a root $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of this polynomial, but since $a_p$ is an algebraic integer, so are the roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$; in particular $v_p(\alpha) \geq 0$ and $v_p(\beta) \geq 0$. Since $\alpha \beta = p^{k-1} \epsilon(p)$, and $\epsilon(p)$ is a root of unity, $v_p(\alpha)+v_p(\beta)=k-1$, and this implies $v_p(\alpha), v_p(\beta) \leq k-1$. (with possible equality only when one of those two slope is $0$, which is equivalent to $v_p(a_p)=0$.) For the case of a new form, a computation shows that the slope is always $(k-2)/2$. Now for a more conceptual proof, in term of the geometric interpretation of $U_p$, I recommend reading carefully Kevin's Buzzard second paper (that is the one written by him alone, not him and Taylor) on the Artin conjecture. 

When $k$ is even the answer is always since $p^{(k-2)/2} \in \mathbb Q$. When $k$ is odd the answer is never since if this was true, then for all $p$ (prime not divdidig $N$), we would have $p^{1/2} \in M_f$, so $M_f$ would contain the field of infinite degree over $\mathbb Q$ generated by the square roots of those prime, contradicting the fact that $M_f$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb Q$. 

The point here is that we get to replace $\log^2 x$ by $\log x$. Thanks for any reference (or disproof, if this is just a dream I made). 

Jean-Pierre Serre had a lot of original theorems (some due to him and some due to John Tate) published originally in textbooks. To give two examples, his book "Cohomologie Galoisienne" ("Galois cohomology") contain, I believe, the first published proof of many theorems of Tate that form the socle of the theory. His book "abelian $l$-adic representations and elliptic curves" contains the proof of his theorem that two elliptic curves over a number field with non-integral j-invariants that have the same $L$-functions are isogenous. 

Let $G=GL_2(\mathbb F_p)$, $M=M_2(\mathbb F_p)$, $M^0=$ matrices of trace 0 in $M$. If you consider first $H^1(G,M^0)$, then it is 0 as soon as $p \geq 7$ by CPS (Cline, Parshall, Scott, cohomology of finite groups of Lie type, Publ. IHES 45, (1975)) Theorem 4.2. (This is a result sometimes useful in Galois deformation theory, cf. Mazur, "Deforming Galois Representations", pages 401-402). As for $H^1(G,M)$ you get that it has dimension 0 (edited after the comments) if $p\geq7$ since $M=M_0 \oplus \mathbb F_p$ as $G$-modules when $p$ is odd. 

I have just read the nice survey by Granville and Martin about prime races. I wonder what happens if one changes the rules for the prime races as follows. Fix $q$ a modulus (an integer $>1$). For $a$ an integer relatively prime to $q$, one has a Mertens-like formula $$\sum_{p<x, \atop p \equiv a \pmod{q}} \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{\phi(q)} \log\log x + M_{q,a} + O(1/\log x)$$ where $M_{q,a}$ is a constant. We can say that the "team $a$" wins the race mod $q$ if the constant $M_{q,a}$ is greater than the constants $M_{a,b}$ for others $b \pmod{q}$, and we can even make a complete ranking of the various teams (with possible ties). This is a reasonable notion, since stating that $M_{q,a} > M_{q,b}$ implies that the number of primes $p$ up to $x$ counted with harmonic density $1/p$ which are congruent to $a$ mod $q$ is greater than the same number for congruent to $b$ mod $q$, for every $x$ large enough. 

I am waking up an old and already well-answered question, to offer another point of view, The Artin's conjecture appears very naturally in the context of Chebotarev's density theorem. In fact, we can see Cheobtarev's contribution as a clever trick to circumvent the Artin conjecture by reducing the proof to cases where it is known (by works of Dirichlet and Hecke). But the proof of Chebotarev will be much simpler and more natural if we had the Artin's conjecture, which moreover would give better results as far as the error term is concerned. This is, I think, a good justification of the importance of Artin's conjecture. To explain the role of Artin's conjecture, let us also assume for simplicity GRH. Then, for $G=Gal(K/\mathbb Q)$ a finite Galois group, and $\rho$ an irreducible Artin representation of $G$, the $L$-function $L(\rho,s)$ has no zero on Re $s>1/2$ (by GRH) and no pole either (by Artin), except for a simple pole at $s=1$ if $\rho$ is trivial. Thus the logarithmic derivative, $L'/L(\rho,s)$ has no pole on Re $s>1/2$ (except perhaps...): this illustrates clearly the symmetric and complementary role played by Artin and Riemann's conjectures; both poles and zeros of $L$ contribute to simple poles of $L'/L$, and Artin eliminates some of them, Riemann the others. Now standard techniques of analytic number theory allows us, by integrating $L'/L$ on a vertical line $2+i \mathbb R$ and moving it near the critical line, to $1/2+\epsilon + i \mathbb R$, to get an estimate of the quantity: $$\pi(\rho,x) = \sum_{p^n < x} \log(p) tr \rho(frob_p)^n$$ where the sum is on prime power less than $x$. This estimate is $O(x^{1/2+\epsilon})$ if $\rho$ is non trivial, and $x + O(x^{1/2+\epsilon})$ if $\rho$ is trivial, because of the pole at $s=1$. Now let $C$ be subset of $G$ stable by conjugaison, $1_C$ its characteristic function. Since $1_C$ is a central function, it is a linear combinaison of character of irreducible representation of $G$, say $$1_C = \sum_\rho a_\rho tr \rho.$$ Hence $\pi(C,x) := \sum_{p^n< x} \log p 1_C(frob_p) = \sum_\rho a_\rho \pi_\rho(x)$. Since $a_1$ is easily computed as $|C|/|G|$, we get $\pi(C,x)=|C|x/|G| + O(x^{1/2+\epsilon})$, which is up to standard manipulation Chebotarev's density theorem. Hence we can say that Artin's conjecture play to Chebotarev's density theorem a role analog to the role played by the standard conjectures for the Weil's conjecture proved by Deligne. In both cases, a clever and beautiful trick was used (by Chebotarev and Deligne, respectively) to prove a theorem (Chebotarev's theorem, aka Frobenius' conjecture, and Deligne's theorem, aka the last Weil's conjecture) without proving the conjectural statement that makes the theorem limpid (Artin's conjecture, resp. standard conjectures). This is great, but doesn't make the conjectures any less interesting. Important addendum A friend of mine made me notice something that kind of weakens significantly the point I was trying to make above. Indeed, for the argument outlined above, one doesn't need GRH + Artin's conjecture: GRH is enough. Or, more precisely, the part of Artin's conjecture that is needed is already known under GRH. Indeed, it is clear that in the argument the absence of poles of $L(\rho,s)$ is only used in the region Re $s>1/2$. But by Brauer's theorem, we know that $L(\rho,s)$ is meromorphic on $\mathbb C$, and by elementary reasoning that $\prod_\rho L(\rho,s) = \zeta_K(s)$, where $\rho$ runs amongst Artin's representations of Gal$(K/\mathbb Q)$. Moreover, by Hecke $\zeta_K$ has no poles (except a simple one at $s=1$). Hence if all the $L(\rho,s)$ have no zero on any given region, then they don't have a polo either on that region -- expected for $L(1,s)$ with its simple pole at $s=1$. I leave the argument above, because it shows that, the absence of poles for $L(\rho,s)$ is important for questions on the distribution of primes, even if it is a theorem rather than a conjecture. Moreover, this argument has an historical interest, as Artin's conjecture was made in the 1920's, and Brauer's theorem proved in 1946. I ignore if the question of absence of poles on the critical line for the $L(\rho,s)$ (the only part of Artin's conjecture that is still open) has any direct application on the distribution of primes. 

Whatever your answer to my question in comment, the answer to the title question is yes. Take the case of the $L$-function attached to a modular form $f$, which we assume an eigenform for almost all Hecke operators (since otherwise there is no decomposition of the L-function into Euler product and the phrase "local eigenvalues" has no meaning.) By Deligne, we know then that the local eigenvalues at $p$ for almost every $p$ are Weil numbers, more precisely they are algebraic numbers whose every embedding in $\mathbb C$ has absolute values $p^{(k-1)/2}$ where $k$ is the weight of your modular form (cf. the last corollary of this link for instance). If just one of those eigenvalue is a root of unity, this already forces $k=1$, in which case we know by Deligne-Serre that the Galois representation attached to $f$ has finite image, that is that $L(f,s)$ is an Artin $L$-function.
