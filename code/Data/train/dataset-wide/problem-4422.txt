This is correct. Once the ball is in-bounded the possession arrow switches. See this website for more info about possession arrows if you are interested. 

The Satsuki golf course in Sano, Japan. It's 964 yards long and is par 7. More info here Gunsan Country Club has a 1098 yards hole also par 7. More info here and picture below 

I think really it depends if this is a one of trip or if you visit the pitch regularly. A one of trip will do minimum damage all though I'd advise trying to walk over in regular shoes. If you did walk over in studs, they wouldn't wear down enough for a match official to disallow you from playing for example, but there would be some damage. If you go there regularly then I would definitely recommend wearing normal shoes. They will wear down too quickly and become sharp. 

Watching the Olympics I have found the swimming very interesting. I've noticed that while the swimmers are swimming the TV Channel (BBC) projects a line across the width of the pool saying WR (World Record) at the end. I'm a bit unsure about this line, I know it's to show where the swimmers would need to be at to get the World Record but is the line showing where the swimmer who holds that world record was at that point or is it showing the required place through out? e.g. say the 100m WR was 50 seconds, then the line would progress 10m every 5 seconds. 

It all really depends on what kind of running you are doing. I know that there are some who run distance workouts and take two days off in-between, but I also know some who do tempo interval workouts and take one day off a week. The long run can be the most beneficial, but also can cause the most damage if done too hard, too long, and too frequently. So you can continue doing your individual workout, especially if it seems to be working for you, but be careful with your body as to not overwhelm it. You only get one haha. Throwing some sporadic tempo interval runs may be beneficial for you, as training in only one area may decrease your abilities in another. Many believe there is only one way to run, but there are many different factors and abilities that are tested. Having tempo interval runs will allow you to work on running through tiredness towards the end of the race, and force you to focus on your running form, which one may not necessarily work on if they simply do distance runs and nothing else. 

These are some very basic exercises for developing fast twitch muscles, which are easy and safe for the ages previously mentioned. Hope these descriptions make sense. 

EQUIPMENT COMPLIANCE The International Badminton Federation shall rule on any question of whether any racket, shuttle or equipment or any prototype used in the playing of Badminton complies with the specifications.

In international cricket if an umpire gives a batsman not out after an appeal by the fielding side then the captain of the fielding side can review the decision. Scenario: A batsman gets a tiny edge onto his pad and the fielding side appeals for lbw while the ball bounces up to a fielder who catches it. The umpire gives it not out. The captain is unsure whether the batsman has hit it but reviews the lbw anyway. The edge comes up on hot-spot so it can't be lbw. 

I am a goalkeeper and a wicket keeper, and because these are specialist positions they need different drills and equipment to, say, midfielders or bowlers. I have my own drills but I'd like some new ideas and equipment. So any recommendations? Either 

4.3 The racket: 4.3.1: [The racket] shall be free of attached objects and protrusions, other than those used solely and specifically to limit or prevent wear and tear, or vibration, or to distribute weight, or to secure the handle by cord to the player's hand, and which are reasonable in size and placement for such purposes 

There are compelling reasons to introduce the DH to the National League and compelling reasons to remove the DH from the American League. Most likely the answer to your question comes down to money. By introducing the DH to the National League, there would be 15 more starting positions across MLB. The prototypical DH is a power hitter. These types of players usually command expensive contracts. NL team owners don't want to introduce the DH so they can avoid paying those contracts. AL team owners likely have a reason to keep the DH out of NL as well. If the NL were to introduce the DH, there would be increased demand for those types of players, inflating DH salaries. The question points out that the DH can extend the careers of players. Old players make more money than young players, because they can become free agents. Keep in mind that the DH was instituted in the AL to increase offense as a way to bolster attendance, and consequently revenues. Although offense is at a low point in today's game, right now, MLB is flush with money from TV deals, so that pressure does not exist. 

According to the Baseball Reference Play Index, 140 players have hit 182 home runs through the 2015 game, but no pitcher has ever hit a home run in the All-Star Game. Now that DH is used every year, this will likely never happen. Some other ASG home run fun facts: Stan Musial has the most ASG home runs with 6. Ichiro hit an inside-the-park HR in 2007. Fred Lynn had the only grand slam in 1983. Naturally, Babe Ruth hit the first ASG home run in 1933. 

What I would do, not necessarily what will work for you, would be to practice keeping your eyes open for the single somersault, until you get comfortable with that and figure out what works for you. During your take off you should look forward and focus on one point that catches your eyes so that you know when to kick out. So I would continue to practice this until you find out what works for you during the single somersaults, and then once you have figured out how to keep your eyes open for that, I would then advance to the double somersaults and try the same technique that was used to work for the single somersault. This may take a lot of time, and may be a little frustrating at times as it sounds as you have developed performing them with closed eyes as a habit, but having opened eyes definitely makes the double much easier (at least for me).

Knowing how much vertical jumping is important in basketball, some safe plyometric workouts for 10-12 y/o kids would be to have them squat down and jump up as high as possible while reaching up with one or both hands and hit a flag or a point directly above them. Then, upon landing, immediately jump up again and attempt to reach higher. It is important to use both upper and lower body movement, to keep landings short, and to perform multiple jumps in succession. Another exercise to work on quick muscle twitching, and foot speed would be to have them run various ladder drills. Some good drills include:
