Sorry for that I have not explain the concrete meanings for those symbols in this question since it needs quite much word, these can be found in page 3 and 5. 

Why $\mathcal{C}(, \mathbb{F}(X)) \rightarrow [\mathcal{C'}](,X)$ is an isomorphism? How to get $\mathcal{C''}$ is a right rejective subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$ by $\mathcal{C'}$ a right rejective subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C''}$ a right rejctive subcategory of $\mathcal{C'}$? 

$F$ maps $A$-bimodules to $eAe$-bimodules, but why $F:A$-bimodules $\rightarrow eAe$-bimodules is also equivalent? Why $F(W)=eWe$ for any bimodules of $A$? 

I know $A$ and $B$ are derived equivalent by definition. But who can tell me how to get the $F$ such that $F(B)=T^{\bullet}$ ? Also how $F$ induces $F'$? Can we still get $F$ and $F'$ when $A$ is a general ring or algebra? 

I am reading this paper "Homological theory of idempotent ideals". It says there is a well-known observation: Let $P$ be a projective $\Lambda$-module. Then $\mathfrak{U}= \tau_P(\Lambda)$, the trace of $P$ in $\Lambda$ which is the ideal generated by the homomorphic images of $P$ in $\Lambda$, is an idempotent ideal in $\Lambda$ and one obtains all the idempotent ideals of $\Lambda$ this way. I don't know this result. Could anyone tell me some references or books about this result? Thank you. 

I am reading the paper "Derived categories and stable equivalence", the link is here:$URL$ At theorem 2.1, there is an equivalent functor $F: \mathbf{mod}-\Lambda \rightarrow D^b(mod-\Lambda)/K^b(P_{\Lambda})$ on page 308. There are some places I can't understand in its proof: 

Let $A$ be a k-algebra,where k is a fixed field. {$x_1,x_2, \cdots,x_n $} is a complete set of primitive orthogonal idempotents of $A$. $M$ is a left $A$-module such that $x_iM=0$ for $i=1,2,\cdots,n-1$. I want to know whether there exists a simple module $S$ which is a direct summand of $soc(M)$,such that its projective cover $P(S) \in add(_AAe_n)$? 

Let $A$ be a k-algebra, where k is a fixed field. Let $S$ be a simple, non-injective $A$-module such that $Ext^{i}_{A}(S,S)=0$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$. Let $P(S)$ be the projective cover of $S$, and let $Q$ be the direct sum of all non-isomorphic indecomposable projective $A$-module which are not isomorphic to $P(S)$. $\nu_A$ is the Nakayama functor. Suppose $$0 \rightarrow S \rightarrow I(S) \rightarrow I_1 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow I_n \rightarrow I_{n+1} \rightarrow \cdots$$ is a minimal injective resolution of $S$, where $I(S)$ is the injective cover of $S$. Who can help me get $I_i \in add(\nu_A(Q))$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ by $Ext^{i}_A(S,S)=0$? 

Let $A$ be an algebra over a field k. A module $_AM$ is called a generator if $\textrm{add}(A) \subseteq \textrm{add}(M)$, a cogenerator if $\textrm{add}\big(D(A)\big) \subseteq \textrm{add}(M)$. $M$ is $n$-rigid if $\textrm{Ext}_A^i(M,M)=0$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$. Now suppose $_AM$ is a generator-cogenerator which is $n$-rigid and neither projective nor injective. $\Lambda := \textrm{End}_A(M)$. If $\Lambda$ is at most $(n+m+2)$-Gorenstein, that is the injective dimension $\textrm{inj.dim}(_{\Lambda} \Lambda)=\textrm{inj.dim} (\Lambda_{\Lambda}) \leq (n+m+2)$, then for any $\Lambda$-module $N$, how to get that $\Omega^2_{\Lambda}(N) \cong \textrm{Hom}_A(M,Y)$ for some $A$-module $Y$(here, $\Omega$ is the syzygy functor)? 

Let $A$ be a finite dimensional algebra over a field K. $E$ is an injective $A$ module. $\nu=DHom_A(-,A)$ is the Nakayama functor. $add(E)$ is the full subcategory of $A$-module consisting of all direct summands of direct sum of finitely many copies of $E$. How to get that $add(E)=add(\nu(E))$ equivalent to $add(soc(E))\cong add(top(E))$? 

Let $A$ be a finite dimensional algebra over a field K. Let $M$ be an $A$-module and $0 \rightarrow I^0 \rightarrow I^1 \rightarrow \cdots$ be a minimal injective resolution of $M$. The dominant dimension of $M$, denoted by domdim$(M)$, is the largest number $t$ or $\infty$ such that $I^0, I^1, \ldots, I^{t-1}$ are projective. If $M=A$, we get the dominant dimension of $A$, domdim$(A)$. 

It says that"$M$ belongs to $\mathcal{F}(\Theta)$ if and only if $M$ has submodules $0=M_0 \subseteq M_1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq M_t=M$ such that $M_s/M_{s-1}$ is isomorphic to a module in $\Theta $"(By the definition, if $M \in \mathcal{F}(\Theta)$, there is an $A$-module N such that $M \oplus N$ has submodules $0=M'_0 \subseteq M'_1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq M'_t=M \oplus N$ and $M'_s/M'_{s-1}$ is isomorphic to a module in $\Theta $, then how to get $M$ also has submodules $0=M_0 \subseteq M_1 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq M_t=M$ such that $M_s/M_{s-1}$ is isomorphic to a module in $\Theta $?) It also defines $\mathcal{X}(\Theta)$ the full subcategory of $A$-mod of all modules which are direct summands of modules in $\mathcal{F}(\Theta)$. (By the definition, I think $\mathcal{F}(\Theta)$ has already been closed under direct summands, what is the difference between $\mathcal{X}(\Theta)$ and $\mathcal{F}(\Theta)$?) It gives an example to show $\mathcal{X}(\Theta)$ and $\mathcal{F}(\Theta)$ are not same: $A=\begin {pmatrix} k & k & k \\ 0 &k &0 \\ 0 &0& k\end {pmatrix}$,where k is a field, $\Theta(2)$ is the simple projective $A$-module, $\Theta(1)$ is its injective hull: here the indecomposable modules of length 2 belong to $\mathcal{X}(\Theta)$ but not to $\mathcal{F}(\Theta)$. (I don't know how to get the conclusion) 

If $M$ is a finitely generated $\Lambda$-module with Loewy length 2 and finite projective dimension. How to get the exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow A \rightarrow P/rad^2P \rightarrow M \rightarrow 0$$ where $P$ is the projective cover of $M$ and $A$ is semisimple?(I just know that $P/radP \cong M/radM$) Suppose that $(rad \Lambda)^3=0$, for any $\Lambda$-module $M$, $\Omega M$ is the first syzygy of $M$. Then how to get $\Omega M$ has Loewy length at most 2? 

Let $A$ be a finite dimension algebra over a field K. $B=eAe$ is Morita equivalent to $A$ for an idempotent $e \in A$. Then Morita equivalence $F$ is given by $F(M)=eM$ for any left $A$-module $M$. I have seen that "The induce equivalence from the category of $A$-bimodules to the category of $eAe$-bimodules is then given by $W \rightarrow eWe$ for any $A$-bimodule $W$." My questions are: 

I want to know if there are any relation between domdim$(A)$ and domdim$(M)$ for any $M \in mod A$. (For example, if $A$ is selfinjective, then domdim$(A)$=domdim$(M)=\infty$) We know there are algebras such that domdim$(A) \geq 2$. I want to know if there are algebras such that dom.dim$(M) \geq 2$ for any $M \in modA$. (I know selfinjetive algebras satisfy the condition, is there other examples?) 

On page 10, proposition 3.11 says that we can apply Mueller's theorem to calculate the dominant dimension of $C$, then $dom.dim(C)=inf \{ i \geq 1 | Ext^i_B(M,M) \not =0 \}+1$(It says Theorem 2.2 (4) is refered as Mueller's theorem) In the proof of Corollary 3.15 on page 11, $1 \Longrightarrow 2$, we get that $Dom_d=Gp(A)$, then it says by proposition 3.14, we get $A$ is Gorenstein with Gorenstein dimension d. But to use 3.14, we need that $dom.dim(A)=d$ and I can only get $dom.dim(A) \geq d$ by $Dom_d=proj$. So how to get $dom.dim(A)=d$ ? Another question is that by $Gp(A)=proj$, then $A$ is CM-free. Since a Gorenstein algebra is CM-free iff it has finite global dimension. But why it says the global dimension equal to the Gorenstein dimensin d? 

Let $\Gamma$ be an artin algebra. We denote by $mod \Gamma$ the category of finitely generated left $\Gamma$-modules. $D: mod \Gamma \rightarrow mod \Gamma$ is the standard duality. $I_0(\Gamma)$ is the injective envelope of $\Gamma$. Set $S= \{ X \in mod \Gamma | $ there is an exact sequence $0 \rightarrow X \rightarrow I_0 \rightarrow I_1$ with $I_0,I_1 \in add I_0(\Gamma) \}$. 

Let $A$ be an algebra. We know that $Soc M =\oplus _A Soc M_{\alpha}$ and $Rad M =\oplus _A Rad M_{\alpha}$ if $M= \oplus _A M_{\alpha}$ as $A$-modules. Now let $M,N$ be $A$-modules, $\Lambda:=End_A(N)$, whether $Soc_{\Lambda}(Hom_A(N,M)) =Hom_A(N,Soc_A(M))$ and $Rad_{\Lambda}(Hom_A(N,M)) =Hom_A(N, Rad_A(M))$ hold(here $Soc_A$ means the socle functor acts on $A$-modules, so does $Rad_A$ )? 

I am reading the paper"Dominant dimensions, derived quivalences and tilting modules", the link is here:$URL$ On page 22,Lemma 4.2 says that let M and N be A-modules, if $N \in add(_A A)$, then the functor $Hom_A(-,T)$ induces an isomorphism of abelian groups: $Hom_A(M,N) \cong Hom_{B^{op}}(Hom_A(N,T),Hom_A(M,T))$. Here T is a tilting A-module, and $B :=End_A(T)$. In its proof, it says"We use the fact that $_AA$ has an $add(_AT)$-copresentation, that is, there is an exact sequence $0 \rightarrow A \rightarrow T_0 \rightarrow T_1$ of A-modules with $T_0,T_1 \in add(_AT)$ such that the sequence $Hom_A(T_1,T) \rightarrow Hom_A(T_0,T) \rightarrow Hom_A(A,T) \rightarrow 0$ is still exact." So I want to ask: 

I am reading this paper strongly primitiv species with potentials I : mutations. In page 6, they give the definition of weighted quiver: a weighted quiver is a pair $(Q,d)$, where $Q$ is a loop-free quiver and $d=(d_i)_{i \in Q_0}$ is a tuple that assigns a positive integer $d_i$ to each vertex $i$ of $Q$. They also give the morphisms between the corresponding path algebras. But I have not found the definition of morphisms between weighted quivers, or automorphisms of weighted quivers. Is there any references or works that give a definition of automorphisms of weighted quiver? Thank you for any help. 

The following are my questionsï¼š 1) Is there any relation between $Morita$ $equivalent$ and $derived$ $equivalent$? (I think $A$ and $B$ are $Morita$ $equivalent$ can induces $A$ and $B$ are $derived$ $equivalent$. Is it right? Conversely, if $A$ and $B$ are $derived$ $equivalent$, when $A$ and $B$ are $Morita$ $equivalent$?) 2) If $A$ and $B$ are $Morita$ $equivalent$, someone tells me that the dominant dimensions of $A$ and $B$ are also equal. But I don't know the reason. Who can tell me? Thank you for any help. 

Let $R,S$ be two K algebras, where K is a fixed field. Then we can get a new algebra $R \otimes S$, i.e. the tensor product of these two algebras. Suppose the following sequence $$0 \rightarrow R\otimes S \rightarrow X_1 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow X_n$$ is an exact sequence of $(R \otimes S)$-projective-injective modules $X_i$. My question is that how to prove these $X_i$ are projective and injective in $R$-modules and $S$-modules, repsectively? 

Let $A$ be a k-algebra, where k is a fixed field. Let $S$ be a simple, non-injective $A$-module such that $Ext^{i}_{A}(S,S)=0$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$. Let $P(S)$ be the projective cover of $S$, and let $Q$ be the direct sum of all non-isomorphic indecomposable projective $A$-module which are not isomorphic to $P(S)$. $\nu_A$ is the Nakayama functor. Suppose $$0 \rightarrow S \rightarrow I(S) \rightarrow I_1 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow I_n \rightarrow I_{n+1} \rightarrow \cdots$$ is a minimal injective resolution of $S$, where $I(S)$ is the injective cover of $S$. Let $T':= \tau^{-1} \Omega_A ^{-n+1}(S)$, where $\tau^{-1}:=TrD$ is the Auslander-Reiten inverse translation. $\Omega^{-1}$ is the cosyzygy operator. Who can tell me why $T'$ doesn't have projetive direct summand? 

I am reading this paper finiteness of representation dimension, on page 1012 there is a place I don't understand: 

Why $_AA$ has an $add(_AT)$-copresentation? How to use this fact get the isomorphism $Hom_A(M,N) \cong Hom_{B^{op}}(Hom_A(N,T),Hom_A(M,T))$? Thank you. 

I am reading the paper "Gendo-symmetric algebras, dominant dimensions and Gorenstein homological algebra", the link is here: $URL$ There are some places I can't understand: 

To show $F$ is full, it says "since F' is clearly full, and that for no non-zero object $X$ of $\mathbf{mod}-\Lambda$ is $FX \cong0$,since no non-projetive $\Lambda$-module is isomorphic in the derived category to an object of $K^b(P_{\Lambda})$". But if $M \in \Lambda-mod$ has a finite projective resolution $P^{\bullet}$, we can get $M \cong P^{\bullet}$ in $D^b(mod- \Lambda)$, so why no non-projetive $\Lambda$-module is isomorphic in the derived category to an object of $K^b(P_{\Lambda})$? To show $F$ is faithful, it says "then the mapping cone of $\beta$ is sent to zero by $F$, so $\beta$ is an isomorphism, so $Y \rightarrow Z$ is a split monomorphism and $\alpha$ is zero", I can't understand this, who can explain it more specific? On page 309, it say "the natural map from $P^*$ to $\overline{P^*}$ is an isomorphism in $D^b(mod-\Lambda)/K^b(P_{\Lambda})$" I know a map $\alpha$ is an isomorphism in the homotopy category $K(A)$ iff it's mapping cone is 0. Is it still hold in $D^b(mod-\Lambda)/K^b(P_{\Lambda})$? Still on page 309, it says "there is a complex $$Q^*= \cdots \rightarrow P^{r-1} \rightarrow P^r \rightarrow Q^{r+1} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow 0$$ which is the projective resolution of some module $M$", so I want to ask how to make sure there must be a module whose projective resolution is the form $\cdots \rightarrow P^{r-1} \rightarrow P^{r} \rightarrow \cdots$?
