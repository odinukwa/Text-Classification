Jupiter's atmosphere is mostly Hydrogen, lying over liquid Hydrogen, on top of metallic Hydrogen, and finally at the center a large rocky core. As you remove the hydrogen atmosphere the liquid would turn to gas, metallic to liquid, and on and on until all the hydrogen were gone and you have a massive core left approximately 12 to 45 times the mass of Earth. (Not much is known about the core.) So if you had only the rocky core, cooled down from it's current temperature of 36,000K, and added a nitrogen/oxygen Earth like atmosphere, you could see the bottom in an Earth like way. It would not be a dim star, though it would glow very hot until it cooled, and also the planet would hold together. 

Science advances through observation, hypothesis, experimentation/prediction, analysis of data, and comparing the hypothesis with the observed data. If the data continues to support one theory over another, through peer reviewed publications, then it will become the currently accepted theory of how something works. I happen to think there are issues with the theory of dark matter and find MOND, Modified Newtownian Dynamics, to be far more likely to be the reason we have 'missing matter' in the universe. But it does not explain all missing matter and phenomenon and so as scientists we should wait until the data supports our 'theory' and not assume others are misguided and wasting time, money, etc. 

You can see for yourself for any date and location using the free Stellarium program ($URL$ The constellation that the Sun is in as seen from Earth does not depend noticeably on the precise location of the observer on Earth. It depends mostly on the time of year. Here are the approximate days of the year at which the Sun enters a new constellation: 

Venus has volcanism and weather, and those can cover or erode craters. There are relatively few impact craters on Venus today, indicating that the surface of Venus is at most 600 million years old -- meaning that any older surface features have been erased. The Earth's surface is even younger. During the Late Heavy Bombardment, in the very early history of the Solar System, there was a period of time when many asteroids hit the Moon, creating many large impact craters. It seems likely that the Earth and Venus got hit by many asteroids then, too. Yet, no evidence of these craters is visible on Earth or Venus today. So, if Venus had a moon and that moon crashed into Venus thousands of millions of years ago, then the impact crater would likely have been erased by now. And if Venus got hit by a sufficiently large object, then the energy of the impact might melt the entire surface of Venus, so that no lasting crater can form. So, absence of very big craters from Venus is not evidence that Venus never had big moons. 

A planet and moon both habitable seems feasible to me, given the planet's orbit is in the stars 'goldilocks' orbital region. As an example, if an Earth/moon system were recreated except larger. So the Earth moon system was created early in our solar system by a large Mars sized collision with early Earth. We ended up with a rare larger than normal moon, compared to Earth, 1/6th the size. Looking at the other planets, no other moon comes close to being this big compared to the planet. Anyway, if instead of a collision creating two bodies the size of the Earth and moon you increased both masses by 2.5, you could end up with an Earth 2.5 times the size of ours, likely the edge of feasible, and a moon the size of Mars, also the edge of feasible. So yes both could sustain life, imo, assuming other conditions are met. (Water, organics, solar output, magnetic fields, etc.) On the 1:1 resonant moons, I'd have to agree with the previous comment, very unlikely to be stable. Now if you want an advanced civilization to create an artificial one, that could work. Or use a very large Jupiter to have a couple of habitable planets in orbit and maybe even habitable planets at L3 and L4 (Lagrange points), though I am unsure of their stability too I don't think it's be too big a stretch. (Jupiter's Lagrange asteroids are called Trojans and appear stable but none are particularly big.) 

Sugar Grove Station was an outpost designed to listen in on Soviet radio signals reflected off the moon. How would this work? Wouldn't the radio signals be distorted by the imperfect surface of the moon? And wouldn't they also be extremely weak since they wouldn't be beamed directly at the moon? 

The expansion of space is something that happens on the largest scales. At small scales, such as distances between nearby galaxies, other forces, such as gravity, dominate. Galaxy clusters are held together by the attractive force of gravity between these galaxies. Space in these regions is still expanding, but the gravity pulls on these galaxies much more than space's expansion moves them apart. Galaxies that are close enough together, such as the Milky Way and Andromeda, are pulled together by the force of gravity between them. 

We can use Newton's law of gravity to calculate the force the Earth feels from the moon: $$ F_g = \frac{GM_{Earth}M_{Moon}}{r^2} $$ Where G is the universal gravitational constant, $6.62*10^{-11}$ $m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$, $M_{Earth}$ and $M_{Moon}$ are the masses of the Earth and Moon in kilograms, and $r$ is the distance between their center s in meters. We can rearrange this equation to solve for a distance like so: $$ r = \sqrt{\frac{GM_{Earth}M_{Moon}}{F_g}} $$ Now we can input any force we like to see how far away the Moon would have to be in order for us to feel that force. If we want the force of gravity to go to zero, we can take the limit as $F_g\rightarrow 0$. When we do this, we see that for the Earth to feel zero gravitational force from the Moon, it would have to be infinitely far away. However, infinity is not a very useful number; why don't we look for something a little more practical? Let's say that we want the Earth to feel exactly 0.01 Newton of gravitational force from the Moon. That's about the weight of 1 gram of matter at the Earth's surface. In that case, we will have $r=5.411*10^{19}$ meters or $3.4*10^{14}$ miles, about $1.4*10^{11}$ times further away. Keep in mind, though, that this is still not zero force. It's small enough that we probably wouldn't be able to detect it, but it is nonzero. 

The "approximate" part is that the Sun may be up to one day earlier or later than the quoted dates, just like the start of the seasons may be one day earlier or later than the average. (Actually, it is the calendar that is early or late with respect to the phenomenon.) Also, because of the precession of the equinoxes, these dates shift by about 1 day every 70 years. See $URL$ 

Based on the math in the Wikipedia article about the Airy Disk: The intensity of the starlight as a function of angular distance $\theta$ from the center is reasonably approximated by a Gaussian $$ I(\theta) = I_0 \exp(-\theta^2/(2\sigma^2)) $$ where $\sigma$ is a measure for the width of the intensity profile, which for an ideal optical system and diffraction-limited images is $$ \sigma \approx 0.42 \lambda N $$ (where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $N$ is the f-number) and which is independent of the peak intensity $I_0$. For a non-ideal or not-diffraction-limited system, the Gaussian should still provide a reasonable approximation, but then $\sigma$ is (much) larger than for the ideal system. The apparent edge of a star in an image occurs where the intensity $I(\theta)$ drops below a certain minimum $I_\text{limit}$, which (from the first equation) corresponds to an angular distance $$ \theta_\text{edge} = \sigma\sqrt{2\log(I_0/I_\text{limit})}$$ We can rewrite this in terms of visual magnitude $V$. For fixed $\sigma$, $I_0$ is a measure for the brightness of the star. Brightness is related to magnitude $V$ through $$ V = -2.5 \log_{10}(I/I_\text{ref}) $$ (with $I_\text{ref}$ the reference intensity for the magnitude scale) so $$\log(I_0/I_\text{limit}) = 0.4 \log(10) (V_\text{limit} - V_0)$$ and \begin{eqnarray} \theta_\text{edge} & = & \sigma \sqrt{0.8 \log(10) (V_\text{limit} - V_0)} \approx 1.36 \sigma \sqrt{V_\text{limit} - V_0} \\ V_\text{limit} - V_0 & = & \frac{\theta_\text{edge}^2}{0.8 \log(10) \sigma^2} \approx 0.543 \left( \frac{\theta_\text{edge}}{\sigma} \right)^2 \end{eqnarray} So, the difference between the limiting magnitude and the star's magnitude is proportional to the apparent angular area of the star in the image. 

The Trappist-1 planets all orbit very close to each other. During NASA's press release, they mentioned that these planets are close enough to disturb each others orbits. Is this system stable over a long time scale? Or could we perhaps just have imaged this system before one or more planets is ejected or destroyed? Later into the press conference, one of the scientists says "these planets should have formed further out and migrated inwards". Could they possibly still be moving inwards, or are their orbits now stable? 

Study as much physics and mathematics as possible. Astronomy is essentially a branch of physics. If you're still in school, then take classes in these areas. If you're not in school anymore, then there are plenty of online resources to continue your education. This will allow you to understand what people are talking about when they discuss technical things. Decide what exactly you're interested in. There are lots of different areas of study within astronomy. Decide what appeals to you the most. Do you like planets? Galaxies? Cosmology? All of these different focuses require more specialized knowledge. Your skills are already marketable. Being an astronomer can mean lots of different things. There are some astronomers who hardly ever look through telescopes, and spend most of their time reducing data. A large part of astronomy is computer programming. As a software engineer, you may already have the skills you need to work with astronomy research. Keep an open mind. There are lots of jobs in astronomy research where you might not be called an "astronomer". For example, as a software engineer, you could find work with NASA supporting space research. Your job title might not be "Astronomer", but you'll still be in the field. Be prepared for hard work. Being an astronomer can be difficult, not just because of the subject matter, but also because of the effort you have to put in to get a job. It can be relatively difficult to find an employer looking for people with your particular skillset. My recommendation would be to keep an eye on the NASA Jobs website to see when they're hiring. You can also search for internships on NASA's OSSI site. Try some amateur astronomy. There are lots of ways you can get involved in astronomy without having it as a job. A quick Google search for "Amateur astronomy projects" yields many different results. Join a local astronomy group. If you live in a reasonably sized city, there should be an astronomy group near you. Find them and join them. Don't give up! Having astronomy as a profession can be difficult, but it is also rewarding. If you truly want to do this, you'll need to work at it. Just don't give up! 

You are free to pick your reference point any way you want. You could pick a $\text{HJD}$ at which the star is brightest, or dimmest, or exactly average, or you could pick the $\text{HJD}$ of the first observation, or you could even set $T_0 = 0$. If two people pick different $T_0$, then the phases they find differ by a constant value (modulo 1). It is convenient to set $T_0$ at or before the smallest $\text{HJD}$ in your observations, so that all $\text{HJD} - \text{T_0}$ are nonnegative, because the $\text{INT}$-like functions provided by calculators, computer languages, and software libraries don't all round negative numbers in the same direction. Many round all numbers towards zero, so that $+3.4$ yields $+3$ (as we want) and $-3.4$ yields $-3$, but here we want $-3.4$ to yield $-4$, otherwise you get negative phases before $T_0$ and positive phases after $T_0$. If your observations of brightness are evenly spaced in time, then you can use a Fast Fourier Transform to find the approximate period and phase. 

We can calculate the distance we need to be from an object in order for it to be any arbitrary angular size using the formula $D=\frac{d}{2\tan(\frac12\delta)}$. In this case, $D$ is the distance from the object, $d$ is its diameter, and $\delta$ is the angular size. The Milky Way's diameter is 100,000 light years. If we want the Milky Way to appear as large as the Sun appears from the Earth (0.5$^\circ$), we would need to be 5700,000 light years away. If we want it to appear much larger, we could be closer. For the Milky Way to be the size of a 1 meter circle held at arm's length (90$^\circ$), we would need to be 50,000 light years away. 

There are actually several components of tidal forces which serve to distort a planet or moon - diurnal, nonsynchronous rotation, ice-shell thickening, orbit obliquity, and polar wander. A moon could be stressed by any combination of these mechanisms, leading to frictional forces and heating.
