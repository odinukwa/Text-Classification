Before gravity was conceived as a physical phenomenon and studied by Isaac Newton, gravity was not microfounded. So before Newton, modelling the real world should assume away gravity, because it was not microfounded. We should instead create models into which humans could walk on air. When a phenomenon appears stable, while attempting to understand and decipher it (to micro-found it), we should be wise enough to accept its existence and include it in our models, of course in an "ad hoc" manner since we haven't decipher it yet. Whether firms "cannot" or "choose optimally not to" change their prices everyday, makes little difference, as long as we haven't settled on the optimization framework into which such an optimal choice could come about. It makes little difference because in the absence of knowledge it can be seen as a semantic issue: I can re-interpret "cannot" as "an optimizing agent cannot do what is suboptimal -it goes against every inch of its existence". Nevertheless, bashing for micro-foundations of an observed regularity (and it is a prevailing observed regularity across time, space, cultures and economic systems that firms don't changes their prices continually), is a good thing, in that it keeps up the pressure to finally find those microfoundations. I just hope the bashers don't argue in addition, that in the meantime, we should only be modelling people as walking also on air -sorry, be modelling firms only as being able to change their prices continually. And to send the ball back, I have never seen in my life any convincing "micro-foundation argument" for the assumption that prices are perfectly elastic. 

Applying the Law of Iterated Expectations on the defining property of a sub-martingale $E(X_{t+1}|X_1,\dots,X_t）\ge X_t$ we have that $$E\Big[E(X_{t+1}|X_1,\dots,X_t)\Big]=E(X_{t+1}) \geq E(X_t)$$ So a sub-martingale has also its unconditional expected value non-decreasing. Therefore any economic variable that appears to consistently increase in value is a candidate for being a sub-martingale, since the defining property here conditions only on the variable's past, not on any other factors that may influence it. National Output/GDP could be reasonably modeled as a sub-martingale, since it historically "always" increases, bar catastrophic events. In general, any economic variable that can be modeled as a random walk with non-negative drift, $$X_{t+1} = \alpha + X_{t} + u_t,\;\; \alpha \geq 0$$ is a sub-martingale. 

Here are three: Klenow, P., & Rodriguez-Clare, A. (1997). The neoclassical revival in growth economics: Has it gone too far?. In NBER Macroeconomics Annual 1997, Volume 12 (pp. 73-114). MIT Press. Klenow, P. J., & Rodriguez-Clare,A. (1997). Economic growth: A review essay. Journal of monetary economics, 40(3), 597-617. They pose certain conceptual issues as regards entangled causalities (in the economics' sense, not in the econometrics' sense). All are freely downloadable. Bernanke, B. S., & Gürkaynak, R. S. (2002). Is growth exogenous? taking Mankiw, Romer, and Weil seriously. In NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2001, Volume 16 (pp. 11-72). MIT Press. This paper argues that one of the most important implications of any Solow framework is that long-run growth depends only on exogenous technological progress, and that MRW do not test in the right way this implication (the authors do it their way and reject this implication). But I don't think you will find papers with deep statistical-econometric testing/validation of the model. 

It does. Assume a bond without coupons, to be fully re-paid in a single payment. On it ("face value" $\equiv B$) the bond writes the amount to be paid, as well as the date of payment. In such a situation, the "face value" includes both the principal amount and the interest. But the bond will be transformed to cash in say, one year's time. Then the "present value" of the bond is $${\rm PV} = \frac {B}{1+r}$$ where $r$ does not equal the contractual yearly interest rate of the bond, but an interest rate that reflects current market conditions and expectations, as well as the current assessment of the solvency of the debtor at payment time. Of course both "face value" and "present value" are very general terms, used in a variety of situations, in which their meaning is similar but not identical to the above described. 

In the course of my research I have been examining these days macroeconomic time series for per capital household consumption, using the databank of the WorldBank. The unit of measure was constant 2005 USD. I got all shorts: smooth upward trends indicating a steadily increasing material well being on average; series with wild swings indicating socioeconomic turmoil, civil wars, coup d'eta's etc; series with an obvious structural shock in the level which then continued to grow at the same rate (for example Finland experienced such a shock when the Soviet Union collapsed); series suspiciously smoothly increasing, too smoothly to be believable and so suspect of being fake... Unique among them, was Madagascar: its per capita consumption exhibited a steady downward trend for the period 1971-1996, although after that period the trend seems to (gradually) flatten out. Here is the plot: 

Both another answer and the OP have linked to the wikipedia article on the matter. I think the following passage from the article sums adequately the situation (bold mine): 

Following Caputo, an Optimal Control problem is autonomous when none of the functions appearing in the description of the problem depends explicitly on the time-variable. But this means that the standard setup with an exogenous utility-discount factor is not autonomous, but it can be made so by redefining the multiplier(s) and then using the current-value Hamiltonian. @ramazan approach starts correctly, by breaking the discount factor and including the naughty part in the instantaneous objective function. Nothing forbids the state variable to appear in the instantaneous objective function, on the contrary, the general theoretical treatment always includes it. Denoting $y_t = \int_{0}^{t}h\left(k_{s}\right)ds$, your problem now becomes $$\underset{\left\{ c_{t}\right\} }{\max}\int_{t=0}^{\infty}\left[u\left(c_{t}\right)e^{-y_t}\right]e^{-\rho t}dt$$ $$\dot{k_{t}}=f\left(k_{t}\right)-c_{t}$$ with current value Hamiltonian $$\mathcal{H}^{current}=u\left(c_t\right)e^{-y_t} +\lambda_t\left[f\left(k_t\right)-c_t\right]$$ While taking the derivative with respect to consumption presents no issues, the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to capital needs some care (and this is why I kept the $t$-index in the Hamiltonian). If $G$ is the antiderivative of $h$, then $y_t = G(k_t) - G(k_0)$. I guess the rest are easy for you, although of course the first-order conditions will be more complicated. 

What "seasonally unemployed" means? First, to be "unemployed", one must actively be seeking for work, as the OP stated. The adjective "seasonally" here would reflect the fact that Julie is looking for a seasonal job, and couldn't find any. But this information is not provided to us. Irrespective of her past employment, Julie may have been looking for a permanent job, in which case she should not be categorized as "seasonally unemployed". 

It should always be counted that way. When we decide to look at a whole Industry, we treat it as a "single economic entity". Then to arrive at the Industry's total profit, we naturally add all sales revenues from all participating companies, and subtract all expenses from all participating companies, as though it was one company: $$\pi_I = R_1 + ...+R_n - E_1 - ...-E_n = (R_1-E_1) + ...+(R_n-E_n) = \pi_1 +...+\pi_n$$ where some of the $\pi$'s may be negative, i.e losses. This is the logical thing to do because we ask "how much sales revenue did the Industry had, and how much expenses"? 

My (unverified) impression is that the Search Unemployment paradigm won over both Efficiency Wages and Implicit Contracts (the third alternative approach to study this so "politically hot" market), because Search models can more easily be quantified and tested, relying less on unobservables. The Nobel prize to Diamond, Mortensen & Pissarides certainly widened its acceptance, credibility, and increased its momentum. Nevertheless, scholarly activity in the field of Efficiency wages seems not to have stopped. A noisy indicator: data from Google scholar now(Nov-22, 2014), search item "efficiency wage" (in quotes), don't include patents, don't include citations.

By Roy's Identity we have that Marshallian (uncompensated) demand for good $x_i$ is $$x_i^M = \frac {\partial U^*/\partial p_i}{\partial U^*/\partial B} \tag{1}$$ where $U^*$ is optimized utility over goods vector $\mathbf x = (x_1,...,x_i,...x_n)$ and $B$, which is the available budget, and given the price vector $\mathbf p = (p_1,...,p_i,...,p_n)$. To obtain a constant elasticity demand function we require $$\eta \equiv \frac {\partial x_i^M}{\partial p_i}\cdot \frac{p_i} {x_i^M}=const. \tag{2}$$ Using $(1)$ we have that $$\frac {\partial x_i^M}{\partial p_i} = \frac {(\partial^2 U^*/\partial p^2_i)\cdot(\partial U^*/\partial B) -(\partial^2 U^*/\partial B^2)\cdot (\partial U^*/\partial p_i)}{\big[\partial U^*/\partial B\big]^2} \tag{3}$$ Inserting $(3)$ and $(1)$ into $(2)$ we have $$\eta \equiv \frac {(\partial^2 U^*/\partial p^2_i)\cdot(\partial U^*/\partial B) -(\partial^2 U^*/\partial B^2)\cdot (\partial U^*/\partial p_i)}{\big[\partial U^*/\partial B\big]^2}\cdot \frac{p_i} {\frac {\partial U^*/\partial p_i}{\partial U^*/\partial B}}$$ $$= \frac {(\partial^2 U^*/\partial p^2_i)\cdot(\partial U^*/\partial B) -(\partial^2 U^*/\partial B^2)\cdot (\partial U^*/\partial p_i)}{(\partial U^*/\partial B)\cdot (\partial U^*/\partial p_i)} \cdot p_i$$ $$\implies \eta = p_i\left(\frac {\partial^2 U^*/\partial p^2_i}{ \partial U^*/\partial p_i}- \frac{\partial^2 U^*/\partial B^2}{\partial U^*/\partial B}\right) \tag{4}$$ For this expression to be constant over the whole range of $p_i$ we need that $$\left(\frac {\partial^2 U^*/\partial p^2_i}{ \partial U^*/\partial p_i}- \frac{\partial^2 U^*/\partial B^2}{\partial U^*/\partial B}\right) = \frac {C}{p_i} \tag{5}$$ for some constant $C$, which becomes the constant value of the price elasticity of demand. That's the general condition that must be satisfied. You could check whether the generalized Cobb-Douglas standard Utility function specification $$U(\mathbf x) = \prod_{i=1}^n x_i^{a_i}$$ satisfies the condition, perhaps under some restrictions. THE CASE OF QUASI-LINEAR UTILITY FUNCTION The OP ponders the case of a quasi-linear utility function, so let's solve this forward. We have $$\max_{x,m} [cx^{\theta} +m],;\;\;\; s.t. \;\;\;p_xx + m = B,\;\;\; 0<\theta <1,\;\; c>0$$ where $m$ is residual income for all other goods. The Lagrangean is $$\Lambda = cx^{\theta} +m + \lambda[B-p_xx - m]$$ and first order conditions are $$c\theta x^{\theta-1}=\lambda p_x,\\\;\;\; \lambda =1$$ So $$x^* = \left(\frac {c\theta}{p_x}\right)^{1/(1-\theta)},\;\;\; m^* = B-p_xx^*$$ So the indirect utility function is $$U^* = c\left(\frac {c\theta}{p_x}\right)^{\theta/(1-\theta)} + B-p_x\left(\frac {c\theta}{p_x}\right)^{1/(1-\theta)}$$ $$= \left[c(c\theta)^{\theta/(1-\theta)} - (c\theta)^{1/(1-\theta)}\right] \cdot \frac {1}{p_x^{\theta/(1-\theta)}} + B$$ One can easily verify that this indirect utility function satisfies the required condition $(5)$ for isoelastic demand, and also see how the preference parameters map to the demand parameters. 

A pair of random variables $(Y,X)$ that has a joint bivariate distribution that belongs to the Elliptical Symmetric Family and to the Pearson Family (they overlap), have the property that the associated conditional expectation functions (of $Y$ given $X$ but also of $X$ given $Y$) are linear (more generally, affine) functions. Examples include the Normal distribution and Student's $t$-distribution. Other bivariate distributions that have affine conditional expectation functions are the Pareto, Beta, Gamma, F-, Binomial, Poisson, and Negative Binomial. 

I like this question because it provides an opportunity to showcase how one can use the simplest of mathematical analysis, full of simplifying assumptions, and still get something useful/applicable. So let's call "advanced" and "basic" the two versions of the software. Each customer buys one unit of the one or the other. Let's assume/approximate the demand function as linear and let's assume away cross-price and competition effects. Assuming linearity is acceptable as a local approximation. Assuming no competition effects is to assume either that the software is seriously differentiated from the competition, or that we examine the case with competition's prices fixed. The worst assumption is the one assuming away intra-cross-price effects: we do expect that if we raise the price of the Advanced version, potential customers may turn to look to the Basic version (and, possibly, but less strongly, vice versa). Anyway, with these assumptions we have the demand functions $$Q_A = a_A - b_AP_A,\;\;\; Q_B = a_B - b_BP_B$$ and the Revenue function $$TR = P_A\cdot Q_A + P_B\cdot Q_B = a_AP_A - b_AP_A^2 + a_BP_B- b_BP_B^2$$ Interpretation of the coefficients comes later. Maximizing this function with respect to the two prices is straightforward, and one gets $$P_A^* = \frac {a_A}{2b_A},\;\;\; P_B^* = \frac {a_B}{2b_B}$$ Then optimal revenue share for the Advanced version can be shown to be $$S_A^* = \frac {a_A^2}{a_A^2 + (b_A/b_B)a_B^2}$$ Now, $a_A$ is the maximum number of customers that we would have if we gave the Advanced version for free, and likewise for $a_B$. These quantities are routinely estimated/assessed by businesses. The beta coefficients are trickier, because they reflect the marginal loss of customers as we increase the price by one currency unit. But again, a business can and does make educated guesses on this matter also (perhaps considering bigger increases than one unit), based on past experience, and knowledge of the market and the potential customers. So we see that the abstract and simplistic $S_A^*$ can be applied to an actual situation, and of course we can form some intervals by saying "$a_A$ is from... to..." etc. and so get a sense of where the optimal customer mix may lie. The first step to make this a bit more realistic is to include an asymmetric intra-cross-price effect: namely, if we increase the price of the Advanced version, potential customers may turn to the Basic version, but if we increase the price of the Basic version we lose potential customers to the competition. In this case the demand function of the Advanced version remains as before, but the demand function of the Basic version becomes $$Q_B = a_B - b_BP_B + c_BP_A$$ It is a bit more complicated but the final expressions are still workable. One of course would here have to assess the magnitude of $c_B$ also. 

To complement @Ubiquitous answer, whether employers have monopsonistic power or not in the labor market is still something that is questioned in various corners of the Economics discipline. The simple observation made in a comment, that in the labor market, most of the suppliers (workers) have an urgent and immediate need to sell, to a degree higher than a firm has in selling its products, I believe goes a long way in rationalizing why the labor market is "special". A stimulating book focusing on the issue of monopsony power of employers in the labor market is "Monopsony in Motion: Imperfect Competition in Labor Markets" (2005) by Alan Manning. A review critical of the book can be found here. 

I am posting this as an answer, because it continues on user @ivansml answer... which is the one that identified the catch here, a catch I naively have overlooked (although it is a narrow case, while the interesting par comes after. Nevertheless, it should have been dealt with). Indeed, with exogenous wage rate, and perfectly competitive optimization on labor demand, the marginal product of capital is determined only by the parameters of the model and by the wage rate. For the simple case where we assume that the wage rate is constant the analysis of @ivansml holds: the model becomes one of endogenous growth: the marginal product of capital is constant, which is what is needed for endogenous growth, where there is no steady state in levels. Denoting $\hat c = \dot c/c$ and $\hat k = \dot k /k$ , equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ of the OP can be written $$\hat c = f_k-\delta -\rho \tag{1b}$$ $$\hat k = f_k - \delta - c/k \tag{2b}$$ Since $f_k$ is constant, the growth rate of consumption is constant - zero, positive, or negative, depending on the parameters and the wage. On the other hand differentiating $(2b)$ with respect to time we get $$\dot {\hat k} = (\hat k - \hat c)\cdot (c/k)$$ and it is obvious that for steady-state growth we want $\hat k = \hat c$, which, from $(2b)$ is obtained only if $c = \rho k$. It is easy to verify that, since $\lambda(t) = c(t)$, the only way that the transversality condition will hold, is if consumption and capital grow, or shrink, at the same rate (or stay constant). In endogenous growth models proper where we examine the whole economy, we just assume that the parameters of the model are such that there is a positive growth rate, because this is what we observe in the real world. But here, we have just one individual. So, what we may be telling our businessman? If $f_k-\delta -\rho >0$, the growth rate is positive, and both his consumption and capital should grow "forever", maintaining a constant ratio. If $f_k-\delta -\rho =0$, the growth rate is zero, and both variable stay forever constant. If $f_k-\delta -\rho <0$, the growth rate is negative, and we should enter into a downward spiral of diminishing consumption and capital (always maintaining the relation $c= \rho k$). This, has some intuition, validating the appropriateness of Optimal Control application: given the other parameters and the wage rate, the larger the "impatience" (the larger $\rho$ is) the more possible becomes that the individual will experience diminishing consumption levels, since the future, and hence investment, are not much to his liking. Of course, a monotonic downward spiral may not sound very realistic as a solution -but this is a very stylized model, providing essentially general tendencies in a necessarily highly formal mathematical language. The really interesting part will start if we consider a variable wage. This can create all sorts of interesting and complicated dynamics for our little businessman and his consumption-investment decisions.
