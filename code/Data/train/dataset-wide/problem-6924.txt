A problem with using energy service prices is that they might reflect competition conditions (e.g. monopoly/oligopoly, or the big six in the UK) rather than the true cost of energy to firms. A problem with using energy prices is that they might reflect demand and supply issues. For example, no one would say that the drop in oil prices from 140 to 50 was due to technological improvement. Instead, it was driven by a shale oil revolution, and perhaps geopolitical aspects. 

A paper just out of the oven provides a very comprehensive analysis of market power in the US for more than 50 years, using mark-up data from three different sources. The key graphs below: 

Therefore, the PPP converts local money into US dollar equivalent, for a given year. This means that a person living in the US could get an more or less precise idea of how poor a person living under the poverty line is by comparing their own incomes and prices to those of the poverty line (adjusting the line by inflation based on current year). You can read more about the PPP and its use for the international poverty line here. 

This data is here. Disaggregation by company and market is here. ADEFA does not provide data on profits thought. As you can see from the latter link, all companies are multinationals with subsidiaries in Argentina (e.g. Toyota Argentina S.A. where "S.A." stands for Sociedad An√≥nima, meaning PLC). As such, they provide annual statements to the local tax authorities, including profits. They should also publish annual reports to their investors (e.g. Toyota 2014 here; see profits in page 8). And official government organisations also make these statement public (e.g. here). In other words, all the data must be available online. You just need to google something like "name of company memoria anual 20XX", where memoria anual stands for annual financial report, for year 20XX. Whether the data is systematically available free of charge, I doubt it. Normally consultancy companies, investment banks and other financial firms produce compilations and analysis of this data for their clients (know this from first hand, when worked at Deutsche Bank). Unless you have access to one of those, you will have to compile the data yourself. At least there are just a few car companies, so this should not take you long. PS: beware of over/under reported utilities due to transfer pricing though. 

This is perfectly possible. To see this, assume a continuum of workers, with index $i$, where $\eta_{i}$ denotes the ability of worker $i$. The distribution of ability in this population is given by $G(\eta)$. Since the market is competitive, we can forget about firms, and solve the problem from the social planner perspective (because of the 1st welfare theorem). For simplicity, assume that labour is the only factor of production. All workers supply the same number of hours. Furthermore, assume that workers' production is given by the sum of their individual contributions, times a technology level parameters, $A$. So, if there are only two workers, with ability $\eta_{a}$ and $\eta_{b}$ respectively, total output is given by $A(\eta_{a}+\eta_{b})$. In the general case, total output is given by: $$Y = A \int_{i \in L}^{}\eta_i\,\mathrm{d}i$$ (Notice that, for simplicity, this production function assumes constant returns to scale) Now, let's postulate the hypothesis that workers are paid proportionally to their marginal product. It is clear that this is equivalent to $\eta_{i}$, as not having this worker reduces output by that amount (notice the importance of the assumption of output as the sum of workers' ability). If the wage per unit of ability is $\omega$, then the real wage of worker $i$ is $$w(i) = \omega\eta_{i}$$ Now, under perfect competition (and without capital), all product is paid to workers. This is, $$Y = \int_{i \in L}^{}w(i)\,\mathrm{d}i$$ Replacing the definition of wages and rearranging leads to: $$Y = \omega\int_{i \in L}^{}\eta_{i}\,\mathrm{d}i$$ Given the production function assumed, this implies: $$A=\omega$$ Given our assumption of constant returns to scale, this is of course reasonable. The wage per unit of ability must be equal to the technology level (as it is in the case of $Y=AL$). This completes the proof. Notice the above result is true, irrespective of which is the distribution of ability. Notice further that equal ability ($\eta_{i}=\eta$) means $w(i)=w$, which brings us back to the Econ 101 labour market. 

The reference is World Bank (2006). You can see the detail of the methodology in Appendix 1, and their estimates of intangible wealth in Appendix 2. There are other methodologies to measure intangible wealth (e.g. here and here). Alternatively, there are many ways to compute natural and physical capital, which will give different results to the one given by the WB, even if using the same formula to compute intangible capital. For example, see here. If you search in google or here things like "measuring capital stock", you get tons of hits too. I think that because this is a relatively new research area, there is no "official" guideline about how to measure intangible wealth. Maybe in the future some sort of standard will be produces, pretty much like the standard for GDP came to be (which is still subject to criticism anyway). 

This evidence gives a rather counterintuitive result (at least from the normative meaning of the words), which is that a rentier capitalism might be better for investment and growth than an investment captialism. 

You need to use in the options to get the spatial Durbin model. To get the dynamic version of the model, add to the options. 

Interesting question. In effect, while factor shares were thought to have remained fairly stable over a long time (the first of the Kaldor's facts), more recently they have varied, particularly in the direction of a fall in the labour share. This short paper from (2012) shows that under such scenario, a growth accounting exercise which assumes constant factor shares leads to inconsistent results. The abstract reads: 

Updating of the base year is an indication of methodological changes in the way the national accounts are measured. This means two series with different base year (or reference year, as others call it) are strictly speaking not comparable over time. Here is the official document from the Central Statistics Office informing about the changes. As the document states: 

So, you are concerned about "the time to produce output". Well, think of $b$ as an indication of how much time you can spend to produce a given amount of output with a fixed amount of labour. As I indicate above, variations in $b$ have important consequences for $L^*$, $C^*$, and ultimately for maximum utility $U(C^*,L^*)$. Note: The specification I chose means the income and substitution effect arising from an increase in productivity ($b$) do not cancel each other. Other utility function (e.g. with $\ln C$) will mean $b$ does not affect $L$. I also leave this exercise to you. 

the liquidity and value of government coupons: if you could sell them very easily for cash and with little discount, then there is little difference. the accessibility/familiarity of the expenditure they are to represent: if they are food coupons to be exchanged in any major supermarket, then beneficiaries could simply using them for their monthly shopping. If they are to be used only in a super-healthy store, not so easily accessible, and valid only to buy children's food, maybe some of the coupons will not be used, or will be resold at a high discount. In that case, they are less like cash, since it is not very rational to destroy cash, or sell cash for less cash. 

I do not want to put many constraints on the structure of the problem, except by defining a competitive equilibrium as such where firms are price takers in the factor and good(s) market, and, perhaps (?), that firms make no profits. For example, is it possible to have something like "competitivistic" competition, where consumers have love for variety and firms produce differentiated goods, yet, instead of monopolistic competition, firms do not charge a markup, because there is free entry, so that firms end up producing at zero profit? Or for example, a model of consumers geographically immobile, and where differentiated transportation costs across regions mean firms need to charge a markup to pay for that cost, and where, again, free entry deter firms from exploiting consumers? 

There is one lottery, with expected payoffs $z_1$ and $z_2$, and average $E(z)$. The expected value of this lottery in terms of utility is $U[E(z)]$. Now, assume a second lottery, with higher $z_1$ and smaller $z_2$, such that the expected value is the same, i.e. $E(z)$. The expected value of this lottery is the same, $U[E(z)]$. Yet, because of lower variance in the second lottery, the point E in the second lottery is closer to D. (In the extreme case of no uncertainty, D and E coincide). In other words, $E[u(z)]$ in lottery one is lower than $E[u(z)]$ in lottery two, even if they pay the same on average. The contradiction of your statement follows immediately. Take the second lottery just introduced, and decrease $z_1$ by a small $\epsilon$. Now, the expected income of the lottery is marginally lower than $E(z)$, which is the opposite relation to the one in your question. There clearly is a small $\epsilon$ such that the relation between $E[u(z)]$ in the two lotteries remains as before. The proof follows the same logic for the case of risk loving individuals (where uncertainty is preferred to certainty and the utility function is convex). Actually, the only case where your statement does hold is for risk neutrality. This can trivially be seen in the graph too.
