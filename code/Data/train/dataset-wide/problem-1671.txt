There are a number of conceptual and numeric problems with your code. They contribute, but I haven't found the conceptual problem yet. I will edit this answer if / when I find it. To start, you set the half-light radius for an exponential profile at 1, create a profile out to 1000, and with a resolution of 1. You need more resolution at the centre, and the last 990 or so bins (probably more than that) are useless. I changed your to 

The most comprehensive catalogue of strong gravitational lenses that I am aware of is the CASTLeS database with about 120 lens systems. Several of them have extended features, arcs, etc., while others are point sources. They provide the redshifts of lens and source where available, as well as time delays between multiple images and the velocity dispersion (a proxy for the mass) of the lens for a few. You would have to create a comparison dataset without strong lensing yourself, but that should not be difficult: Go to Hubble's Ultra Deep Field web page, download the images with the same filters as used in CASTLeS and cut out likely looking galaxies. The UDF contains mostly very high-redshift galaxies, so the chance of accidentally picking a strong-lens system is very slim. (Disclaimer: I've only ever used ACS UDF images, not the NICMOS ones; if it's too hard, just skip the IR data.) 

That should be in western China, since all of China uses Beijing's time zone. Reference: $URL$ --- Edit below --- In response to the comment by @adrianmcmenamin: I'll leave this as guesswork since I simply don't know the peculiarities of every timezone there is. Here's a back-of-the-envelope calculation for local noon in western China. The Sun covers 15 degrees in a period of 1 hour. All of China is on Beijing time (UTC + 8 hours). With the above, it's centred on $15 \cdot 8 = 120^{\circ}$ east. As a consistency check, Beijing is at $116^{\circ}$ east. The westernmost part of China is at about $73^\circ$ east (See here). Local noon there is delayed by $(120^\circ - 73^\circ)/(15^\circ/h) \simeq 3h$. So, local noon is a little later than 3pm. This is discounting daylight savings time, which is not currently observed in China. 

Warning: I never worked with spectra, and I don't have a complete answer. Anyway, here's how I understand it: A spectrograph has a resolution $R = \Delta \lambda / \lambda$ that tells us how well it can distinguish light of different wavelengths. VIMOS from the paper has a resolution from 200 to 2500. With the same flux from the source and for a low-resolution spectrograph, you get more photons per wavelength bin than for a high-resolution one. This means you'll also get better SNR. So, giving SNR / wavelength makes inherent sense. Here's where I'm very unsure: giving a SNR / $(0.1$nm$)$ should be equivalent to a magnitude limit, if the spectral energy distribution is the same. Or it could be a minimum quality criterion on the spectrum - stop taking data as soon as the SNR is reached. 

I understand basically that the universe is homogenous (looks the same from every point) and I was told in my astro class that it's supposed to have no center, but how that works boggles my mind. I can't get over the feeling that from some point in the universe a civilization could look in a certain direction and see a sign indicative of the direction towards the edge or the center, like younger galaxies or a lack of galaxies moving a certain direction. EDIT: Thanks to Sir Cumference for highlighting some things that are unclear about my question. Sure, to a certain extent you might be able to think of the universe as being without a center, but if you think of a ball growing larger from nothing, and you pick a random point in the growing sphere, you can always say that the point is further from some points on the sphere than others, or in other words, that there is a direction towards a "center". Any other details you can give that are related at all would be extremely welcome. 

LIGO detectors have two 4 km arms, and everything in those arms in suspended in a vacuum. The actual dimensions of those arms I was unable to find, but the published paper here has more information for you to peruse. 

I know some measures must exist, but I have no idea what the programs are, what organizations are involved, or how effective they are. 

This is plausible, and might even be a good idea if used right. First off, NASA has been working on plans for an asteroid redirect mission, called ARM. While it remains to be seen whether this will be approved, and they plan to put it into lunar orbit, this is a hypothetical scenario anyways so I'll ignore that. Now, putting an asteroid into earth orbit is a little bit of a difficult subject. Sure, you could do it, but messing up would net you a whole lot of problems. I presume it would have to go into high earth orbit if it goes into orbit at all. This rules out using the asteroid directly like a satellite, but that would have been impractical even if it was sanctioned by everyone with enough influence to have an opinion on earth. From there the satellite would be best used as a base of operations, from which you could send drones to collect junk and keep refueling stations. I'd also include a telescope or two, but that's personal preference. If you want a list of targets though, here would be a good place to look. 

and they've been going for a number of years by now. So, it would be technically challenging but possible. Politically, it might not be so easy: Every observatory wants to make the best use of the observing time they have, and most are oversubscribed (more time asked for than available). You need a fairly solid science case to block several telescopes around the world for several years, but the result you'd get if all goes well is merely confirmation of someone else's result. 

The header of a FITS file is ASCII, and points you to further information. Calling directs you to "'Astronomy and Astrophysics', volume 376, page 359; bibcode: 2001A&A...376..359H". A software to view FITS images is ds9 (yes, that makes it hard to google...). Alternatively, there's skycat. Both can be used to view and do basic analysis on FITS images. For FITS binary tables, it is probably best to write your own analysis software. For a quick look, fv might do the job. Accessing the data yourself If you want to write your own software for analysis, take a look at either cfitsio, a C library for reading and writing FITS files, or pyfits, a python module which does the same and which seems to have merged with the astropy software package. The cfitsio page in the link above has links to documentation on both the cfitsio library and the FITS standard in general. 

In other words, the red- and blueshift due to our motion must exceed the peculiar motion of the individual galaxies. Cosmologists have been dealing with a very similar problem trying to measure the Hubble constant. I remember from a cosmology class (can't find a source at the moment) that the Coma cluster is the first cluster whose redshift is dominated by the Hubble flow as opposed to peculiar motion. This is mainly due to the fact that the local group is moving towards the nearer Virgo cluster. From the above wikipedia link: Distance ca. $100 \textrm{MPc}$, apparent recession velocity ca. $7000 \textrm{km s}^{-1}$. So, at that speed, you would definitely see a systematic difference in redshift of galaxies ahead of and behind you. How long to get to that speed at constant acceleration of $10 \frac{m}{s^2}$? \begin{equation} a = \frac{v}{t} \Rightarrow t = \frac{v}{a} = \frac{7\cdot 10^6 m s^{-1}}{10 m s^{-2}} = 7 \cdot 10^5 s \simeq 8\, \textrm{days.} \end{equation} Note that this is a worst-case scenario. People have used much closer galaxies to determine the Hubble constant. This paper's abstract says 

There are some differences in the required surface accuracy (imperfections significantly smaller in scale than the observed wavelength do not matter) and surface composition - the ALMA dishes are solid metal, whereas the FAST dish is perforated. This works because as long as the holes are smaller than the wavelength, the incoming radio waves see it as solid. The receivers used to convert incoming photons to electricity for both telescopes work on the same principles. Practically, it is much more difficult for ALMA due to the high frequencies at the edge of the far-infrared spectrum. ALMAs shortest wavelengths are just a little too long for receivers used in infrared or optical telescopes to work, and almost too short for normal radio receivers to work.
