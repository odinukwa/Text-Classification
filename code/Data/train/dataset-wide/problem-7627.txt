Short version: has anyone done geometry on something that is the formal filtered colimit of Frechet manifolds? Longer version: A colleague and I came up with a concept today that seems like we require generalising smooth Frechet manifolds to something that is a filtered colimit of such manifolds: Ind-Frechet manifolds if you will. A fragment of this idea is that we need to consider a space of smooth paths $I \to M$ in a smooth manifold (poss. compact) with a finite number discontinuities (poss. zero). As a topological space one can simply take the (filtered) colimit over the spaces of paths with discontinuities at specified number of points in $I$ (this should be a Frechet manifold). The result is a space over the infinite simplex (i.e. $colim_n \Delta^n$). But there is no guarantee that this colimit exists in the category of Frechet manifolds and smooth maps. We really need this to be something like a smooth space, so we can discuss connections and the such like. I'm aware that we could use something like diffeological spaces or Chen spaces or the like, but since people talk about ind-schemes, I wondered if there was something similar for manifolds. 

In the case at hand, $v$ is defined as $$v = \bar{u}(id \times A \times A): E_{Z_2} \ltimes D^{r-s} \wedge D^{s-r} \to S$$ The sequence in question, which is described as the 'restriction of $v$ to the boundary', is shorthand for $$ \partial(E_{Z_2} \ltimes D^{r-s} \wedge D^{s-r}) \stackrel{\pi}{\to} S^k \vee S^k \to S^k \to S^0$$ and the notation $\partial(\ )$ is shorthand for the boundary of the 'obvious thing', the only space that belongs there. The $\pi$ seems to be projection. I can't comment on the other occurrence, but often in seminars one can write such a notation when trying to save time and/or space on the board, especially if the expression is complicated. 

From a topological point of view, many interesting categories of spaces (even if not excessively general) are already essentially small, while being closed under a reasonable class of (co)limits. For instance, second-countable paracompact Hausdorff spaces all embed in the Hilbert cube $[0,1]^{\aleph_0}$, hence the category of such is essentially small. Polish spaces are another example of spaces embeddable in the Hilbert cube. One could perform a similar analysis to the Stacks Project for topological spaces in any given setting to find out which constructions allow one to stay entirely within a small category. 

One could take ETCS - which is a finite, first order axiomatisation of the category of sets - and remove the axiom that guarantees the existence of a natural numbers object. Then in this set up one can prove the existence of sets of finite cardinality, but not the existence of a set with cardinality $\geq \aleph_0$. Moreover one could weaken this to a finitist version of Palmgren's constructive, predicative version of ETCS, which would be a well-pointed $\Pi$-pretopos with enough projectives. This latter version minus function sets (the '$\Pi$' in $\Pi$-pretopos) would perhaps be closer to Nelson's idea, because at one point he expresses doubts about the finiteness of $n^m := \{1,\ldots,n\}^{\{1,\ldots,m\}}$ for large $n$ and $m$. EDIT: I should say that in a formal setting this would translate to the unprovability of the statement "$n^m$ is finite", which would be the case in a model of a "finite set theory" without function sets. Or one can just work with Nelson's arithmetic, which is the most ultrafinitist thing I know. For example, exponentiation is not a total function in his theory. 

Regarding element-to-element arrows, Emili Bifet writes on The Math Forum that Riemann used the notation $a \to b$ as follows: 

Here's an idea, espressed in very rough terms. Consider generalised elements of the $F_n$, namely maps $A \to F_n$. We might as well only consider elements of the form $\coprod_{m\in S} F_m \to F_n$, for some $S \subset \mathbb{N}$ for various reasons I won't explain (I'm working a bit from intuition here - there are probably watertight reasons one could come up with). But recall that there are no maps $m\to n$ if $ m \lt n$, so one can roughly see that really there should only be generalised elements $\coprod_{m\in S} F_m \to F_n$ where $S \subset \mathbb{N} \cap [n,\infty)$. And then a generalised element of $\prod_\mathbb{N} F_n$ should be a map $$ \coprod_{m\in S} F_m \to \prod_\mathbb{N} F_n $$ but the projection to $F_n$ ensures that $S \subset \mathbb{N} \cap [n,\infty)$ for all $n$, hence there are no such maps, and so $\prod_\mathbb{N} F_n$ has no elements. So morally, $F_n$ looks like the subset of $P\mathbb{N}$ consisting of all sets with all elements greater than or equal to $n$. But I can't prove this, or give an explanation more rigorous than the above. 

(This is more of an extended comment, but contains ideas that may help answer the question) This might link up with informal ideas that Tim Porter has expressed (only in online forums, not in any formal setting that I know of). He posits the idea that instead of asking for existence fillers in horns for simplicial sets, so as to get Kan complexes, what if there is a probability distribution on the set of possible fillers? To recover your situation, take the nerve of the group considered as a one-object groupoid and this is a reduced Kan complex (reduced = one 0-simplex). That there is a group multiplication means that inner horns have unique fillers. (inverses means unique fillers for outer horns) It may be possible to find a mixture of these two ideas that recovers the definition of a hypergroup. Then simply relax the condition that your simplicial set is reduced. It is well known that Kan complexes with unique fillers (and poss some other conditions I am too lazy to check) are nerves of groupoids. So this should give the concept you are looking for. If there were references I'm fairly sure Tim would have mentioned them, but then again, maybe not. If you do find some I'm sure he'd like to hear from you. 

This is just to answer your first question. The second one I don't know about. The homotopy theory of categories is not quite as you envisage it. Really Grothendieck is thinking of the Thomason model structure on $Cat$ (the category of small categories), which is Quillen equivalent to the Quillen model structure on $sSet$ via the nerve functor. Then Grothedieck considered pairs $(Cat,W)$ where $W$ is a class of functors which acted as weak equivalences. This he called a basic localizer (nLab). Grothendieck conjectured, and Cisinski proved, that the class of weak equivalences in the Thomason model structure was the smallest basic localizer. From there Grothendieck moved to considering pairs $(C,W)$ for any category $C$ and class $W$ of arrows such that $C[W^{-1}]$ was equivalent to the homotopy category of CW-complexes, or even the homotopy category of some basic localizer, and in particular he was interested in when $C = Pre(S) = Cat(S^{op},Set)$, presheaves on some small category $S$. In particular, we know that $S=\Delta$ can be used to recover the homotopy theory of CW-complexes. The question was to characterise those $S$ such that $(Pre(S),W')$, where $W'$ was inherited from a basic localizer (consult Cisinski's or Maltsiniotis' work for details), can be used to model the same homotopy types as $Cat$. Such categories $S$ were called [weak/strict] test categories. D. Cisinski, Les préfaisceaux comme modèles des types d’homotopie, Astérisque 308 (2006) and G. Maltsiniotis, La théorie de l’homotopie de Grothendieck, Astérisque, 301 (2005) are central resources in this area. 

In lieu of a real answer, I offer the following analysis by Lieven le Bruyn, in a sequence of posts on Google+: 

Homotopy Type Theory/Univalent Foundations is probably the newest entrant to the field and should definitely be mentioned. You could do worse than check out the resources at the (quasi-)official site. The HoTT Book has a big introduction, and Mike Shulman and David Corfield have both written either philosophically-inclined, or explicitly philosopical papers on the topic. 

For an even more geometric application, the fundamental groupoid tells you all about parallel transport in bundles, as long as the transport is independent of the actual path and only relies on the homotopy class of the path. This is the case for flat connections (in particular on vector bundles). For appropriate spaces, one can define a flat connection on a line bundle as a character of the fundamental group, but is more natural to define it as a functor from the fundamental groupoid to the groupoid $core(1dVect)$ of 1-dimensional spaces and isomorphisms between them (this latter groupoid is equivalent to $GL_1$ considered as a groupoid with one object). A point is sent to the fibre over that point, and a (homotopy class of paths) to the isomorphism between the fibres induced by the flat connection. This has manifest extensions to vector bundles of higher rank $n$, replacing $core(1dVect)$ by the groupoid $core(ndVect)$. There are versions of this for covering spaces, but vector bundles are perhaps more geometric. 

Prompted by the discussion in comments above, Asaf wrote a blog post Cofinality and the axiom of choice that gave the following example of a model of ZF: 

analogous to the well-known isomorphism $Spin(5,1)\simeq SL(2,\mathbb{H})$? Clearly one cannot make a simple appeal to the Lie algebra isomorphism, but need to pull out some Clifford algebra or spin representation built from quaternions. EDIT: bonus imaginary internet points if this exceptional isomorphism is compatible in some way the one for $Spin(5,1)$. 

The obvious first answer: take three copies of $\mathbb{N}$ as total orders, then join them at the bottom element to get an unbounded poset with bottom. This of course isn't satisfactory as it doesn't give $\mathbb{Z}$ for two copies of $\mathbb{N}$. This strikes me as a sort of 'what about a 3-dimensional version of the complex numbers?' question, and could benefit from considering 'four infinities'... 

In a paper placed on the arXiv today Shelah references theorem 0.9 from this paper (also Shelah) that uses $\aleph_{736}$ as an upper bound. This strikes me as analogous to Skewes' number. Are there any other examples where explicit mentions of 'large alephs' are used in proofs or theorems? Large in this instance is $\aleph_n$ for $n > 3$, say. Edit: The first version of this question asks for $n$ a natural number, because clearly there are uses of $\aleph_\omega$ that are not all that uncommon, I imagine. But if there are uses of alephs - in isolation, not as part of a general transfinite induction scheme - that have $n$ an infinite ordinal like $\omega^2\cdot 5 + 45$ or some specific polynomial in $\omega$ which is 'not boring' (e.g. $\omega, \omega+1$), then I'd like to hear those as well. Bonus points, even though this is a separate question: where does the 736 come from? Is it due to some sort of Goedelian numbering scheme that encodes the statement “G is a free abelian group”, which is part of the theorem? 

(As a bonus question: Come up with a model of ZF that violates WISC or prove we can use forcing to construct one) 

Take the nerve of $X//G \in Gpd(sSet)$ to get a bisimplicial set ($URL$ then take the diagonal, or the Artin-Mazur codiagonal ($URL$ Either of the resulting simplicial sets represent the homotopy type. Pick the one which is better for what you need it for. 

Given a paracompact smooth manifold, you have smooth partitions of unity (nLab), but on a real analytic manifold (e.g. a complex manifold viewed as a real manifold) one doesn't have analytic partitions of unity (much less holomorphic, if you are in the complex case). That is, given any open cover on a smooth manifold, one can find a partition of unity subordinate to that cover - this is a very topological property. Using partitions of unity you can paste together local functions as desired. The existence of smooth partitions of unity comes down to the existence of a smooth (but not analytic!) bump function on $[-1,1]$. Edit: you can find details and formulas on Wikipedia. A related fact is that on a paracompact smooth manifold, the sheaf of real-valued functions is fine (nLab,wikipedia). 

I'm interested not just for a reference, but in the technique, at least from a category-theoretic point of view. 

Edit: Ah, I found the result I was looking for in Mackenzie's Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids in differential geometry (LMS lecture note series no. 124), namely Proposition III.1.17, on page 92. It says that for any Lie groupoid $\Omega \rightrightarrows B$ (there called a differentiable groupoid - for him Lie groupoids are a specialised notion) the inertia groupoid (there denoted $G\Omega$) is a sub-Lie groupoid, and the arrows of $G\Omega$ form a closed embedded submanifold of $\Omega$. In particular this result implies the source = target map $G\Omega \to B$ is a submersion. However, in the newer General theory of Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids (LMS lecture note series no. 213), he corrects this, in a comment just after example 1.2.12, and only claims it for locally trivial Lie groupoids, which was probably what he was thinking of in the earlier book. 

Let $G$ be a (nice enough) topological group (actually a filtered colimit of compact Lie groups), and let $X$ be a manifold with an action (a proper one in fact) by a Lie group $H$. Let $X//H := (X\times EH)/H$ be the Borel construction. Does the following claim appear in the literature: 

For the case when $H$ is a compact Lie group and $G$ is an abelian Lie group, then this is proved in a 1983 paper by Lashof, May and Segal, Equivariant bundles with Abelian structure group, Contemporary Math 19 (1983) 167--176. (pdf) And some related cases are treated by May in Some remarks on equivariant bundles and classifying spaces, Asterisque 191 (1990) 239--263 (pdf) The claim seems intuitively true, but I can't seem to be able to find it, so my intuition may be off. If it is true, then surely May would have mentioned it (perhaps he does and for some reason I missed it). EDIT: May also treats the topic in chapter VII of the book Equivariant homotopy and cohomology theory, but it seems a compilation of older work. Another way to view the question is to ask if the categories of H-equivariant G-bundles on X and ordinary G-bundles of X//H are equivalent. There is some work in Lashof-May-Segal where they refrain from assuming G is abelian (there called A, however), I'm digesting it at the moment. Also note I'm not asking for a classifying space for equivariant bundles - this is a much different question.
