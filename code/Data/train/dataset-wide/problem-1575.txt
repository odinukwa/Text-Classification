The measurement of a chemical abundance is not a question of using a simple equation. The simplest it gets is using a "curve of growth", which relates equivalent width to abundance and assumes you already know the temperature of the star and its surface gravity. For the Li 6708A line, the relevant tables, that can be interpolated, are found in Soderblom et al. (1993). $URL$ . These are LTE curves of growth based on Atlas atmospheric models. As an aside, the equivalent width of this line in the Sun is 3 mA. The formula you quote looks like some sort of linear approximation, but this resonance line rapidly enters the saturated (non-linear) portion of the curve of growth for equivalent widths of 50 mA or more. As the equation is couched in terms of ratios, then the units you use are entirely up to you. 

When an interaction occurs that results in the absorption or emission of a photon, we are not dealing with stationary states. Stationary states are solutions of the time-independent SchrÃ¶dinger equation, but the absorption and emission of photons is a time-dependent phenomenon. Spectral lines in fact do not have a definite energy. They have a natural width associated with the time taken for the transition to occur. The probability that a transition might occur resulting in the absorption or emission of a photon of a given frequency can only be tackled by considering a time-dependent Hamiltonian. What one finds is that transition probabilities become large for frequencies close to the those corresponding to energy differences between stationary states. 

The structure (mass versus radius and density profile) is influenced by its rotation rate, but not by as much as you might think. Even in Newtonian physics you can think of a mass element $m$ at the surface of a star of mass $M$ and radius $R$, rotating with angular velocity $\omega$. A condition for stability would be that the surface gravity is strong enough to provide the centripetal acceleration of the test mass. $$ \frac{GMm}{R^2} > m R \omega^2$$ If this is not satisfied then the object might break up (it is more complicated than this because the object will not stay spherical and the radius at the equator will increase etc., but these are small numerical factors). Thus $$ \omega < \left(\frac{GM}{R^3}\right)^{1/2}$$ or in terms of rotation period $P = 2\pi/\omega$ and so $$ P > 2\pi \left(\frac{GM}{R^3}\right)^{-1/2},$$ is the condition for stability. For a typical $1.4M_{\odot}$ neutron star with radius 10 km, then $P>0.46$ milli-seconds. A proper General Relativistic calculation of this limit would give a similar result, but depends to some extent on the equation of state of the neutron star. Happily, this is easily satisfied for all observed neutron stars - they can spin extremely fast because of their enormous surface gravities and all are well below the instability limit. I believe the fastest known rotating pulsar has a period of 1.4 milli-seconds. You also ask how pusars can attain these speeds. There are two classes of explanation for the two classes of pulsars. Most pulsars are thought (at least initially) to be the product of a core-collapse supernova. The core collapses from something a little smaller than the radius of the Earth, to about 10km radius in a fraction of a second. Conservation of angular momentum demands that the rotation rate increases as the inverse of the radius squared. i.e. The spin rate increases by factors of a million or so. Pulsars spin down with age because they turn their rotational kinetic energy into magnetic dipole radiation. However, the fastest rotating pulsars - the "milli-second pulsars" are "born again", by accreting material from a binary companion. The accreted material has angular momentum and the accretion of this angular momentum is able to spin the neutron star up to very high rates because it has a relatively (for a stellar-mass object) small moment of inertia. 

It is expected that the spin down will continue, even after the pulsar has switched off, but the spin down rate itself depends on the rotation speed, so the neutron star will never come to a halt, even after tens of billions of years. 

The merging of neutron stars must happen though. The obvious example is the Hulse-Taylor binary neutron star system, where the two object are spiralling together, presumably by the emission of gravitational waves, and will merge in about 300 million years. The combined mass of the 2 neutron stars is $2.83M_{\odot}$, but the mass of any black hole they create would be lower, with the difference radiated away as neutrinos and gravitational waves. Merging neutron stars (or merging neutron star + black hole binaries) are thought to be the progenitors of short duration gamma ray bursts or so-called Kilonova eventsthat are generally seen in high redshift galaxies. These typically last a second or less, but involve an energy release of about $\sim 10^{44}$ J. They may produce a black hole, or perhaps a more massive neutron star. There will also be a gravitational wave signature (a "chirp") that could be detected by the next generation of gravitational wave experiments (now a reality). These black holes may be isolated and hence not represented in the mass distribution above. A further observational signature of these events may be in the form of the current levels of a number of heavy r-process elements, like Iridium and Gold, that may mostly be produced in these events. As for accretion onto an existing neutron star - well it looks quite rare because there may be a large gap between the highest masses at which neutron stars are produced in supernovae (maybe $1.5M_{\odot}$) and the maximum mass of a neutron star. We know that the latter is at least $2M_{\odot}$, but it could be higher, perhaps $3M_{\odot}$, the maximum allowed by General Relativity. As to the outcome of this hypothetical event, well sticking to non-speculative physics, the most likely thing to happen would be the production of massive hyperons in the neutron star core at sufficiently high densities ($>10^{18}$ kg/m$^3$), which would lead to an instability (due to the removal of degenerate neutrons that are providing the majority of support); the neutron star may then slip inside its event horizon (about 6km for a $2M_{\odot}$ neutron star) and become a black hole. Some sort of explosion seems unlikely, though a gravitational wave signature might be possible. EDIT: An update on the NS/BH mass distribution above. I saw a talk recently at a conference - the explanation of the distribution has two broad thrusts; either the black holes are not produced in this mass range because of the physics of the progenitors, or there is a strong observational bias against seeing them. An example of the former explanation can be found in Kochanek (2014), who proposes that there is a class of "failed supernovae" between 16 and 25$M_{\odot}$ that do manage to eject their envelopes in weak transient events, but leave behind their helium cores to form the lowest mass 5-8$M_{\odot}$ black holes. Lower mass progenitors are then responsible for the neutron stars. The observational bias is that the companions to the lowest mass black holes in binary systems may be always overflowing their Roche lobes. The resultant accretion signature swamps the companion spectrum and prevents a dynamical mass estimate (e.g. Fryer 1999). The Chandra Galactic Bulge Survey is attempting to find examples of quiescent, relatively low X-ray luminosity, eclipsing compact binaries, with which to measure a more unbiased black hole mass distribution. Further Edit: There continue to be challenges and claims that there are "low-mass" black holes that could be formed via accretion-induced collapse of a neutron star (pointed out by Alexandra Veledina). For instance Cygnus-X3 has a claimed mass of $2.4^{+2.1}_{-1.1}\ M_{\odot}$ according to Zdziarski et al. 2013, but these observations lack the precision to be really sure yet. 

I'm afraid this is not straightforward The amplitude of the gravitational wave strain signal from a merging compact binary (neutrons star or black hole) is $$h \sim 10^{-22} \left(\frac{M}{2.8M_{\odot}}\right)^{5/3}\left(\frac{0.01{\rm s}}{P}\right)^{2/3}\left(\frac{100 {\rm Mpc}}{d}\right),$$ where $M$ is the total mass of the system in solar masses, $P$ is the instantaneous orbital period in seconds and $d$ is the distance in 100s of Mpc. $h \sim 10^{-22}$ is a reasonable number for the sensitivity of LIGO to gravitational wave strain where it is most sensitive (at frequencies of 30-300 Hz). So you can see that to increase the observability you can increase the mass, decrease the period or decrease the distance. But here are the complications. LIGO is only sensitive between about 30-300 Hz and the GW frequencies are twice the orbital frequency. Thus you cannot shorten the period to something very small because it would fall outside the LIGO frequency range and you also cannot increase the mass to something too much bigger than the black holes that have been already seen because they merge before they can attain high enough orbital frequencies to be seen. (The frequency at merger is $\propto M^{-1}$). A further complication is that the evolution of the signals is more rapid at lower masses. That is - the rate of change of frequency and amplitude increase rapidly with total mass. That is why the recent neutron star merger was detectable for 100s by LIGO, whereas the more massive black hole mergers could only be seen for about 1 second. But what this means is that you have fewer cycles of the black hole signal that can be "added up" to improve the signal to noise, which means that higher mass sources are less detectable than a simple application of the formula I gave above would suggest. A further complication is that there is a geometric factor depending on how the source and detectors are orientated with respect to each other. OK, these are complications, but the formula can still be used as an approximation. So if we take the GW170817 signal, the total mass was about $2.8M_{\odot}$, the source was at 40 Mpc, so at frequencies of 200 Hz (corresponding to a period of 0.01 s) you might have expected a strain signal of about $3\times 10^{-22}$. This gave a very readily detectable signal. The discovery paper (Abbot et al. 2017) says the "horizon" for detection was approximately 218 Mpc for LIGO-Livingston and 107 Mic for LIGO-Hanford. As the source was much closer than these numbers then it is unsurprising that the detection was strong. Taking the formula above and a fixed orbital period of 0.01 s, we can see that the horizon distance will scale as $\sim M^{5/3}$. So a $10 M_{\odot} + 10 M_{\odot}$ black hole binary might be seen out to $218 \times (20/2.8)^{5/3} = 5.7$ Gpc (this will be an overestimate by a factor of a few because of the issue of the rapidity of the evolution towards merger that I discussed above). A more through and technical discussion can be read here, although this is a couple of years out of date and LIGO's reach has been extended by about a factor of five since these calculations were done.
