The trick is to draw the whole reaction function—including the part that coincides with the axis. Hopefully these figures make it clear: 

Interest is a key mechanism to ensure that resources are properly allocated within an economy. There are lots of uses to which money can be put: consuming goods, building highways, constructing a new factory, investing to develop a new drug, etc. Just like goods, the allocation of money is governed by the price system—where the interest rate is the price (because the interest rate is how much you have to pay to get access to money). If the price is too low (i.e. if there is no interest) then few people will be willing to lend money and valuable investments (in, for example, infrastructure or new business ventures) will not take place because the funds aren't available to pay for them. A positive interest rate ensures that people with money they don't need right now have an incentive to lend it to people with valuable projects to fund. We know that it is possible for economies to function without interest, though, because the charging/payment of interest is prohibited by Sharia law, giving rise to so-called Islamic banking. 

No, you do not have sufficient information to conclude that the demand is perfectly elastic. The following figures show two ways that demand curves that are not perfectly elastics could have generated the first two data points in your series: 

I am trying to compile a list of winners of the Nobel memorial prize in economics whose thesis advisor also won the prize. So far I have 

Together, I think these quotes nicely illustrate the way that economists' perceptions of their own discipline evolved over time. By the 1930s, we have Robbins' startlingly insightful observation that Economics is about choice subject to constraints, which is obviously a very general kind of problem. But even as early as the late 19th century you can already see traces of this kind of thinking in Marshall's words. This way of thinking about economics is, I think, key to emboldening economists to reach out beyond the confines of market behavior. Indeed, I think one reason why economics has been so imperialistic is that economics is as much a methodology as a body of knowledge. As such, economists have constantly looked for new problems and settings to which they can apply the tools they know. More recent contributions that have been important are probably: 

Reverse Auction In a reverse auction, $n$ bidders choose their bid, $b_i$, as a function of their cost $c_i$ (distributed according to $F$. They seek to maximise their expected payoff: $$[b_i(c_i)-c_i]\Pr(b_i\leq\min_j b_j).$$ If we look for a symmetric equilibrium in which bidders with higher costs bid more then the probability that I have the lowest bid is just the probability I have the lowest cost: $$\Pr(b_i\leq\min_j b_j)=[1-F(c_i)]^{n-1}.$$ A useful trick is to think of a bidder as choosing what kind of cost to "pretend to have". If we call their choice $\widetilde{c}$ then a bidder's probblem is to $$\max_{\widetilde{c}}[b(\widetilde{c})-c_i][1-F(\widetilde{c})]^{n-1}.$$ Differentiation yields the first-order condition: $$-(n-1)F'(\widetilde{c})[1-F(\widetilde{c})]^{n-2}[b(\widetilde{c})-c_i]+[1-F(\widetilde{c})]^{n-1}b'(\widetilde{c})=0.$$ In equilibrium, we know that a bidder should not want to pretend to be anyone other than his true type, so this first-order condition must hold at $\widetilde{c}=c_i$: $$-(n-1)F'(c_i)[1-F(c_i)]^{n-2}[b(c_i)-c_i]+[1-F(c_i)]^{n-1}b'(c_i)=0.$$ This is a differential equation that can be solved for the equilibrium bid function, $b(c_i)$. In, particular, if costs are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$, we have $F(c_i)=c_i$ and the differential equation can be simplified to $$-(n-1)[1-c_i]^{n-2}[b(c_i)-c_i]+[1-c_i]^{n-1}b'(c_i)=0.$$ $$(n-1)\frac{1}{1-c_i}[b(c_i)-c_i]=b'(c_i).$$ The solution to this differential equation is $$b(c_i)=\frac{1+c_i(n-1)}{n}.$$ 

More formally, if $Y(t)$ is GDP at time $t$, one could express this as Recession: $Y'(t)<0$ for 6+ months downturn: $Y''(t)<0$ recovery: $Y''(t)>0$. The definition of recession (2 quarters of negative growth) is widely standardised. I think the definition of downturn and recovery is less standard, and therefore more subject to debate. 

The above describes how you might go about learning about economics. But from your question, it seems more like you are more interested in learning about finance, which is the discipline that encompasses the study financial markets, etc. I learnt finance from a book called "Introduction to Finance" by Lawrence J. Gitman and Jeff Madura, but there doesn't seem to be a recent edition so perhaps someone else can recommend a more recent introduction to the subject. 

I can find books with a nice treatment of calculus, but am struggling to find a book that also includes coverage of topics in probability. Failing one book that covers all of these topics, I also welcome suggestions of books that might work well together to give such coverage. 

Externalities are but one example of market failure. Market failure is more properly defined as any situation in which a market, left to operate without any intervention, fails to produce the efficient (welfare-maximising) allocation. Sources of market failure include 

According to the OECD: Israel's spending per-student is low relative to other OECD countries. Given that countries like the US have both higher spending per-student and higher enrolment rates, it is not clear what a switch to heavier state subsidisation (both the UK and US already heavily subsidise universities) would achieve. Bear in mind that most of the best US universities privately subsidise talented students from poor backgrounds so that the highest fees are mostly bourne by the wealthy. It seems that implicit in your question is the idea that Israel rations its heavily subsidised tertiary education by imposing more demanding entrance requirements, but it is not clear to me that this is true. The entrance requirements for elite universities such as Harvard, MIT, Oxford, or Cambridge are among the most demanding in the world. There are 4599 higher education institutions in the US that cater to a very broad spectrum of student types. 

The 'punishment' that Motta refers to is exactly the idea that, if one firm cuts its price to break the tacitly collusive status quo, other firms will 'punish' it by responding with a price cut of their own. Sometimes, tacit collusion is known by the alternative name conscious parallelism to reflect the idea that firms are consciously mimicking each others' strategies. Particularly among legal scholars, the term conscious parallelism is used to mean coordination of prices without an agreement, whereas the term collusion is reserved specifically for the case in which an agreement has taken place. Among economists, as Motta explains above, both practices are known as (respectively, tacit and explicit) collusion and the conscious parallelism terminology is less common. 

Notice that you only have to pay the journalists and the rent once, no matter how many copies you print (so these are fixed costs). The cost of printing (paper and ink) will increase as you produce more copies of the paper because you will need more of these inputs, so these are variable costs. Suppose it costs \$10,000 to pay a team of journalists to produce an issue of a newspaper (fixed cost), and \$1 to print a copy of that paper (variable cost). If you sell one thousand copies then the total cost is $$\$10,000+(1,000 \times \$1)=\$11,000.$$ That means the average cost of producing each copy is $$\$11,000/1000=\$11.$$ Now suppose production increases to 2,000 units. Now the cost is $$\$10,000+(2,000 \times \$1)=\$12,000.$$ The average cost per unit is $$\$12,000/2000=\$6.$$ So output increased and the result is that the average cost per unit has fallen. This is a situation in which there are economies of scale. The reason this happens is that, as output increases, the fixed cost (here the \$10,000) gets spread over more units so that the average fixed cost per-unit decreases even if the variable cost does not. In particular, notice that in the first case the fixed cost gets averaged over 1000 units (a fixed cost of \$10 per unit), whereas in the second it is averaged over 2000 units (a fixed cost of \$5 per unit). 

This leaves the question of the long-run fate of the universe. To end on a note of optimism, here's a quote from Wikipedia: 

Notice that points 2 and 3 are essentially equivalent (they result in the same distribution of consumption across time). In the former, I am directly storing food. In the latter, I am using the pebbles to store the value associated with the food until I want to claim that value back. Although the store of value is really just an abstract implementation of the physical storage of the goods generating that value, this distinction becomes important in more sophisticated economies. Storing value rather than storing the goods that generate that value is attractive for a few reasons. 

Addendum: subsequent work has shown that leverage of market power is possible in various situations. But the conditions needed for it to work are more intricate than suggested by common intuition. 

The usual textbook example of a Giffen good (i.e. a good whose demand curve slopes upwards) is the Irish potato famine. The idea is that as potatoes (a staple food) became more expensive, people could no longer afford expensive foods such as meat and so ended up buying more potatoes! However, this example has come in for criticism, not least of all because a potato famine means that the total consumption of potatoes must have been decreasing at the time. You can read a critique of the potato famine hypothesis here. More recent work has suggested, however, that consumption of rice (also a staple) in some poor parts of China does exhibit Giffen behaviour. This research was published in a paper by Jensen and Miller in the AER in 2008 titled "Giffen Behavior and Subsistence Consumption". They ran a field experiment in which they subsidised rice consumption (i.e. decreased its apparent price) for randomly chosen households and found that the result was a decrease in rice consumption. Alfred Marshall popularised the notion of a Giffen good in 1895, but it took until the 21st century for fairly robust evidence of Giffen bahviour to emerge. That finding such an example took so long suggests that Giffen goods are, indeed, a very rare phenomenon. 

Since these are two ways of thinking about the same subsidy, they must yield the same value for producer surplus. But you should be able to see by comparing the blue and green areas that this necessarily implies that the tunnel has the same area as D+A+B. 

In problems like this, complementarity and substitutability are often defined with respect to the cross-derivatives. Write $v_i(\cdot)$ for the derivative of $v$ with respect to its $i$th argument. Thus, $v_i(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ measures how much output increases if $i$ increases his effort slightly. Now let's think about the derivative of $v_i$ with respect to $a_j$: $v_{ij}(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$. If $v_{ij}>0$ then an extra unit of effort from $i$ yields more output when $a_j$ is high (and vice-versa). We say that $i$'s and $j$'s efforts are complements because extra effort from $j$ makes $i$'s effort more effective (and vice versa). Conversely, if $v_{ij}<0$ then extra effort from $j$ makes $i$'s effort less effective, and this is often taken as a definition of substitutability. 

Varian has a paper on Price Discrimination and Social Welfare in which he gives some necessary and sufficient conditions for (third degree) price discrimination to increase welfare. A necessary condition is that the total level of output (i.e. the total number of consumers served) increases as a result of the discrimination. A sufficient condition is that the profitability of the new output (i.e. after discrimination) exceeds the profitability of the old output (before discrimination) evaluated at the new prices. 

Note that fertility (number of children per adult female) is decreasing essentially everywhere, and is forecast to be only slightly above replacement level worldwide by the middle of the century. Here's the source. It also turns out that Malthus greatly underestimated the importance and potential of technological development for agriculture. Here's the amount of wheat produced from one hectare of land in the developing world (where most population growth takes place; figure source): 

A negative externality arises when the private net marginal benefit (i.e. the marginal benefit minus the marginal cost) of an activity exceeds the net social benefit. In such cases, the self-interested private decision maker will increase their participation in the activity even though it is socially inefficient for them to do so. A positive externality arises when the private net marginal benefit (i.e. the marginal benefit minus the marginal cost) of an activity are smaller than the net social benefit. In such cases, the self-interested private decision maker will not increase their participation in the activity even though it is socially efficient for them to do so. This is a semantic distinction to the extend that if one thinks activity $A$ has a negative externality then one can define a new activity $B$, which is simply the "act of not doing $A$" so that $B$ has a positive externality. On this basis, one can argue that every externality is positive or that every externality is negative. For example, many people think that education has a positive externality because educated people make better citizens (e.g they make more informed voting decisions that benefit others). As a matter of semantics, one could argue that this is, in fact, not a positive externality and that what is really going on is that people who do not educate themselves are exerting a negative externality on those who do by virtue of their ignorance. Whilst there is some merit to this reasoning, I do not find it helpful. Often, when we study the effects of behaviour, we are interested in comparing those effects to some baseline or benchmark in which the behaviour is absent. When communicating economics to others, it is usually the case that some benchmarks are more intuitive that others. We could, for example, rewrite all of consumer theory in terms of "the dis-utility people experience from not having goods" and look at the "problem of non-consumption dis-utility minimisation". Doing so would be formally equivalent to the more conventional approach of consumption utility maximisation (only the language changed), but would probably be less intuitive for people trying to understand the economics.(*) At least to me, it is more intuitive to think that people actively choose to undetake some level of education and exert a positive externality on others than to think that everyone receives infinite education by default and the choice of abstaining results in a negative externality. Besides education, another example that I think fits most intuitively into the positive externalities box is network effects. If I buy a telephone then all of my phone-owning friends are made better off because now they can use their telephone to call one more person that they couldn't reach before. It seems weird to think of the negative externality of not owning a phone. In terms of taxes versus subsidies: to get to the socially optimal intensity we need to ensure that the private net marginal benefit is zero precisely when the social net marginal benefit is zero. In the case of a negative externality this can be done either by increasing the private marginal cost (via a tax) for the activity or by increasing the private marginal benefit of not participating in the activity via a subsidy. For example, we could either subsidize low carbon firms or tax heavy polluters. As far as aligning incentives are concerned, the two are equivalent. In most practical cases, the more important consideration is likely to be that of budget constraints and politics: 

What is going on here? We know (as you pointed out) that we need $\text{MB}=\text{MC}$ for allocative efficiency. But we can't just go out and tell consumers whether to buy or not. We have to give them the incentive to make the efficient choice on their own. The way this is achieved is by setting the price such that only consumers for whom purchasing is efficient will be willing to buy. 

Let's start with an environment in which there is only ever a single pledge level. The question at hand is: how do we choose the dollar amount of that level to maximise revenue (income)? Observation 1: your probability distribution implies a demand curve. We can plot the cumulative distribution of willingness to pledge and it will probably look roughly like this (with most of the mass at the bottom, as you speculate):
