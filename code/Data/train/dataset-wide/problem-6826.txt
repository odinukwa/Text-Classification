This question boils down to asking why business cycles exist and change employment in shocks. One possibility is that employment is sticky or not worth changing constantly. A firm cannot constantly calculate and evaluate worker productivity and general profitability without a, perhaps rather expensive, cost, especially if the firm is very large. Constantly hiring and firing to try and have "optimal" employment for a firm is also bad for morale. And perhaps more to the point, the alternative to firing people in large swathes is lowering wages, which is even worse for worker morale and sometimes not really legal (e.g. salaries are fixed for a year). So if there is a recession for example, a firm will generally choose to keep wages up, and then when it can't afford such a scenario anymore, it will create large layoffs. Further Reading: The cost of firing changes the dynamics of how people are fired as well. See this article about France and Spain's different changes in employment with respect to the Great Recession. It is possible to prevent large drops in unemployment. Whether it is efficient is another question. My answer only briefly touches on the theory, and there is plenty of literature related to the points I've made that you can look for. 

Credit cards are a way of deferring payment in the form of inter-temporal substitution; it helps reduce the household's liquidity constraint that may prevent it from consumption smoothing as much as they would like if their transitory income was much more spread over the household's lifetime. You are right that the amount of money doesn't change. Loans require giving away money, but credit cards are a way of creating debt, so banks do not need to hold more cash to give a line of credit like you suggest. 

You may find better help in the Math SE, but let's see if we can help here. So we can arrange your system as such: \begin{align} s_1 - \frac{1}{3} s_2 & = 2 \\ -\frac{1}{8} s_1 + s_2& = 7 \\ \end{align} So we form the matrix setup: $$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1/3 \\ -1/8 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} s_1 \\ s_2 \\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 7 \\ \end{bmatrix} $$ You can multiply the matrices out to see that you get the same system. The first step of solving any system, regardless of method, is to always check for linear dependence of the coefficient matrix. $$ \det \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1/3 \\ -1/8 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} = (1 \cdot 1) - (-1/3 \cdot -1/8) = \frac{23}{24} \neq 0 $$ So Cramer's rule is indeed useable here. To solve for $s_1$. You replace the column for $s_1$ with the answer matrix and divide the determinant of that by the determinant of the original coefficient matrix. Use a similar process for $s_2$ $$ s_1^* = \frac {\det \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1/3 \\ 7 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}} {\det \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1/3 \\ -1/8 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}} = \frac{\frac{13}{3}}{\frac{23}{24}} = \frac{104}{23} $$ $$ s_2^* = \frac {\det \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -1/8 & 7 \\ \end{bmatrix}} {\det \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1/3 \\ -1/8 & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix}} = \frac{\frac{29}{4}}{\frac{23}{24}} = \frac{174}{23} $$ And then we're done. Plug in the answers and make sure they work. 

Keep in mind that during the 7 years of famine in the Bible, there was still a negative production shock that more than likely produced a heavy recession for some of those seven years as workers tried to reallocate their labor to something more useful than agriculture. A recession merely represents a fall in final goods production. The grain that was saved up doesn't represent production for that period (rather it would be for the previous seven years of economic boom). The grain stored up represents savings rather than production. It doesn't look like Joseph or Pharaoh told the people that the famine was coming (imagine the panic), so workers wouldn't have predicted the change in permanent income, and their intertemporal substitution would be much smaller because of the error in their adaptive/rational expectations. Joseph merely used taxes (one-fifth of each year's harvest) to engage in consumption smoothing. So to answer most of your questions, food storage doesn't prevent negative output shocks. It merely is a hedge against them. Arguably most people should try to have emergency savings of their own to hedge against recessions of their own, but especially in America, we are not very good at saving money. We also have a lot of population who live paycheck to paycheck, and are liquidity constrained, unable to consumption smooth according to their predictions in permanent income, even if they want to. 

The first roughly means that you need an infinite number of operations to expand out the actual Riemann-Zeta function. The second roughly means 0 is no longer an additive identity and/or associativity of addition breaks down. These things combined mean that you're gonna have weird issues treating infinite sums as if they were finite sums where you can do EZ-PZ operations with. It's almost as if you have to define the very concept of infinity as two separate, contradicting definitions. Treating infinite sums as finite sums could be interesting in theoretical topics. But with my money? I don't think my accountant would appreciate me going in and saying that my finite sum of money can be treated as an infinite sum of money. 

The Gale-Shapley Algorithm is a way of matchmaking between two different entities of people. It guarantees that every individual player is matched and that the matches are stable. What sort of literature has been done building off of this? How does social welfare change when the two entities do not have the same number of individuals in them, so that not everyone can be matched? Are there faster ways to match individuals with each other (lower runtime?). And most importantly, what sort of applications does the Gale-Shapley algorithm have in economics? It seems like a very weird game theoretic model just because when I read the proof for the validity of the algorithm, it doesn't seem like the problem is "discrete"; that is, optimizing who gets matched with who and finding a Pareto efficient result can't be solved through maximizing a continuous function. (As a side question, is the Gale-Shapley allocation Pareto efficient?) Edit I meant to say, in the second paragraph, "it seems like the problem IS "discrete". So my apologies there. 

Now when you take this original model, what happens if we allow for quitting? No worker will want to quit since the solution is time consistent. There is no reason to quit the job if you found it optimal to accept a job in a previous period. So the model as is can't account for quitting. Some ways you can tweak the model though to change the optimal reservation wage over time is to change $C$ to be time varying. Maybe if you have more security over other periods, you might quit to look for a better job that will take you. You could also change $F(w)$ to be time varying. Maybe over time the wages available to someone of your skills rise. In Joanovic's matching model, "tenure" makes your wages increase over time, so that could affect the decision to quit. Maybe your agent isn't risk neutral and their risk preferences change over time. 

Take your two beginning expressions and cross multiply them: $$p_1 c_1^F = p_2 c_2^F$$ $$p_1 c_1^H = p_2 c_2^H$$ Then subtract each right hand side for both equations. Multiply one of the expressions by $-1$ on each side: $$p_1 c_1^F - p_2 c_2^F = 0$$ $$-p_1 c_1^H + p_2 c_2^H = 0$$ And set each expression equal to each other: $$p_1 c_1^F - p_2 c_2^F = -p_1 c_1^H + p_2 c_2^H$$ Put the $p_1$ and $p_2$ terms together: $$p_1 c_1^F + p_1 c_1^H = p_2 c_2^F + p_2 c_2^H$$ Factor the $p_1$ and $p_2$ terms and rearrange: $$p_1 (c_1^F + c_1^H) = p_2 (c_2^F + c_2^H) \implies \frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{c_2^F + c_2^H}{c_1^F+ c_1^H}$$ 

Also, suppose that it is illegal for schoolteachers to give subsidies to ensure trades in the fourth case. The lack of Coasian bargaining is particularly bad for the teacher, whose disutility from listening to little tykes fight would be less than the disutility of just subsidizing the trade. 

Hint: Notice that there is no discount factor between the two periods. Consumption between the two periods are perfect substitutes; if the consumer, they will spend all their income in the lower price period, if possible. So there are two cases the firm considers. Either the consumer does not know the space that price is draw from, $\{\bar{p},\underline{p}\}$, with probability $1 -\alpha$, or the consumer does know this with probability $\alpha$. If the consumer "doesn't know" $P$, then the rest of this question depends on whether the consumer knows the distribution of $P$, but not the value of $P$ itself in the second period, which is unclear to me given the question. If the consumer does know the distribution of $P$ (which is what I'm assuming), but not the value, then they won't consume anything in period 1 if $\frac{w}{p_1} < \frac{1}{2}(\frac{w}{\bar{p}}+\frac{w}{\underline{p}})$, since the expected amount of goods you could buy with wealth $w$ next period will be lower, so spending all income in that period would maximize expected utility. Note it wouldn't simply be $p_1 > \frac{1}{2}(\bar{p}+\underline{p})$ being the condition. Then think about what happens if the consumer knows the value of $P$ next period and how they would act. Finally, the firm, knowing this and the weight of $\alpha$, will try to maximize expected profit (we don't have a cost function, so expected revenue) with respect to $p_1 \in \mathbb{R}$. $$\max_{p_1} \ \Pi(p_1, P) = p_1E(c_1) + E(P)E(c_2)$$ Edit: Oh, if you were instructed specifically to use a Bellman, good luck. It looks like you're on the right track in general. 

Hint: To find equilibrium price and quantity, you want to find when the system is in equilibrium. In equilibrium, quantity demanded should equal quantity supplied. $$Q_d = Q_s \implies -300,000P + 6,000,000 = 200,000 \sum_{i=1}^n (c_i'(q_i))^2 - 200,000$$ Where $c_i(q_i)$ is the cost function for firm $i$ with respect to $q_i$, firm $i$'s production. I'm assuming when you wrote $MC$ you meant marginal cost. $$\implies 6,200,000 - 200,000\sum_{i=1}^n (c_i'(q_i))^2 = 300,000P$$ $$\implies P = \frac{62}{3} - \frac{2}{3} \sum_{i=1}^n (c_i'(q_i))^2$$ Now that we have an inverse demand function with respect to $q$, we have to solve the firms' maximization problem. Since there's no information you've given to us directly about that, let's assume technology is homogeneous and that firms compete via Cournot competition. $$\Pi_j = q_j(P(q)) - c(q_j)$$ $$\Pi_j = q_j(\frac{62}{3} - \frac{2}{3} \sum_{i=1}^n (c'(q_i))^2) - c(q_j)$$ Now take the derivative w.r.t $q_j$ and set to zero to find the maximum. $$\Pi_j' = (\frac{62}{3} - \frac{2}{3} \sum_{i=1, i \neq j}^n (c'(q_i))^2) + \frac{2}{3} \frac{d}{dq_j} (c'(q_j)^2 \cdot q_j) - c'(q_j) = 0$$ Where that derivative is evaluated with the product and chain rule. From here, you solve for $q_j$ as an expression of all $q_{i, i \neq j}$. Since the cost functions are homogeneous, it shouldn't be that bad to do. Also remember that the number of suppliers is 1000, so the problem can be further simplified: $$\Pi_j' = (\frac{62}{3} - \frac{2}{3} \cdot 999(c'(q_i))^2) + \frac{2}{3} \frac{d}{dq_j} (c'(q_j)^2 \cdot q_j) - c'(q_j) = 0$$ $$\implies \Pi_j' = (\frac{62}{3} - 666(c'(q_i))^2) + \frac{2}{3} (2c'(q_j) \cdot c''(q_j) \cdot q_j + c'(q_j)^2) - c'(q_j) = 0$$ and then you solve for $q_j$ in terms of $q_{i, i \neq j}$ and do the rest of the Cournot derivation.
