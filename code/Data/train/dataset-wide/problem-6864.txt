How do we go about using it in Economics? 1) We gather all available alternative choices, say $A, B, C$ 2) We measure (in whatever way appropriate for the situation) the benefit from each choice, say $G_A, G_B, G_C$. 3) The opportunity cost of choice $A$, say $OC_A$ is defined as the maximum benefit among the benefits of the alternative choices : $$OC_A \equiv \max \{G_B, G_C\}$$ If $G_A - OC_A <0$ obviously we will be better off by choosing something else, and not $A$. And that's that. Standard example: you have some money and the only choices available are $A$ to put it in a bank account yielding $3\%$ interest and $B$ to put it in another bank account that yields $4\%$ interest. The direct benefit of choice $A$ is $3\%$ and its opportunity cost is the direct benefit from the alternative choice $B$, i.e. $4\%$. This does not mean that $A$'s "net benefit" is $3\% - 4\% = -1\%$. This operation just tells us that we have better choices than $A$. Again, it does not, in any meaningful way, say something like "so the net benefit from choosing $A$ is $-1\%$. It only says "if we choose $A$ we will actually get $3\%$ direct benefit, but we would have get $1$ percentage point more if we had chosen $B$" (an even funnier fallacy here is to say, "so I got $3\%$ and I foregone $1\%$, so my "true benefit = gains (-) losses" therefore true benefit is $3\%-1\%=2\%$" -so sir, can you please hand me this $1\%$ the bank gave you on top of your true benefit? Thank you so much). Turning to your example, the direct benefit of choosing $x^*=0$ is $3$. The highest opportunity cost of choosing $x^*$ will come from choosing $x'=\epsilon>0$. This will have direct benefit $3-\epsilon$, which is the highest opportunity cost of choosing $x^*$. Perform if you want the subtracting operation, $3-(3-\epsilon) = \epsilon >0$. The important result is that we get a positive number: so the benefit from choosing $x^*$ is greater than the benefit from choosing any available alternative. It is not the case that the "net benefit" from choosing $x$ is $\epsilon$ (again, since you will get $3$, can you please give me the $3-\epsilon$ which is above your "net benefit"?) My impression is that this confusion surrounding the correct use of opportunity costs has psychological roots together with the use of the word "opportunity" in a different context: the "feelings of disappointment"(disutility) from "missed opportunities", that one may experience when he learns that he could have gotten more, which appear to "subtract" from the utility gained from what he actually got. Indeed, but in such a case, the missed opportunity was not known/available as an alternative choice during the time of decision. One could attempt to construct a utility function accommodating such behavior, but this is a totally different issue, it has nothing to do with how "opportunity cost" is defined and used in Economics. 

The passage quoted is (at least) sloppy as regards language, in that it writes first "relatively less expensive", and then uses "even more", which would be correct if previously it had described a "more" expensive rather than a "less" expensive situation. What happens here is that, under the assumption that Purchasing Power Parity holds (or tends to hold), we have $$\pi = \pi^* - \dot S/S$$ Where $\pi$ is local inflation, $\pi^*$ is "foreign" inflation, and $\dot S/S$ is the growth rate of "local" exchange rate (units of foreign currency per unit of local currency). Then, if $\pi > \pi^* \implies \dot S/S <0 \implies \dot S <0$, at least as a tendency, and the local currency will, eventually, depreciate. For clarity, assume that we start from a situation where both inflation rates are zero. Then, local positive inflation happens, for some local reason. Initially, before the exchange rate starts to adjust, local exports become more expensive for the foreigners (as the answer by @user3522240 describes), while imports (whose nominal price in terms of foreign currency has not changed, due to zero foreign inflation) become relatively less expensive, with "relatively" referring to the relative contribution of imported resources to local costs of production, compared to the cost of local resources. Imports do not become "cheaper" in nominal terms, in either currency. Only their percentage contribution to total costs becomes smaller. But since eventually, we assume that the exchange rate will depreciate, weakening the local currency, the nominal cost of imports in terms of local currency will increase. But this will now increase the total cost of production in terms of local currency, and it will tend to add inflation to the already existing, locally generated, inflation rate, as firms will attempt to pass this imports-linked increase in costs to consumers. APPENDIX The Purchasing Power Parity in terms of inflation rates is derived as follows: Denote $P$ the local price level and $P^*$ the foreign price level. Then PPP is expressed as $$P\cdot S = P^*$$ Differentiate with respect to time, $$\dot PS + P\dot S = \dot P^*$$ Manipulate (and use the PPP relation) $$\implies \frac {\dot P}{P}S + \frac {P}{P}\dot S = \frac {\dot P^*}{P^*}\frac {P^*}{P} \implies \pi S + \dot S = \pi^* S$$ Divide by $S$ and re-arrange to obtain $$\pi = \pi^* - \dot S/S$$ 

As regards the first question, the "$p_t=...$" expression is conceptually and qualitatively useful because, at the optimum, it relates price with consumption and expectations. Mathematically it is an implicit function of course, so it is not a "closed-form solution" to "tell us how to find $p_t$". Cochrane acknowledges this as he writes in p. 6 

This question as is (October 2, 2015, 15:07 Athens time) should be closed and I voted to that effect. I provide an answer in order to show why it should be closed. As any natural or legal entity, the "Fed" engages in strategic behavior. Strategic behavior is not a priori constrained by moral considerations (and this is why Game Theory has come under fire for moral reasons in a normative approach). Under strategic behavior anything goes at first, and then the actual course of action is decided based on whatever constraint the decision maker feels it has to take into account, for whatever reasons. Therefore "manipulation of facts" of any short and to any degree may in principle be employed in order for the decision maker to (attempt to) reach its goals. So the question as is has the above trivial and uninformative answer. It could be improved by asking, for example: 

Interestingly I could not locate quantitative data on Firing Costs (aka Separation Costs aka Severance Pay) for the US Economy. Perhaps because, as US Dpt of Labor says 

There is a historical-sociological reason why, despite USA being considered the "fortress of capitalism" (which in principle allows for an arbitrary degree of wealth and income inequality),still, rich people are taxed less in Europe (which supposedly takes a more, ahem, "socialist" approach), even if we exclude indirect taxes: In Europe with its historical burden, prior to the industrial revolution the aristocracy had its wealth in land, since we are talking about agricultural economies. The central authorities of the day (the King) taxed the aristocrats which in turn, in order to cover both the King's taxes and their own living, taxed the peasants with exorbitant "tax rates", in the form of almost total appropriation of agricultural produce, given the socio-economic laws of the era. So for centuries land per se was not essentially taxed (after all it was "god-given"): it was labor that was taxed almost to death. Add to this the fact that these social arrangements were embedded in a theocratic system that gave them religious credence, count again the length of time that it lasted, and we can perhaps understand why modern Property taxes in Europe tend to be lower than Property taxes in USA, were the apparently more individualistic culture cuts both ways -meaning that the State has also and "individualistic" approach to things: if it is after a certain amount of revenues, it has fewer qualms to take them where it can find them. In Europe the same concern, constrained by tradition not to be wholly fulfilled through Property taxes, and ideologically and socially pressed to exhibit a redistributional character in income taxation, has led to larger indirect taxes, like VAT. So either including or not indirect taxes, the tendency goes in the same direction: relative tax burden is heavier for "Europe's poorer", than "USA's poorer". Of course this does not conclude on whether it is better to "be poor in USA or in Europe", since one should also quantify the social benefits that the poorer receive in Europe compared to the USA, as regards, education, health, direct subsidies, etc. 

The $\mathbf M = \mathbf I-\mathbf X(\mathbf X'\mathbf X)^{-1}\mathbf X'$ matrix is the "annihilator" or "residual maker" matrix associated with matrix $\mathbf X$. It is called "annihilator" because $\mathbf M\mathbf X =0$ (for its own $X$ matrix of course). Is is called "residual maker" because $\mathbf M \mathbf y =\mathbf {\hat e}$, in the regression $\mathbf y = \mathbf X \beta + \mathbf e$. It is a symmetric and idempotent matrix. It is used in the proof of the Gauss-Markov theorem. Also, it is used in the Frisch–Waugh–Lovell theorem, from which one can obtain results for the "partitioned regression", that says that in the model (in matrix form) $$\mathbf y = \mathbf X_1\beta_1 + \mathbf X_2\beta_2 + \mathbf u$$ we have that $$\hat \beta_1 = (\mathbf X_1'\mathbf M_2\mathbf X_1)^{-1}(\mathbf X_1'\mathbf M_2)\mathbf y $$ Since $\mathbf M_2$ is idempotent we can re-write the above by $$\hat \beta_1 = (\mathbf X_1'\mathbf M_2\mathbf M_2\mathbf X_1)^{-1}(\mathbf X_1'\mathbf M_2\mathbf M_2)\mathbf y$$ and since $M_2$ is also symmetric we have $$\hat \beta_1 = ([\mathbf M_2\mathbf X_1]'[\mathbf M_2\mathbf X_1])^{-1}([\mathbf M_2\mathbf X_1]'[\mathbf M_2\mathbf y]$$ But this is the least-squares estimator from the model $$[\mathbf M_2\mathbf y] = [\mathbf M_2\mathbf X_1]\beta_1 + \mathbf M_2\mathbf u$$ and also $\mathbf M_2\mathbf y$ are the residuals from regressing $\mathbf y$ on the matrix $\mathbf X_2$ only. In other words: 1) If we regreess $\mathbf y$ on the matrix $\mathbf X_2$ only, and then regress the residuals from this estimation on the matrix $\mathbf M_2\mathbf X_1$ only, the $\hat \beta_1$ estimates we will obtain will be mathematically equal to the estimates we will obtain if we regress $\mathbf y$ on both $\mathbf X_1$ and $\mathbf X_2$ together at the same time, as a usual multiple regression. Now, assume that $\mathbf X_1$ is not a matrix but just one regressor, say $\mathbf x_1$. Then $\mathbf M_2 \mathbf x_1$ is the residuals from regressing the variable $X_1$ on the regressor matrix $\mathbf X_2$. And this provides the intuition here: $\hat \beta_1$ gives us the effect that "the part of $X_1$ that is unexplained by $\mathbf X_2$" has on "the part of $Y$ that is left unexplained by $\mathbf X_2$". This is an emblematic part of classic Least-Squares Algebra. 

As mentioned in the other answer, the Lagrange multiplier is the marginal effect on the value (optimized) function, when the constrained is "relaxed" marginally. In your case then it should be interpreted "how much studying time changes as the required average expected grade..." increases? Well, this is a good example to show that how we set up the Lagrangian function matters in order to interpret what we get meaningfully. Your is a minimization case so we have $$\min T = t_1+ t_2 \\ s.t\;\;\; \displaystyle m-\frac{[{g}_{1}({t}_{1})+{g}_{2}({t}_{2})]}{2}=0$$ How do we write the Lagrangian? Do we write $$\Lambda = t_1+ t_2 + \lambda\left[m-\frac{[{g}_{1}({t}_{1})+{g}_{2}({t}_{2})]}{2}\right]$$ or $$\Lambda = t_1+ t_2 - \lambda\left[m-\frac{[{g}_{1}({t}_{1})+{g}_{2}({t}_{2})]}{2}\right]$$ Since the constraint is an equality constraint, you may hear that "it doesn't matter". Mathematically, it indeed doesn't, but it does matter when the time comes to interpret the value of the multiplier. And, maybe in Utility maximization problems we don't much care because utility is ordinal. But in a problem like the one the OP is solving, the objective function is measured in a very real and measurable and quantifiable unit, time. Now how we should understand "what happens when the constraint is relaxed"? In the specific minimization problem, it intuitively means "what happens when the required $m$ is reduced". (Since "relax" has a "desirable" connotation, and so we would desire to be asked for less effort, a lower target). I guess it is now clear how the obtained value for $\lambda$ can be interpreted. And do ponder what variant of the Lagrangian is the appropriate one for your case. 

The authors are concerned with dynamics, hence the mention of "initial conditions". If one wanted to turn their conclusions into the static case with just one move to equilibrium, one should consider in which "basin of attraction" does the zero output vector belongs. 

The answer by @EconJohn covers the case of a constant price elasticity of demand. To model a varying price elasticity of demand you employ the semi-log specification, $$\ln(Q_d)=\beta_0-\beta_1 P+\beta_2 S+\mu$$ $$\implies Q_d = \exp \{\beta_0-\beta_1 P+\beta_2 S+\mu\}$$ Here, the price elasticity of demand is (use "marginal over average") $$\eta = -\frac {\beta_1 \cdot Q_d}{Q_d/P} = -\beta_1P$$ and it is increasing in price, which is intuitive (the higher the price level, the more "jittery" the consumers, the more "itchy" to go). Of course the numerical estimate of the coefficients in the two specifications will be different, since they represent different things in each case. 

The "second" constraint appears redundant and it confuses matters. Re-arrange the first one to obtain $$\tilde{a}_{t+1} = \big[\tilde a_t+(1-\delta )Y_t-\tilde{c}_t\big]R_t$$ This tells us that wealth in the beginning of next period is fully determined by current-period decisions and known states, without any uncertainty whatsoever: we start with the given wealth at the beginning of the period, our income and the interest rate becomes known, we decide and "set aside" the full amount of consumption (for the whole period, at the beginning of the period), and the rest becomes interest-bearing asset. Why the second constraint, which looks into the future, confuses matters? Because in order to apply Dynamic Programming/Bellman equation, it has to be the case that our optimization problem can be formulated as a recursive one, meaning that the whole many-periods or even infinite-horizon problem can be broken down to a two-period problem. And we have this condition in the above constraint, we do not need the second one. If $V(\tilde a_t)$ is the value function, the Bellman equation is then $$V(\tilde a_t) = \max_{\tilde c_t}\big [u(\tilde c_t) + \beta V(\tilde a_{t+1})\big]$$ and we must find the policy function $h(\tilde a_t)=\tilde c_t$ that satisfies $$V(\tilde a_t) = u[h(\tilde a_t)] + \beta V\left[\big(\tilde a_t+(1-\delta )Y_t-h(\tilde a_t)\big)\cdot R_t\right]$$ 

(I guess a long answer can be fitting to a long question...) The current state of knowledge as to "how to run a socioeconomic area (SEA)" could be grossly summarized as follows: There is a Government that has the right to collect taxes and conducts fiscal policy, in order to provide some public goods, and also to partially smooth economic inequality through redistribution (not because we are good and humanitarian people, but so as not for the inequality to eventually threaten the SEA's existence). There is the area's fiat money, backed by the Government's sovereignty. There is a Central Bank that makes loans to the Government, so as for monetary policy to be a "negotiated outcome" between the Government and the Central Bank, attempting to partly offset the short-horizon that politicians are forced (or like) to have. The Central Bank has also the role of "lender of last resort" for the commercial banks, so as to secure the stability of the fiat money system. If a SEA-wide shock hits, and an economic recession or crisis sets in, monetary policy can be used in what is in effect a "reverse-causation" scheme: instead of first producing and then creating the money in order to match this new production for exchange purposes, we first create the fiat money, that now functions as windfall-wealth, in order to increase demand and thus generate new production that will eventually match the money (that's what "demand side policy" is all about). If the economy is in a recession, and there is a large amount of unemployed factors of production, it has some good chances of succeeding (i.e. the increased demand will activate again factors of production rather than just create inflation). Note that the use of fiscal policy in such a situation essentially amounts to the same thing -but instead of strengthening the demand of the private sector towards the private sector, it is the government that directly, through fiscal policy, purposefully raises aggregate demand in order to induce supply. If an asymmetric shock hits selectively only some parts of the SEA, then the government can use its tax revenues for (usually geographic, but also sectoral) redistributive purposes, channeling resources to the regions/sectors that are hit. Moreover, if factors of production are mobile enough, they will move towards the comparatively more economically healthy regions/sectors, alleviating the problem of production factors' unemployment, which if it persists, will create a social problem, and will threaten the SEA's cohesion. Now consider the European Union: It has a currency alright, and a Central Bank -but the Central Bank is not permitted to act as a lender of last resort proper -the currently observed "quantitative easing" is a silently accepted bending (not breaking) of the official rules of the ECB. Why deprive the European Central Bank of such a fundamental function of a central bank? Because it was Germany's non-negotiable condition in order to create a common currency, originating from Germany's experience with hyperinflation. Germany did not impose this to others, having made an exception for itself: when there was still a Deutsche mark, Germany's central bank also was not permitted to act as a lender of last resort for the commercial banks (and Germany's economy proved strong enough to not ever come in need of such a safety valve). The EU also has a "Government" (the European Commission) -but its fiscal budget is so small compared to the EU's economy, that it cannot adequately perform any redistributive function to the required degree, in the case of an asymmetric shock (redistribution happens alright -but it is slow and long-term). Also, members' national budgets are under scrutiny and hard-pressed at a political level in order not to go south. Finally, due to history and culture, factors of production, especially human ones, have very low mobility. So while a SEA-wide shock is not really likely for such a diverse area like the EU, asymmetric shocks are much more likely for the very same reasons -and it is for these asymmetric shocks that the EU is really lacking the tools to deal with, at least the tools that are currently known and used. Therefore, it appears that we have to concede that the European Union, including monetary union, was a "premature" action, if judged by macroeconomic criteria: on the balance, the tangible economic benefits appear to be outweighed by the hardships introduced. Theoretically, we should have first wait for economic homogeneity and integration to happen or nearly-happen, and then strengthen it through the creation of the EU. And indeed, this was the original plan: the European Union started as partial (country-wise and sector-wise) economic semi-unions here and there, to slowly and gradually help economic integration -and then it accelerated, because the global geopolitical situation suddenly changed and (deep) uncertainty once more ruled the land... ...We should make a mental effort to imagine what the experience of two devastating World Wars (which are not that old, anyway), has imprinted on this continent. The forced/hurried economic unity/integration represented by the EU, was and still is in my opinion mainly an attempt to lay these continent-wide nightmares to rest. Since this is a "negative" motive, it is only natural that "positive" motives emerged in the process. Especially after the crisis of 2008, one could argue with some strength that currently, the European Union is little more than "feeling asphyxiated, but sticking together, grinding our teeth"... ...So, perhaps "everyone should exit"? The real issue as I see it is whether the alternative will be eventually along the lines of (economically and/or physically) "sharpening our teeth to each others' neck" -or not.
