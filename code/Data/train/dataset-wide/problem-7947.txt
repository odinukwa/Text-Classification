The following is not strictly speaking something that can be read off from the character table. However, it is an elementary combinatorial identity about partitions which one can deduce from understanding the character theory of symmetric groups well enough, and looking at the character table does play a central role: For $\lambda \vdash n$ a partition of $n$ (i.e., $n = 1 \lambda_1 + 2 \lambda_2 + \cdots + n \lambda_n$) define $$ A(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} n^{\lambda_n}, \qquad B(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (\lambda_n)! $$ Claim: $$\prod_{\lambda \vdash n} A(\lambda) = \prod_{\lambda \vdash n} B(\lambda) $$ The character-theoretic proof proceeds as follows: 

$Fl(V)$ is a very geometric object over $X$, so we might as well ask that we actually have a formula for $E^*(Fl(V))$ in terms of $E^*(X)$. If $E^*$ is "reasonable" (i.e., has Chern classes giving rise to a "projective bundle formula") then iteratively applying the projective bundle formula will give such a thing, and in fact show that $E^*(X)$ is a direct summand of $E^*(Fl(V))$. (My favorite:) There's a nice way of strengthening Condition 1' that also holds in all reasonable cases, and that looks rather natural. You can ask that $Fl(V) \to X$ behave like a "covering", i.e. that (Condition 2:) $$ E^*(X) \to E^*(Fl(V)) \to E^*\left(Fl(V) \times_X Fl(V)\right) $$ is an equalizer diagram. (So not only is pullback injective, but you can identify its image...) (In fact, in reasonable cases it'll be a split equalizer diagram, related to the direct summand thing above.) 

There's also a different way of writing down the $H$-space structure, that I like for its algebro-geometric flavor. (I'll talk about $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ here, and $\mathbb{R}P^\infty$ should be analogous.) Regarding $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ as a classifying space for complex line bundles, we know that this $H$-space structure is supposed to implement "tensor product of line bundles". In a (not very explicit) sense this tells us the homotopy class of $\mathbb{C}P^\infty \times \mathbb{C}P^\infty \to \mathbb{C}P^\infty$: It represents the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(1,1) = p_1^* \mathcal{O}(1) \otimes p_2^* \mathcal{O}(1)$. We can use this description to write down a much more explicit (and classical) explicit representative. First, let's recall what the analogous picture looks like for finite projective spaces. The line bundle $\mathcal{O}(1,1)$ determines (upon picking generating sections) the Segre map $\mathbb{C}P^n \times \mathbb{C}P^m \to \mathbb{C}P^{nm+n+m}$ which takes (in homogeneous coordinates) $([X_0:\ldots:X_n] , [Y_0:\ldots:Y_m]) \mapsto[X_0 Y_0: \ldots : X_i Y_j: \ldots: X_n Y_m]$ where I'm choosing to be vague on the precise ordering of the coordinates. (In the end this won't matter up to homotopy, as the maps will become homotopic upon composing with $\mathbb{C}P^{nm+n+m} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}P^\infty$.) The analogous formula with infinitely many homogeneous coordinate makes just as much sense, one just has to a good ordering of pairs of non-negative integers. Such an infinite Segre map gives another realization of the $H$-space structure. 

I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for (and there's a good chance you already know what I'm going to write) but let me give it a try: The realization functor of cyclic sets (not spaces!) to $S^1$-spaces can be made part of a Quillen equivalence for two of the three commonly desired model structures on $S^1$-spaces: The model structure that gives you "Spaces over $BS^1$" is given in a 1985 paper of Dwyer-Hopkins-Kan, while a model structure that gives you the equivalences that you want (i.e., checked on fixed sets for finite subgroups) is given in a 1995 paper "Strong homotopy theory of cyclic sets" by Jan Spalinksi. (Irrelevant to your question, but along the same lines: A recent paper of Andrew Blumberg describes how one can throw in some extra--still combinatorial--data and obtain a combinatorial model of the third desirable model structure on $S^1$-spaces, namely where equivalences are those that induce equivalences on fixed sets for all closed subgroups.) Spalinksi's model structure depends on the following construction of $|X_{.}|^{C_n}$ (as a space-over-$BS^1$) in terms of the subdivision construction: The simplicial set $(sd_r X)_n = X_{r(n+1)-1}$ has an action of $C_r$--since $C_r$ is a subgroup of the copy of $C_{r(n+1)}$ acting on $X_{r(n+1)-1}$; taking fixed points (in sSet) and then realizing gives $|X_{.}|^{C_n}$. This suggests (though I haven't checked too carefully) that remembering each $X_n$ as a $C_{n+1}$-space (in the sense you suggest, with subgroups) is enough, as you expected. 

If $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ is a imaginary quadratic field with discriminant $-D$, then we get Heegner points on $X_0(N)$ as long as there exists $\mathfrak{n} \subset \mathcal{O}_K$ such that $\mathcal{O}_K/\mathfrak{n} \simeq \mathbb{Z}/N$. For this to happen, we need all of the primes $p \mid N$ to either split or ramify in $\mathcal{O}_K$. Gross-Zagier was originally proved when the "Heegner hypothesis" is satisfied, i.e. all of the primes $p$ split. However, in applications, this hypothesis is not always satisfied. However, Heegner's original paper used $D \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$ and $N = 32$, so $2 \mid N$ is inert. How do you get points on $X_0(N)$ in this situation? I couldn't find an English translation or summary of Heegner's paper, and am confused as to how this works. 

Let $k = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{m})$, where $m \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$. Let $\epsilon$ be the fundamental unit of $k$ satisfying $\epsilon > 1$. A paper I'm reading involves studying the 2-torsion fields of elliptic curves $E/k$ which have global minimal models and everywhere good reduction. The fields $k(\sqrt{\pm \epsilon})$ come up a lot, and the paper constantly considers the cases $N_{k/\mathbb{Q}}(\epsilon) = 1$ and $N_{k/\mathbb{Q}}(\epsilon) = -1$ separately. I don't really get how $N(\epsilon)$ controls the structure of $k(\sqrt{\pm \epsilon})/\mathbb{Q}$. For example, the paper states that if $N(\epsilon) = 1$, then the field extensions are Galois. Why is this true, and in general what does the sign of the norm of an element tell you? Since the sign goes away when you consider norms of ideals, I've never really thought about this. Sorry if there's just a basic Galois theory / algebraic number theory fact I'm missing! 

Given a polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $d$, consider the following three sets: $$N_1(x) = \#\{k \leq x: f(k) \text{ is square-free}\}$$ $$N_2(x) = \#\{n \leq x: n = f(k) \text{ is square-free}\}$$ $$N_3(x) = \#\{n \leq x: n \text{ is the square-free part of $f(k)$}\}$$ Generally, we should have that $N_1(x) \sim c x$ (not proven for large degrees, assumes that $f$ satisfies the necessary congruence conditions). Then $N_2(x) \sim c' x^{1/d}$. What do we know about the growth of $N_3(x)$? Do we get significantly more values by considering square-free parts and not just square-free values? Any references for this would be appreciated. Edit: Changed from big-O notation to make order of growth more precise. 

I have an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}(t)$, and I want to compute its rank. Does knowing the rank over $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ for some prime of good reduction give a bound on the rank over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$? I noticed that magma can compute 2 Selmer groups for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, so I was wondering if that would give me some info on the rank over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$. Or more generally, how would you go about computing the rank of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$? Note: I've read Stewart and Top's paper "On Ranks of Twists of Elliptic Curves and Power-Free Values of Binary Forms", but am wondering about other techniques. 

I'm reading "On Ranks of Twists of Elliptic Curves and Power-Free Values of Binary Forms" by Stewart and Top, and struggling to understand the argument on pg 962 which shows that the rank of a particular elliptic curve $E_{D(t)}/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is exactly 2. Here are the relevant details: Start with the elliptic curve $$E/\mathbb{Q}: y^2 = x^3 + 1$$ and the polynomial $$D(t) = 2t(t - 1)(t + 1)(2t + 1)(t + 2) \in \mathbb{Z}[t].$$ Let $C/\mathbb{Q}$ be the curve given by $s^3 = D(t)$ and let $$E_D/\mathbb{Q}(t): y^2 = x^3 + D(t)^2.$$ For each point $P = (x(t), y(t))$ in $E_D(\mathbb{Q}(t))$, we define an element $\phi_P$ of $\text{Mor}_\mathbb{Q}(C, E)$ by $$\phi_P(t, s) = (x(t)/s^2, y(t)/s^3).$$ Then we have a map $$\lambda: E_D(\mathbb{Q}(t)) \to H^0(C, \Omega^1_{C/\mathbb{Q}})$$ given by $$\lambda(P) = \phi_P^\ast \omega_E$$ which is shown to be a homomorphism with finite kernel. We want to use this homomorphism to show that the rank of $E_D/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is exactly two. First, we can find two points, and show they are independent by looking at their images under $\lambda$. This is fine, and shows that the rank is at least 2. Next, we want to show that the rank is at most 2. We know that the image lands in $H^0(C, \Omega^1_{C/\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_3))$, the eigenspace on which the automorphism of $C$ given by $\zeta(t, s) = (t, \zeta_3 s)$ acts on differentials as multiplication by $\zeta_3$. This constrains the image to the 3-dimensional space, say spanned by $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$ (this numbering is different from the paper). All of this makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense is how the authors constrain the image to a 2-dimensional subspace. They define three involutions on $C$, called $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3$, and show that the space of $\sigma_i^\ast$-invariant holomorphic differentials is generated by $\omega_i$. Hence the quotient of $C$ by $\sigma_i$ is an elliptic curve. In two cases, the curve is isogenous to $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and in the third case it is not. From this, they somehow infer that the rank is 2. I'm very confused about this, and would appreciate some more details or a reference. Thanks! 

We can think of the splitting principle as a condition on a "cohomology theory" (of some sort) $E^*$, coming about when working with Chern classes for instance, and then ask: When does $E^*$ satisfy this condition? First, let's make the condition more precise and reformulate it: Condition 1: Given $X$ and a vector bundle $V$ on $X$, there exists $f: X' \to X$ such that $f^* V'$ has a filtration with subquotients line bundles, and $f^*: E^*(X) \to E^*(X')$ is injective. But there is a universal choice for $X'$, namely the flag variety of $V$: $p: Fl(V) \to X$. Any $f: X' \to X$ with $f^* V'$ filtered with line bundle subquotients will factor through $p$, and so we're really just asking if $p^*: E^*(X) \to E^*(Fl(V))$ is injective. Condition 1': For all $X$ and $V$, $p^*: E^*(X) \to E^*(Fl(V))$ is injective. At this point there are two ways this answer can go, depending on ones tastes: 

You can somewhat lift the algebraic closedness assumption: You have to allow an auxillary ring (actually, division algebra) to act equivariantly on both representation and tensor over it. Such a decomposition should hold whenever one of the groups has semi-simple representation category (the division rings in 1 are endomorphisms of simples). Then, the decomposition can be made canonical precisely up to choosing representative simple objects. If $V$ is a $G \times H$-rep, and $\rho$ are representative simples for $G$, then the natural map $$ \bigoplus_{\rho} \rho \otimes_{D_\rho} Hom_G(\rho, V) \to V $$ with $D_\rho = End_G(\rho)$ will be an isomorphism of $G \times H$-modules. (Conversely, given applying such a decomposition to $k[G]$ viewed as $G \times G$-module one would have to recover a representative set of simples.) For symmetric groups (in char. $0$), the endomorphism rings of simples are just the field (i.e., the simples remain irreducible over the alg. closure), so in particular you get such decompositions. Moreover, there are explicit representative simples that one can write down (the Specht modules). I don't know of the combinatorial theory to say if this gives any sort of satisfactory answer to your question 3. 

This is not a helpful answer to your main question, but merely a negative answer to your "In particular..what happens.." question. But, the general idea may be helpful in figuring out what more precise things (weaker than Keller's result) would be reasonable to ask for. $\newcommand{\RR}{\mathbb{R}}\newcommand{\RHom}{\mathrm{RHom}}\newcommand{\pt}{\mathrm{pt}}\DeclareMathOperator{\deg}{deg}\newcommand{\RGamma}{R\Gamma}\renewcommand{\mod}{\text{-mod}}\newcommand{\C}[1]{C^\bullet(#1)}$ Since I'll lapse into this notation anyway, let me make it explicit: Identity $\gamma_M$ with the functor $$ \RGamma(M, -)\colon D \to \C{M}\mod $$ where by $\mod$ I'm implicitly working in a dg-setting. At some point below, I'll assume that $N$ is compact oriented of dimensions $n$. (This is not strictly necessary, but allows me to avoid extra notation.) Claim: Suppose that $M$ is simply connected, $\dim M \geq 2$, and that $i \colon N \hookrightarrow M$ is not the identity. Then, the functor $\gamma_M \colon D= \langle \RR_M, i_* \RR_N \rangle \to D_{A_M}$ is not fully faithful. Fuzzy Remark: Before sketching an argument, here's a "philsophical" remark about why things will go wrong: The category $D_c(M)$ feels the topology (or maybe even geometry) of $M$. In particular, it has a Proper Base-change Theorem saying something like $q^* p_! = (p')_! (q')^*$ where the maps take part in a fiber-square of (actual) topological spaces. The category $D_{A_M} = \C{M}\mod$ feels only the homotopy theory of $M$. You should expect a Base-Change Theorem in this context, but now with a fiber-square of homotopy types -- more correctly, a homotopy fiber-square. A simpler sort of 'no go' result that this heuristic implies: Suppose you had wanted to include two sub-manifolds $i_k\colon N_k \hookrightarrow M$, $k=1,2$. The $\C{M}\mod$ images would be unable to tell them apart if the $i_k$ were homotopic -- e.g., the inclusion of any two points. While the constructible theory would certain care whether the two points were the same or not. Sketch of Claim: To see this, note that $$ \RHom_{D_c(M)}(i_* \RR_N, i_* \RR_N) = \RHom_{D_c(N)}(i^* i_* \RR_N, \RR_N) = \RHom_{D_c(N)}(\RR_N, \RR_N) = \C{N} $$ while Sub-Claim: Letting $\stackrel{h}\times_M$ denote the homotopy fiber product, $$ \RHom_{A_M}(\gamma_M(i_* \RR_N), \gamma_M(i_* \RR_N)) =\RHom_{\C{M}}\left(\C{N}, \C{N}\right) \approx C_{\bullet}\left(N \stackrel{h}\times_M N\right)[-n] $$ Assuming the sub-claim: to conclude it suffices to produce homology classes on $\Omega M$ in arbitrarily positive degrees, whose images under the composite $$ H(\Omega M) \to H_*(N \stackrel{h}\times_M N) \to H_*(\Omega (M/N)) $$ are non-zero. I think the following should do this upon filling in the details: Equip $M$ with a base-point in $N$, take some non-zero element of $\pi_i M$, with $i \geq 2$, that remains non-zero in $\pi_i (M/N)$. Use it to produce an $(i-1)$-homology class on $\Omega M$, and then take its Pontrjagin products. Sketch of sub-claim: Underlying the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence is the statement that, letting $\boxtimes$ denote derived co-tensor of co-modules over a co-algebra, $$ C_\bullet(N) \boxtimes_{C_\bullet(M)} C_\bullet(N) \approx C_\bullet(N \stackrel{h}\times_M N) $$ Poincare duality gives an equivalence $\C{N} \approx C_\bullet(N)[-n]$ of $\C{M}$-modules (or $C_\bullet(M)$-comodules). It remains to identify $$ \RHom_{\C{M}}(\C{N}, \C{N}) \approx C_\bullet(N) \boxtimes_{C_\bullet(M)} \C{N} $$ by term-wise identifying the co-simplicial cobar constructions on both sides. Example: Note that if $N = \pt$ the sub-claim is a familiar statement in Koszul duality: That for $M$ simply-connected $\RHom_{\C{M}}(\RR,\RR) \approx C_\bullet(\Omega M)$. In certain cases, e.g. $M = S^{2k+1}$, you can just see it. As an aside: $C_\bullet(\Omega M)\mod$ knows about all locally-constant things, not just local systems finitely-buildable from the trivial one. (But will run into the same issues if you try to include submanifolds without explicitly adding in extra generators for the strata.) Remark: Though $\gamma_M$ is not fully-faithful here, it does get the maps into/out of $\RR_M$ right. Logic as above shows that $$ \RHom_D(\RR_M, i_* \RR_N) = \C{N} = \RHom_{\C{M}}(\C{M}, \C{N}) $$ and then Verdier Duality (for $D_c(M)$) + something like Grothendieck Duality (for $\C{M}$) give the other direction as well.
