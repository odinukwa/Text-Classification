Waldhausen, Jahren and myself proved a fiber gluing lemma for Serre fibrations, in the context of simplicial sets, that may be useful. In Propositions 2.7.10 and 2.7.12 of "Spaces of PL manifolds and categories of simple maps" $URL$ we prove that given: 

For symmetric ring spectra $R$ there is also a definition of the graded group of units, $GL_1^J(R)$, which retains information about the negative homotopy groups of $R$. See Sagave-Schlichtkrull, "Diagram spaces and symmetric spectra", Advances in Mathematics (2012). Here $J = \Sigma^{-1} \Sigma$ is a specific category, and the graded units can be viewed as spaces over $BJ \simeq QS^0$. For instance, $GL_1^J(ku)$ is different from $GL_1^J(KU)$, where $ku$ is the connective cover of the periodic complex $K$-theory spectrum $KU$. 

Compact Lie groups are finite loop spaces, but Andersen, Bauer, Grodal, Pedersen (Invent. Math., 2004) give an example of a finite loop space that is not (even rationally) homotopy equivalent to any compact Lie group. 

No. Let $B=S^1$, $F=\mathbb Z$, $E=S^1\times\mathbb Z$, and let $p$ be a two-fold covering on each component: $p(z,n)=z^2$ where $S^1$ is regarded as the unit circle in $\mathbb C$ (for the purposes of computing $z^2$). 

The T-tetromino is a T-shaped figure made of four unit squares. An $m\times n$ rectangle can be tiled by T-tetrominoes if and only if both $m$ and $n$ are multiples of 4. This was proved in a 1965 paper by D.W.Walkup, and the proof was "hands on". Some "algebraic" tricks like colouring or tiling groups can prove that $mn$ must be a multiple of 8, but they do not seem to rule out the cases like $99\times 200$ and $100\times 102$. I wonder whether a better proof of D.W.Walkup's theorem is known today. By "better" I mean applicable to non-rectangular regions as well. For example, is there a way to determine what 6-gons (8-gons, ...) admit tiling by T-tetrominoes? 

The answer to your third question is "yes". A little more generally, if $Sq^{n+1}$ acts nontrivially in the mod $2$ cohomology of $C$, then $Sq^{(k+1)(n+1)}$ acts nontrivially in the mod $2$ cohomology of $C^{\wedge k+1}$, by the Cartan formula. If $e$ smashed with the identity on $C^{\wedge k}$ were null-homotopic, then its mapping cone, which is $C^{\wedge k+1}$, would split in a way that is not compatible with this nontrivial cohomology operation. A similar argument works for $e = \alpha_1$, using the Steenrod operations in mod $p$ cohomology. I think this kind of argument goes back to Michael Barratt. There is a Cartan formula for secondary cohomology operations, due to Leif Kristensen, which might give similar results for some classes $e$ of Adams filtration $2$, but I have not looked at the details. 

Let $R$ be bounded below, bounded above and nontrivial, and work in $R$-modules. Let $X = \bigvee_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} \Sigma^n R$. Then $X \overset{\simeq}\to D(DX)$ is an equivalence, but $X$ is not dualizable. (Edit: Increased generality, based on a comment by Nardin.) 

You don't have to define your objects as sets, in fact, you should avoid such unnatural definitions. I don't think a number theorist would be happy to see a proof referring to elements of a natural number or using the identity $1=\{0\}$. Such proofs are not acceptable because they won't survive even the slightest change in the foundations. Similarly, if you develop Euclidean geometry, you don't define a point as a two-element set whose first element is a Dedekind cut and the second one is another weird set. You rather begin with axioms (either Euclidean ones or some axiomatization of the real line) and build the geometry on these. The set theory comes in if you want to show that your theory is consistent (as long as ZF is), and you do that by building a model within ZF. In your example with men, your actually create a mathematical model of whatever you want to study, in the same way as physics does. There are always translation steps from real world to mathematics and back, they just happen to be trivial in this case. So it's not a problem that men are (modelled by) sets. Only if you like to believe that mathematical objects do exist in some metaphysical sense, you will have a problem with the counter-intuitive claim that everything is a set. But you can just remove this axiom and stay agnostic about whether everything is a set or not. You will not lose anything - the only essential use of this axiom is that you are able to define the notion of equality rather than having it built into logic. And this is hardly of any importance outside the logic itself. 

When $k=2$ and $n$ is even, $$ D_{k,r} S^n \simeq BB_{r+} \wedge S^{rn} $$ is the $rn$-fold unreduced suspension of the classifying space of the braid group $B_r$ on $r$ strings. I once cited Cohen-Mahowald-Milgram ``The stable decomposition for the double loop space of a sphere'' (1978) for this, and if I recall correctly they credited Arnold for the idea. Hence $rn$ is the maximal number of suspensions that can appear in this case. Edit: For $k=2$ and $n=2$ the map $F(\mathbb{R}^2,r) \times_{\Sigma_r} \mathbb{R}^{2r} \to \mathbb{R}^{2r}$ taking $[z,\xi] = [z_1, \dots, z_r, \xi_1, \dots, \xi_r]$ to $$ (\sum_i \xi_i, \sum_i z_i \xi_i, \dots, \sum_i z_i^{r-1} \xi_i) $$ trivializes the source as an $\mathbb{R}^{2r}$-bundle over $F(\mathbb{R}^2,r)/\Sigma_r$. Here the $z_i$ and $\xi_i$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are viewed as complex numbers, and the products in the displayed formula are formed in $\mathbb{C}$. A similar formula works for any even $n$, by taking the direct sum of $n/2$ copies of this $\mathbb{R}^{2r}$-bundle. Hence the Thom complex of this bundle, which is your $D_{2,r} S^n$, is the $rn$-th suspension of $(F(\mathbb{R}^2,r)/\Sigma_r)_+ \simeq BB_{r+}$. I recalled this in Proposition 9.10 of my paper "Topological logarithmic structures" GTM 16 (2009). For $k=2$ and $n=1$, or more generally for $n$ odd, the stable splitting of $\Omega^2 S^3$ is closely connected to the story of Brown-Gitler spectra. Regarding the case when $k$ is a higher power of $2$, you might first try $k=4$ and identify $\mathbb{R}^4$ with the quaternions. However, in that case the quaternionic Vandermonde matrix might well be singular. For instance, with $r=3$ and $z = (i,j,k)$ the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ i & j & k \\ -1 & -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ annihilates $\xi = (1,0,1)$, so Arnold's idea does not extend to this case. 

In an unrelated thread Sam Nead intrigued me by mentioning a formalized proof of the Jordan curve theorem. I then found that there are at least two, made on two different systems. This is quite an achievement, but is it of any use for a mathematician like me? (No this is not what I am asking, the actual question is at the end.) I'd like to trust the theorems I use. To this end, I can read a proof myself (the preferred way, but sometimes hard to do) or believe experts (a slippery road). If I knew little about topology but occasionally needed the Jordan theorem, a machine-verified proof could give me a better option (and even if I am willing to trust experts, I could ensure that there are no hidden assumptions obvious to experts but unknown to me). But how to make sure that a machine verified the proof correctly? The verifying program is too complex to be trusted. A solution is of course that this smart program generates a long, unreadable proof that can be verified by a dumb program (so dumb that an amateur programmer could write or check it). I mean a program that performs only primitive syntax operations like "plug assertions 15 and 28 into scheme 9". This "dumb" part should be independent of the "smart" part. Given such a system, I could check axioms, definitions and the statement of the theorem, feed the dumb program (whose operation I can comprehend) with these formulations and the long proof, and see if it succeeds. That would convince me that the proof is indeed verified. However I found no traces of this "dumb" part of the system. And I understand that designing one may be hard. Because the language used by the system should be both human-friendly (so that a human can verify that the definitions are correct) and computer-friendly (so that a dumb program can parse it). And the definitions should be chosen carefully - I don't want to dig through a particular construction of the reals from rationals to make sure that this is indeed the reals that I know. Sorry for this philosophy, here is the question at last. Is there such a "dumb" system around? If yes, do formalization projects use it? If not, do they recognize the need and put the effort into developing it? Or do they have other means to make their systems trustable? UPDATE: Thank you all for interesting answers. Let me clarify that the main focus is interoperability with a human mathematician (who is not necessarily an expert in logic). It seems that this is close to interoperability between systems - if formal languages accepted by core checkers are indeed simple, then it should be easy to automatically translate between them. For example, suppose that one wants to stay within symbolic logic based on simple substitutions and axioms from some logic book. It seems easy to write down these logical axioms plus ZF axioms, basic properties (axioms) of the reals and the plane, some definitions from topology, and finally the statement of the Jordan curve theorem. If the syntax is reasonable, it should be easy to write a program verifying that another stream of bytes represents a deduction of the stated theorem from the listed axioms. Can systems like Mizar, Coq, etc, generate input for such a program? Can they produce proofs verifiable by cores of other systems? 

An unpublished, but quite well distributed, reference is "Appendix A, Compactly Generated Spaces" to the 1978 Ph.D. thesis of L. Gaunce Lewis, Jr. Proposition 4.1 discusses the existence of the left adjoint (Hausdorffification) by way of Freyd's adjoint functor theorem, and Construction 4.3 explains the transfinite induction by iterating $X \to JX$ where JX is essentially the quotient of X discussed by Martin Brandenburg. (Lewis works with weak Hausdorff spaces, but the story is the same.) A published version of something much like this appears in Lewis, May and Steinberger's book "Equivariant Stable Homotopy Theory" (Springer LNM 1213), where the spectrification functor L is constructed in Section 1 of the Appendix (pages 475-481) by this kind of transfinite induction. 

Question 1: There are several arguments. In degree 2 there is a reference: the proof of corollary 3.7 of Waldhausen's "Algebraic K-theory of spaces, a manifold approach". See $URL$ for a copy. Consider the maps $BG \to A(\ast) \to K(Z)$ and apply $\pi_2$. Here $\pi_2 BG = Z/2$, the composite is zero (restrict to $BSG$) and $\pi_2 A(\ast) \to K_2(Z)$ is an isomorphism. Hence the first homomorphism cannot be injective. In degree 3 there is another argument. Right composition with the unstable map $\eta : S^3 \to S^2$ takes the generator of $\pi_2(BO)$ to zero in $\pi_3(BO) = 0$, so by naturality with respect to $BO \to BG$, composition with $\eta$ takes the generator of $\pi_2(BG) = Z/2$ to zero in $\pi_3(BG)$. On the other hand, composition with $\eta$ takes the generator of $\pi_2 Q(S^0)$ to a nonzero element in $\pi_3 Q(S^0)$, so by naturality with respect to $Q(S^0) \to A(\ast)$, composition with $\eta$ is nonzero from $\pi_2 A(*) = Z/2$ to $\pi_3 A(\ast)$. Therefore $BG$ cannot split off $A(*)$. In degree 4 there is your argument. Question 2: So far, I only know that $BGL_1(R) \to K(R)$ admits a retraction if $R$ is the realization of a commutative simplicial ring. There is no retraction for $R = ku$ by Corollary 2.3 of "Divisibility of the Dirac magnetic monopole as a two-vector bundle over the three-sphere" by Ch. Ausoni, B. I. Dundas and J. Rognes, Documenta Mathematica 13 (2008) 795-801, and ku is already pretty close to a commutative simplicial ring.
