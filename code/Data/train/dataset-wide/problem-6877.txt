The concept is actually the other way around. Think of it in the same way as the Law of Demand. If you go to the grocery store and you see a food that you like selling for \$.25/lb, you would buy a whole lot of it before the price rises. Conversely, if you go to the grocery store and you see a food that you like selling for \$100/lb, you would probably wait to buy this item until it is cheaper or at least buy a small amount of it. In economics, the price drives the quantity demanded by the consumer. Now let us look at the Law of Supply. Imagine that you are the owner of a company. You go to the store, and you see that the item you are producing and the similar items produced by your competitors is selling for \$.25. You would not necessarily want to produce a lot of the product because the margin between the selling price and the production costs (profit) is small. Conversely, imaging going to the store and seeing that the item you are producing and the similar items produced by your competitors is selling for \$100. You would want to produce a lot of the product because the margin between the selling price and the production costs is (presumably) large. In this case, as in the other case, the price drives the quantity produced by the supplier. 

Depends. Who has the least currency? Let us first take a look at the economics of inflation. A certain economy has \$100 in circulation. If the government inflates the currency with an additional \$100, there is going to be \$200 in circulation. If a crate of apples originally cost \$1 in the initial economy, the market will adjust the cost to \$2 in the inflated economy. The original dollar only has half the purchasing power (and is only worth half a crate of apples) because the total amount of money in the economy doubled. The same principles from this simple example can be applied to any real economy. When the government injects more money into the economy, each piece of currency in the economy loses a portion of its purchasing power, and the market adjusts by increasing the prices of goods and services. Inflation is no respecter of persons. Bill Gate's money has devalued at the same rate as mine. So, with respect to inflation, the currency is taxed neither at a progressive nor at a regressive rate; the currency is taxed equally. However, notice that the taxation caused by inflation affects the currency only. Let us return to our example. If we purchased a crate of apples in the \$100 economy, we would only pay \$1. Then the government inflates the economy to \$200. If we try to resell the crate of apples (assuming that they have not spoiled), we can expect the selling price to be \$2. There is nothing special about pre- or post- inflation apples; the apples are still worth the same amount and require payment with an equivalent purchasing power. Now, we head back to the real world. When people purchase books, cars, refrigerators, vacation homes, stocks, bonds, etc., they are shielded from inflation. They can sell the stocks, bonds, and homes at the new inflated price. Unfortunately, whoever took their money suffers the brunt of inflation and is poorer for holding onto their money. 

I am reading Sala (2004) and I think I have found a mistake in the paper. On page 7 the author argues that one can differentiate between Ricardian and Non-Ricardian policy regimes by considering correlations between primary surpluses and their effect on real debt. See this picture. Where $s_t$ is current primary surplus, $\alpha_t$ is the discount factor and $b_t$ is the real debt. He says: 

This might seem like an odd question but seeing as I haven't had any formal education in solving ratex models yet, it is something I have been thinking about a lot recently. Consider the following state space representation of an arbitrary model: $\Gamma_{0}y_{t} = \Gamma_{1}y_{t-1}$ Where the gamma's are coefficient vectors. To solve this system we can simply pre-multiply by $\Gamma_{0}^{-1}$, define $A =\Gamma_{0}^{-1} \Gamma_{1}$ and then decompose $A$ in to its Jordan canonical form $A = P \Lambda P^{-1}$. $\Lambda$ being a vector with eigenvalues on the diagonal and the P's being right and left eigenvectors. I am fine with applying this method to different models but I feel like I don't have the intuition pinned down. I don't quite understand why I do this decomposition. If I have understood correctly, eigenvalues originate from differential equations where you assume the solution to be on the form $e^{\Lambda t}$ and I suppose that is fine. But then we have to ensure that the eigenvalues are less than one in absolute terms or in some cases that one is inside the unit circle while the other is outside. When solving linear difference equations I can appreciate why we need coefficients to be inside the unit circle (to prevent explosive behavior) but I don't understand how this links to eigenvalues. So I suppose my question is: what do eigenvector and eigenvalues tell us about the system? Why do we even have to decompose $A$? Is there a visual representation? I am sure in physics eigenvectors have a 'visual' meaning. Is there a similar way to look at eigenvectors in economics? A while back I recall reading a paper that showed the relationship between eigenvectors and the number of initial conditions needed to solve a model. If anyone has references similar to this I would very much like to read them. I understand that this question is quite vague but I am just trying to understand why I am doing what I am doing. 

Small Business Owner: Yes. Freelance Writer: Yes. Subsistence Farmer: No. Capitalism is the use to the private sector to grow the economy. This means that the private sector has to be producing a good or service that can be sold in the marketplace to benefit society. Let us take a look at your examples. A small business owner is, by definition, owning a business that is producing some good or service for which there is a market. One example would be a barber shop or a "mom and pop" restaurant. It does not matter if the venture is making millions of dollars or just making ends meet. It does not even matter if they are the only employee. The business is making a good or service that is demanded, and they are fulfilling that demand. A freelance writer is also producing a good or service that is demanded by others. This could be written articles, books, essays, etc. or the service of taking notes and transcribing words. Again, it does not matter the payment received for this good or service or if the freelance writer is a loner. However, the subsistence farmer is different. By definition, a subsistence farmer is only producing enough food to keep themselves alive; they are not producing any food to sell to anyone else. The farmer (presumably) has no other source of income and is forced to produce all other items on their own. So, although they are innovative, the subsistence farmer is not a capitalist. 

In the real world, "price fixing" is very difficult to accomplish. In most industries, it would be very easy for a new seller to enter the market and offer their goods at the lower price, stealing the customers from the "price fixing" sellers. For these sectors of the economy, "price fixing" is not an option unless the "price fixing" sellers can convince/coerce any entering sellers to commit to the existing fixed price. Ordinarily, "price fixing" occurs in industries with either a monopoly or an oligopoly. In a monopoly, there is only one seller. So, they alone are able to dictate the price of the good or service. In an oligopoly, there are only a few sellers. These few sellers can easily conspire with each other to elevate the price. However, even then, there is always the danger that one of the sellers will eventually drop their prices and try to steal the consumers from the other sellers. 

Price elasticity of demand is related (but not equal) to the inverse of the slope of the demand curve. This Wikipedia article defines PED as: 

If short term rates are positive and long term rates are negative then short term rates must be higher than long term rates. Therefore, the yield curve will be considered inverted by definition. Remember, central banks set the interbank overnight lending rate as a matter of policy. In the U.S., this is called the Federal Reserve Funds Rate. This is the shortest possible maturity. So this is the leftmost point on the yield curve. By contrast, supply-demand equilibrium (i.e., the market) sets long-term bond prices. And, as we know, bond prices are inversely correlated to their yields. So when the market demand increases for long term bonds, their prices rise and their yields fall. 

Economists have been exploring control theory applications to macro economics for decades. For example, here is a 40 year-old research paper written in 1976 on the topic. 

It depends on whether all the tickets are sold or not. If sold out, all the the tax burden is borne by the buyers. If not, then it's shared. If sold out, buyers pay all the tax. If all 39,000 tickets are sold, then your reasoning holds correct. The revenue the owners receive with the tax will equal the income to the owners without the tax. $$R = P \cdot Q_{max}$$ Where $R$ is the total revenue from ticket sales to owners, $P$ is the average ticket price, $Q(P)$ is the total quantity of tickets sold and $Q_{max}$ is the total quantity of tickets available to be sold (39,000 in this case). $$ Q_{max} = 39,000 $$ The total amount of tax revenue received by the government will equal the total amount of taxes paid by the ticket buyers. $$T_{paid} = T_{received} = \$5 \times 39,000 = \$195,000$$ If not, the tax burden is shared. When the stadium does not sell out, then the price elasticity of demand kicks in and causes both parties to share the tax burden. Keep in mind, the ticket sellers still earn the same amount per ticket, their shared tax burden (economic loss) comes from a reduced number of ticket sales due to the increase in ticket cost paid by the ticket buyers. The reduction in ticket sales represents a cost of lost opportunity of a perishable asset (i.e., the unsold tickets). The amount the buyers, in aggregate, reduce their ticket purchases will be proportional to the price elasticity of demand. The below diagram shows the impact of taxation on ticket sales, price and quantity sold. 

I was reading this blog post by Noah Smith where he argues that the interest rate implied by the Euler equation fails to match the data. His post is mainly based on this paper by (Canzoneri et al, 2006). Noah brings up an interesting point: The functional form assumed by Canzoneri et al might be 'wrong'. However, they also try different functional forms and the results are quite robust. I haven't read the entire Canzoneri paper but I would also question what specific interest rate they consider. As far as I can tell they consider the Federal Funds Rate. If we assume that this is the interest rate faced by households, then I would be more convinced. Anyhow, seeing as there appears to be a negative correlation between the interest rate implied by the Euler equation and the observed interest rate, what have macroeconomists done to account for this? From my own reading it seems to me that Euler equations are still widely used in modern macro but it seems quite worrying that such a fundamental aspect of modern literature fails to match the data. 

The interest component is already included. It was just their way of writing out the budget constraint that confused me. If anyone is interested: $\frac{B_{t-1}}{p_{t}} - \frac{B_{t}}{(1+i_{t})p_{t}} = \frac{i_{t}}{(1+i_{t})}\frac{B_{t}}{p_{t}} - \frac{B_{t}}{p_{t}} + \frac{B_{t-1}}{p_{t}}$. This is simply the interest on existing debt and the face value of existing debt (on the expenditure side). And real bond issuance on the income side. Simple rearranging and you have it. 

Which is what I was after. However, this made me wonder what was wrong with the method I was trying above. Looking at the top corner of the coefficient matrix (i.e the 4x4 matrix in the top left corner) it is clearly $\Gamma_{0}^{-1} \Gamma_{1}$. But the rest of the matrix I am unsure of. And question (2) remains, once I have solved for the variables of interest, will I be ready to make IRF's? 

I have been doing some reading on general equilibrium theory and it has made me highly confused regarding the logic behind NK models. If I have understood correctly, NK models are based on Walrasian or Arrow-Debreu auctions where there is no role for money, banking or credit (since there is perfect barter in this world). However, in the NK framework the most commonly used methods for introducing money in to the model, is money-in-utility and cash in advance, but this seems very counter intuitive. In a world with perfect barter, clearly money provides no utility because it cannot be consumed. And since CIA imposes an additional restriction on consumers that was not present in the Arrow-Debreu world, are we not imposing a welfare reducing constraint? I understand that in the real world money has many beneficial functions (store of value, removing double coincidence of wants etc etc). But in the Arrow-Debreu/Walrasian world it has no function. And since modern macro models are built around this, including money does not seem logical. How can we use models to study the price level/inflation when the underlying theory has no logically consistent way of including money? I mean, I have nothing against the fact that money can provide direct utility or that CIA is a real life constraint. My question is on the theory side rather than the empirical side.
