This is not comprehensive: for instance the above list restricts to spreading maths among somewhat specialized mathematicians; it could include spreading towards a non-specialist or non-mathematicians, or trying to develop interactions and applications of pure mathematics... the latter are important activities of a number of mathematicians and these are essential roles; not so far in my personal experience. Nevertheless, there's a growing tendency (especially in some countries), towards a job exclusively intended in the purpose of publishing "new research" and this is indeed the most visible, and in particular, for a young mathematician, the way considered as most accurate to judge the ability to work as a mathematician. That it tends to remain, all along the carrier, the main/exclusive way a mathematician is now judged, is more of a problem. Last and not least, the meaning of "new" (new results, new research, new ideas, new maths)... is very subjective! 

(although it's not always given by the obvious projection!). Actually while (1) follows from the Nikolov-Segal theorem (every finite index subgroup is open, in a t.f.g. profinite group), the particular case of the Nikolov-Segal theorem for products of finite simple group was proved by Saxl and Wilson, namely: if $(S_n)$ is a sequence of finite simple groups and $\lim_{n\to\infty}|S_n|=\infty$, then every finite index subgroup in $\prod S_n$ is open. (J. Saxl and J. S. Wilson, A note on powers in simple groups, Math. Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 122 (1997), 91-94.) Checking (2) is quite elementary, modulo the fact that finite simple groups have a bounded generating rank, namely every finite simple group is generated by 2 elements, which relies on classification. Gather together all isomorphic simple groups in the product, to write $G=\prod_S G_S$, where each $G_S\simeq S^{I_S}$, and $S$ ranges over non-isomorphic finite simple groups. Let $L$ be a t.f.g. closed subgroup of $G$; so $L$ has a dense subgroup generated by $d$ elements for some $d$. Let $L_S$ be its projection in $S^{I_S}$; it is generated by $d$ elements. Let $M_S$ be the subgroup of $S^{I_S}$ generated by $L_S$ and the diagonal; it is generated by $\le d+2$ elements (because any finite simple group is generated by 2 elements). Also, every finitely generated subgroup of $S^{I_S}$ containing the diagonal is isomorphic to $S^k$ for some $k$. So if we choose a family of $d+2$ elements in $\prod M_S$ whose $S$-component generates $M_S$, we obtain a generating subset for a dense subgroup of $\prod M_S$, and $M_S$ is a product of finite simple groups. This proves (2). 

To summarize the discussion. Let $G$ be a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbf{C})$, $H$ its Zariski closure. 

Better: any homomorphism $f$ from the infinite symmetric group $S(X)$ ($X$ arbitrary set) to a locally compact group $H$ has a discrete image. Proof: we can suppose that $f$ has a dense image. (a) Case when $H$ is totally disconnected. Let $L$ be a compact open subgroup of $H$. Notation: $L^h=h^{-1}Lh$, $h\in H$. Consider $K=f^{-1}(L)$. Recall that $L$ is commensurated in $H$, in the sense that the function $u_{H,L}(h)=\log([L:L\cap L^h])$ on $H$ takes finite values. Hence $K$ is commensurated in $S(X)$. By a result of Bergman (which easily follows from an earlier 1995 result of Galvin), every subadditive function on $S(X)$ is bounded. By a classical result of Schlichting 1980 (rediscovered by Bergman-Lenstra 1989), this implies that $K$ is groupwise transfixed, in the sense that there exists a normal subgroup $N$ of $S(X)$ that is commensurate to $K$. By Baer's classification of normal subgroups of $S(X)$, normal subgroups of $S(X)$ have no proper subgroup of finite index, with the only exception of the finitary subgroup and its subgroup of index 2. Hence replacing $N$ by a subgroup of index 2 if necessary, we can suppose that $N$ has no proper subgroup of finite index; so $K$ contains $N$ as a subgroup of finite index. Since $N$ has no proper subgroup of finite index, it has no nontrivial homomorphism into any profinite group. So $N$ is contained in the kernel of $f$, and hence $L$ is finite, and hence $H$ is discrete. (b) General case. By (a), $H/H^\circ$ is discrete, so $H^\circ$ is open. Define $N=f^{-1}(H^\circ)$, then $f(N)$ is dense in $H^\circ$. We conclude by (c) below that $H^\circ=1$, so (a) applies. (c) Let $N$ be any subquotient of $S(X)$ and $P\neq 1$ a connected locally compact group. Then $N$ has no nontrivial homomorphism $v$ into $P$ with dense image (no continuity assumption). Proof 1: suppose by contradiction that there's one; modding out the kernel, we can suppose $v$ injective, and modding out $P$, we can suppose that $P$ is Lie, and then that $P$ is either the circle group or a connected simple Lie group with trivial center. The group $P$ being linear, it has all its finitely generated subgroups residually finite (Malcev). So $N$ inherits this property. From Baer's classification of normal subgroups of $S(X)$ (and the simple observation that these are the only subnormal subgroups, see Scott's 1964 book Group Theory), all subnormal subquotients of $S(X)$ contain all countable groups as subgroups, except the finitary subgroup, modulo 1 or modulo the alternating subgroup. We can discard the latter by connectedness. So $N$ is the finitary symmetric group; it is locally finite and not virtually abelian, which is impossible in a linear group in characteristic zero such as $P$. Contradiction. Proof 2 (without using solution to Hilbert's fifth problem?). The proof by Galvin implying that all subadditive functions on $S(X)$ are bounded adapt without change to all its normal subgroups except those contained in the finitary subgroup. Given this, when $N$ is not contained in the finitary subgroup, and using some word length on $P$ with respect to a compact generating subset, we deduce that $P$ is compact. Then by Peter-Weyl, we can assume that $P$ is Lie compact (and connected). At this point we can conclude as in the first proof by Malcev. An alternative is to use that any infinitely generated field is union of a properly increasing sequence of subfields to deduce that every infinitely generated subgroup of a compact connected Lie group is union of an increasing sequence of proper subgroups ("cofinality $\omega$"), which clearly implies the existence of an unbounded subadditive function. Applying this to the image of $N$ in $P$, we deduce that this image is finitely generated, but again using a word length argument, we deduce that the image is finite, and finitely connectedness forces $P=1$. It remains the case when $N$ is the finitary subgroup or its alternating subgroup of index 2. In this case I can conclude as in Proof 1 but this makes use of Hilbert V. I have to think if we can conclude by another argument (to discard the possibility of a dense embedding of an infinite alternating group into a connected locally compact group). References: G.

To begin with: a necessary and sufficient condition for $(g_i,h_i)_{i\in I}$ to be free is that either $(g_i)_{i\in I}$ or $(h_i)_{i\in I}$ is free. It is obviously sufficient. Let us check it's necessary; the case when $I$ is a singleton being straightforward (to say that a singleton family is free means that its single element has infinite order), assume it has at least 2 elements. If none of the two families is free, there exist nontrivial group words (in the free group over $I$), say $w,w'$ such that $w((g_i)_{i\in I})=1$ and $w'((h_i)_{i\in I})=1$. Since $I$ has at least 2 elements, there exists a conjugate of $w'$ (say, by some generator) that does not commute with $w$. Then possibly replacing $w'$ with this conjugate and then considering $w''=[w,w']$, we have $w''((g_i,h_i)_{i\in I})=1$ and $w''\neq 1$. 

I guess that you mean that $B(H)$ has no character (=continuous unital algebra homomorphism into $\mathbf{C}$) if $H$ has dimension $\neq 1$ (idem for $M_n(\mathbf{C})$ for $n\neq 1$), and thus that your question assumes $\dim(X)\ge 2$ (and hence $=\infty$). Argyros and Haydon (Acta Math, 2011: arXiv, Project Euclid unrestricted access) constructed a Banach space $X$ of infinite dimension in which every bounded self-operator is scalar+compact. Hence for such a space, modding out by the ideal of compact self-operators yields a character. 

It's false for every $n\ge 3$. Consider $A_n,B_n$ $n\times n$ square matrices with no common eigenvalue (these exist for $n=0$ and $n\ge 2$). Then $$A=\begin{pmatrix} A_2 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & A_2 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & A_{n-4}\end{pmatrix},\qquad B=\begin{pmatrix} B_2 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & B_2 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & B_{n-4}\end{pmatrix}$$ work for $n=4$ and $n\ge 6$. It remains to do $n=3,5$. Define $$N=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 &1& 0\end{pmatrix},\qquad N'=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & -1\\ 0 &0& 0\end{pmatrix}$$ Then $N$ and $N'$ have no common eigenvector but the plane spanned by $N,N'$ consists of nilpotent matrices. Then the matrices $$A=\begin{pmatrix} N & 0\\ 0 & A_{n-3}\end{pmatrix},\qquad B=\begin{pmatrix} N' & 0\\ 0 & B_{n-3}\end{pmatrix}$$ work for all $n=3$ and $n\ge 5$. 

Here homomorphisms are meant continuous, and reps are in $\mathbf{GL}_n(\mathbf{R})$ for $n$ not fixed, or equivalently in $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{C})$ in view of the closed inclusions $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{R})\subset \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{C})\subset \mathrm{GL}_{2n}(\mathbf{R})$. Note that the equivalence between (ii) and (iii) is obvious. That (i) implies (ii) is clear since if $\mathrm{Hom}(G,\mathbf{R})\neq 0$, $G$ admits $\mathbf{R}$ as a quotient, and we can use a 2-dimensional complex representation of $\mathbf{R}$ whose image is dense in a 2-dimensional real torus. The implication (ii)$\Rightarrow$(i) goes by reduction to the semisimple case. Thus first assume that $G$ is semisimple. Fix a representation $\rho:G\to\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{C})$. In the latter, the image of the representation is a (a priori not closed) Lie subgroup $H_1$, with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$ (a real Lie aubalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbf{C})$. Let $H_2$ be the closure of $H_1$ (in the real Zariski topology, or in the real topology, it does not matter). Then $H_2$ normalizes $\mathfrak{h}$ and $H_1$. Since up to finite index, the automorphisms of $H_1$ are inner, and since $H_2$ is connected, we deduce that $H_2=H_1C$ where $C$ is the centralizer of $H_1$ in $H_2$. Decompose $\mathbf{C}^n=\bigoplus V_i$, a sub of $H_1$-irreducible complex subspaces. Then since $C$ is in the closure of $H_1$, it preserve each $V_i$. Since the $H_1$-representation on the complex space $V_i$ is irreducible, its commutant is reduced to scalars. Moreover, since the restriction of $H_1$ on $V_i$ has determinant 1, it is also the case for $C$. We deduce that $C$ is a finite abelian group. Thus $H_1$ has finite index in $H_2$. Since $H_1$ is $\sigma$-compact, a Baire argument then shows that $H_1$ has non-empty interior in $H_2$, and hence $H_1$ is the unit component of $H_2$ in the real topology. Thus $H_1$ is closed. (Another argument goes by using the fact that perfect Lie subalgebras of $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbf{R})$ are always Lie algebras of some Zariski closed subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{R})$.) Now assume $G$ arbitrary satisfying (ii). Write $G=RS$ with $R$ the connected solvable radical and $S$ a semisimple Levi factor. A simple argument based on taking the complexification at the Lie algebra level shows that $[G,R]$ is normal and that each representation of $G$ maps $[G,R]$ to unipotents. Thus let $\rho$ be a representation of $G$, say in $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{R})$, and let $H$ be its image. Then $N=\rho\Big(\overline{[G,R]}\Big)$ is a connected, unipotent normal subgroup of $H$. Being a unipotent connected Lie subgroup, it is necessarily closed in $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{R})$, actually Zariski closed. If $M$ is the normalizer of $N$, then $H\subset M\subset \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{R})$ and $M$ is Zariski closed. Moreover $M/N$ stands a Zariski closed subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_m(\mathbf{R})$ for some $m$ (indeed, if $M=\mathbb{M}_\mathbf{R}$ and $N=\mathbb{N}_\mathbf{R}$ for some $\mathbf{R}$-subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_n$, then $\mathbb{M}/\mathbb{N}$ is a linear algebraic group and hence is isomorphic to an $\mathbf{R}$-closed subgroup in some $\mathrm{GL}_m$, and $\mathbb{M}_\mathbf{R}/\mathbb{N}_\mathbf{R}\to (\mathbb{M}/\mathbb{N})_\mathbf{R}$ is a closed map in the real topology.) Therefore, we are reduced to the case when $[G,R]=1$. In this case $G=RS$, with $S$ semisimple Levi factor, $R$ abelian, and $[R,S]=1$. Since every linear representation of $S$ factors through some finite index subgroup of its center, it is no restriction to assume that $S$ has a finite center, and in particular $S$ is closed. By (ii), we thus deduce that $R$ is compact. Hence since by the first case, $\rho(S)$ is closed, we deduce that $\rho(G)$ is closed as well. 

No: there exists a sequence of finite groups with commuting probability bounded away from 0 but with no abelian (normal) subgroup of bounded index. Fix a prime power $q$. Consider the "higher Heisenberg" group $G_n$ of order $q^{2n+1}$ consisting of those square matrices of size $n+2$ over $\mathbf{F}_q$ of the form $$P(u,v,x)=\begin{pmatrix}1 & u & x\\ 0 & I_n & v\\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix},$$ where $u$ is a row, $v$ is a column, and $x$ a scalar. If we endow $\mathbf{F}_q^{n^2}$ with the symplectic product $\langle u\oplus v,u'\oplus v'\rangle=uv'-u'v$, then we see that the centralizer of $P(u,v,x)$ is the set of $P(u',v',x')$ such that $\langle u\oplus v,u'\oplus v'\rangle=0$. In particular, this is a subgroup of index $q$ (unless $(u,v)=(0,0)$ in which case $P(u,v,x)$ is central). So the probability that two elements commute is $\ge 1/q$ [actually it's $1/q+q^{-2n}(1-1/q)$, if I'm correct]. On the other hand, the largest cardinal of an abelian subgroup in $G_n$ is $q^{n+1}$ (since $n$ is the largest dimension and hence $q^n$ is the largest cardinal of an isotropic subspace in the symplectic space $\mathbf{F}_q^{2n}$). So the minimal index of an abelian subgroup in $G_n$ is $q^n$. Thus, $q$ being fixed ($q=2$ is fine) and $n$ tending to infinity, we get the required example.
