As Daniel Pomerleano recalled, I have done some work on this with Castano-Bernard. The article is posted here $URL$ I can try to summarise the main ideas. Friedman and Tian showed that a set of nodes in X can be smoothed (in the complex category) if the homology classes of exceptional cycles of a resolution satisfy a good relation. Roughly this means that there is a $3$-dimensional chain whose boundary are the exceptional cycles (actually, it's a bit stronger than this...). On the other hand Smith, Thomas and Yau (see reference given by Daniel Pomerleano) have shown that a ``symplectic conifold'' can be resolved (in the symplectic category) if the vanishing cycles (Lagrangian $3$-spheres) satisfy a good relation (i.e. there exists a $4$-chain bounding the spheres). In the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow philosophy of mirror symmetry one should be able to write $X$ as a torus bundle (with some singular fibres...) $E/L \rightarrow B$. Where $B$ is a real $n$-dimensional manifold, $E$ is a $n$-dimensional vector bundle and $L$ is a maximal lattice ($\cong \mathbb{Z}^n$ over a point). The mirror manifold $X'$ is the dual torus bundle $E'/L' \rightarrow B$. Now let $n=3$. If one has a one dimensional vector subspace $V_b \subset E_b$, where $b \in B$, then the anhilator of $V_b$ is a $2$-dimensional subvector space $V'_b \subset E'_b$. If you vary $b$ and $V_b$ over some $2$-dimensional object in $B$ then you obtain a $3$-dimensional object in $X$ and on the mirror you have a $4$-dimensional object. This somehow explains the correspondence between "odd cohomology" in $X$ and ``even cohomology'' in $X'$. In our paper, we construct some $2$-dimensional objects (which we call tropical $2$-cycles) which in $X$ give a $3$-chain whose boundary is the union of the exceptional cycles and in $X'$ give a $4$-chain whose boundary is the union of the vanishing cycles. This proves that if such tropical $2$-cycles exist the obstructions to smoothing $X$ and to resolving $X'$ vanish simultaneously. Our work relies very much on Mark Gross's ``Topological Mirror Symmetry'', which you can find here $URL$ 

The original problem I'm looking at is: given a bound on the operator norm of $\Lambda A \Lambda,$ where $\Lambda, A$ are positive definite matrices and $\Lambda$ is diagonal, what is the tightest bound on the operator norm of $A \Lambda^2.$ My starting point is the fact that these two matrices have the same eigenvalues, so the operator norm of $\Lambda A \Lambda$ upper bounds the spectral radius of $A \Lambda^2.$ For normal matrices, the numerical radius is the same as the spectral radius and the operator norm. While $A \Lambda^2$ is not normal, one might hope that it is nice enough that there is still some nontrivial connection between its numerical and spectral radii ( a bound on the former is a bound on the operator norm, up to a constant). Is this the case, or am I barking up the wrong tree? 

The constraints can be rewritten by replacing the squares with absolute values, then you have a program like $\operatorname{argmin}_{\mathbf{X}} \|\mathbf{D}\mathbf{X}\|_F^2 + \|\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{Z}\|_F^2$ $\text{s.t.}\quad \forall i,j \quad |\mathbf{d}_{01} \mathbf{X}_i| = |\mathbf{d}_{01} \mathbf{X}_j|, \text{ and } |\mathbf{d}_{34} \mathbf{X}_i| = |\mathbf{d}_{34} \mathbf{X}_j| $ where the $\mathbf{X}_i$ constitute the columns of $\mathbf{X},$ the matrix $\mathbf{D}$ takes the differences of the consecutive columns of $\mathbf{X},$ and $\mathbf{d}_{01}, \mathbf{d}_{34}$ are appropriately defined row vectors. Then you can use the standard trick of replacing $|x|$ with $x_{+} + x_{-}$ subject to $x = x_{+} - x_{-}$ and $x_{+}, x_{-} \geq 0$ to get the equivalent program $\operatorname{argmin}_{\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{e}^{+}, \mathbf{e}^{-},\mathbf{f}^{+}, \mathbf{f}^{-}} \|\mathbf{D}\mathbf{X}\|_F^2 + \|\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{Z}\|_F^2$ $\text{s.t.}\quad \forall i: \quad \mathbf{d}_{01} \mathbf{X}_i = e^{+}_i - e^{-}_i, \text{ and } \mathbf{d}_{34} \mathbf{X}_i = f^{+}_i - f^{-}_i,$ $\quad \quad \forall i \neq j: e^{+}_i + e^{-}_i = e^{+}_j + e^{-}_j, \text{ and } f^{+}_i + f^{-}_i = f^{+}_j + f^{-}_j,$ $\quad \quad \mathbf{e}^{+}, \mathbf{e}^{-}, \mathbf{f}^{+}, \mathbf{f}^{-} \succeq 0$ By considering the Lagrangian, you can see that for each i, at least one of the $e^{\pm}_i$ will be zero, and likewise for the $f^{\pm}_i,$ so this is indeed equivalent to the original program. Concisely: at a presumed optimal point you can always increase over the value $L(\mathbf{X}^\star, \mathbf{e}^{+,\star}, \mathbf{e}^{-,\star}, \mathbf{f}^{+,\star}, \mathbf{f}^{-,\star}, \boldsymbol{\lambda}, \boldsymbol{\nu})$ by moving all the mass onto exactly one of $\mathbf{e}^{\pm}$ and $\mathbf{f}^{\pm}.$ By vectorizing $\mathbf{X}$, you can write the objective as a convex quadratic in a vector $\mathbf{x}$, and a little massaging of the constraints gives you a convex quadratic program in standard form. In terms of actually solving the final QP, I'm not sure what the state of art is, especially since performance usually depends on the properties of your problem (sparsity or structure in the Hessian of your quadratic, whether you have only equality or inequality constraints, etc.). You'd need a subject matter expert to get a definitive answer on that one. I'd personally try TFOCS if you have access to Matlab, since it's a first order solver and looks relatively easy to use (I have not used it myself). 

This is embarrassing, I think it must work, but I can't see how to prove it works. If anyone knows enough functional calculus of operators on a Hilbert space to tell me how to do it, I would be very grateful. Of course, you might also tell me that it is wrong... Take positive bounded operators $x,y$, and increasing continuous functions $f,g:[0,\infty)\to [0,1]$ with the property that if $f(t)>0$ then $g(t)=1$. Then show that $$ f(x)\,g(x+y)= g(x+y)\,f(x)=f(x)\ . $$ Reason why I think it should work: If $f(t)>0$ then $g(t+\mathrm{positive})=1$, so it works... OK, this argument is not legal, but can the statement be proved in functional calculus? Purpose: This is to be used to show that for a separable C* algebra there is an approximate identity $u_n$ with the property that $u_n u_{n+1}=u_{n+1}\ u_n=u_n$. Maybe someone actually looked at special approximate identities with this sort of property? 

There follows a possible construction, and I would like to know if it or a similar construction has been done before (as I suspect), so that I can reference it, or if it obviously does not work! Any useful comments welcomed. What is wanted is the noncommutative analogue of taking an open subset of a compact Hausdorff topological space, and taking the continuous complex functions on that open set, with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of the open set. (Noting that such functions are often unbounded.) The NC setup - let $A$ be a unital separable C* algebra, with 2-sided ideal $J$. We do not want to take $A/J$, but instead take a countably many seminorm construction based on certain states on $A$. In the commutative case they would be states with measures supported away from the closed set where the elements of $J$ vanish. In the noncommutative set up, it seems likely that such states can be constructed from an approximate unit of $A/J$. An appropriate modification of $a\mapsto \phi(u_n a u_n)$ where $u_n\in A/J$ is the approximate unit and $\phi$ a state of $A/J$, with suitable cut offs and sums with $1/2^m$ weights might work. Then such states would give countably many seminorms to give an algebra larger than $A/J$ (and likely not separable). The background: How to define meromorphic functions in noncommutative complex geometry? The starting ideal $J$ would correspond to where the poles (or divisor) would have to be. Of course the preceeding construction (if it worked) would generate really horrible functions in general, but the big problem is how to get unbounded functions at all - once they exist it should be possible to choose nicer ones. 

I'm looking at some statistical literature and trying to compare the results given there in probabilistic big-Oh notation with statements I'm more familiar with. In particular, I'm trying to interpret statements of the form $$ \|\Sigma_{n(p)} - \Sigma \| = O_P\left( \frac{\log p}{n(p)}\right). $$ As far as i can tell from the rather terse wikipedia page on $o_p$ notation, this means that there is some constant $C$ that is independent of $p$ for which $$ \lim_{p \rightarrow \infty} \mathbb{P}\left( \|\Sigma_{n(p)} - \Sigma \| > C \frac{\log p}{n(p)}\right) = 0. $$ Is that correct? 

Let $n,p \in \mathbb{N}_+$ with $p \leq n.$ Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the set of partitions of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ into $p$ nonempty sets. How can I efficiently sample uniformly from $\mathcal{P}$? 

Let $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma \otimes I)$ (so the columns of $Z$ are distributed $\mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$) and $A = Z'Z.$ Is there a name for the distribution on $A$? Is the density known? 

No; here's a counterexample: let $f = 0$ and consider the minimizer $y = 0.$ Then you can construct convex functions which converge to $0$ pointwise but whose minima are always moving away from $y =0,$ e.g. $f_n(x) = (x - n)^2/n^n.$ 

What are the standard methods of computing the rank-k truncated SVD of large dense matrices? My literature search yields results only for large sparse matrices. I assume for k small that you use a Krylov subspace method (this is what Matlab's svds does). But (empirically) how large can k get before these methods become impractical, and then what should one resort to? 

Is it already known that ${}_1F_1(a;b;x) \leq \Gamma(b)(1+|x|)^{-a}$ when $a$ is an integer, $a <0,$ and $b>0?$ If it is, what is a reference? my proof: Since the Kummer function can be written in terms of a generalized Laguerre polynomial, \begin{equation} \label{eqn:Kummer-Laguerre-equality} {}_1F_1(a;b;x) = \frac{\Gamma(1-a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(b-a)} L_{-a}^{(b-1)}(x), \end{equation} when $a < 0,$ we proceed by bounding the generalized Laguerre polynomial on the right hand side. Let $n = -a$ and $\alpha = b - 1.$ Then $$ L_{n}^{(\alpha)}(x) = \sum_{\ell=0}^n \frac{\Gamma(\alpha + n + 1)}{\Gamma(\alpha + \ell +1)(n-\ell)!\ell!} (-x)^\ell. $$ Our constraints on $a$ and $b$ ensure that each $\Gamma(\cdot)$ term in the above sum is positive. Furthermore, for $\ell=0,1,\ldots,n,$ $$ \Gamma(\alpha + \ell +1) \geq \Gamma(b) \geq \min_{x > 0} \Gamma(x) > 0.88. $$ It follows that $$ L_{n}^{(\alpha)}(x) \leq 1.14 \cdot \Gamma(\alpha + n + 1) \sum_{\ell =0}^n \frac{|x|^\ell}{(n-\ell)!\ell!} = 1.14 \cdot \Gamma(b-a) \frac{1}{(-a)!}(1 + |x|)^{-a}. $$ The last equality is a consequence of the binomial theorem. The conclusion follows immediately when this estimate is used in the relation expressing ${}_1F_1$ in terms of the Laguerre polynomial. 

This question is about mapping finitely generated projective modules over $C^*$ algebras (or K-theory classes - I don't mind much) under maps between algebras. If we have an idempotent matrix $P\in M_n(A)$ and a star algebra map $\phi:A\to B$ then taking $\phi(P)$ (applying to each entry) will give another idempotent. However suppose that we only have a completely positive map $\psi:A\to B$ -- what do we do then? One possible way would be to use the KSGNS theorem to say that $\psi$ is given by a Hilbert bimodule structure on some $M$ together with an element $m\in M$. The module given by the applying the map to an $A$-module $E$ might be taken as $M\otimes_A E$ (or rather the conjugate of $M$ to get the sides right...). However this seems to be a very non-unique construction, and likely far too big. The reason I am interested in this is the problem of calculating characteristic classes (a la Connes) for algebras which simply do not have any nicely calculable $n$-cycles. It may be simplest to transfer the bundle to an easier to deal with algebra. (Just as classically we can define a cycle on a manifold by using an embedded submanifold). However then we run into the problem that we often only have CP maps, not algebra maps... I would be grateful for any assistance. 

Given a positive (or completely positive map) $\phi:A\to B$ between C* algebras, is there a way to construct an $A-B$ bimodule? This would more or less generalise the following construction: If $\phi$ was an algebra map, we could have ${}_\phi B$, which is $B$ as a vector space, with $B$ product as the right $B$ action, and left action $a. b=\phi(a) b$. If there was a Hilbert C* module, so much the better. (This is part of the idea that bimodules generalise algebra maps, and I want to look at the differentiable properties of bimodules.)
