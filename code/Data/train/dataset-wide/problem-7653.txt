Let $R$ be a ring and $G$ a $p$-divisible group over $R$. Since $G[p]$ is finite flat over $\text{Spec}(R)$, it is an affine (group) scheme, say $\text{Spec}(B)$. What can be said about $B$ beyond the fact that it is a locally free $R$-algebra? Similar questions can be asked for $G[p^n]$. For example what is an element $b\in B$? Or how should I think of $B$? Any insight would be useful - so if a nice description exist when $R$ is say, perfect, or a complete DVR, or even a field, you can assume that. My main interest is for general $p$-divisible groups, however if some nice insight can be given for $p$-divisible groups arising from elliptic curves or abelian varieties I'd appreciate it. I have some grasp for connected $G$, because in this case $G$ corresponds to a formal Lie group. So if, say, $G[p^n]=\text{Spec}(B_n)$, and if $A=R[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]$ is the corresponding power series ring of the formal Lie group, then $B=A/J$ with $J$ being the ideal generated by $X_i^p$ in $A$, where $X_i^p$ is viewed as the result of the formal group law applied $p$ times to $X_i$ (this is detailed in Tate's "$p$-divisible groups" for $G[p^n]$, section (2.2); note that it is assumed there that $R$ is complete, noetherian, local with residue field of char $p$). But for more general $G$ (e.g. which doesn't split into a connected and etale component, for example) I don't know what happens. Thank you. p.s. why is there no "$p$-divisible-groups" tag? :) 

Hi, I encountered an issue today that I can't resolve to myself: Consider the projective model structure on chain complexes over a ring R (Ch(R)), bounded below if you like. Projectives in Ch(R) are split-exact complexes which are level-wise projective (so in particular are contractible). Cofibrations in Ch(R) are inclusions with projective cokernel, and so every cofibrant object is projective (since the initial object is the zero complex). In particular every cofibrant object is contractible, and so since every object of Ch(R) has a cofibrant replacement, every chain complex has trivial homology???? This obviously can't be right, and I'm misunderstanding something, and any help to figure out what that is would be much appreciated. Thanks, Tom Addition: After thinking about it for a little bit longer I think that the word "projective" in the definition of a cofibration in the projective model structure must mean "level-wise projective", as this resolves the question, and there is a lot of literature on constructing "almost projective" resolutions in derived categories, of which a level-wise projective resolution is an example. I think the reason for their use is that to ask for a (categorically) projective resolution in derived categories is usually too strong a requirement to be able to do anything with it, (as illustrated by the contractibility of projective objects in Ch(R)). I hope this paragraph is correct, but comments/answers/corrections still very welcome. 

Unfortunately, in my mind there are several ways in which to interpret this statement. Let's assume that finite generating set refers as a module (not as an $R$-algebra). One interpretation that I tried and gives me trouble is the following: For simplicity, take $S$ to affine, $\newcommand{\Spec}{\text{Spec}}$ $S=\Spec(R)$, and $Z=\Spec(B)$ even with $B$ free as a module over $R$, say of rank $N$ and a basis $b_1,\ldots,b_N$; then I don't think the condition for full set of sections (say in the form (1) of definition (1.8.2) on page 33 of Katz-Mazur) for $b_1,\ldots,b_N$ implies it for every $b\in B$. When trying to prove it, roughly speaking, I ran into the problem that "additivity fails", i.e. if (1) holds for $b$ and $c$, then it doesn't hold for $b+c$ (if this were usual linear algebra over a field, I believe this translates to the fact that $b$ and $c$ viewed as linear maps on $B$ via multiplication, have different eigenvectors). However, I didn't completely disprove it. It may be possible that the algebra structure on $B$ (or even the Hopf algebra structure) somehow guarantees that all is good? (doesn't seem so to me though, even if the matrices of $b$ and $c$ commute since $bc=cb$). Or maybe it was meant that even though we work Zariski-locally, say on $\Spec R$ we still require the definition of full set of sections for any $\Spec R'\to\Spec R$. (i.e. I am allowed to pass to $R$-algebras). In this direction, alternatively (and maybe that's what Brian meant, but it doesn't seem exactly 'Zariski locally' anymore) one can pass to the "universal element" $f=\sum T_ib_i\in B\otimes_RR[T_1,\ldots,T_n]$ as on page 38 of K-M and then indeed, it suffices to check condition (1) (or (2)) for this universal element, yielding a big identity but in finitely many variables. Could anybody help clarify this please? As a bonus, I would appreciate some intuition as to why the condition for full set of sections is so "linear" (in my not-very-developed understanding it seems to barely touch upon the algebra structure of $B$ and almost not at all on the Hopf algebra structure) - it seems a bit strange that it encompasses so much "geometric" information (at least the way I think of level structures). Thanks! 

This is perhaps more of a comment but I am not reputable enough yet to leave comments. Without looking in too much detail, I think Shipley and Schwede assert in their paper "algebras and modules in monoidal model categories" on page 502, that when (with the notation of your question) A is the category of finite simplicial sets and the monoidal product is the smash product, then it does indeed give a monoidal model structure. They talk of it very briefly but give a lot of references. There is an online copy here: $URL$ Regards, Tom 

I would recommend finding a copy however as it does have a lot of information on the kind of issue you asked about. I'm happy to say a bit more on who you could (respectuflly!) ask for a copy, if you email me at smp12tbs@sheffield.ac.uk Cheers, Tom
