If $U \cong \mathbb A^n$ is the image of $j$, then the long exact sequence of a pair shows that $\mathbb A^n \setminus U$ has no cohomology in any degree, which is only possible if $U = \mathbb A^n$. More generally (using heavier machinery), no variety $X$ is isomorphic to a Zariski open subset $U \subsetneq X$. The same long exact sequence shows that the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of $X \setminus U$ would need to vanish, which is only possible for $X \setminus U = \varnothing$. 

I think you would enjoy reading Curt McMullen's paper "Moduli spaces in genus zero and inversion of power series". In some sense there is nothing there that isn't already in Getzler's paper, but everything is stated in a down-to-earth and combinatorial fashion. Let me summarize the story, first for the spaces $\overline M_{0,n}$ and $M_{0,n}$. The space $\overline M_{0,n}$ has a stratification where a stratum corresponds to a tree with no vertices of valence two. The stratum itself is isomorphic to $\prod_v M_{0,\mathrm{val}(v)}$ where $v$ runs over interior vertices of the tree and $\mathrm{val}(v)$ denotes the number of incident edges. Since the virtual Poincaré polynomial is additive over stratifications, this shows that the virtual Poincaré polynomial of $\overline M_{0,n}$ is given by a sum over trees involving the virtual Poincaré polynomials of $M_{0,n'}$ for $n' \leq n$. Now using the relationship between compositional inversion and summing over trees, well-known to combinatorists, one can thus show that the exponential generating series of virtual Poincaré polynomials of $\overline M_{0,n}$ and $M_{0,n}$ are compositional inverses of each other. (If you don't know virtual Poincaré polynomials, think about any other invariant additive under stratification, e.g. Euler characteristic.) Finally, both the spaces $\overline M_{0,n}$ and $M_{0,n}$ have pure cohomology in every degree: $H^k (\overline M_{0,n})$ is pure of weight $k$, and $H^k(M_{0,n})$ us pure of weight $2k$. Thus in both cases, the virtual Poincaré polynomial concides with the usual Poincaré polynomial (in the latter case up to a substitution $t \mapsto t^2$). This explains the second sentence in Bergström-Brown's abstract. The story for $M_{0,n}^\delta$ and $M_{0,n}$ is completely similar, the only difference being that $M_{0,n}^\delta$ has a stratification indexed by trees without vertices of valence two and with a cyclic ordering of the edges incident to each vertex. In the same way as compositional inversion of exponential generating functions corresponds to sums over trees, compositional inversion of ordinary generating functions corresponds to sums over trees with such cyclic structure. McMullen touches upon something very similar at the very end of his paper. He doesn't consider $M_{0,n}$ and $M_{0,n}^\delta$, but instead considers the choice of a connected component of $M_{0,n}(\mathbf R)$ and its closure. Combinatorially this amounts to exactly the same thing: $M_{0,n}^\delta$ is defined by choosing a connected component of $M_{0,n}(\mathbf R)$ and taking the union of all strata meeting the closure of this component. A final remark is that the duality between $H^\bullet(\overline M_{0,n})$ and $H^\bullet(M_{0,n})$ can be upgraded to a Koszul duality of two cyclic operads, the "Hypercommutative" and "Gravity" operads. This is a much stronger result than just that their generating series are compositional inverses, and this is what Getzler proves. On the other hand the cohomologies of $M_{0,n}^\delta$ and $M_{0,n}$ give rise to nonsymmetric cyclic operads (this notion is not defined in the literature, but it's not hard to give the definition). However, it turns out that they are not in any natural sense Koszul dual of each other, but it is still true that they are interchanged with each other under bar-cobar-duality, up to homotopy. (But first one needs to define a bar transform of nonsymmetric cyclic operads...) This is an operad-theoretic statement that improves on what Bergström-Brown proved. I worked this out with Johan Alm at one point but we never wrote it down properly. 

To answer your specific question, there is a unique curve of genus three with a 32-element automorphism group, the hyperelliptic curve $$ y^2 = x^8 - 1.$$ As for any hyperelliptic curve, the automorphism group fits in a central extension $$ 0 \to C_2 \to G \to D_{16} \to 1 $$ where $C_2$ is the subgroup generated by the hyperelliptic involution and $D_{16}$ permutes the branch points of the hyperelliptic map, i.e. the solutions of $x^8-1=0$ on $\mathbf P^1$. The group can be given a presentation $$ \langle s, t \mid s^4, t^4, (st)^2, (s^{-1}t)^2\rangle.$$ I just learned this from a paper of Shaska and Wijesiri (a decidedly noncanonical reference). 

As damiano makes implicit in his answer, a curve of genus two admits a map of degree N to an elliptic curve if and only if there is an isogeny of degree N^2 of its Jacobian and a product of two elliptic curves. The case N=2 also admits the following simple description: a genus two curve (over an alg. closed field) is a double cover of an elliptic iff it can be written as $y^2 = f(x^2)$, where $f$ is a squarefree cubic with $f(0) \neq 0$. One can say slightly more. Given a map $f : C \to E_1$ of degree N, we get also a map $f_\ast : \mathrm{Jac} \; C \to E_1^\vee$. If we assume that f does not factor through an isogeny then the kernel is connected so we get a second elliptic curve E2 lying as a subgroup on the Jacobian. So the Jacobian has two elliptic subgroups and it turns out that they intersect exactly in their N-torsion points. We get an induced isomorphism between the N-torsion subgroups which turns out to invert the Weil pairing, and this is the data needed to reconstruct C. Namely, given two elliptic curves and an isomorphism of their N-torsion subgroups inverting the Weil pairing, one may consider the graph of this isomorphism in the product of the elliptic curves. The condition on the Weil pairing ensures that the graph is a maximally isotropic subgroup, so the quotient will have a principal polarization, and (when the quotient is not again a product of two elliptic curves) this is exactly the Jacobian of C with its principal polarization. This is pretty classical stuff which is well explained in several articles by Ernst Kani and Gerhard Frey. Start with "Curves of genus 2 covering elliptic curves and an arithmetical application." It can also be fruitful to think about this in a general context of Prym varieties -- when we have a degree N map from a genus two curve to an elliptic curve, the second elliptic curve which appears is of course exactly the Prym variety, which in this case is principally polarized. I know in particular that Frey and Kani worked out some rather precise conditions on when a principally polarized abelian surface arising as a quotient of a product of two elliptic curves as above actually is the Jacobian of a curve. I am not really sure in what article it can be found though. It was something like: pairs of elliptic curves with an isomorphism of their N-torsion are parametrised by $Y(N) \times Y(N) / SL(2,{\mathbb Z}/N)$, and the locus of such pairs which do not give rise to the Jacobian of a curve is the union of certain Hecke correspondences on Y(N). The description of exactly which Hecke correspondences was pretty complicated but when N is prime it was at least workable. The case of N=2 is easy though: then the "bad" locus is just the image of the diagonal in $Y(2) \times Y(2)$.
