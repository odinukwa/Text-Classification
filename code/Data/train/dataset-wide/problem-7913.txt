To add to the excellent answers of jvp and David Speyer above: Actually Hartog's theorem does even better: Given a domain $U\subset\mathbb{C}^{n{\geq{2}}}$ and a compact $K\subset{U}$ such that $U\setminus{K}$ is just connected, any holomorphic function on $U\setminus K$ extends holomorphically to $U$. Note that we don't need the codimension condition. This is actually a simple consequence of Cauchy's formula in several variables. For algebraic geometry (resp. complex geometry) and dimension $\geq{2}$: The analog of Hartog's theorem is that any regular (resp. holomorphic) function on the complement of an algebraic (resp. analytic) subset of codimension atleast $2$ in a normal algebraic(resp. analytic) variety, extends to the whole algebraic (resp. analytic) variety. I would also like to point out the important difference between the affine (resp. Stein) case and the projective case as perhaps alluded to by jvp above. If $X$ is a projective algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$ and you find a holomorphic function $f$ on the complement of a divisor $D$ then you will not be able to extend the function to all of $X$ however hard you try(!) since there are no global non-constant functions on projective varieties (similar statement for compact analytic vars). So to add to jvp's answer (which might seem like hair-splitting but is important IMHO): His second paragraph must refer to a non-projective neighborhood of the contractible curve that he discusses, otherwise the argument is still true but only vacuously! This is because there is no non-constant function to be found on a projective surface on the complement of a contractible curve and hence there is nothing to extend! Moreover, it will not be possible in general to extend holomorphic functions from the complement of divisors whose examples can be easily constructed. So there is no hope in this direction without any local boundedness hypothesis. 

No. $R = k[x,y]/(xy)$, $M = R/(x)$. The zero module has infinite depth and support of dimension $-\infty$, so should not be considered MCM. 

Motivations include: (1) Mumford's proof is completely opaque to me; (2) No, I mean really really opaque; (3) I'm curious about extensions of the theorem to non-isolated singularities [which should probably be another question]. 

No. Let's work with an Artinian local ring $R$. Let $X$ be a module satisfying $\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(X,R)\neq 0$ for all $i$. (These are plentiful; for example, assume $R$ is non-Gorenstein and let $X$ be the residue field.) Define a module $Q$ by "Serre's trick": take generators $\chi_1, \dots, \chi_r$ for $\mathrm{Ext}_R^1(X,R)$ and consider the short exact sequence corresponding to $(\chi_1, \dots, \chi_r) \in \mathrm{Ext}_R^1(X,R^r)$: $$0 \to R^r \to Q \to X \to 0$$ Then $\mathrm{Ext}_R^1(Q,R) =0$, since the long exact sequence of $\mathrm{Ext}$ looks like $$\cdots \to \mathrm{Hom}_R(R^r,R) \to \mathrm{Ext}_R^1(X,R) \to \mathrm{Ext}_R^1(Q,R) \to \mathrm{Ext}_R^1(R^r,R)=0$$ and the map $\mathrm{Hom}_R(R^r,R) \to \mathrm{Ext}_R^1(X,R)$ is cooked up precisely to be surjective. On the other hand, $\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(Q,R) = \mathrm{Ext}_R^{i}(X,R) \neq 0$ for all $i\geq 2$. One can jazz this up a bit, using a result of Jorgensen-Sega (journal link): There exists a local Artinian ring $R$ and a family $\{M_s\}_{s\geq 1}$ of reflexive $R$-modules such that (among other things) $\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(M_s,R)\neq 0$ if and only if $1 \leq i \leq s-1$. They give a completely explicit construction of $R$ and the modules $M_s$. Taking one of the $M_s$ in place of $X$ above, one obtains modules $Q_{a,b}$ for which $\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(Q_{a,b},R)$ vanishes up to $i=a-1$, is nonzero for $a \leq i \leq b$, and vanishes again for $i \geq b+1$. Then taking direct sums gives essentially arbitrary behavior of vanishing and non-vanishing. 

Here's what I know about this arrangement. Regarding the number of chambers in this arrangment, Zuev obtained the lower bound $2^{(1-o(1))n^2}$. The proof uses Zaslavsky's theorem and a difficult estimate due to Odlyzko. $URL$ describes an improvement to that lower bound (including references to Zuev's and Odlyzko's articles). $URL$ studies a closely related arrangement and gives a related (but weaker) lower bound using a very elegant method. It turns out the arrangment becomes much easier mod $2$ (even than one might expect). Whenever one has a central hyperplane arrangement one has a zonotope dual to it. Klivans and Reiner [ $URL$ ] fix $k$ and look at the zonotope (Minkowski sum of the line segments) generated by all 0/1-vectors of length $n$ with exactly $k$ ones. In particular they are interested in the zonotope considered as symmetric polynomial (the sum $\sum x^m$ over all lattice points $m$ in the zonotope). Thus the Minkowski sum of their zonotopes over $1\leq k \leq n$ is the zonotope dual to your arrangement. Degree sequences of hypergraphs correspond to integer points in this latter zonotope. Surprisingly the converse is false! This was showed by Liu [$URL$ ]. The vertices in the zonotope, and thus the regions in the arrangement, correspond almost to linear threshold hypergraphs (better known as linear threshold (Boolean) functions). A linear threshold hypergraph is determined by $n+1$ real potentially negative numbers $q,w_1,\dots,w_n$; any set $S\subseteq [n]$ with $\sum_{i\in S} x_i \leq q$ is declared an edge. "Almost" above means that the vertices in this zonotope correspond exactly to the linear threshold hypergraphs that can be given with $q = 0$. What if $q \neq 0$? Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ with $s$ simplices and degree sequence $v_1,\dots,v_n$, one can look at the values $s-2v_i$, $1\leq i\leq n$. If $\mathcal{H}$ happens to be down-closed, this is what game theorists call the Banzhaf value of the game represented by $\mathcal{H}$ and what computer scientists call the Boolean influence of the Boolean function represented by $\mathcal{H}$. Anyway it is more natural to look at the vector $(s,v_1,\dots,v_n)$ rather than just $(v_1,\dots,v_n)$. This corresponds to looking instead at the zonotope generated by $(1,0,0),(1,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,1,1)$ et.c. (all binary vectors of length $n$, prepended by $1$). The vertices (obviously more than when we didn't have the leading 1's in the generators) in this zonotope correspond exactly to linear threshold hypergraphs. Since each $v_i$ is an integer $0$ and $2^{n-1}$, and $s$ is between $2^n$ there are at most $2^{n + n(n-1)} = 2^{n^2}$ of them, giving an almost matching upper bound to the lower bound above. The latter zonotope is briefly mentioned in the end of the article $URL$ . I remember having seen a reference to a paper of Terao computing the characteristic polynomial of the arrangemnt for some small values, but cannot locate that reference right now. 

Excuse me guys, but I think it is true that the permutation groups $S_m$ will not admit a faithful representation in dimension $n$ if $m>>n$? I can certainly see this for $m>2n$ atleast. So this will give countably many examples of finitely presented groups not admitting injective homomorphism to $GL(n,C)$ as Dmitri wanted in his question (1). My claim can be seen by either an elementary combinatorial calculation on the involution on the respective spaces or by classification of irreducible representation of $S_n$(that they are either the identity, sign or the standard ones). We don't have to invoke any high powered theorem to do this IMHO. Cheers! 

I think the question raises a valid point. A very fruitful approach to affine problems was initiated by Iitaka in the 70's which is as follows: Suppose $V$ is an affine variety and $X$ is a projectivisation such that $D=X-V$ is a divisor with simple normal crossings (SNC). Look at the canonical divisor $K:=K_X$ and the divisor $L:=K+D$ on $X$. Just like, the now classical, theory of Kodaira and others of analysing the multicanonical systems $nK$ of a projective variety, Iitaka proposed to look at $n(K+D)$ to come up with the a kind of classification for the pair $(X,D)$ as one does for projective varieties. Of course the only complete success in classifying varieties until Iitaka's time was for curves and Surfaces (which is also available now for 3-folds), so he and others applied this idea for non-compact (in particular affine) surfaces. Below I shall talk only about surfaces since the appropriate theory for 3-folds has not yet been worked out (as far as I know) and the curve case is extremely well understood and presents no real difficulty, generally speaking. Just like a Kodaira dimension for projective surfaces, we can define the logarithmic Kodaira dimension of non-compact surfaces which is by definition the rate of growth of $n(K+D)$ as $n$ varies over positive integers. This number, called $\bar\kappa$ can take values $-\infty,0,1,2$ (or upto the dimension of the variety in the general case). At this stage one proves a theorem that this number is independent of the compactification $X$ chosen, as long as $D$ is SNC. This gets the theory started and we get a perfect gadget for studying the non-compact (in particular affine) surfaces. The whole project follows Kodaira's classification philosophy that one should develop enough classification theorems for the various $\bar\kappa$ classes and therefore (ideally) answer "all" questions about the non-compact (or affine) varieties. So if you want to answer a question like "are two affine varieties $A,B$ isomorphic or not" then the first thing to look at is their log-Kodaira dimensions. If they turn out to be different then we are done. If they are same then we have to look more closely into that particular $\bar\kappa$ class and either apply the appropriate classification theorems available or formulate and prove one, to decide. However, just like in the projective case, the general type surfaces are hardest to study and don't always admit any good structure like a fibration over a curve which might have helped in their systematic study. And, by and large, the greatest success story has been in the non general type cases where there is a detailed classification of projective surfaces. Similar difficulties are encountered in the affine case and the $\bar\kappa\leq{1}$ affine surfaces are amenable to detailed study. Of course, there are some strong results about general type surfaces also which are in spirit the same as in the case of surface geography problem. To find out more about these things one may look at Iitaka's book(GTM,76) and Miyanishi's book. 

The McKay correspondence mentioned in Hailong's and Mike's answers extends to maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over the invariant rings $R=k[x,y]^G$, where $G$ is a finite subgroup of $GL(2,k)$ (with $|G|$ invertible in $k$). In particular (Herzog) all such subrings have only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable MCM modules, that is, they have finite CM type. The converse is true in characteristic zero -- that a two-dimensional complete normal domain over $\mathbb{C}$ of finite CM type is a ring of invariants -- by a result of Auslander. The case $G \subset SL(2,k)$ corresponds to $R$ being Gorenstein, and in particular a hypersurface -- namely the ADE hypersurfaces listed in Mike's answer. The correspondence between the irreducible representations of $G$ and the components of the exceptional fiber extends to include the irreducible MCM modules, and the McKay quiver (aka Dynkin diagram) is the same as the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver. The modules are directly connected to the irreps by Auslander, and directly connected to the components of the fiber by Gonzales-Sprinberg--Verdier and Artin--Verdier, extended to the non-Gorenstein case by Esnault and Wunram. Most of this is in the current draft of my notes with Roger Wiegand on MCM modules, chapters 4, 5, and 6. (Ignore the geometry in Chapter 5 -- it's riddled with errors and I'm currently rewriting it. Or you're welcome to point out errors I might not have noticed yet.) The question of what happens to the Auslander-Reiten-McKay correspondence for $G \not\subset SL(2)$ is addressed in some recent papers of Iyama and Wemyss. (You only get some of the indecomposable MCMs, the so-called special ones.) 

Can someone please clarify if there always exist regular neighborhoods for a properly embedded surface in a 3-manifold? More precisely, if $F$ is a properly embedded surface in a 3-manifold $M$ and I give a simplicial complex structure to $M$, then will $F$ automatically recieve a subcomplex structure (after probably finitely many barycentric subdivisions of the triangulation of $M$) ? If this is so, then we can obviously construct a regular neighborhood of $F$. But I am feeling unsure about it now due to the following example where $F$ might be too big to allow such a compatible subdivision of the triangulation of $M$: Example: Consider a mobius band without a contractible neighborhood in a genus 1 handlebody. One can construct one as follows: First take a solid cylinder $D^2\times{[-1,1]}$ and look at the central strip. Now glue the ends of the cylinder with $180$ degrees twist to make it a genus 1 handlebody. This will glue the central strip with a twist to make it a mobius band and it has no small neighborhood in the ambient genus 1 handlebody. It seems to me that this mobius band will not have a subcomplex structure for any given simplicial complex structure on the genus 1 handlebody. In case the answer to my question is yes, I would also like to ask if there are no issues regarding the orientability of $F$ and $M$ while considering regular neighborhoods. That is whether it matters for constructing such a neighborhood if $F$ is non-orientable but $M$ is orientable or vice-versa or other combinations. I am unable to clarify this by looking at Hempel's book on 3-manifolds. It would be great if someone could elucidate this. 

By the hypercube I mean the lattice formed by all n-bit strings ordered by pointwise inequality. For example, $000 \leq 110$, $010 \leq 110$, $110$ and $001$ are not comparable. Further we have the meet and join operations $\wedge$ and $\vee$ that take the pointwise max and min. For example $010 \wedge 110 = 010$ and $001 \vee 100 = 101$. A submodular measure $\mu$ is a function from the hypercube to nonnegative reals satisfying $\mu(x) + \mu(y) \geq \mu(x \wedge y) + \mu(x \vee y)$ for all $x$ and $y$. My question is, what is a minimal set of $(x,y)$ such that if the inequality above holds for these $(x,y)$ then it holds for all $(x,y)$ (and hence $\mu$ is submodular)? The question comes out of mere curiousity (I want to understand submodularity in a more intuitive way) - I first guessed it suffices to check all pairs of elements of same rank. I'm still not sure whether that's true. If $x$ and $y$ are comparable, then the inequality is vacuous by itself. 

The two papers cited below might be of some interest to you: Theorem 3.3 of (1) says that for a Krull domain $R$, $Cl(R)/Pic(R)$ is torsion iff local class groups are torsion at the maximal ideals. It is also a remark before Theorem 13 of (2), attributed to Chouinard, that any abelian group appears as the Class group of some local Krull domain. So for constructing an example as you want we may choose a local Krull domain $R$ with $Cl(R)$ a free abelian group and try to see if we can manage the image of $Pic$ in $Cl$ to be of finite index. I am unable to construct such an example right away, however its existence seems morally possible to me.

A really neat well known example is as follows: Choose a conic $C_1$ and a tangential line $C_2$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$ and asssociate to a point $P$ on $C_1$ the point of intersection $Q$ of $C_2$ and the tangent line to $C_1$ at $P$. This gives a birational isomorphism from $C_1$ to $C_2$. Identify the curves by this map to get the quotient variety $\phi:\mathbb{P}^2\rightarrow{X}$ with $C:=\phi(C_1)$. Now if there was an embedding of $X$ in a smooth scheme then, there would surely exist an effective line bundle on $X$, say $L$ whose pull back to $\mathbb{P}^2$ will obviously be effective. Let us see why this is a contradiction. Let $L'$ be the pullback of $L$ to $\mathbb{P}^2$. Note that the degrees of $L'|C_1$ and $L'|C_2$ both coincide with the degree of $L|C$ and are therefore equal. But $L'\cong\mathcal{O}(k)$ and therefore the degrees in question are $2k$ and $k$ respectively for $C_1$ and $C_2$. Therefore $k=0$ and $L'\cong\mathcal{O}$, which is non-effective! A contradiction! In view of VA's comment, I give a complete proof here for constructing $X$ as a scheme. In our special case it is a trivial pushout construction: Here I am thinking of $Y$ as $C_1\amalg{C_2}$, $Y'=C$ (the quotient by the birational isomorphism above), and $Z=\mathbb{P}^2$, but the argument is more general provided any finite set of closed points in $Z$ is contained in an affine open set. $X$ will denote the quotient. Claim: Suppose $j:Y\rightarrow{Z}$ is a closed subscheme of a scheme $Z$, and $g:Y\rightarrow{Y'}$ is a finite surjective morphism which induces monomorphism on coordinate rings. Then there is a unique commutative diagram (which I don't know how to draw here, but one visualize it easily): $Y\xrightarrow{j}{Z}$, $Y\xrightarrow{g}Y'$, $Y'\rightarrow{X}$, $Z\xrightarrow{h}X$ where $X$ is a scheme, $h$ is finite and induces monomorphisms on coordinate rings and $Y'\rightarrow{X}$ is a closed immersion. Proof: First assume that $Z$ is affine, in which case $Y,Y'$ are both affine too. Let $A,A/I,B$ be their respective coordinate rings. Then $B\subset{A/I}$ in a natural way. Let's use $j$ again to denote the natural map $A\rightarrow{A/I}$. Put $A'=j^{-1}(B)$ and $Spec(A')=X$. The claim is clear for $X$. Also if $Z$ is replaced by an open subset $U$ such that $g^{-1}g(U\cap{Y})=U\cap{Y}$, $X$ would be replaced by $U'=h(U)$ which is an open subset. Now this guarantees the existence of $X$ once it has been shown that $Z$ can be covered by affine open subsets $U$ such that $g^{-1}g(U\cap{Y})=U\cap{Y}$. But this is obvious in our example. For our example it is also clear from the construction of $X$ that it is actually reduced and irreducible. QED. I hope this is satisfactory. 

When I say "Markov chain" I think of a directed positively weighted (finite) graph, such that the sum of all edges going out of a vertex equals 1. Also I assume that it is aperiodic and irreducible. If the Markov chain happens to be equivalent to an "undirected Markov chain", i.e. for each directed arc (u,v) with weight w there is an arc (v,u) with same weight w, then it is easy to characterize the stationary distribution directly in terms of the graph; the stationary distribution at a vertex v is proportional to the out-degree (which in this case is half the total degree) of v. However I know of no such direct description of the stationary distribution in terms of the graph of a Markov chain that does not come from an undirected graph (except possibly for time-reversible chains, but this is a very special special case). My question is: are there any such descriptions? This is of course a bit vague(since the stationary distribution clearly depends only on the graph) but I hope it is not too vague. I would not expect an as easy description as in the undirected case (where it suffices to look in a neighbourhood of radius 1 to find the probability of any vertex), but it seems reasonable that there could be a description involving, say, all trees rooted at the vertex. This seems not to be treated in standard texts on Markov chains (correct me if wrong), where usually most effort is spent on proving existence, estimating speed of convergence, and the underlying graph is considered as 'auxilliary'. 

One inequality is obvious -- a surjection $M \longrightarrow R^r$ will give a subspace of dimension $r$. 

I'm promoting this comment to an answer, since it appears no one else is jumping in with a proof. Prop. 2 of this paper by Eisenbud attributes it 'essentially' to Berger, and has a sketch of a proof. 

The $A_\infty$ and $D_\infty$ plane curve singularities have defining equations $x^2=0$ and $x^2y=0$. These equations are "clearly" natural limiting cases of the equations for $A_n$ singularities $x^2 + y^{n+1}=0$ and $D_n$ singularities $x^2y+y^{n-1}=0$ as $n \to \infty$, since large powers are small in the adic topology. So we're tempted to say that $A_\infty$ and $D_\infty$ are "limits" of the "series of singularities" $\{A_n\}$ and $\{D_n\}$. This was already observed by Arnol'd in 1981, who wrote "Although the series undoubtedly exist, it is not at all clear what a series of singularities is." Have there been any attempts since Arnol'd to make sense out of the phrases in quotes in the previous paragraph? That is: 

Frankild, Sather-Wagstaff, and Wiegand: As long as ${}_BM$ is finitely generated, $A \longrightarrow B$ is flat local, $\mathfrak{m}_A B = \mathfrak{m}_B$, and the extension of residue fields is an isomorphism, this happens if and only if $\mathrm{Ext}_A^i(B,M)$ is $A$-finitely generated for all $i \geq 1$. 

I'm looking for nice explanations of these two facts. EDIT: by the topology inherited from projective space I do not mean the Zariski topology, but the classical topology (given by balls in the Euclidean metric on the affine space from which we construct projective space, say). Since I have no intuition for the Zariski topology in this embedding, I'm not even sure I've got the statement correct: one place where it occurs is on page 147 in Fulton's Young tableaux book. EDIT 2: I have gotten it wrong; Fulton claims only that the Zariski closures of the open cells equal their classical closures. But he also calls it a general fact. I guess the proper version of my first question should be: why are the Zariski closures of the open schubert cells equal to their classical closures in the Pluecker embedding, and is there a general fact from which this follows? 

One good way to understand Arrow's paradox (not sure if the 'everyday life' condition applies here!) is via homology. See for example Baryshnikov: Unifying Impossibility Theorems: A Topological Approach. Basically, voter's preferences, as well as the aggregate preference, are represented as points in a topological space. The choice rule is a map between these spaces. The conditions of Arrow's theorem force the induced map on homology to be that of a dictator.
