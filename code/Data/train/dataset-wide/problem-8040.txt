First, $V$ needs to be the type of variety for which the ring of regular functions $O(V)$ separates points. If it doesn't, then that establishes an equivalence relation on $V$ and you might as well pass to the quotient in which points are separated. Thus $V$ is an affine algebraic variety. Moreover, if $V$ is complex, then you have to take its realification to have any hope of approximating smooth functions; the complex regular functions are all holomorphic and would at best approximate the space of holomorphic functions. So, we can suppose that $V$ is an affine real algebraic variety, or in scheme-speak, the real points of an affine real algebraic variety. If $V$ is compact, then the Stone-Weierstrass theorem directly tells you that $O(V)$ is dense in $C^\infty(V)$. Okay, you have to extend the Stone-Weierstrass theorem to derivatives, but in finite dimensions you can do that. And you have to consider derivatives at singularities of $V$ if you want to allow singularities. But I don't think that there is any real problem with that either. If $V$ is not compact, then I have a little trouble interpreting the question, but I think that it comes to the same thing. Every algebraic variety is locally compact in the analytic topology, and when you say "local coordinate patches", the reasonable interpretation is coordinate patches whose closures are compact. If $X$ is any suitably tame locally compact space and you make a Fréchet topology on $C^\infty(X)$ by exhausting $X$ by a sequence of compact subsets, then you can extend the Stone-Weierstrass theorem by diagonalization. I don't know what is meant by characterizing topologies on $O(V)$ that come from differentiable structure. I can't think of another equally natural Fréchet topology on all of $C^\infty(V)$, other than to take the sup of each derivative on each compact set. But, if you are willing to work with only part of $C^\infty(V)$, and if you are willing to give $V$ a Riemannian metric, then you can use $L^p$ norms instead of sup norms. Or you can make a Banach space instead of a Fréchet space by making some algebraic combination of the seminorms instead of listing them separately. I think that the resulting space is typically smaller than all of $C^\infty(V)$, but it can still be big enough to include all of $O(V)$. It is then a different locally convex topology on $O(V)$ because it has a different completion. (This answer doesn't feel all that creative, so maybe the intended question is different?) 

First of all, "cohomological dimension" means two different things. The cohomological dimension of $X$ could be the largest $n$ such that $H^n(X)$ does not vanish. This definition is appropriate for defining the cohomological dimension of a group $G$ to be the cohomological dimension of its classifying space $BG$. It could also mean the supremum of $n$ for all closed subsets $C \subseteq X$ such that $H^n(X,C) \ne 0$. This second definition is more appropriate for geometry. By this second definition, an $n$-ball is $n$-dimensional, because you can let $C$ be its boundary. In this second, more geometric approach, it's standard and better to use Čech cohomology. So I should really write $\check{H}^n(X,C)$, but I won't bother. Also, you can ask for the cohomological dimension with various coefficients, and you might get different answers. There is a very interesting review by Dranishnikov of cohomological dimension theory of compact metric spaces. It includes his famous construction of a compact metric space whose covering dimension is $\infty$ and whose cohomological dimension (over $\mathbb{Z}$) is 3. Theorem: (elementary) If $X$ is any topological space and $A$ is an abelian group, then $\dim_A X \le \dim X$, where the right side is the covering dimension. As Torsten Ekedahl points out, this inequality follows quickly from the definition of Čech cohomology and the fairly similar definition of covering dimension. In both cases you use the nerve of an open covering. In Čech cohomology, you take the limit of the cohomology of the nerve. In covering dimension, you take the lim inf of the dimension of the nerve, QED. Theorem: (elementary) (1) $\dim_A X \le \dim_{\mathbb{Z}} X$; (2) For every $A$, $\dim_A X = 0$ iff $\dim X = 0$; (3) $\dim_\mathbb{Z} X = 1$ iff $\dim X = 1$; (4) For every $A$ and every $n$-dimensional compact simplicial complex $K$, $\dim_A K = n$. I would guess that (4) also applies to compact CW complexes. Theorem: (Alexandroff) If $X$ is a compact metric space and if its covering dimension $\dim X$ is finite, then $\dim X = \dim_{\mathbb{Z}} X$. Theorem: (Pontryagin) For each prime $p$, there is a "surface" $X$ whose $\mathbb{Z}/p$-dimension is 2, and whose $\mathbb{Z}/q$-dimension is 1 for any prime $q \ne p$. In light of Alexandroff's theorem, if you want cohomological dimension and covering dimension to differ for a compact metric space, the covering dimension has to be infinite. Whether this was possible was a long-standing open problem; Dranishnikov found the first example. He also describes an example of Dydak and Walsh of a compact metric space $X$ such that $\dim_{\mathbb{Z}} X = 2$ but $\dim_{\mathbb{Z}} X \times X = 3$. 

Since Zev asks for a uniqueness theorem in the comments, here is one that shows both the merits and limitations of the characteristic polynomial as an answer. For simplicity let $F$ have characteristic 0. Let $K$ be a field extension of degree $n$ which is generic in the sense that the Galois group is $S_n$. Then any Galois-invariant polynomial in $\alpha \in K$ and its Galois conjugates, is a symmetric polynomial. The theorem is that the algebra of symmetric polynomials is generated by elementary symmetric polynomials, which are exactly the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of $\alpha$. (This is using the fact that the eigenvalues of $\alpha$ as a map are itself and its Galois conjugates.) In particular, the trace is the unique linear such map up to a scalar; and any multiplicative polynomial of this type is a power of the norm. You can also describe the norm as the last Galois-invariant polynomial (the one of degree $n$) that provides new information. But if the Galois group is smaller, then the ring of invariant polynomials in $\alpha$ and its Galois conjugates is larger, and any of these other invariant polynomials is also "nice". These extras are somewhat hidden by the fact that, for any Galois group, the trace is still the only linear example and the norm is still the only multiplicative example. Well, the original question was open-ended. I think that this answer does fit one interpretation of the question, but maybe it is too standard and maybe there are also other interesting answers. 

Since Gjergji brings up isoperimetric inequalities, there is a lot of attention in combinatorial geometry devoted to combinatorial versions. For instance, if $f$ is a Boolean function $f$ on $n$ bits, define its "instability" to be the number of ways that $f(\vec{x}) \ne f(\vec{y})$ when $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ differ in one bit. If half of the values of $f$ are 0 and half are 1, then the theorem is that the most stable choice of $f$ is a function $f(\vec{x}) = x_k$ that only depends on one bit. On the theme of one-step proofs in geometry that depend on another theorem, there is a one-step proof of this fact using the standard spherical isoperimetric inequality. 

Intersection homology and cohomology are still around, but as a topic they have just substantially been renamed. They are part of the theory of perverse sheaves, which are widely used in the Langlands program, in algebraic geometry approaches to categorification, and elsewhere in algebraic geometry. To the extent that intersection homology was intended for topology, it has stoked relatively less interest than in algebraic geometry. On the one hand, there has been a trend away from homological algebra in geometric topology. On the other hand, singularities are part of the structure of intersection homology. Singularies are more germane to geometric topology than to algebraic topology in the sense of homotopy theory. Both singularities and homological algebra are major aspects of algebraic geometry. 

This is partly plagiarizing from David's insightful answer below, but I can't resist an addendum to his remarks. In the paper, The triangle-free process, Tom Bohman simplifies the construction of Kim that David cites. He makes a maximal triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices in using simplest plausible method: The random greedy algorithm. The result is a graph that is statistically very predictable. Its independence number is almost always $\Theta(\sqrt{n \log n})$, and therefore so is its maximum valence. Its average valence is also in the same class. You can easily make graphs like this yourself with a simple computer program and see their properties. It's ironic, but a common theme, that a very simple random algorithm is more efficient than a highly symmetric construction such as the Kneser graphs. As David explains, you get an immediate lower bound of maximum valence $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ for any graph of diameter 2 or even radius 2. The Kneser graphs above have valence $O(n^\alpha)$ with $\alpha = \log_{27/4}(4) \approx 0.726$. So the Kim-Bohman result is much stronger, and that's why he pointed out Kim's paper. In fact, this result closes a circle for me. A triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices is also a type of "packing design" in which each triple of vertices only has room for two edges. The original paper that introduced the random greedy algorithm in the topic of packing designs is by Gordon, Kuperberg, Patashnik, and Spencer. In that paper, we were looking at packing designs at the opposite end, for instance choosing triples of points with a random greedy algorithm such that no edge is contained in more than one triple. (The paper says covering designs, but at our end of the asymptotics, they are almost the same as packing designs.) It's the same highly predictable phenomenon at both ends. One of the ideas in this paper was to simplify a fancier construction using "Rödl nibbles" to the random greedy algorithm. Bohman is doing the same thing (but with much stronger asymptotics than in our paper), because Kim also uses Rödl nibbles. 

I haven't spent as much time on this good question as I wanted to. I also haven't spent nearly as much time on the important topic that it comes from as I wanted to. But here is a stab at it. First, Khovanov and Lauda don't actually categorify the true $U = U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. Lusztig doesn't actually find a canonical basis for it either. Instead, they work with an atomized form $\dot{U}$ that, as far as I can tell, amounts to the representation category of $U$. If I'm right about that, then the categorification gives you no hint as to how to decorate the Hopf category to make its 2-category of representations happy, because the question is tautological. One thing that is going on is something that you identified as a hint of trouble in your question: Given two irreps $V_\alpha$ and $V_\beta$, there are actually three basified combinations, using the tensor basis, the canonical basis, and the dual canonical basis. I'm going to guess that they have categorifications with functors between them like this: $$\mathcal{V}_\alpha \diamondsuit \mathcal{V}_\beta \leftarrow \mathcal{V}_\alpha \otimes \mathcal{V}_\beta \to \mathcal{V}_\alpha \heartsuit \mathcal{V}_\beta.$$ (Maybe it is not as simple as these arrows, but there is hopefully some sort of association. Also I don't feel like using the symbol $\boxtimes$, but maybe I should.) I think that the paper Khovanov-Lauda I has a true categorifigation of $U^+ = U_q(\mathfrak{g}^+)$ with the structure that you reject as the wrong answer. Namely, their induction and restriction functors are functors $$M:\mathcal{U}^+ \otimes \mathcal{U}^+ \to \mathcal{U}^+ \qquad \Delta:\mathcal{U}^+ \to \mathcal{U}^+ \otimes \mathcal{U}^+$$ So maybe $\mathcal{U}^+$ does act on all three of the above categorical products, and maybe $\mathcal{U}^-$ does too, but the actions don't fit together perfectly. It's known that you can understand a representation of the decategorified $U$ as a certain kind of twisted Hopf module of $U^+$ (using the quantum double formula of Drinfeld), or equivalently as a twisted bimodule of $U^+$ and $U^-$. Maybe the quantum double formula should be categorified in some way that does not lead to a categorification of $U$, since people haven't constructed one. This suggestion is a bit like Chris' suggestion of a Hopfish categorification, but it would instead be a Hopf categorification that is double-ish. Also it might only be braided-ish, since that comes from the quantum double. Note that Khovanov and Lauda also didn't categorify the antipode in their paper, just the bialgebra structure.
