This is not exactly a solution, but what seems a good way to approach the problem. 1) Consider for each player $k$ the team $I(k)$ to which he brings a maximal value $$ v(k)=\max_i f_i(k) = f_{I(k)}(k). $$ BTW: note, that most probably for most of the players $v(k)$ is quite close to 1, as it is a maximum of $b\gg 1$ independent $R[0,1]$'s; to be more precise, the expectation of $v(k)$ is $1-\frac{1}{b+1}$. 2) Take a "greedy" way of forming the teams: put each player $k$ into the team $I(k)$ where he plays the best. Then, each player equiprobably goes to any of the teams, hence the number of players in any team is equal to the sum of $b^2$ expectation-$1/b$ Bernoulli variables, and thus is roughly normal with expectation and dispersion $\sim b$. In particular, the teams formed in this way are roughly equal, differing from $b$ by something like $\sqrt{b}$. If I'm not mistaken, this means that the product for this case differs (in average, most probably) from the theoretical maximum of $b^b$ by a factor of constant. (This could be surprising, as in the theoretical upper bound 1 is used instead of all the values, but in fact the greedy method almost gets 1 everywhere, and $(1-1/b)^b$ is $1/e$ -- a constant) 3) The idea now is that if you divide the players in a strongly non-equal way, you will get a value that will be lower than the ``greedy'' one. 4) Namely: imagine, that one of the teams is much smaller than the average, that it has less than $\epsilon b$ players (where, say, $\epsilon=\frac{1}{10}$). Then, you get an upper bound for the product by $\epsilon b$ times $(b+(1-\epsilon)b\cdot \frac{1}{b-1})^{b-1}$ (it is a bit rough: we're again setting all the players to values 1). But this is a theoretical maximum of $b^b$, multiplied by a constant, which is approximately equal to $\epsilon \cdot \exp(1-\epsilon)$, and the smaller is $\epsilon$, the smaller it becomes. In particular, for sufficiently small $\epsilon$ it becomes smaller, than the constant that we are getting in the greedy algorithm. The same applies if one of the teams is too large, larger than $Ab$. The upper bound is again $b^b$ times $A\cdot \exp(1-A)$, and the factor $A\cdot \exp(1-A)$ tends to zero as $A$ tends to infinity. 5) Finally, it looks quite plausible that one can make the above arguments work for $\epsilon$ and $A$ arbitrarily close to $1$, but for that one should improve the above arguments in two points: *) First, take $S=\sum_k v(k)$ to be maximal possible sum of values, and use $(S/b^2)^b$ as a reference point instead of $b^b$. *) Second, re-equilibrate the teams: for every player, consider the team which is second-best for him, and try moving $\sim \sqrt{b}$ players from large teams to smaller ones, which are second-best for them. It looks plausible that with this improvement of the greedy algorithm you get a product that is equivalent to our new maximum-reference point $(S/b^2)^b$, while any $\epsilon<1$ or $A>1$ reduce maximum possible value by a constant factor. 

The conjectured identity $$ f(q)=(q;q)_\infty\left(1+\sum_{k=1}^\infty q^k(-q;q)^2_{k-1}\right)=\sum_{\substack{m,n\geqslant0\\n\ne1}}(-1)^mq^{\frac{(m+n)(3m+n+1)}2},\tag{1} $$ using Euler's pentagonal number theorem $(q;q)_\infty=\sum _{m=-\infty}^\infty (-1)^m q^{\frac{1}{2} m (3 m+1)}$ can be brought to an equivalent form $$ (q;q)_\infty\sum_{k=1}^\infty q^k(-q;q)^2_{k-1}=\sum_{\substack{m\ge0}}\sum_{\substack{n\ge 1}}(-1)^mq^{\frac{(m+n)(3m+n+1)}2}.\tag{1a} $$ By identity $(4.1)$ in Rhoades' paper the sum on the LHS of $(1a)$ is $$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty q^k(-q;q)^2_{k-1}=\frac{1}{2(q;q)_{\infty }} \sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{q^{\frac{1}{2} n (n+1)}}{q^n+1}-\frac{1}{4}\sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac{q^{k^2}}{(-q;q)_k^2},\tag{2} $$ while the double sum in $(1a)$ \begin{align} \sum_{\substack{m\ge0}}\sum_{\substack{n\ge 1}}(-1)^mq^{\frac{(m+n)(3m+n+1)}2}&=\sum _{m=0}^\infty \sum _{k=m+1}^\infty (-1)^mq^{\frac{k(k+1+2m)}2}\\ &=\sum _{k=1}^\infty \sum _{m=0}^{k-1} (-1)^m q^{m k+\frac{1}{2} (k+1) k}\\ &=\sum _{k=1}^\infty q^{\frac{k^2}{2}+\frac{k}{2}} \frac{1-(-1)^k q^{k^2}}{1+q^k}.\tag{3} \end{align} Since $\sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{q^{\frac{1}{2} n (n+1)}}{q^n+1}=\frac{1}{2}+2 \sum _{n=1}^\infty \frac{q^{\frac{1}{2} n (n+1)}}{q^n+1}$ $(2)$ and $(3)$ contain the same sum $\sum _{n=1}^\infty \frac{q^{\frac{1}{2} n (n+1)}}{q^n+1}$. This sum cancels out after $(2)$ and $(3)$ are substituted in $(1a)$ resulting in $$ \frac14-\frac{(q;q)_{\infty }}{4}\sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac{q^{k^2}}{(-q;q)_k^2}=-\sum _{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n q^{\frac{3 n^2}{2}+\frac{n}{2}}}{1+q^n},\tag{1c} $$ and equivalently $$ \sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac{q^{k^2}}{(-q;q)_k^2}=\frac{2}{(q;q)_{\infty }}\sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n q^{\frac{3 n^2}{2}+\frac{n}{2}}}{1+q^n}.\tag{1d} $$ $(1d)$ corresponds to the special case $x=-1$ of the identity $$ \sum _{k=0}^\infty \frac{q^{k^2}}{(x q;q)_k(q/x;q)_k}=\frac{1-x}{(q;q)_{\infty }}\sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n q^{\frac{3 n^2}{2}+\frac{n}{2}}}{1-xq^n},\tag{4} $$ which can be obtained from Watson-Whipple transformation formula (see the paper "Modular transformations of Ramanujan’s fifth and seventh order mock theta functions", Ramanujan J. 7 (2003), 193–222. by Gordon and McIntosh). $(4)$ also can be proved directly by partial fractions expansion and the following limiting case of q-Gauss summation $$ \sum _{k=n}^\infty\frac{q^{k^2}}{(q;q)_{k-n}(q^{n+1};q)_{k}}=\frac{q^{n^2}}{(q^{n+1};q)_n}\sum _{k=0}^\infty\frac{q^{k^2+2kn}}{(q;q)_{k}(q^{2n+1};q)_{k}}=\frac{q^{n^2}}{(q^{n+1};q)_\infty}. $$ 

First of all this has nothing to do with the inflection point of $e^{-\alpha x^2}$. According to Poisson summation formula (see Whittaker, Watson, Modern analysis, chapter 21.51) $$ \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\alpha (x-n)^2}=2{\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}}}\left(1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\frac{\pi^2}{\alpha}n^2}\cos2\pi n x\right),\quad \text{Re}~\alpha>0.\tag{1} $$ From this formula one can see that when $\alpha>0$ is small, the Fourier coefficients $a_n=2{\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}}}e^{-\frac{\pi^2}{\alpha}n^2}$ of the resulting function decreases rapidly with increasing $n$. When $\alpha=1/2$ one has $$ \frac{a_1}{a_0}=2e^{-2\pi^2}\approx 5.4\times 10^{-9}. $$ I don't know any conceptual explanation for this in mathematics, but there is such an explanation that comes from physics. Consider a quantum particle with mass $m$ on a ring of radius $a$. We assume the ring is pierced with magnetic flux $\phi$. We want to calculate partition function of this system at temperature $T>0$ in two different ways. On the one hand, it is known that the energy spectrum of the particle is given by $$ E_n=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^2}\left(n+\frac{\phi}{\phi_0}\right)^2, $$ where $\phi_0$ is the so called magnetic flux quantum. Then partition function is given as the Gibbs sum $$ Z=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-E_n/T}=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^2T}\left(n+{\phi}/{\phi_0}\right)^2}.\tag{2} $$ Here one immediately recognizes the sum analogous to the LHS of $(1)$. On the other hand, partition function is related to the trace of the density matrix $\rho_{\theta_1,\theta_2}$, i.e. to $\int\rho_{\theta,\theta}d\theta$. It is possible to calculate the density matrix of this system in imaginary time representation by solving a certain differential equation. Details of this calculation can be found for example in this book, chapter 4.3. Consider first the more simple case of unbounded line $-\infty<\theta<+\infty$; then the answer is $$ \rho_{\theta_1,\theta_2}=Ce^{-\frac{mTa^2(\theta_1-\theta_2)^2}{2\hbar^2}}, $$ where $C$ is some normalization constant. Magnetic flux does not enter this expression because there is not any nontrivial loop in the system. On a ring there is a nontrivial loop, and let $n$ be the winding number. It is known that the partition function is a sum over all homotopy classes multiplied by corresponding phase factor. In this case the phase factor comes from the magnetic flux (Aharonov-Bohm phase) and equals $e^{2\pi in\phi/\phi_0}$. As a result we have \begin{align} Z&=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{2\pi in\phi/\phi_0}\int\rho_{\theta,\theta+2\pi n}d\theta\\ &=2\pi C \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\frac{2\pi^2mTa^2}{\hbar^2}n^2+2\pi in\phi/\phi_0}.\tag{3} \end{align} Combining $(2)$ and $(3)$ one obtains the transformation in $(1)$. One can see from this physical interpretation that when the temperature $T$ increases, then the higher Fourier harmonics decrease. This corresponds to the physical intuition that the higher the temperature the more chaotic the system becomes and the effect of the Aharonov-Bohm phase averages out due to thermal fluctuations. 

Yes, it does. As the random variable is positive, consider the Laplace transform $f(\lambda)=E \exp(-\lambda X)$ (instead of the Fourier one). Then, one has $f^2(\lambda)= f(2\lambda)$. Taking the logarithm, one gets $2\log f(\lambda)=\log f(2\lambda)$, and for the function $g(\lambda)=\frac{\log f(\lambda)}{\lambda}$ this implies $g(2\lambda)=g(\lambda)$. Finally, pass to the limit as $\lambda\to\infty$. Then $g(\lambda)$ tends to the essential infimum of the law of $X$. On the other hand, $g(e^s)$ is $\log 2$-periodic; as it has a limit as $s\to\infty$, this is a constant function. Hence, $g$ is a constant function, and thus $X$ is constant almost surely. 

Also not a complete answer, but if you do not require that $\partial E$ is connected, the answer is zero, because you can take a unit square, and remove $n^2$ circles centered in a grid with mesh $1/n$ that are of radius $1/n^3$ (so their influence on the perimeter is neglectable). Finally, the argument of Benoît shows that even if you assume that the boundary is connected, it is \emph{not} the disk that is an optimizer. Indeed, you can take three circles that are tangent to each other. Due to Benoît's argument this shape has the same constant as a disk itself. Now, this shape has a small concave empty triange inside. Now, one can change the corners of this triangle: "open" one (with an arbitrarily small perturbation) and add to $E$ the small, but noticable zones in two other ones, that does not increase the boundary area, does not increase the incircle radii (there still is sufficient boundary to stop them from growing), and increases the area of $E$. 

I would say that yes. In fact, a nearby question is "why the heat kernel on a Riemannian manifold exists" (well, it depends on what do you prefer to construct first: the Brownian motion [say, out of discrete random walk], then using it to solve the heat equation, or the heat kernel, then using it to define the Brownian motion). Both questions can be answered simultaneously via an explicit construction. You can find it in Candel, Conlon, Foliations II, 2003, page 441, and the keyword is "parametrix". It is an "almost-solution": an explicit function $H(t,x,y)$, that is singular at $t=0$, but sufficiently well approximates the heat kernel so that $\partial_t H - \Delta H$ is a nice function $K$. Then you can find the true heat kernel $h(t,x,y)$ by correcting $H$ by a series of convolutions (in both space and time): $H-H*(K+K*K-K*K*K+\dots)$. And out of this, you get everything. Well, it's perhaps a bit too heavy artillery for such a simple question (normally, you were asking only for that a heat kernel on a manifold behaves in the same was as in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where it is given by an explicit formula). But at least it works. 

The paper Two-dimensional series evaluations via the elliptic functions of Ramanujan and Jacobi deals exactly with double sums of this kind and shows how to evaluate them in terms of elliptic functions. The book Lattice sums then and now gives alternative methods to calculate lattice sums. 

The following formula gives a parametric extension of $(1)$ for $|a|$ sufficiently small \begin{align} \small\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{\left(e^x+e^{-x}+e^{a+ix\sqrt{3}}\right)^2}+e^a\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{\left(e^{a+x}+e^{-x}+e^{ix\sqrt{3}}\right)^2}+e^a\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{\left(e^{a+x}+e^{-x}+e^{-ix\sqrt{3}}\right)^2}=1 \end{align} This means that $(1)$ is not an isolated result. In view of this one might be very sceptical that any number theoretic interpretation of the integral exists. 

It was shown by Paul Ehrenfest in 1917 that Coulomb interaction is unstable at spatial dimensions higher than three P. Ehrenfest, In what way does it become manifest in the fundamental laws of physics that space has three dimensions? Proc. Netherlands Acad. Arts Sci., 20 (1917), 200 - 209.: In $R_n$ for $n>3$ the planet falls on the attracting centre or flies away infinitely. In $R_n$ for $n>3$ there do not exist motions comparable with the elliptic motion in $R_3$,- all trajectories have the character of spirals. This analysis has been extended to quantum mechanics in Tangherlini, F. R. (1963). "Atoms in Higher Dimensions". Nuovo Cimento. 14 (27): 636. 

It turns out that the answer is quite easy. Take $p=q^2$,$~z=1$,$~b=q^2a$, then $$ \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty (bq^n,p/aq^n;p)_\infty z^n q^{n(n-1)/2}=2 \left(q a,q/a;q^2\right){}_{\infty }\sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{\left(-1/a\right)^n q^{n^2+n}}{1-a q^{2 n+1}}. $$ The sum on the RHS is proportional to Appell-Lerch sum $$ m(qa^2,q^2,q^2/a) $$ in the notation of the paper E. Mortenson, D. Hickerson, Hecke-type double sums, Appell-Lerch sums, and mock theta functions (I), Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, (3) 109 (2014), no. 2, 382-422. In general Appell-Lerch sums do not have infinite product representations. For example take $a=q^{-1/2}$, then we get the sum of the type $m(1,q^2,z)$,$~z\neq 1$ which is related to mock theta function of order $2$, formula $(4.2)$ in the paper cited above. Therefore $(1)$ can not have a closed form. 

The formula $$ \small\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty (bq^n,p/aq^n;p)_\infty z^n q^{n(n-1)/2}=\frac{(-z,-q/z;q)_\infty}{\ln\frac{1}{q}}\int\limits_0^\infty\frac{\left(bt/z,pz/at;p\right)_\infty}{\left(-t,-q/t;q\right)_\infty}\frac{dt}{t},\quad |p|<|q|,\tag{1} $$ or alternatively in more symmetric form $$ \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{(bq^n,p/aq^n;p)_\infty}{(-zq^n,-q/zq^n;q)_\infty} =\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{\left(bq^x,p/aq^x;p\right)_\infty}{\left(-zq^x,-q/zq^x;q\right)_\infty}dx,\quad |p| < |q| $$ is a q-analogue of $$ \small\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{i\theta n}}{\Gamma(b+\alpha n)\Gamma(1-a-\alpha n)}=\int\limits_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{e^{i\theta t}dt}{\Gamma(b+\alpha t)\Gamma(1-a-\alpha t)},\quad 0 < \alpha < 1,~-\pi<\theta<\pi.\tag{2} $$ It is known that both the series and the integral in $(2)$ have a closed form $\frac{(1+e^{i\theta})^{b-1-a}e^{i(1-b)\theta}}{\alpha\Gamma(b-a)}$(T. Osler, SIAM J. MATH. ANAL. Vol. 3, No. 1, 1972) and in fact that $(2)$ is a generalized binomial theorem. It is also known that if $p=q,~|b|<|pz/q|<|a|$ then $(1)$ is Ramanujan's psi sum and Ramanujan's beta-integral (see Gasper and Rahman, Basic hypergeometric series, chapters 5-6). Also there is a closed form for the sum when $b=a$ (AMM problem 11742): \begin{align} \small\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty (aq^n,p/aq^n;p)_\infty z^n q^{n(n-1)/2}=(q,-z,-{q}/{z};q)_{\infty }(p/q,a/z,pz/aq;p/q)_{\infty }/(p;p)_\infty,\quad |p|<|q|. \end{align}
