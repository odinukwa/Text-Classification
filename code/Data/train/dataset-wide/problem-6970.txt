In Progress and Poverty, Henry George claims that the advancement of technology eventually leads to increasing the land value and the land rent. This means that people who own land will have a high income, whether or not they work, while people without land will have to pay most of their free income to the landlords as rent. 

A proportional division is a kind of fair division in which a resource is divided among $n$ partners with subjective valuations, and each partner receives a share which is worth for him at least $1/n$ of the total resource value. This definition is cardinal in nature: it relies on the assumption that each partner has a numeric value function which is unique up to scaling. Suppose that all we know about the partners is that they have an ordinal preference relation. Is there a natural way to define the notion of proportional fairness in this case? I thought of several possibilities myself, but I would like to know if something like this has already been done in the literature. 

I can do simple calculations in micro-economics, such as: given the utility function of a consumer, calculate his demand curves; given utility functions of two consumers and initial endowment, calculate the competitive equilibrium; etc. However, the calculations become tedious and I am looking for a software that can do them automatically. For example, I am looking for a software where I can: 

$$(x_F,y_F) = \frac{1}{|F|}\sum_{i\in F} (x_i,y_i)$$ If the budget-set is convex, then this bundle is also in the budget set. 

$$ u_F(x,y) = \min_{i\in F} u_i(x,y) $$ Then, calculate the demand in the usual way: select a bundle $(x_F,y_F)$ that maximizes the aggregate utility $u_F$ in the budget-set. A problem with this method is that it requires to normalize the members' utility functions to the same scale. 

In recent social protests, I have heard the claim that the economic growth benefits only the rich: they become richer while most people become poorer. To check whether this claim is realistic, I looked for data relating economic growth (measured by the increase GDP) and real wages. I found this blog post, which shows that in the UK in 2008-2014, there has been positive economic growth while the real wages were declining. The writer offers several explanations to this phenomenon, but they may be specific to the UK. So, my question is: what are some other examples of economic growth that comes together with decreasing real wages? In general, what are examples of economic growth periods, in which few people benefit while most people become poorer? 

A consumer's preferences are represented by the following utility function: $$u(x,y,m) = x+y+m$$ where $m$ is money. Are the goods $x,y$ substitute goods or independent goods? Microeconomic textbooks say that they are perfect substitutes. Why? Because the consumer will always want to spend his entire budget on the cheapest product. So, if $p_x<p_y<1$, the consumer will demand only x, while if $p_x$ increases above $p_y$, the consumer will demand only y. So, the demand of y increases with the price of x. But consider the following situation: x and y are two kinds of rare items that are sold in an auction. The consumer has enough money to buy all available units. Then, if $p_x<1$ the consumer will want to buy all available units of x regardless of $p_y$, and if $p_y<1$ the consumer will want to buy all available units of y regardless of $p_x$. By definition, this means that x and y are independent goods. Does this mean that the definition of substitutes vs. independent goods depends not only on the utility function but also on the exact situation? Are there any references that discuss this issue? 

Now the minimax value is 32, and a maximin strategy for the row player is mixing the two top rows. So my question is: In what conditions does a positive monotone transformation on a game's payoff not change its maximin and Nash equilibrium strategies? 

By definition of a Nash equilibrium, for every time $t$ and for every history $h$: $$E[Y_{h}^{t}]\leq E[X^{t}]$$ Hence also: $$E[Y^{t}]\,=\,\sum_{h}Pr[h]\cdot E[Y_{h}^{t}]\,\leq\,\sum_{h}Pr[h]\cdot E[X^{t}]\,\leq\,E[X^{t}]\cdot\sum_{h}Pr[h]\,\leq\,E[X^{t}]$$ Summing over the entire series, and using the fact that the expectation of a sum is the sum of expectations: $$E[\sum_{t=1}^{T}Y^{t}]\leq E[\sum_{t=1}^{T}X^{t}]$$ So the player cannot gain by deviating. 

What are some scenarios in which the theory of repeated games have been applied? I am looking, for example, for scenarios in which a government, a firm or a person accepted a decision which relied upon a result such as the Folk theorem. 

In a competitive market, there are 3 types of goods: X, Y and money (m). X and Y are substitute goods, and the utility functions are quasi-linear with respect to money, i.e: $$U(x,y,m) = u(x,y) + m$$ The supply of X and Y is determined exogeneously, and the prices $p_x$ and $p_y$ are then determined such that the system is in equilibrium (i.e. demands for X and Y equal their supply). Now the supply of X is increased, and a new equilibrium is achieved with new prices $p_x'$ and $p_y'$. What can we say about the new prices? 

What is the difference between the term "competitive equilibrium" and the term "general equilibrium"? Here in econ.SE, they are two different tags, so there is probably a difference between them, but I don't understand what exactly. 

Calculate the optimal bundle of each family member separately: each member selects a bundle $(x_i,y_i)$ that maximizes his utility function $u_i$ given the family's income $I$. Then, calculate the family bundle as an average of the members' bundles: 

Suppose all players play unconditioned Nash equilibria, except player $i$ who diverts and plays another strategy. The other strategy of player $i$ may depend on history. We have to show that player $i$'s payoff in the repeated game does not increase. For every time-period t, define the following random variables: 

The maxinim value is 3 and a maximin strategy for the row player is selecting the bottom row (the column player can guarantee at most 3 by mixing the two columns with equal probability). But if we raise to the 3rd power: 

Both functions are weakly-quasiconcave. When one function is increasing, the other is flat, and when the other is decreasing, the first is flat. Therefore, regardless of what transformations we apply to them, the sum will look like a wave and will not be quasaiconcave. 

What is the intuitive difference between gross and net substitutes? What are good real-life examples of these? Why is the requirement for competitive equilibrium, "gross substitute" and not "net substitute"? I.e., why does a competitive equilibrium not exist if the products are net-substitute? 

It's election time in my country. The government boasts a decrease of 5% in consumption prices thanks to removing regulations, while the opposition blames the government for an increase of 5% in housing prices. I am wondering if there is any economic relation between the two facts. Consider the following model: There are two nearby towns, A and B. Initially, each town has a single grocery store. In the housing market, there is a competitive equilibrium between the two towns, with $r_A$ the rent in A and $r_B$ the rent in B. Now, the mayor of A decides to remove regulations and allow new discount stores to operate. This immediately decreases the price of consumption goods in A. People living in B hear about this and go shopping in A. Some of them, when their rent period terminates, decide to move to A in order to live near the discount stores. House owners in A notice the increased demand and decide to raise the rent. Finally, the housing market achieves a new competitive equilibrium, with the rent in A increasing to $r_A'>r_A$. In effect, the house owners have pocketed the gain from the removal of regulations. MY QUESTIONS: 

He said (after Theorem 2.8) that, if preferences are not convex, then Pareto-efficient envy-free allocations might not exist. As an example, he brings the following economy: there are two agents with the same preferences: $$u_1(x,y) = u_2(x,y) = \min(x,y)$$ and the total bundle is $(2,1)$. I do not see how this is a negative example. If we give each agent a bundle of $(1,0.5)$, then the division is envy-free, since the value of every agent is exactly 0.5. It is also Pareto-efficient, since to increase the utility of one agent, it is necessary to give him some y from the other agent, but this hurts the utility of the other agent. Am I missing something? 

Suppose the game is played infinitely many times, and both players have discount factor $\delta$. The players want to create the outcome $4,4$ using only pure strategies. Intuitively, they should alternate between the (3,5) and the (5,3). This will give the row player: $$(1-\delta)\sum_{t=0}^\infty \delta^{2t}*3 + \delta^{2t+1}*5 = \frac{3+5\delta}{1+\delta} $$ and the column player: $$(1-\delta)\sum_{t=0}^\infty \delta^{2t}*5 + \delta^{2t+1}*3 = \frac{5+3\delta}{1+\delta} $$ The payoff vector goes to $(4,4)$ when $\delta \to 1$, but otherwise it is not exactly $(4,4)$. I am looking for references about the following questions: in what conditions is it possible to attain exactly a desired payoff vector with only pure strategies (for an arbitrary game and arbitrary number of players)? And how this payoff vector can be constructed? I looked at some papers about folk theorems for discounted infinitely-repeated games. The problem is that they usually assume that $\delta\to 1$, which is not always true in practice. 

Let: $$[0,\frac{1}{n}]\cup[\frac{2}{n},\frac{3}{n}]\cup[\frac{4}{n},\frac{5}{n}]\cup...\cup[\frac{n-2}{n},\frac{n-1}{n}]$$ $(n=1,2,...)$ represent a sequence of commodities of increasing utility. If the indicator functions of these sets are embedded in $L^\infty$ with the weak* topology, then the limit is $\frac{1}{2}1_{[0,1]}$, half the indicator function on the interval $[0,1]$. This, indeed, is a natural limit that is not in the commodity space. 

Are these preferences consistent with rational preferences, according to the "rationality" axioms of von-Neumann and Morgenstern? Initially, I thought that "obviously yes". von-Neumann and Morgenstern only talk about preferences on lotteries, but here, the agent's preferences are only given on sure sequences, so obviously there should be some rational preference relation on lotteries that is consistent with them. However, one of the rationality axioms is "continuity". It says that there exists a probability $p\in(0,1)$ such that: $$ p Z + (1-p) X \sim Y $$ The preference relation can be represented by a function $u$ such that: $u(X)=0, u(Y)=p, u(Z)=1$. But then, if we take $n>1/p$, if the agent receives $n$ units of Y, his utility is more than 1, so the agent should prefer this over receiving one unit of Z and $n-1$ units of X... What is wrong with these preferences?
