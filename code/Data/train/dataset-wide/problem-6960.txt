The statement $f\succcurlyeq f^\prime$ and for every $s$ not in $E$, $f(s)=f'(s)$ says that $f$ and $f^\prime$ have the consequences unless $E$ occurs, and $f$ is preferred to $f'$. Loosely, the sure thing principle says that if two acts differ only in their consequence should $E$ occur, their ordering should depend only on their consequences in $E$ and not on states outside of $E$. What the sure thing principle gets you is that if $f\succcurlyeq_E f^\prime$ then $f$ must be conditionally preferred to $f^\prime$ because of the consequences of $f^\prime$ in $E$. Otherwise this would not be known. Here's a plain English interpretation of conditional preference. Imagine I put together two portfolios, $A$ and $B$. I start both portfolios off with the same asset, let's just say some money in a mutual fund. In portfolio $A$ I put an additional asset that pays a dollar in all states of the world $E$ where a democrat wins the 2016 election. I give you a choice between $A$ and $B$. In action $f$ you choose $A$ and in action $f'$ you choose $B$. Presumably you prefer $f$ to $f'$. But the payoffs of $f$ and $f'$ differ only should a democrat win the 2016 election. So by the definition Karni has given you $f$ is preferred to $f'$ given $E$. With the sure thing principle, I can separate your preference in $E$ states from your preferences in not $E$ states. So I now know your preference for $f$ must stem from $f$ being in some sense better than $f'$ in $E$ states. Technically (read: obnoxiously) preferences are defined over the functional space $F$, so the abstruse definitions come from the fact that the notation $f(s)\succcurlyeq f'(s)$ or $f(s)\sim f'(s)$ is not yet defined. Instead Karni has to work with the $f_E$ notation. In this notation you'd write your idea for conditional preference as $f\succcurlyeq_E f'$ iff $f_Eh\succcurlyeq f'_Eh$ (the first part of the sure thing principle). I agree that this is more in line with my notion of what conditional preference should be. Savage mentions both senses in his discussion: 

As has already been said, the MOST fundamental equation is surely: $$\text{MB}=\text{MC}$$ EDIT: This equation is fundamental in terms of the way economists think. As pointed out in the comments below, in terms of fundamental equations of economic models, the most fundamental equations describe equivalences between the uses and supplies of items (money, goods, etc.). These provide the tension of the marginal cost side of this equation. I would add equations related to comparative statics: 

If you are looking for a light-weight, definitely somewhat partisan take on development economics (I realize this is only part of what you want) check out The Elusive Quest for Growth: Economists' Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics. It goes into the theory and history of development economics and its application to policy. If you're looking for a good overview of development economics without the history or context but with more technical details, the standard reference is I think still Debraj Ray's Development Economics. 

Apparently this is called attrition bias. It's very similar to survivorship bias. This paper suggest correcting for it using Heckman correction. Propensity score matching may also help somewhat. My experience with both has been mixed, but they are commonly used. You should figure out what exact approach is most appropriate for your setting. One last edit: These two papers, which talk about bounding the average treatment effect, may also be of use to you. 

Direct predecessors to Adam Smith within the classical tradition (maybe a more useful distinction than modern) include Hume, Locke and Dudley North. Before the classical economists, there were the physiocrats (18th century), such as Francois Quesnay and Turgot. The physiocrats emphasised agricultural productivity as a driver of the wealth of nations. They were contemporaneous with, but also preceded by mercantilists (16th century - 18th century). Mercantilists mostly concentrated on creating a favorable balance of trade, which would allow reserves to accumulate in the possession of an absolute ruler. They emphasized government control of the economy as an extension of state power. The mercantilists had a lot of influence in the policies of nations, for instance in the form of Colbert. Famous writers might include de Malynes and Mun. Mercantilists were one of the main targets of Adam Smith's critique. The distinction being that mercantilists believed the quantity of reserves to be the ultimate source of a nation's wealth and so emphasized protectionism, while Smith focused more on trade allowing inputs to become more productive. In doing so he was very influenced by Quesnay to whom he had considered dedicating The Theory of Moral Sentiments. The inclusion of gains from trade, self-interest and competition leading to increased productivity, and division of labor distinguishes Smith from these earlier writings and forms the link to "modern" economics. There were also "economists" long before the 16th century, the connections between them and economics is we understand it tends to become more tenuous the farther back you go. Iba Khaldun is a good example, Aristotle (or more likely one of his students) literally wrote a book called "Economics" (this deals with economics in the literal sense of management of a household), you could also talk about Hesiod's "Works and Days" (a very old text indeed) being an example of early economics. 

Market implied expectations from the TIPS spread. TIPS securities provide inflation protection but are otherwise roughly comparable to normal treasuries, so the difference in yields between these two is a measure of expected inflation. Consumer expectations from the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, which you can find here. Surveys of professional forecasters, such as this survey. 

This is a statement of conditional dominance: "a certain consequence $g(s)$ is better than an (uncertain) $f$ for every possible $s$ in $B$, so $g$ should be preferred to $f$ given $B$." Because we have already accepted the sure-thing principle, P7 from Savage and P7 from Karni are equivalent. If we had not accepted the sure-thing principle, Savage's would be more restrictive. So Karni is actually being less restrictive with his definition of conditional preference, and that is presumably the purpose. 

Formal tests of model fit: If you are using SMM, GMM or indirect influence check out the J-stat. If you are using maximum likelihood you want a likelihood ratio. Bayesian model testing is similar to likelihood ratios, but more complicated. Many of the DSGE models were rejected on these bases (you can see Sargent discussing it briefly in this interview). These tests are all very similar. Out of sample performance: Estimate the model, then use it to predict out of sample data. This is a tough test, but it is super useful. They aren't so common in economics, but statisticians use them a lot (often times they leave out part of the data and try the model out there). You probably want your model to pass a formal test in sample before you do an out of sample test. 

I think this piece by John Cochrane represents a typical defense of the efficient market hypothesis from this kind of critique. Here's another. The basic summary is that market efficiency does not imply that expected returns cannot vary or that bubbles will not happen. Bubbles should be unpredictable, and variation in expected returns should be driven by risk or discount factors. Whether that's the case for the financial crisis is definitely a matter of debate. Do people believe in efficient markets? I think that varies a lot from field to field. It might be more useful to say that efficient markets are usually the null or prior that academics in finance and economics work with when they try to understand something. That is to say if you want to use some data to try to convince them that financial markets aren't efficient, you face an uphill battle, but the struggle isn't impossible.
