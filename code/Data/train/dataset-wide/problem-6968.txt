Ignoring the intertemporal budget constraint, mergers and bankruptcies the distribution of returns for equity securities traded in a double auction is $$\Pr(\tilde{r}_t)=\left[\frac{\pi}{2}+\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\mu}{\gamma}\right)\right]^{-1}\frac{\gamma}{\gamma^2+(\tilde{r}_t-\mu)^2}.$$ For this see: Harris, D.E. (2017) The Distribution of Returns. Journal of Mathematical Finance , 7, 769-804. For returns calculated as the difference of logs, the returns are: $$\Pr(log(r_t))=\frac{1}{2\sigma}\text{sech}\left(\frac{\pi(\tilde{r}_t-\mu)}{2\sigma}\right)$$ 

I would think not. First, one can readily imagine cases where the Dutch book would hold, but which the independence axiom could not. Consider the presidential election of 1992. It would satisfy the necessary conditions for Bayesian reasoning and hence support the Dutch Book argument by default, but would clearly fail the independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion. If someone chose to gamble on the election, then it is difficult to imagine why bookies could not place coherent odds. On the other hand, if memory serves me correctly, the majority polled preferred Bush over Clinton, but the plurality went for Clinton. Part of that discussion, however, has to do with the particular form of von Neumann's particular axiom. He is adding zero, essentially, to a binary preference. There exist lotteries, such as those built around voting or other binary choice events, where the form of von Neumann's axiom is simply irrelevant to the problem. If you take von Neumann's form, it implies that a third lottery has no impact on a binary choice of another lottery by implying that sufficient funds exist to purchase that lottery as well. In an election, you get only one outcome, you cannot "afford" two Presidents. This only holds if you can develop a "portfolio" of lotteries in any convex combination. If you imposed additional restrictions on the type of lottery, then you may be able to get there from the Dutch book axioms, but that has more to do with the fact that you can always add zero to both sides of an equation in ordinary math. You should be able to walk backward from the utility function into preferences and arrive at von Neumann's axiom. Of course, von Neumann's axioms do not assume the Dutch book argument and so you are dangerously mixing and matching. From the Dutch book argument, you can arrive at Kolmogorov's axioms. It doesn't mean you should, other than as a mental exercise. Indeed, Savage subsumes Kolmogorov into his justification of personalistic probability. It does beg the somewhat interesting question as to whether the independence axiom is really an axiom and under what circumstances it is an axiom. 

There is no one word for this case because economics divides this up into multiple subproblems, one of which is the principal-agent problem, but that is not a unique answer to your question. This is part of the broader discussion of external costs. Health is a quasi-good. If it were a pure good, it would also be a public good. Public goods are neither rivalrous nor excludable. It isn't rivalrous because my being healthy doesn't use up the capacity for you to be healthy. Likewise, using only lawful and ethical means, you cannot exclude people from being healthy. You could obviously kill them, but excluding such breaches, you cannot. Insurance is a club. It is not rivalrous, but it is excludable. It is a form of voluntary sharing, whereas public goods only function under forced sharing. The problem requires a public solution as it is a public goods problem, but in the United States, we lack public health care so the patch Americans have used has been to create clubs. This "club" system has some positive advantages and worked up until the advent of major medical insurance. The advantage is that it increases the liquidity to provide health care when needed and as such increased the amount of health care providers and drugs. In doing so, the nation became healthier, but the cost went up. To supply more physicians, nurses, drugs, facilities and other personnel it is necessary to move up the supply curve. The true demand curve is not met because the system is inefficient. The disadvantage of major medical is that it passed all costs along to the insured to the advantage of both the provider and the insurance company. The prior system, capitation, passed all excess costs onto the patient so price increases were pretty tightly constrained. Under capitation, a physician could double their official price, but not receive any additional money because the patient couldn't pay it. Under major medical, the insurer paid all charges regardless of cost. This led to the rise of usual, customary and reasonable charging systems, physician networks and so forth. Those are damage control systems and cannot contain costs. Conversely, the insurance company has a strong profit incentive to not permit universal coverage, even if the premiums are affordable. Since insurers basically receive a percentage over total costs, their profits depend upon rising health care costs. A system of "I decide, but you pay," is their most profitable model. Major medical exists today and capitation does not because of this. As to the boyfriend-girlfriend problem, this is a different type of problem. The boy could be viewed as purchasing the possibility of sex and may also be viewed as purchasing a potential alliance. As the payer, it is in the boyfriend's self-interest for the girl to be happy with the purchase. The best choice would be to allow her to choose. This does a couple of things that improve efficiency. First, the boy could always veto some idea that was too unacceptable. Further, this strategy provides information about the girl. If the goal is sex, an unacceptable movie might not be painful enough to say no to, but if the goal is a permanent mating bond, it may be enough information for the boy to know that it is not worth the emotional costs of watching terrible movies. Second, the boy is purchasing a lottery. If the boy were risk averse, he would rather be paid than play, but sex throws risk aversion out the door and switches people to risk-loving behavior. Hence, the existence of unplanned pregnancies. How many people, just today, have said: "just this once without the condom?" Because the boy is now risk-loving, the boy is willing to pay a premium to able to take the risk. Likewise, a risk-averse girl who has become risk-loving due to the presence of hormones is willing to accept a premium for the risk that unfortunate consequences may ensue. If the premium is inadequate, then nothing will happen. However, if the premium is sufficient, it may result in no sex because the hormones have not overridden the risk aversion that is the normal state of affairs. If the guy doesn't create that "spark," the gifts won't matter. I am reasonably certain I am more handsome than the late Hugh Heffner, but for some reason, tons of 18-22-year-old models are not flocking all over me. There is the potential for inefficiencies in any gift-giving situation, but in the boyfriend-girlfriend case, it is probably very small in the usual case. You can find whole classes of similar problems in the literature, especially for public, common-pool and club goods. 

So let's decided that decision A is taking the certain sum and decision B is taking the risky sum, where $\bar{w}$ is current wealth and $\mathcal{U}$ is a utility function where $\mathcal{U}'>0$ and $\mathcal{U}''<0$, then you have two potential outcomes in utility. The first is $$\mathcal{U}(A)=\mathcal{U}(\bar{w}+2000)$$ and the second is $$\mathcal{U}(B)=\frac{\mathcal{U}(\bar{w}+10000)+3\mathcal{U}(\bar{w}+500)}{4}.$$ Given only this information, the decision depends upon $\bar{w}$, the shape of $\mathcal{U}$, the payoff outcomes, and the probabilities involved. If you wanted to determine how sensitive a decision would be to change, you could treat the currently fixed factors as variable factors one at a time. To provide an example, you could create a new variable $\pi$ so that option A would become $$\mathcal{U}(\bar{w}+\pi).$$ You could also do this to substitute for $\bar{w}$, the other payoffs, or the odds. If you added the assumption that the actors were indifferent, then you could also use the Envelope Theorem to look at local sensitivity. 

depend upon the existence of moments in the distributions at all. Unfortunately, I couldn't find specific literature to what you are talking about outside the finance literature and most of it is built on flawed assumptions. It would be interesting to see how people respond to skewed distributions like waiting time models that possess sufficiency. I couldn't find an example. 

is neither. There is nothing intrinsic to expectations that makes forecasting better unless a squared loss function makes sense under the circumstances. In that case, it isn't "useful," so much as background information. For some things such as stocks, it isn't possible to define a problem in terms of squared loss because the integrals diverge. It also isn't a way to explain forecast error. It may be the case that in a particular problem model errors naturally converge to quadratic loss. In that case, it doesn't explain the errors, it just describes them. If a quadratic loss function was inappropriate, as would be the case of stocks which naturally follow an all-or-nothing loss function, it would make understanding the errors more difficult. Expectations are misused in economics as it implies all problems are quadratic loss problems. All problems relevant to a particular research line may be, but that isn't mandatory and doesn't work for all distributions. Expectations are one way to remove the stochastic component when they are defined for the density involved. This allows differentiation because stochastic functions are not smooth even though they are continuous. The use of expectations was an attempt to create a smooth curve over a random process. If the first moment is defined, which it isn't for things like stocks, then you can construct a smooth path that is a function of time. For stocks, you have to define the parameters as a function of time and minimize over the all-or-nothing loss function over a neighborhood of $\theta_t\pm\epsilon_t$, where $\theta_t$ is a parameter and $\epsilon_t$ is small where the loss is 1 outside the neighborhood and 0 in the neighborhood. I am presenting this in a paper on generalized anticipation operators. 

There is empirical research that the price of gold is linked to the planetary level of combat. A large amount of wealth can be transferred into a small mass making it easy to transport. Because the planetary supply of gold is approximately fixed and very small, it reacts sharply to demand shocks. Gold functions as an alternative currency. It is a good medium for it because it has limited industrial value. In essence, because it is useless for most purposes, other than jewelry it is a good choice. Jewelry makes gold even more valuable and makes it easy for people to wear their wealth as is common in third world countries. Coins and bricks really are inconvenient particularly when fleeing. The secondary use is between nations to settle debts. It still happens, rarely, but it still happens. Although the gold standard is gone, gold is still something that can be exchanged. It doesn't require physical transport as long as you trust the central bank that is storing your gold. Gold seems to have supplanted other monies, such as salt or wheat because it is useless. Your question could equally be asked about Yap money, which is still in use or wampum. You can find more on stone money at $URL$ 

Before you read mine, you should read the above four papers first. It also wouldn't hurt to read E.T. Jaynes tome as well. It is, unfortunately, a polemical work, but it is rigorous nonetheless. His book is:
