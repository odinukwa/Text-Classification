As DonyorM discussed, the best choice for your question (because you asked about a human-made source) would be to spin the MMU. And what do you know - more math! The centripetal force on an astronaut must be the same as the surface gravity of the moon: $$F_c=\frac{mv_c^2}{r}=mg_{\text{Moon}}$$ Once again, the $m$s cancel out, and we re-arrange to get $$v_c=\sqrt{g_{\text{Moon}}r}$$ Here, $r=0.711 \text{ meters}$, so $$v_c=1.074850641 \text{ meters/second}$$ The angular velocity $\omega$ is $\frac{v_c}{r}$: $$\omega=\frac{v_c}{r}=1.511744924 \text{ radians/second}$$ Treating the entire apparatus as a block with the dimensions of the MMU (okay, I'll add half a meter to the height to account for the astronaut's legs sticking out, and the MMU has a mass of $148 \text{ kilograms}$, and the astronaut has a mass of, say $75 \text{ kilograms}$), we have the moment of inertia $I$ as $$I=\frac{1}{12}m(w^2+d^2)=\frac{1}{12}(75+148)(.846^2+.711^2)=22.69465425$$ Angular momentum $L$ is defined as $$L=I \omega=22.69465425 \times 1.511744924=34.30852836$$ We know that we have to obey the law of conservation of momentum: $$\frac{dL_{\text{system}}}{dt}=0$$ which becomes $$\frac{d(\frac{1}{12}m(w^2+d^2) \omega)}{dt}=0$$ Everything here but $m$ should, optimally, we a constant, because $m$ changes as fuel is released. So something else has to change, too. Let's go back to the definition of $\omega$: $\omega=\frac{v_c}{r}$. So now we have $$\frac{d(\frac{1}{12}m(w^2+d^2) \frac{v_c}{r})}{dt}=0$$ Divding out a whole bunch of constants, we have $$\frac{d(m \frac{v_c}{r})}{dt}=0$$ This means that $\frac{mv_c}{r}$ is a constant. We also know that $F$ is a constant. This means that $$\frac{d(\frac{mv_c^2}{r})}{dt}=0$$ So $\frac{mv_c^2}{r}$ is also a constant. Yet $m$ changes. Could $v_c$ change? No, because in the first case, $v_c$ is raised to the first power, while in the second case, it is raised to the second power. In both cases, it would have to match $dm$ . . . and if $dv \neq 0$, then this would be impossible in both cases. So $r$ must change, and so $$\frac{dm}{dt}=\frac{dr}{dt}$$ Whether or not this is possible for humans to engineer depends on how easily the radius is changed (impossible on the MMU!), and how quickly the mass changes (e.g. how much propellant is expelled in a given time. 

As I stated in a comment, there is no faster-than-light travel, which, fortunately, some answers picked up on. 

What we're concerned with here is the eruption column and subsequent plume arising from the volcanic eruption. This is a shield volcano, so it's not going to erupt a la Mount St. Helens; rather, it will slowly spew out material. Granted, for a volcano this large that's still going to be quite the eruption. First, let's figure out some basic properties and quantities: 

I’d also like to mention Bromley & Kenyon (2015), who attacked the problem analytically. If you’re into expanding potentials using Fourier series, be my guest and read it through. In this case, I, however, prefer to look at what overall trends from the simulations tell us. 

The consequences This is another matter entirely. I don't know how quickly a change like this can propagate through the population. I assume that the first generation of colonists won't be too worried with procreating in the beginning, just staying alive. However, once things are suitable and safe, they can consider raising children. The delay, though, is not insignificant. Another important factor is what's happening on Earth. If all of the "smart" people are leaving for Mars, will that somehow reduce the mean IQ on Earth? I'm not sure; you'd have to send an awful lot of high-intelligence people away for there to be major changes through the planet. If this is the case, you might see some resentment towards remaining intellectuals. There will be something of a class divide: Those who are allowed to go out and explore and those who are forced to stay on Earth. People will not be happy if it's implied that they are "too dumb" to go to Mars. I recall reading Brave New World. At one point, it is revealed that 

Summary Contrary to what I had originally hypothesized, cities were not a huge part of the population of Europe; they held perhaps only a few percent of the population. Most people were rural farmers, living in densities of roughly 80 people per acre. If you know what fraction of your country is either arable land or land that can be made arable by magical means, you can figure out what the rural population is. From there, you can either use the rule of them that 90% of people were peasants, or simply sprinkle in a half-dozen 80-100,000-person cities per continent, with maybe 20 or so at 5,000 or more. 

Okay, so I'm calling Douglas Adams out on that one, but then again, nobody ever said that the books are scientifically plausible. I, however, would like to know if it's possible for us humans to do something similar, i.e. "surfing" solar flares, with our current technology or realistic technology that could be developed in the near future, or about 50 years from now. Can we "surf" the Sun by using some sort of craft (perhaps modeled on a solar sail) to "ride" solar flares, coronal mass ejections, or something similar? If not, what are the major obstacles to doing so. 

I'm a bit bored, so I thought I might come up with a list of some of the bugs that might show up in the simulation. Taking some inspiration from the Wikipedia article on software bugs: 

The setup is weak. If a large country comes in and takes out one of the states, they could be annihilated. But here's where the coalition comes in: Have everyone send in forces. Organization can be implemented in this time of emergency, but, once again, have no one person in power. Or two. Or three. The regions could descend into isolation out of not being in close contact with each other. But is this a problem you need to solve? Just keep the coalition alive, and each region can be largely self-sufficient. Trade can keep any necessary ties strong. You shouldn't have too much trouble. One region could try to conquer another. Sure, they're on equal footing at first, but this could change. This is a risk you'll have to take. But I'm sure that the other regions will rise to the attacked regions defense. Because if the would-be-conqueror takes over other regions, it will quickly dominate, and all the others will fall.

You could go with a normal ice age, but you won't see glaciation over all of the planet, just portions extending out from the poles, perhaps into the southern temperate zones. That's why a Snowball Earth scenario is better. 

Therefore, the pole will be moved at a speed slower than the speed of light. For more reading, see questions on Physics Stack Exchange (1, 2, 3 and links therein) that talk about the same subject. See also the Ehrenfest paradox, another problem in special relativity about rigid bodies, albeit one with a different resolution. 

Get hold of a fairly massive celestial body. It could be a star, a rogue planet (as PipperChip mentioned), or something completely different. Put it in a position so that it is orbiting the galaxy at the same rate the solar system does - except much higher up or lower down perpendicular to the galactic plane. Propel the thing in a direction perpendicular to the galactic plane. Perhaps you could accelerate it using a black hole. (This happens to stars near the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. Unfortunately, the supermassive black hole isn't directly above or below the solar system, but we can make do with a smaller one.) Make sure the thing hits Earth - or passes by it on the side, perturbing it enough to chuck it out of the plane of the solar system. 

I'll narrow down your list by talking about all the stars you shouldn't use. You'll find it gives you a pretty narrow range. Let's start with the exciting ones: neutron stars. These are, technically, stellar remnants, leftovers of massive stars that blew themselves apart in supernovae. Supernovae are, in general, not a good thing for planets - or, in fact, anything that happens to be near the star. Given that planets would form early in a star's life (and hence pre-supernova), in many cases it's unlikely that a planet would survive. Just to mess with us, though (!), there are many cases in which planets somehow survived a supernova. Where the central neutron star is a pulsar, these planets are known as pulsar planets. So, actually, it is possible for planets to exist around neutron stars. If the neutron star is a pulsar, the planet may be bathed in enough radiation that life could not exist, but perhaps life would have a chance if the neutron star is not a pulsar. Next up: A White dwarf. White dwarfs (or dwarves, depending on your personal preference) are also stellar remnants. They are the remains of stars like our Sun, who have cast off their outer layers as a planetary nebula and are now merely the small remnants of their former cores. Planets can exist around white dwarfs - in fact, it is thought that Mars and all the planets beyond it will continue orbiting the Sun for a period of time after it becomes a white dwarf (Earth, Venus and Mercury will likely be swallowed up). Life on Europa could be given a chance when the star expands into its red giant phase, before it becomes a white dwarf. As a white dwarf, there won't be a lot of light to help shine on Europa - in, fact the Sun will cool into a black dwarf - but Europa could temporarily harbor life. Now I'll go to supergiants. These are the biggest of them all, the class O and B stars. They live short but exciting lives, often only ten million years or so (to put that in perspective, our Sun has been on the main sequence for about 4.5 billion years, and will live for a few billion more). They are extremely massive and very hot. Planets may or may not form here - it can be hard to detect them. At any rate, complex life will certainly not form on planets around supergiants, because of their short lifespan. Ten million years go by, and fft! You get a supernova. Next on the table are stars more like the Sun - think G, F, or K stars (A stars are more massive, and giant-like throughout their lives). These are the stars that get people excited, because many are solar analogs - stars like our Sun. They have great potential for harboring life, and many think a star like this should be our first target for an interstellar voyage. Another cool (pun intended) type of star are red dwarfs. These are low-mass stars. They are cool, small, and long-lived, with potential lifespans of trillions of years. They could have exoplanets - in fact, many that we have discovered do - and could thus support life, if the exoplanet is within the star's habitable zone. Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to our solar system, is a red dwarf. So out of all the basic types of stars, I'd go with a Sun-like star or a red dwarf. They have the best chances to harbor life, when compared to other types of stars. As @celtschk pointed out in a comment above, you can change the orbital period of the planet to whatever you like by simply changing how far it is from the star. This is the simplest answer you'll get to that question. To make it more complicated, though, I'll note that if you want life to develop on that planet, you do have some constraints. The planet's orbit must be within the star's habitable zone. For red dwarfs, that means the planet must be reasonably close, and so a year equivalent to 365 Earth days may not be possible in all cases. I'll clear up the brown dwarf angle here, because there's an important distinction to be made between brown dwarfs and other stars. Brown dwarfs are "failed stars" - they aren't massive enough to sustain hydrogen-1 fusion. They are technically designated as "sub-stellar objects", and have been confused with large planets. Their masses can range anywhere from 13 Jupiter masses to 70-80 Jupiter masses. Because they don't undergo hydrogen-1 fusion, they don't emit a lot of light, and so would be poor choices to harbor life, unless a brown dwarf was orbiting another star.
