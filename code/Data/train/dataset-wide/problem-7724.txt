and 2.: I am not aware of any ideas in this direction. The most obvious comment is the fact that there are Bernoulli numbers, and that their numerators must have prime factors. If these prime factors are large enough, they will produce irregular primes. For proving the existence of regular primes you have to show that there exist primes $p$ not dividing the numerators of the Bernoulli numbers $B_n$ with $n < p$. Heuristically there must be many of them, but the numerators grow so fast that you cannot exclude the possibility that all primes larger than some bound are irregular. 

I guess you are looking for the appendix by Olga Taussky in Harvey Cohn's "A Classical Invitation to Algebraic Numbers and Class Fields". This being said, there is a reason why algebraic number theory is called "algebraic". 

The connection between values of the zeta function at positive integers and higher K-theory (see Timothy's answer) is beautifully explained by Manfred Kolster here. 

I have mentioned this link before. You can find links to almost everything that is freely and legally available on the web as far as mathematical publications are concerned. 

For a good introduction to the different approaches of Kronecker and Dedekind you should read the relevant sections in Weyl's "Algebraic theory of numbers", Princeton UP 1940. He strongly favors Kronecker's approach, at least if the goal is saving unique factorization. In fact, Kronecker's methods do what they're supposed to do in the polynomial ring $R = {\mathbb Z}[X]$ (in particular, they show that $R$ is a UFD), whereas Dedekind's ideal theory fails miserably in this respect since $R$ is a UFD yet its ideal theory is complicated as $R$ is not even a Dedekind domain. Taking up a comment made by Victor Protsak, the divisor theory developed by Borevich and Shafarevich (which I also neglected until very recently) isn't that foreign at all: their "rings with a divisor theory" coincide, unless I am mistaken, with the modern notion of Krull domains. I do not (yet) know any serious and readable account in English (B & S have superfluous axioms; see Gundlach's book below). For those comfortable in German I suggest 

He also explicitly stated the analogy between function fields and number fields in the titles (and the body) of the following two papers 

The cuneiform tablet MS 2351 from the 19th century BC contains the 15-digit sexagesimal number 13 22 50 54 59 09 29 58 26 43 17 31 51 06 40, which happens to equal $20^{20}$. I also seem to remember they constructed a table of reciprocals for numbers of the form $125 \cdot 2^n$ for exponents up to $19$. Edit. Last year some fragments of a large table have been identified: Ossendrijver discovered that the complete table contained the powers of 9 up to $9^{46}$. 

I would like to know about references for the following result (point 3): Let $K/k$ be a normal extension (I am interested in number fields, but everything should work in fields of characteristic $\ne 2$) with Galois group $G$, and let $L = K(\sqrt{\mu}\,)$ be a quadratic extension. 

P.S. Takagi's thesis is contained in his collected papers. I also would like to refer you to a beautiful article by Cox and Hyde on The Galois theory of the lemniscate. 

This story is apocryphal. In my review of Dauben's article The battle for Cantorian set theory, I wrote that Dauben repeats the well known claim that Kronecker, in a lecture at the Berliner Naturforscher-Versammlung in 1886, called Lindemann's proof of the transcendence of $\pi$ worthless since irrational numbers do not exist. The earliest references he offers for supporting this claim are Weber's article in [Math. Ann. 43, 1--25 (1893; JFM 25.0033.03)] and Kneser's [Jahresber. DMV 33, 210--228 (1925; JFM 51.0025.03)]; both articles, however, only give Kronecker's equally famous statement that God made natural numbers; all else is man's work. For a more historical evaluation of Kronecker's ``rejection'' of irrational numbers, see H. M.~Edwards [Essays in constructive mathematics (2005; Zbl 1090.11001)], as well as J.~Boniface and N.~Schappacher [Rev. Hist. Math. 7, 207--275 (2001; Zbl 1014.01003)]. Let me also remark that in his lectures on number theory published by Hensel (1901; JFM 32.0184.06), Kronecker gives the Leibniz series for $\pi/4$ and writes that this definition of the transcendental number $\pi$ is actually of a number theoretic character. 

This doesn't fly. If the powers that be would like to delete the question, please go ahead. For my defense I'd like to add that I wanted to see whether my guess that most people would use the name Gauss in their answer holds water or not. So here's what I think I know. Polynomials became mathematical objects through the work of the Italians (Cardano etc.); after preliminary work done by Pedro Nunez, Simon Stevin showed that there is a Euclidean algorithm in polynomial rings that allows one to compute greatest common divisors. Strictly speaking it is difficult to separate unique factorization in ${\mathbb R}[X]$ or ${\mathbb C}[X]$ from the fundamental theorem of algebra, but certainly those who were working on the latter (d'Alembert, Euler) did not mention unique factorization anywhere. The concept of unique factorization is due to Gauss (1801), although partial credit should be given to Euclid. Gauss proved that the rings $\mathbb Z$ and ${\mathbb Z}[i]$ are factorial, and did the same for ${\mathbb F}_p[X]$ in his famous Section VIII of the Disquisitiones, which was published posthumously. Dirichlet realized in the 1840s that Euclidean domains are factorial and stated this as explicit as he could. But noone seemed to put 1 and 1 together to derive (1); my guess is that its essential content was known to people like Dirichlet, Eisenstein, Dedekind and Kronecker, but the result does not appear anywhere except much later when Weber wrote his textbook on algebra. Let me also add that Dirichlet could state that Euclidean rings are factorial even though the concept of an abstract ring came much later (he said something to the effect that if there is a Euclidean division algorithm, then you must have unique factorization no matter which "domain" you are working in). Kronecker, in his lectures and, somewhat later, also in his publications, proved that the polynomial rings with finitely many variables and coefficients from $\mathbb Z$ have unique factorization. The first explicit statement (and proof) of (2) that I know is in Hensel's article Ãœber eindeutige Zerlegung in Primelemente, J. Reine Angew. Math. 158 (1927), 195--198. Again I guess that this wasn't exactly news for Emmy Noether or Artin, and the result is mentioned in just about every textbook on algebra, starting with van der Waerden's algebra published in 1930, which was based on lectures by Noether and Artin during the 1920s. Corrections are welcome. 

Who first proved that $k[x]$ is factorial if $k$ is a field? Who first proved that $R[X]$ is factorial if $R$ is? 

The following is not a full answer, but perhaps gives you an idea of how to approach the result. Let us consider the claim $$ p^{hR} \ge \Big(\frac{D}4\Big) $$ for the smallest noninert prime. I first show that the inequality holds whenever $p \ge 11$. In fact, we have $h \ge 1$ and $R \ge \frac12 \log D + O(1)$: the latter claim is clear since the fundamental unit $(t+u\sqrt{D})/2$ satisfies $u \ge 1$ and $t \approx u \sqrt{D}$. Since $\log p > 2$, the claimed inequality follows. Thus we only have to look at small primes. If $R$ is large enough, the claim holds. If $R$ is as small as possible, the following happens. If $u = 1$, the discriminant must have a very special form. One possibility is $D = 4n^2 +1$. Here the fundamental unit is $\varepsilon = 2n+\sqrt{D}$ (unless $n = 1$), so $R \approx \frac12 \log D$. On the other hand, "Davenport's Lemma" shows that the minimal nontrivial norm is $n = N((2n+1+\sqrt{D})/2)$; see 

This is simple class field theory plus Galois theory. Consider a quadratic number field $K$ with class number divisible by $3$. For constructing an unramified cyclic cubic extension $L/K$, adjoin the cube root of unity, and denote the resulting field by $K'$. The Kummer generator of the Kummer extension $L' = K'(\sqrt[3]{\mu})$ must be an ideal cube for the extension to be unramified: $(\mu) = {\mathfrak m}^3$. Since $L'/K$ is abelian, Galois theory shows that the ideal class of ${\mathfrak m}$ must come from the quadratic subfield $F$ different from $K$ and ${\mathbb Q}' = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-3})$. Thus the unramified cubic extensions of $K$ correspond roughly to the $3$-class group of $F$; any differences come from the fact that $\mu$ might be a unit. The reflection theorem was found independently by Reichardt and then generalized by Leopoldt. For a dvi file of Scholz's article, see here. Edit.Here's an English translation. 

Gassmann constructed number fields with the same normal closure in which almost all primes split in the same way. Later, the question morphed into "do zeta functions determine the number field", for example in 

Euler "proved" that $\sum \mu(n)/n = 0$ by observing that $\sum \mu(n) n^{-s} = 1/\zeta(s)$ and setting $s = 1$. Actually, the result $\sum \mu(n)/n = 0$ was later proved by von Mangoldt, and shown to be equivalent to the prime number theorem by Landau. 

The following result is a special case of a sideresult in my PhD thesis (1995): Let $k = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{d})$ be a quadratic extension with discriminant $d$, let $d = d_1d_2d_3d_4$ be a factorization of $d$ into coprime discriminants, and assume that $$(d_1/p_2) = (d_2/p_1) = (d_3/p_4) = (d_4/p_3) = +1 $$ for all primes $p_j \mid d_j$. Then there exist $\alpha = x_1 + y_1 \sqrt{d_1} \in {\mathbb Z}[\sqrt{d_1}]$ and $\beta = x_3 + y_3 \sqrt{d_3} \in {\mathbb Z}[\sqrt{d_3}]$ satisfying $x_1^2 - d_1y_1^2 = z_1^2d_2$ and $x_3^2 - d_3y_3^2 = z_3^2d_4$ such that $M = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{d_1},\sqrt{d_2},\sqrt{d_3},\sqrt{d_4}, \sqrt{\alpha},\sqrt{\beta})$ is an unramified extension of $k$ with Galois group $D_4 \times D_4$. The subfield $$ L = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{d_1d_2},\sqrt{d_1d_3},\sqrt{d_1d_4}, \sqrt{\mu})$$ with $\mu = 2x_1x_3 + 2y_1y_3\sqrt{d_1d_2} + 2z_1z_2\sqrt{d_2d_4}$ has Galois group $D_4$ over $k$, but is not normal over ${\mathbb Q}$. I have given the concrete example $d = -3 \cdot 13 \cdot 5 \cdot 29$ with $\alpha = (-1 + \sqrt{13}\,)/2$, $\beta = 7 + 2 \sqrt{5}$ and $\mu = -7 + 2\sqrt{65} + 2 \sqrt{-87}$. I just verified with pari that it is indeed unramified: f=polcompositum(x^2+3*13,x^2+3*5)[1]; f=polcompositum(f,x^2+3*29)[1]; g=x^8 + 28*x^6 + 470*x^4 + 3836*x^2 + 380689; The compositum $L$ of $f$ and $g$ has degree $16$ and discriminant $3^8 5^8 13^8 29^8$, hence is unramified over $k$. For odd degree extensions I would try a nontrivial 3-class field tower of a quadratic number field and pick out a suitable subgroup that isn't fixed under the automorphism of order 2. I'm sure some group theorist will be able to come up with an example. 

There, Netto proved the following: A polynomial $$ f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1} p x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{k+1} p z^{k+1} + a_k p^2 z^k + \ldots + a_0 p^2 $$ with degree $n > 2k$, in which the $a_j$ are integers such that $p \nmid a_0$, does not have a factor of degree less than $k+1$. This is similar to Gjergji's second example, but allows the divisibility by $p^2$ that I had had in mind. 

A Pell conic is an affine curve of the form $C_N: Q_0(X,Y) = 1$, where $Q_0$ is the principal binary form with discriminant $N$ (if $N = 4m$ with $m \equiv 3 \bmod 4$, then $Q(X,Y) = X^2 - mY^2$). For each prime $p$ not dividing $N$, the curve has a smooth reduction modulo $p$, and the number of points is $p - a_p$ for $a_p = (N/p)$ (the Kronecker symbol). We call $C_N$ modular if there exists a modulus $m$ such that $a_p$ only depends on the residue class of $p$ modulo $m$. It can be shown that $m = N$ always works, and that $(N/p) = \chi(p)$ for a primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ with conductor $N$. We attach a "Pell form" $$ f_N(q) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n q^n $$ to $C_N$. If the Pell conic is modular, then $f_N$ is a rational function of $q$ (the numerators are basically what are known as Fekete polynomials, and a partial fraction decomposition naturally will lead you to Gauss sums) and can be extended to a meromorphic function on the whole complex plane with poles at the primitive $N$-th roots of unity and satisfying a functional equation $$f_N\Big( \frac1q \Big) = - \chi(-1) f_N(q). $$ Observe that if $\chi(-1) = 1$, then $f_N(1) = 0$. This is closely related to the global solvability of the Pell equation in integers. If $\chi(-1) = -1$, on the other hand, then $f_N(1) = 2h/w$, where $h$ is the class number and $w$ the number of roots of unity in the complex quadratic number field with discriminant $-N$. For a prime $p \nmid N$, define the Hecke operator $T_p$ by $$ f|_{T_p}(z) = \frac1p \sum_{a=0}^{p-1} f\Big(\frac{z+a}p \Big). $$ Then the Pell forms $f_N$ are simultaneous eigenforms of the $T_p$ with eigenvalues $a_p$. There are other eigenfunctions of $T_p$: the cotangent function, the Bernoulli polynomials, Hurwitz's zeta function etc. This is closely related to what Kubert and Lang have called distributions (cf. etc. Washington's cyclotomic fields). The modular analog of Pell conics are the cyclotomic units. You can parametrize Pell conics analytically by trigonometric functions and "arithmetically" by taking norms from cyclotomic units. 

show the existence of sufficiently many cyclic extensions defined by division values of sn $u$ (the lemniscatic sine); prove that each abelian extension of ${\mathbb Q}(i)$ is contained in the compositum of these fields. 

One of the most early observations on the analogy between function fields and number fields is the little known work by 

Archimedes gave exact proofs as well as mechanically motivated explanations for results like the quadrature of the parabola or the volume of spheres. 

There's a very nice article by Shanks (A survey of quadratic, cubic and quartic algebraic number fields (from a computational point of view), Proc. 7th southeast. Conf. Comb., Graph Theory, Comput.; Baton Rouge 1976, 15-40 (1976)) where you will find more. Scholz, during the 1930s, showed how to construct (using class field theory, which means you will not get generators, just the existence) of Galois groups with small solvable groups; in his construction, the number of ramified primes can be controlled. 

This explains the naive idea behind the definition: since the Frobenius is not well defined, take the mean over all possible values. Finally, Noah Snyder has written a very nice thesis on Artin L-functions, which contains a translation of Artin's 1923 article on L-series. 

But even if this were known, there would not be a terminating algorithm for deciding the finiteness of the $p$-class field tower. There are nontrivial cases in which the $2$-tower was shown to be finite; for some recent calculations see e.g.
