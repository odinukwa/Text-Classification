The authors of the book mentioned that problem $84$ is an old classical open problem. So I suspect that there should be some papers available on solving the problem partially or fully. 

We say that $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is of Baire Class $1$ if it is a pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions. One can generalize the definition above by taking pointwise limit of each 'previous' level(s) to obtain 'next' level. More precisely, 

So it seems that we can also have a similar definition of the above function in terms of $\varepsilon.$ However, I couldn't obtain it. 

$2018$ Abel prize is awarded to Robert P. Langlands for his visionary program connecting representation theory to number theory. In particular, his program predicts the existence of a tight web of connections between automorphic forms and Galois group. 

Using this "bump function", one can do all sorts of "gluing" tricks: for example, if $f\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is any smooth map and $\epsilon>0$ is such that $|f(x)|<\epsilon$ for all $|x|\leq\delta$, then we can build a smooth map $F\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that 

if $E\in \mathcal{N}$ and $F\in \Omega$, $F\subset E$, then $F\in \mathcal{N}$; if $E_n \in \mathcal{N}$ is a countable collection, then $\bigcup_{n} E_n \in \mathcal{N}$ as well. 

In case the book referred to in Doug Lind's comment didn't have what you're looking for, a proof of this statement can be found in Section 2 of this paper: Doris Fiebig and Ulf-Rainer Fiebig, Invariants for subshifts via nested sequences of shifts of finite type, Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems 21 (2001), pp 1731-1758. There are also some other references there, including an article by Krieger with the proof, and another paper by Fiebig and Fiebig with lots more information on coded systems. 

The motivation of your interest in finding the proof of the general first incompleteness theorem which does not 'naturally' (whatever you mean by that) imply the non-existence of finitely axiomatizable extensions of PA is unclear to me. For I would not overestimate the significance of the later (as long as you do not restrict yourself to the language of PA only, which seems unnecessarily restrictive to me). For if just one new unary predicate symbol is added to the language of PA, then the finitely axiomatized conservative extension of PA can already be constructed. This follows from the general result of Craig and Vaught extended from the one of Kleene. You can find the details and references here. 

For the Kronecker's views, Brouwer's intuitionism and much more real motivations for Hilbert's program than the usual tales about paradoxes as main reasons of crisis (they are only a pretext and the reasons go back to 19th century reincarnation of mathematics) see for example Jeremy Avigad and Erich Reck "Clarifying the nature of the infinite: the development of metamathematics and proof theory". You may also look at many other important historical works referenced there. 

Let $f\colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be a $C^2$ uniformly expanding diffeomorphism that fixes the origin: that is, $f(0)=0$ and there is $\lambda>1$ such that $d(f(x),f(y)) \geq \lambda d(x,y)$ for all $x,y\in \mathbb{R}^2$. [The original question just asked for a locally expanding map; I've clarified that it should be a globally expanding diffeomorphism.] Let $X=\{(t,0) : t\in \mathbb{R}\}$ be the $x$-axis in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Is it possible that the images $f^n(X)$ become arbitrarily dense in the unit ball? Or do they satisfy some sort of "uniformly nowhere dense" condition? More precisely, my first instinct is to expect that the following result is true: for every $f$ as above, there is $\delta>0$ such that for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$, there is some $y\in B(0,1)$ such that $B(y,\delta) \cap f^n(X) = \emptyset$. After some effort I've been unable to prove this statement. On the other hand, playing around with candidate counterexamples hasn't gotten me anywhere either: the closest I've come is to consider the maps \begin{align*} g(x,y) &= (x, y + A \sin(Rx)), \\ h(x,y) &= (x + A\sin(Ry), y) \end{align*} for some choice of the parameters $A$ and $R$, then choose $c>0$ large enough that $f(x,y) = ch(g(x,y))$ is uniformly expanding. Taking $A=.06$ and $R=100$ gave some interesting pictures, but numerically it seems that I can only make the images $f^n(X)$ continue to get denser in the unit ball if I take $c$ small enough that $f$ is not expanding everywhere. Which leads me to the question: does every expanding map $f$ as in the first paragraph admit a $\delta$ satisfying the condition in the second paragraph? Or is there a clever counterexample hiding out there somewhere? Edit: As suggested in the comments, another natural class of maps to consider take the form $f(z) = c e^{ig(|z|)} z$ for $z\in \mathbb{C}$, where $g\colon [0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ must be a $C^2$ function with $g'(0)=0$ to make $f$ be $C^2$. Then $f^n(X)$ spirals around the origin, but we can control the total amount of spiraling by a bounded distortion result: Writing $X^+$ for the positive $x$-axis, then given $r>0$, the point on $f^n(X^+)$ with modulus $r$ has argument given by $h(r) := \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} g(c^{-k} r)$, and we have $$ |h(r) - h(t)| \leq \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |g(c^{-k}r) - g(c^{-k}t)| \leq \sum_{k=0}^\infty |g|_{\mathrm{Lip}} c^{-k} |r-t| = C|r-t|, $$ which means that $f^n(X^+)$ is the graph in polar coordinates of a function $\theta(r)$ that is $C$-Lipschitz. Then it is not hard to show that there is $\delta>0$ satisfying the condition above. 

I don't understand what people usually mean when they say "aspects of some mathematical field related to computer science" (how they know what is really related to CS?), but if you really want to study or teach first order logic, then, in my opinion, there is old but still the best book for that -- Joseph Shoenfield's Mathematical logic. 

[Edition. In this answer I wrote about "philosophical logic" and "mathematical logic" in usual sense of these terms. But I also think that the difference between them is very conventional. For example, people studying knowledge formally by means of modal epistemic logics (as formal models) and those who studying provability logics to a large extent (if one forgets about actual motivations) are doing the same things -- they are investigating various modal logics.] "My question is about relations between logic as part of philosophy and mathematical logic from the second half of the 20th century when its seems that connections between these two areas have weakened." "I am quite curious also about the reasons for the much weaker connections between mathematical logic and formal models developed by philosophers at the later part of the 20th century." The main reason is that mathematical logic concerns with models of mathematical thought, but philosophical logic builds models for various parts of philosophy which are very different from mathematics (i. e. they may use modalities, analogy, induction and so on). To give one example of "formal models developed in philosophy that had become important in mathematical logic", Provability logic is such an example. To quote from Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy: "Provability logic is a modal logic that is used to investigate what arithmetical theories can express in a restricted language about their provability predicates." So, provability logics are modal logics which capture provability in formal systems of mathematical logic. Provability logic is regarded as an area of mathematical logic (which represented by Robert M. Solovay, George Boolos, Sergei Artemov, Lev Beklemishev, Giorgi Japaridze, Dick de Jongh and so on) and it uses models, ideas and techniques from modal logic which is (in any case, was) part of philosophical logic. "Another thing I am curious about is to what extent for the applications to computer science formal models described by philosophers turned out to be useful." Again, the original papers by Kripke was by no means concerned with computer science. Kripke discovered another way of interpreting the modalities and the context was philosophical one. But today the whole field of program verification in CS is based on modal logic. A lot of specific modal logics are developed in CS which model specific aspects (temporal logics, dynamic logics and so on). Crucial results about them such as expresiveness, decidability and completeness are proved using essentialy the same ideas as those from original papers in philosophical context. Finally, to speak "about works in philosophical logic that were motivated or influenced by developments in mathematical logic", I quote from what I said in the meta thread: "A new interesting field in philosophy is growing in this century often called Formal Philosophy (this term I believe has its origin from the title of Richard Montague's collected papers book). People of this field (among them R. Montague, H. Putnam, E. Zalta, D. Bonnay...) are trying to solve philosophical problems using formal logic. Particularly, and this is important, many of them try to formalize such kinds of reasoning as modality, induction, analogy, simplicity, naturality, generalization and so on as well as concrete philosophical theories (which are of course in the domain of philosophical logic) using formalisms and methods of mathematical logic. 

What properties of $\alpha_0,\alpha_1$ determine whether we get $\mu(E)=0$ or $\mu(E)=1$? If $\alpha_0=\alpha_1$ is irrational then we have $\mu(E)=1$ as above. On the other hand, if both are rational then $\mu(E)=0$ since $x_n$ takes only finitely many values. If $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ are linearly dependent over the rationals (but not rational themselves) then I believe we have $\mu(E)=1$, but probably this takes some argument. I don't know what happens if they are linearly independent over the rationals. Do any of the above answers change if we consider instead of $E$ the set $F$ of $\omega$ with the property that the limit points of the sequence $m_n$ do not depend on the initial point $x_1$? This would allow more general limiting measures. Or we could impose other conditions on the limit points of the sequence $m_n$ and ask the same question. What happens if we replace $\mu$ with a different $\sigma$-invariant measure on $\Omega$? Do we get a different answer for Bernoulli measures? Markov measures? Gibbs measures? General shift-invariant measures? 

Let $X$ be a metric space. In Borel hierarchy, $\Sigma_{1}^0$ is the set of all open sets in $X$ while $\Pi_{1}^0$ is the set of all closed sets in $X.$ Then at next level, one has $\Sigma_{2}^0 = \{ \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n : A_n \in \Pi_1^0 \}$, that is, elements of $\Sigma_2^0$ are $F_{\sigma}$ sets. In $\Sigma_1^0$, its elements can be described in the following manner: $O \in \Sigma_1^0 \Longleftrightarrow$ $\forall x \in O, \exists \varepsilon>0$ such that $V_{\varepsilon}(x) \subseteq O,$ where $V_{\varepsilon}(x)$ denotes the $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $x$. This definition is very useful as it allows us to visualize open set. 

What is the status of these questions? Any progress on each of them? If yes, any reference is appreciated. .......................................................................................................................................................... Definitions: Let $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^p$ be an open subset and $E$ be a Banach space. Denote $C^n(\Omega,E)$ the space of $E$-valued functions $f$ on $\Omega$ that are of class $C^n.$ $T:C^n(\Omega,E)\to C^m(\Omega',F)$ is called biseparating map if $T$ is bijective and $$\|Tf\| \|Tg\|=0 \text{ if and only if }\|f\|\|\|g\|=0$$ 

Since you mention the related question of grouping together geodesics of lengths in the interval $[L,L+1]$, let me point out that this case is covered by the 1972 result of Bowen that I mentioned in the comments: [R. Bowen, "Periodic orbits for hyperbolic flows", Amer. J. Math 94 (1972), 1-30]. Bowen proved that if $M$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and $\psi_t$ is an Axiom A flow, then on each basic set, the periodic orbits (of length $\leq T$) are equidistributed with respect to the unique measure of maximal entropy on that basic set. In particular, this holds for any transitive Anosov flow (in which case the basic set is the whole manifold), which includes geodesic flow in negative curvature. In fact, (5.5) from that paper shows that if the flow is "C-dense" (basically this just guarantees that it's not a constant time suspension, and in particular C-density holds for geodesic flow in negative curvature), then for any $\epsilon>0$, if one considers the measures $\omega_{\epsilon,t}$ obtained by averaging closed geodesics with length in $[t-\epsilon,t+\epsilon]$, then one has $\omega_{\epsilon,t}\to \mu$, the unique MME, as $t\to\infty$. 

Hi! Let G(N) be the number of graphs with vertices {1, 2, ..., N} and GN(F) be the number of those of them which satisfy graph property F. There is a beautiful result by Glebskii and Fagin that limit of GN(F)/G(N) can be only 0 or 1 for any first order graph property F. The proof essentialy uses compactness and Vaught's test. So, any first order property is either infinitely likely or infinitely unlikely for large graphs. Moreover, there is an algorithm which, given any first order graph property F as input, decides which of this possibilities holds for F (infinitely likely properties can be axiomatized by complete recursive first order theory). Questions. What about second order properties? More specificaly, what possibilities can be for probability of second order graph properties? Can we construct for any x from [0, 1] SO property with limit probability exactly x? What is the limit probability for connectedness of graph? Thanks for any answers and comments.
