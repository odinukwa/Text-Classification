I was reading this blog post by Noah Smith where he argues that the interest rate implied by the Euler equation fails to match the data. His post is mainly based on this paper by (Canzoneri et al, 2006). Noah brings up an interesting point: The functional form assumed by Canzoneri et al might be 'wrong'. However, they also try different functional forms and the results are quite robust. I haven't read the entire Canzoneri paper but I would also question what specific interest rate they consider. As far as I can tell they consider the Federal Funds Rate. If we assume that this is the interest rate faced by households, then I would be more convinced. Anyhow, seeing as there appears to be a negative correlation between the interest rate implied by the Euler equation and the observed interest rate, what have macroeconomists done to account for this? From my own reading it seems to me that Euler equations are still widely used in modern macro but it seems quite worrying that such a fundamental aspect of modern literature fails to match the data. 

The only relevant model I'm aware of is Liu Qingmin(2011 R.E.S). Is there any other decent models dealing with the mechanism of online markets under reputation system, and perhaps linking to regulation? 

I'm interested to know the exact magnitude of impact of Subprime Mortgages crisis on major players in investment banking. In particular, how can I find data for percentage of revenue from Subprime Mortgages in total revenue for major banks, like Goldman Sachs, Morgen Stanley, The Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers? 

To understand the emergence of constitution, Myerson(2008) models a scernario that a political leader gathers supports from captains in order to defeat challengers whose arrival is modelled by a Poisson process. I found using Poisson process seems to be simple and reasonable, but it is the only model I know that utilizes Poisson process.Are there any other well-known models utilizing Poisson process in a similar way? If not, what's drawback of Poisson process? 

I think I have managed to solve it. However, not the way I was initially hoping. I simplified the stacked matrices using the given conditions and some assumptions. Here is my solution: Eq. (3) I write as $\pi_{t+1} = \alpha \beta \pi_{t} + \beta \theta_{t} + \eta_{t+1}$ Forwarding equation (4) one period and arranging it in terms on $b_{t+1} = -\varphi_{1} {\pi_{t+1}} - \varphi_{2}{\pi_{t}} + (\beta^{-1}- \gamma)\widetilde{b_{t}} - \varphi_{3} \theta_{t+1} \ - \psi_{t+1} - \varphi_{4} \theta_{t} = 0$ $\pi_{t+1}$ simplified by eq. (3) $\theta_{t+1} = \rho_{1} \theta_{t} + \epsilon_{1,t+1}$ $\psi_{t+1}$ can be written as its AR(1) formulation as well. Putting the four equations in matrix form results in: 

I'm interested to know economic justifications of forgetting in various fields. On example is Green and Porter(1984). To sustain a Cartel, Cartel members have incentive to forget deviations in a sufficiently distant past. Another is Ekmekciy(2011) which shows that a rating system works better if it stops publicize misconducts, once they're old enough. Literature on a more abstract level is also welcomed, e.g. results like it's more socially desirable in a dynamic games, some agents are restricted to stationary strategies. 

I assume that $r(t)$ is continuous. The idea is that, this Poisson process with time-varying parameter $r(t)$, as the limit of Bernoulli trial with time-varying probability of success, is memoryless: For a generic finite partition $\mathscr{P}$ of $[0, T]$ as $\{[0,t_1),[t_1,t_2),[t_2,t_3) \ldots,[t_{n-1},T]\}$, let the $n$th cell following a Poisson distribution with a fixed parameter $r(t_n)$, so $$P_{\mathscr{P}} = 1 - \underbrace{e^{\sum_{k=1}^n-r(t_k)(t_k-t_{k-1})}}_{\text{Probability of no accidents}}$$. So $P = 1 - e^{-\int_0^Tr(t)dt}$. Notice that the Riemann integral $\int_0^Tr(t)dt$ is the limit of a net indexed by the set of all finite partitions of $[0,T]$ with vanishing maximal length of cell with respect to number of cells. $f(x)=1-e^{-x}$ is continuous, so this limit preserves. 

The interest component is already included. It was just their way of writing out the budget constraint that confused me. If anyone is interested: $\frac{B_{t-1}}{p_{t}} - \frac{B_{t}}{(1+i_{t})p_{t}} = \frac{i_{t}}{(1+i_{t})}\frac{B_{t}}{p_{t}} - \frac{B_{t}}{p_{t}} + \frac{B_{t-1}}{p_{t}}$. This is simply the interest on existing debt and the face value of existing debt (on the expenditure side). And real bond issuance on the income side. Simple rearranging and you have it. 

Which is what I was after. However, this made me wonder what was wrong with the method I was trying above. Looking at the top corner of the coefficient matrix (i.e the 4x4 matrix in the top left corner) it is clearly $\Gamma_{0}^{-1} \Gamma_{1}$. But the rest of the matrix I am unsure of. And question (2) remains, once I have solved for the variables of interest, will I be ready to make IRF's? 

What does Pierpaolo Battigalli really mean? If the actions for a player chooses has been specified, then it automatically specify a pure strategy. By this methodology, he seems to want to distinguish a game structure with commitment and a game without, but how? Added: Here is the slides used in the video, and here is the corresponding paper. 

I would like strongly recommend David Kreps' latest textbook, Microeconomic Foundations I: Choice and Competitive Markets . It contains true virtuosity and is very inspiring. Take utility representation theorem as an example. Kreps forsake the assumption in MWG of taking $\mathbb R^n$ as the underlying space so that readers won't be left with the false impression that this theorem is of limited interest. I also $\heartsuit$ the presentation of GE as a generalized NE which helps developing connections between different areas. 

I am reading Sala (2004) and I think I have found a mistake in the paper. On page 7 the author argues that one can differentiate between Ricardian and Non-Ricardian policy regimes by considering correlations between primary surpluses and their effect on real debt. See this picture. Where $s_t$ is current primary surplus, $\alpha_t$ is the discount factor and $b_t$ is the real debt. He says: 

I have been doing some reading on general equilibrium theory and it has made me highly confused regarding the logic behind NK models. If I have understood correctly, NK models are based on Walrasian or Arrow-Debreu auctions where there is no role for money, banking or credit (since there is perfect barter in this world). However, in the NK framework the most commonly used methods for introducing money in to the model, is money-in-utility and cash in advance, but this seems very counter intuitive. In a world with perfect barter, clearly money provides no utility because it cannot be consumed. And since CIA imposes an additional restriction on consumers that was not present in the Arrow-Debreu world, are we not imposing a welfare reducing constraint? I understand that in the real world money has many beneficial functions (store of value, removing double coincidence of wants etc etc). But in the Arrow-Debreu/Walrasian world it has no function. And since modern macro models are built around this, including money does not seem logical. How can we use models to study the price level/inflation when the underlying theory has no logically consistent way of including money? I mean, I have nothing against the fact that money can provide direct utility or that CIA is a real life constraint. My question is on the theory side rather than the empirical side. 

I think this is a poor oversimplication of Robert Lucas's maxim. It's one thing that Robert Lucas models markets as if "always in equilibrium", it's quite another Robert Lucas claims it's an empirical truth that "market is always in equilibrium". Lucas(1978) explained briefly why he chose such methodology which doesn't faithfully reflects reality: 

In this video (from 7: 30 to 9: 00)on Youtube, Battigalli mentions the state of world for a simple three-legged centipede game, which, in his own word, is 

Can we have some other implication, like, If a game admits a unique Nash equilibirum, does common knowledge of rationality implies Nash equilibirum? 

I have the following optimisation problem: max $E_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}[log(c_{t}) + log(m_{t})]$ subject to $y + \frac{M_{t-1}}{p_{t}} + R_{t-1}\frac{B_{t-1}}{p_{t}} = c_{t} + m_{t}+b_{t}+\tau_{t}$ Where lower case letters indicate real variables and $R$ is the gross nominal interest rate. I am trying to solve this using the value function approach but I am having a difficult time understanding what the state variable should be in this case. I tried using wealth as the state and formulated the following value function: $V(a_{t}) = \max_{c_{t}, m_{t},b_{t}} [u(c_{t},m_{t}) + \beta V(a_{t+1})]$ where $a_{t} = y+ \frac{M_{t-1}}{p_{t}} + R_{t-1}\frac{B_{t-1}}{p_{t}} $ and initial values are assumed to be given. My problem now is that I don't know what to substitute for $a_{t+1}$. I have tried forwarding the left-hand side of the budget constraint (i.e $a_{t+1} = y + \frac{m_{t}}{\pi_{t+1}} + R_{t} \frac{b_{t}}{\pi_{t+1}})$ and then differentiating w.r.t c,m and b but my results are very strange. Furthermore, if I have understood correctly, I also have to find $V_{a}(a_{t})$ which I cannot do with this substitution. I am trying to learn this using Walsh's book and in his example, the budget constraint has capital which appears on both sides of the budget constraint, this allows him to re-write capital as a function of $a_{t}$. I tried to do the same but with real balances; From the budget constraint I can write $m_{t} = a_{t}-c_t-b_t-\tau_t$ So, $V(a_{t}) = [u(c_{t},m_{t}) + \beta V(y + \frac{a_{t}-c_t-b_t-\tau_t}{\pi_{t+1}}) + R_{t} \frac{b_{t}}{\pi_{t+1}} ]$ Again I differentiate w.r.t c,m and b and this time my results are looking less crazy but still not correct. I get: (c) $u_{c} - \beta V_{a}(a_{t+1})[\frac{1}{\pi_{t+1}}] = 0$ (m) $u_m + \beta V_{a}(a_{t+1})[\frac{1}{\pi_{t+1}}] = 0$ (b) $\beta V_{a}(a_{t+1})[\frac{R_{t}}{\pi_{t+1}} - \frac{1}{\pi_{t+1}}] = 0$ And lastly, $V_{a}(a_{t}) = \beta V_{a}(a_{t+1})[\frac{1}{\pi_{t+1}}] $ The final condition implies that $u_{c} = V_{a}(a_{t})$ which is similar to Walsh's answer but I can't seem to obtain a form of the Fisher equation and money demand function from my workings. There is also the equilibrium condition $c_{t} = y-g$ but I have no idea when to impose it. Any thoughts on what I have done incorrectly? 

In Benjamin Edelman, Michael Ostrovsky, and Michael Schwarz(2007), there's a hand-waving argument to justify their setting as a game of complete information: 

This question arises from reading of Sannikov and Scrzypacz (2007) and Green and Porter(1984), which are modeling the same thing, dynamic collusion under imperfect monitoring, in a continuous-time version and a discrete-time version. Their choice of different noises term are crucial to derivation of their conclusions. My question is how to decide which one is dominant for a particular market(e.g. European banana market) regarding the modeling of noises. My guess is that multiplicative noise term is more relevant to shocks of weather, additive accumulative noise term(following Brownian motion in Sannikov and Scrzypacz's case) is more relevant to shocks related to institution, say, cultural revolution and Khomeini's return to Iran. 

I am trying to solve my first ratex model and make some impulse response functions using Dynare. I am following Leeper (1991). This is what I have done so far: The utility function is $\log(c_{t})+\log(m_{t})$. I obtain two first order conditions: (1) $\frac{1}{R_{t}} = \beta E_{t}\frac{1}{\pi_{t+1}}$ and (2) $m_{t} = c[\frac{R_{t}}{R_{t}-1}]$ Where $R_{t}$ is the gross nominal interest rate, $\pi_{t}$ is the gross inflation rate and $c$ the deterministic steady state value of consumption. Suppose the monetary authority follows the following rule: $R_{t} = \alpha_{0} + \alpha \pi_{t} + \theta_{t}$ where $\theta_{t} = \rho_{1} \theta_{t-1} + \epsilon_{1t}$, $|\rho_{1}|<1$ The fiscal authority follows: $\tau_{t} = \gamma_{0} + \gamma b_{t-1} + \psi_{t}$ where $\psi_{t} = \rho_{2} \psi_{t-1} + \epsilon_{2t}$ I then substitute the monetary policy rule in to (1) and both policy rules in to the government's flow budget constraint and linearize around the steady state. I end up with the same results as Leeper: (3) $E_{t}\widetilde{\pi_{t+1}} = \alpha \beta \widetilde{\pi_{t}} + \beta \theta_{t}$ (4) $\varphi_{1} \widetilde{\pi_{t}} + \widetilde{b_{t}} + \varphi_{2}\widetilde{\pi_{t-1}} - (\beta^{-1}- \gamma)\widetilde{b_{t-1}} + \varphi_{3} \theta_{t} \ +\psi_{t} + \varphi_{4} \theta_{t-1} = 0$ where the varphi's are steady state constants. So far I have just replicated what Leeper has done. Since I would like to make IRF's I believe I have to 'solve' the model. I haven't been taught this at university yet so all I know if from reading online lecture notes. I want to use Sims form, i.e [![enter image description here][1]][1] And this is the system I ended up with: [![enter image description here][2]][2] I forwarded (4) one period in order to obtain $b_{t+1}$ and just put everything in matrix form. $\eta$ is the forecasting error from (3). I apologise for the matrix, I am not sure how to write matrices in TeX but hopefully you get the idea. Now I want to stack the matrices as the following: The capital gamma's and phi's are the coefficient matrices from above. There should be a matrix for the forecasting errors but I am not completely sure how to obtain it. But that is a minor issue at this point. If I have understood correctly, I can solve this by inverting the block matrix and since it is diagonal, the inverse is simply the inverse of gamma and phi. However, since phi_0 is singular I cannot invert it. So I have two questions: (1) How do I deal with singular matrices in this context? I have seen some papers by Chris Sims where he shows to how to deal with singular matrices but my knowledge of linear algebra is too basic to understand it. (2) Once I manage to solve the model, can I use Dynare to make IRF's?
