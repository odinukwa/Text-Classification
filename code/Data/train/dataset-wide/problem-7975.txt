Sodin studies the density of the zeros the distribution and gets a proof by Edleman-Kostlan $$ n_f = \sum_{f(a)= 0} \delta (x-a) = \tfrac{1}{2\pi}\log | \,f \,| $$ 

I believe there is something called the Metropolis Algorithm The volume of your simplex (without the linear constraint) is $\frac{1}{n!}$ and so rejection sampling is terrible. So instead you do a reflecting random walk in your space and the limiting distribution is uniform in the polyhedron. If you want to know rigorously why the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm works, maybe you can try What do we know about the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm? by Diaconis and Salff-Lacoste. Oh! I found it... Gibbs/Metropolis algorithms on a convex polytope ... but these very complicated. Just remember the phrase "detailed-balance". 

Another important example is random walk on the cube [0,1]n and it's projection is the Ehrenfest Urn 

And there is likely even more. My goal had been to try to understand if there was equivalence between domino tilings and alternating sign matrix, with 6-vertex as an intermediate object. I wound up just totally confusing myself. 

Is there a way to classify (and build) the principal SU(2) bundles over a given topological surface up to homeomorphism? In the end, I would like to examine the associated bundle whose fiber is a given irreducible representation of SU(2). Perhaps this construction appears in the physics literature. 

Instead of plotting the curve itself I plotted a histogram. It looks mildly like a Gaussian, so I won't plot it here. I think I have stumbled upon Quantum Chaos, or possibly the mixing of the horocycle flow on $\mathbb{H}/ SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$. I don't believe it has ever been proven. Was it ever proven the image on the right is white noise? For line segments very close to the origin $z = 0.00\dots 01 + i y$ do we know how mixed up things are getting? 

In the paper, they try to solve $2x^4 + x^2y + 4 xy ^2 + 4 y^3 = 0$ as a function $y(x)$ in terms of $x$: $$y(x) = c_1 x^{\gamma_1} + c_2 x^{\gamma_1 + \gamma_2} + c_3 x^{\gamma_1 + \gamma_2 + \gamma_3 } + \dots$$ The draw the newton polygon (in ASCII format) 

Galois' own writings are available online. His total writings total less than 100 pages (only some of it on theory of permutation "groups" for solving equations) and changed the course of mathematics. 

He tells us, the Ising Model "freezes" into a Dimer problem, which is dual to a domino tiling problem. From Fisher's original 1966 paper we find, the square Ising model maps to dimers model on "decorated" square lattice: 

However, I later found many other sources. These polynomials appear whenever you have a holomorphic, or entire function or a Laplace transform or otherwise non-zero function and you need to take some kind of approximation. This result is still counterintuitive, since setting $z = ix$ and observing $e^{i \pi x} \neq 0$ suggests there should never be zeros. Varga and Carpenter show: $$ \theta = |\arg z| \geq \cos^{-1} \left( 1 - \frac{2}{n}\right) $$ this should be enough to rule out a zero being on the imaginary axis. 

As a computer experiment I did a few Riemannian sums to see if I could quantify the density statement $\overline{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})} = \mathbb{R}$ : $$ \Big| \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{0 \leq m,n \leq N} \{ \sqrt{2} m + \sqrt{3} n \}^5 - \frac{1}{6} \Big| \stackrel{?}{<} \frac{1}{N^2} $$ A log-plot shows the correct exponent is a bit less than $2$. Is it a Hausdorff dimension of some kind? 

Attaching names to all the concepts, we are looking for points in $X = \{ x^2 - 2y^2 = 0 \} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}^2 $. I could think of several approaches: #1 $\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{R}$, I forget if $\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q}_2$, but certainly $\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}_3, \mathbb{Q}_5$. Therefore $\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$ by Hasse principle. In other words, $X(\mathbb{A}) \neq \varnothing$ but $X(\mathbb{Q}_5) = \varnothing$ so that $X(\mathbb{A}) = \varnothing$. This is cheating, but we can see that an $H^1$ was involved. #2 There is a map $X(\mathbb{Z}) \stackrel{\div2}{\to} X(\mathbb{Z})$ by $(x,y) \to (y/2, x)$. Once can produce an $\mathbb{R}$-valued invariant (such as a height) that decreases indefinitely. 

I found this formula in an engineering textbook (image processing). It is an approximation of the Laplacian on flat space $\mathbb{R}^2$. \begin{eqnarray*} \nabla^2 f &\approx& -20 f(\vec{x}) + 4 \big( f( \vec{x} + \epsilon \,\mathbf{i} ) + f( \vec{x} + \epsilon \,\mathbf{j} ) + f( \vec{x} - \epsilon \,\mathbf{i} ) + f( \vec{x} - \epsilon \,\mathbf{j} )\big) \\ &+& \big( f(\vec{x}+ \epsilon (\mathbf{i}+ \mathbf{j})\big) + \big( f(\vec{x}+ \epsilon (\mathbf{i}- \mathbf{j})\big) + \big( f(\vec{x}+ \epsilon (-\mathbf{i}+ \mathbf{j})\big) + \big( f(\vec{x}+ \epsilon (-\mathbf{i}- \mathbf{j})\big) \end{eqnarray*} Sorry I have no succinct way of writing this. Typically one uses a Stencil: $$ \frac{1}{6\epsilon^2} \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 4 & 1 \\ 4 & -20 & 4 \\ 1 & 4 & 1 \end{array} \right] $$ I suspect this falls out of Euler MacLaurin formula. But he also estimate the error term. More precisely if you call the right hand side $L$ he says that: $$ L = \nabla^2 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{12} \nabla^2( \nabla^2) + O(\epsilon)^4 $$ Can one formalize such an estimate using Sobolev norms? 

It is possible to trisect an angle exactly with origami. Based on the Huzita Axioms, the numbers constructible by Origami form a field are a field strictly larger than the field of compass-and-straightedge constructible numbers. You can also double the cube with origami. 

Not sure what "canonical" means in this context. Half of algebraic geometry is called "canonical ring" or "fundamental class" or some other vacuous term. 

Let $ N_\chi(\alpha,T)$ be the number of zeros of $L(s=\sigma+it,\chi) = \sum \frac{\chi(n)}{n^s}$ where $c > 0$ and $(\sigma,t) $ are in the rectangle $ [\alpha,1] \times [-T,T]$. In various papers one can read an estimate of the number of zeros over all L-functions: $$ \sum_{\chi \mod q} N_\chi(\alpha,T) \ll T^{c(1-\alpha)} $$ How does this imply the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions? $$ \sum_{1 \leq q \leq Q} \sum_{\chi} \left| \sum_x^{x+h}\chi(p) \log p \right| \ll h \cdot e^{\large -a \frac{\log x}{\log Q}}$$ I hardly recognize this as the statement there are infinitely many primes in any arithmetic sequence Since this is a statement about all characters $\chi$ how do we get a single arithmetic sequence $n = aq+b$? 

In classical Mechanics, momentum and position can be paired together to form a symplectic manifold. If you have the simple harmonic oscillator with energy $H = (k/2)x^2 + (m/2)\dot{x}^2$. In this case, the orbits are ellipses. How is the vector field determined by the (symplectic) gradient, then? Also, does anyone know an interpretation for the area inside a closed curve in phase space? 

In the first section of Freed-Hopkins-Lurie-Teleman they construct a one-dimensional Topological Quantum Field Theory. 

In the theory of Young diagrams, it's a common move to turn the young diagram 45 degrees and consider it's profile as a function. [ Note for editors: it would be nice to find an image of this... ] Are there ways to build 1-d (probably piecewise linear) curves from trees or from binary trees or ternary trees? 

We learned in linear algebra that an $N \times N$ matrices can be placed into jordan normal forms with "blocks": $$ \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} \lambda & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \lambda & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \lambda & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \lambda \end{array} \right] \hspace{0.25in}\text{or }\hspace{0.25in} \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} \lambda & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \lambda \end{array} \right]$$ What is the analogue of "blocks" for a pair of $N \times N$ matrices, $\phi,\psi:V \to V$ ? and for a triple of matrices. $\phi, \psi,\rho: V \to V $ ? 

If there is complex multiplication, there is a relationship to splitting of primes. $$ E : y^2 = x^3 - 17x \quad\text{ has }\quad \text{End}(E) \simeq \mathbb{Z}[i] $$ Apparently there are "bad primes" $p = 2, 17$. Chen observes that $a_p = 0$ for $p \in 4\mathbb{Z}+3$ and states a CM Sato-Tate conjecture. 

Q Despite the answer being "yes" there are two possibly incompatible yes answers. One QFT definition depends on the choice of graph embedding, the other is an invariant on surfaces with boundary and does not depend on choice of triangulation. Traditionally the dimer model counts the number of perfect matchings. Even if we pick a rectangle, that region is topologically a disc.. So the TQFT invariant should not depend on our choice of rectangle. Have I shown that Gaiotto-Kapustin and Cimasoni-Reshetikhin cannot agree? 

I'm reading about amenable groups. What are explicit examples of nonabelian discrete amenable groups other than finite groups? Perhaps a group presentation or matrix representation would be useful. 

In all fairness, he had his PhD already and then went to prison because of the War. I notice his study of sheaves and spectral sequences are not part of algerbaic geometey or algebraic topology as we know it. He was studying the Navier Stokes partial differential equations. 

For some reason, today I want to understand better the group of diffeomorphisms of the 2-sphere, $S^2$. After a few minutes I found this result by Smale in 1958. 

Last year, Leonhard Euler posted a note, Finding the sum of any series from a given general term on the arXiv. In recent years, this idea has been extended to sums over lattice approximations of convex polytopes $\Delta \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ as shown in the other responses. 

And if we pin down all the relations we obtain the structure of an algebraic variety. Therefore, could it be possible to write down polynomial morse functions of this kind of space? And work out the critical points? 

How does one write down $\mathbb{R}$-valued functions on the modular surface? I am considering taking an arbitrary function on the upper half plane $f:\mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{R}$ and averaging over the elements of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$. So, $$ f_1(z) = \sum_{g \in SL(2, \mathrm{Z})} f(gz) $$ there may have to be a decay condition on $f$ so the function will converge. I am not necessarily looking for holomorphic functions, just smooth and well defined on $\mathbb{H}\backslash SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$. 

I am going to keep reading, but does anyone know what polyhedron or oval or other geometric shape leads to a proof of the sum of 3 squares theorem? 

I was intrigued by this result in Journal of Number Theory from 2013. Let $n = 2^{\lambda_2}\prod p^{\lambda_p}$. 

I have a Bernoulli trial with success rate $p$ and failure rate $1-p$ the odds of $k$ successes is $\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$. I need to evaluate an integral $$ \int_0^1 dp p^k (1-p)^{N-k} = \frac{k!(N-k)!}{(N+1)!} $$ This was done with Mathematica, but you can use induction. To avoid mindlessly integrating, can you read this integral as an expectation and evaluate it probabilistically? Maybe after rescaling. Maybe there's a name for Bernoulli trials where the success rate $p$ uniformly random. 

I think you can get the Puiseux expansion by solving $t = x^{1/m}$ and setting $y = \sum a_r x^{r/m}$. Then I'd guess there are $m$ branches if $a_1 \neq 0$. See How to Compute a Puiseux Expansion on the arXiv. These are connected with resolutions of singularities on curves. 

John Conway The Symmetries of Things discusses the Magic Theorem in detail as well as versions with 2 or more colors. Echoing Neil's response, the quotient of $S^2$, $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{H}^2$ by a group action is going to be a Riemann surface of some kind. By uniformaztiions any equation like $y^2 = x(x-1)(x+1)$ is going to be a surface of this kind. Beyond that I would like to know which surface? The Cylinder $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}$ has the Euclidean plane as a covering space, so Conway might feel it has been covered in his book. The "things" which Conway discusses symmetry might not be spaces at all. The might be spaces of Modular forms (which live on the surfaces). 

Just to record what I heard from another source, Geometric Control Theory has some promise. Many examples from classical mechanics examined from the point of view of connections on their phase space. The text is Geometric Control of Mechanical Systems by Francesco Bullo and Andrew D. Lewis. 

I think this problem is slightly difficult because you have to sieve out the squares, but otherwise, shouldn't this result fall out of Hasse principle or a theta function of some kind? I could solve this equation possibly over each prime (as well as $p=2$) and then multiply the result. $$ p^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2z^2 $$ There's no guarantee even of one solution here, but for this enumerative result we're simply stating that we could multiply the result from all places. Was it new to count solutions over all primes? Does the number of solutions $r_{(1,1,2)}(p^2)$ for all primes not sufficient to determine $r_{(1,1,2)}$ in general? I remember reading that the class number was either 1 or 2 (but I don't even know what that means). 

By the fundamental theorem of calculus we know a polynomial of degree $n$ has as many roots in the complex plane. That doesn't mean have any more information of the roots than that, (e.g. is the Galois group $S_n$?). There's also the problem that $e^z$ has no roots in $\mathbb{C}$ and how to account for that. Using Stirling formula, Laplace transform, Rouché s theorem and things like that, one can so the roots of such polynomials behave like: $$ |z \, e^{1-z} | = 1 $$ I don't know where I first learned of these results maybe in American Mathematical Monthly: 

There's lots of discussion and staring at the result I can see "cohomological" things about them, but none of the discussions really link the abstract and concrete discussions. I have seen Skorobogatov's book still doesn't show me how to approach this specific case. 

Sometimes models like this can simplified e.g. loop erased random walk and self-avoiding walk. Your model may even be integrable if you allow for a small amount of self-intersections. 

In order for your question to make sense, you need to define the terms "successful mathematician" and "good university". An idealistic response might skirt the issue altogether and claim that it does not matter what other people think. On the other hand, you are constantly being evaluated throughout your schooling and well into your professional career. Maybe you can focus on what it means to do good mathematics. In his essay "What is Good Mathematics" Terrence Tao explains why he thinks Szemeredi's Theorem is good math. The theorem states that any subset of natural numbers with "positive upper density" contains arithmetic sequences of arbitrary length. Although this was proven by Szemeredi in the 1970's, it was proven by many other people using tools from all over mathematics: dynamical systems, Fourier analysis, hypergraph theory. One of my favorite solutions is the proof of the Baik-Deift-Johansson conjecture on the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation. Proofs of this theorem relate this statistic to eigenvalues of random Hermitean matrices and to the lengths of random Young tableaux under Plancherel measure. Again the techniques use here come from different branches of math: e.g. the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, the representation theory of the symmetric group, orthogonal polynomials, random matrices and quantum gravity. See Longest Increasing Subsequences: From Patience Sorting to the Baik-Deift-Johansson Theorem Good mathematics takes a certain mixed of creativity and technical know-how to pose and solve. By solving thousands of problems, you can develop your own mathematical taste. Then you can judge for yourself what good mathematics is and what it isn't. 

After reading Bourgain's paper it seems that Oppenheim's conjecture for quadratic forms is easier to solve if we spread over a range of possible values. He studies quadratic forms of signature $(2,1)$: $$ \max_{|\xi| < A} \min_{x \in \mathbb{Z}^3, \; 0 < |x| < N} \big|\;\underbrace{x_1^3 + a\, x_2^2 - b x_3^2 }_{Q(x)}- \xi\big|$$ For a fixed $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ this was proven by Margulis to tend to zero, and that is called the Oppenheim conjecture, as long as $[1:a:b] \notin P\mathbb{Q}^2$. Here he proves uniform bounds for fixed $a$ and $b$ ranging over an interval 

The logo for this year's ICM show the inequality $ |\tau(n)| \leq n^{11/2} d(n)$ where $\sum \tau(n)q^n = q \prod_{n \neq 1} (1 - q^n)^{24}$ is the tau function. Wikipedia says this bound was conjectured by Ramanujan (appropriate for a conference in Hyderabad) and proven by Deligne in '74 in the process of proving as a corollary of the Weil Conjectures (which I also don't get). The background of the ICM logo looks like Ford circles (or sun rays). What is the hyperbolic geometry behind the Tau Conjecture and its proof? EDIT: It would also be nice to see the proof of this bound, but the Weil conjectures and l-adic cohomology are a topic in themselves. 

Clarification I am being repeatedly asked to clarify the question what do I mean by "pattern" the truth is I don't know. To this end I make two points: 

As a non-expert I would hope that with an appropriate group action I could find objects enumerated by $$ \frac{q^n}{[n+1]_q} \binom{2n}{n}_q $$ and I would look through Richard Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics and hope for the best. 

I found a certain trig identity in a discussion on Lie groups \[ \frac{\prod_{i < j} 2 \sin (\mu_i - \mu_j) \prod_{i< j} 2 \sin (\nu_i - \nu_j) }{\prod_{i, j} 2 \cos (\mu_i - \nu_j) } = \det_{i,j} \frac{1}{2 \cos (\mu_i - \nu_j)} \] This is the Cauchy determinant formula. \[ \det_{i,j} \frac{1}{\mu_i - \nu_j} = \frac{\prod_{i < j} \mu_i - \mu_j \prod_{i< j} \nu_i - \nu_j}{\prod_{i, j} \mu_i - \nu_j } \] It seems to be related to the Haar measure on $U(n)$, which would have a factor: \[ \prod_{i < j} \sin (\mu_i - \mu_j) \] I am thrown off by the cosine factor in the denominator.
