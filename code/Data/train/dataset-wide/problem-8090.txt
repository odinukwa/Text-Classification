They simply take the exact formula for the ruin probability of a simple random walk and use it as an approximation. Ruin probability of a simple random walk that jumps to $+1$ with probability $p$ and to $-1$ with probability q is given by $(q/p)^z$ if $p>q$. Then, take the random walk that starts at $u=Cz$ and jumps to $+C$ or $-C$ with the same probabilities. Pick $C$, $p$ and $q$ in such a way that the mean and variance of simple random walk are equal to that of the Gaussian random walk. This gives the following equations $$ C(p-q)=\mu $$ and $$ C^2(p+q)= \mu^2+\sigma^2. $$ Of course, $p+q=1$. Then the probability of ruin of this random walk will be $(p/q)^{u/C}$ and after finding $p$ and $q$ will be exactly the formula that you gave. Of course, this is not really a proof, just an explanation how one can obtain this approximation. I doubt that a rigorous proof exists. However, as $u\to \infty$, one can use Cramer asymptotics for probability of ruin. 

There are 'obvious' places to follow this up. The mentions in PS (Pursuing Stacks) are worth looking into (but skim that as you can easily get bogged down in it and weighted down by its length) and also see the 'letters to Larry Breen' from 1975 (for which look at the Grothendieck circle pages . These latter give some of the wish-list for a theory of $n$-groupoids, including the corresponding higher Galois theory (and here you could skip to 2015 and Marc Hoyois's preprint: $URL$ For the development since then the work of Lurie, and Toen and Vezzosi provide sources for some of the ideas, but I am not sure what aspect you are interested in. ('Higher algebra' by Lurie would be a good place to browse.) Look through Ronnie Brown's page that relates to PS ( pages.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/pstacks.htm) and follow up some of the links and look at $URL$ There is in PS, I seem to remember, some explicit mention of 'topological algebra' in the sense you want. (Edit: In fact he mentions it early on in the 'letter to Quillen', but not after that if my search was working.) 

This is just a bound from below. The derivation is a bit long for a comment. Clearly, a positive solution to the equation exists (although you need to specify in more details what happens when $X_1=0$ as $\lambda_1=0$ in this case). Now, we have \begin{align*} \sum_{j=2}^nX_{j} &= \sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{j=2}^n\left(\sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \lambda_i\right)\ln (\lambda_j/\lambda_{j-1})\\ &=\sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i\left(\sum_{j=i+1}^n \ln(\lambda_j/\lambda_{j-1})\right) \\ &=\sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i \ln(\lambda_n/\lambda_i) \end{align*} Now since $\lambda_i>0$ we can make use of the inequality $\ln(1+x)\le x$ to obtain \begin{align*} \sum_{j=2}^nX_{j}&\le \sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i (\lambda_n/\lambda_i-1)\\ &=\lambda_n-\lambda_1+(n-1)\lambda_n \end{align*} Dividing both sides by $n$ and letting $n \to \infty$ we obtain by the Law of Large Numbers, $$ \lambda \le \liminf_{n\to\infty}\lambda_n, \quad \mbox{a.s.} $$ 

You can find the asymptotics for this probability. For that let $$ \tau:=\inf\{i\ge 1: S_i\le i^\alpha\}. $$ Then, if $Var(S_1)<\infty$ then the asymptotics for $$ p_n=\mathbf P(\tau>n)\sim \frac{C}{\sqrt n},\quad n\to \infty, $$ see $URL$ for random walks with i.i.d. increments, and $URL$ for random walks whose increments are independent but not necessarily identical. In the latter case the answer is $$ \mathbf P(\tau >n) \sim \frac{C}{\sqrt{Var(S_n)} },\quad n\to \infty. $$ I have doubts about existence of a simple (and accurate) lower bound. 

There is a survey article (by me) that looks at the area of the homotopy theory of ends (and Proper Homotopy) that appeared in the Handbook of Algebraic Topology (1995). If the space concerned is reasonably nice (e.g. an infinite simplicial complex or similar) then the space of ends has a neat interpretation as rays going `to $\infty$'. There is a large amount of theory relating to the homotopy invariants of the ends of spaces. This started with Siebenmann's work on finding when an open manifold could be thought of as a closed manifold with the boundary removed. There are, of course, complications and some of these are discussed in that Survey article and the papers refered to there. That built on an approach through the category of prosimplicial sets due to Edwards and Hastings. A slightly different approach was used by Baues and Quintero in their book `Infinite Homotopy Theory'. Hughes and Ranicki wrote another book `Ends of Complexes' (C.U.Press, 1996), but I have not a copy but there is a pdf file on the web page of Andrew Ranicki. ($URL$ One of the interesting problems is seeing how the global homotopy type reflects the homotopy type at the ends. (If you are interested in following some of this up, post another question and I will look out some more precise references. On the other hand, you may be more interested in the general topology of these end spaces, and again there is more to say there as well.) 

Just an addition to Pablo Lessa's comment. If probability to stay at a point is zero, then you have a simple random walk and the Reflection Principle is valid. So, your question will follow if you find the joint distribution of the maximum and minimum, as the simple random walk visits all points between them. The exact formula for the joint distribution of the maximum and minimum can be found in e.g. book of Billingsley, Convergence of probability measures, Chapter 2.11. The question can also be reformulated as the distribution of the first exit time from an interval [-a,b]. Then, another reference (for the zero-mean random walk) is this paper $URL$ of Kemperman, Asymptotic expansions for the Smirnov test for the range of cumulative sums. Ann. Math. Statist. 30 1959 448–462. The more general case (when probability to stay at 0 is greater than 0) can be treated similarly to the above references. 

You seem to be wanting to USE category theory rather than just to study it as such, although the two are linked. The detailed answer to you problem also depends on the background of the people who are in your chosen PhD school. Category theory is great as an area (as are some others) because if you take it seriously you will be forced to learn a lot of other areas of mathematics in searching for the enlightenment about what certain (categorical) constructions. There are lots of ideas out there and sometimes you should just launch in and work back, finding out what you don't know, and remedying the lack! There are several blogs, sets of lecture notes, the n-Lab, etc. on which you can train yourself. (I gave an MSc course in Ottawa some years ago and have put an extended version of it on my homepage on the n-Lab, try it, it is freely available, (but is a bit long as I went on adding to it!) It tried to build intuition on cohomology and what it means, starting from a very classical basis and then looking at group cohomology, simplicial stuff, and so on. It wanders around looking at some, to me, fun stuff, so dip in and see if some topic grabs you then, as Andrej say, gobble it up. The course (The Menagerie) takes a categorical viewpoint but is not that abstractly categorical.) (Edit: Another good example of the sort of thing you might browse through is the Stacks project. The n-Lab has a page with that title and a link, in case you want to look.) 

For fixed $t<1/\lambda$ it seems that intuition B is correct as $N \to \infty $. In this case, using the large deviations, one can see that it is highly unlikely that more than $(N+\varepsilon)\lambda t$ customers have arrived in time interval [0,t]. As there are $N$ servers and customers join the shortest queue it means that there will be empty servers and new customers will simply join them. Therefore, for $t<1/\lambda$ there will be a proportion of $\lambda t$ servers with 1 customer and $(1-\lambda t)$ servers with 0 customers. It might be good to have a look at N. D. Vvedenskaya, R. L. Dobrushin, F. I. Karpelevich, “Queueing System with Selection of the Shortest of Two Queues: An Asymptotic Approach”, Probl. Peredachi Inf., 32:1 (1996), 20–34, who studied a related system. 

Several people have mentioned that $\otimes N$ should left adjoint to a suitable $Hom(N,-)$. There are numerous instances of this sort of construction (including one using joins of augmented simplicial sets mentioned in another question w.r.t Lurie's HTT). There is a good discussion of the ideas in MacLane's Homology and in Hilton and Stammbach. The sign conventions are, however, often not fully explained. (They work, but why? is the feeling one gets.) The point in Baez and Crans is more that there are variants that have good more or less geometric interpretations and they give sensible answers. (There is also work by Andy Tonks on tensor products of crossed complexes that makes this clear.) The discussion in older sources such as Spanier is also good for explaining why the signs are important. You ask about bilinearity. This is really a strange idea. It can be handled in more generality than the simple form you mention but it can often be best interpreted as coming from the evaluation map $ Hom(A,B)\times A \to B$ in which $(f,x)$ gets sent to $f(x)$. If you look at the adjunction that was mentioned between $\otimes$ and $Hom$, then from $\phi : C\to Hom(A,B)$ you do a naive thing and get $C\times A \to Hom(A,B)\times A\to B$ and that will be bilinear, ugh! Thus the representability of bilinear maps is the same universal property as the one everyone has been mentioning. 

1) I believe it is possible to obtain $P(M_n<a\ | \tau>n)$, where $\tau:=\inf\{n\ge 1: S_n\le 0\}$ in more or less explicit way only for the case of the simple random walk. These computations can be found in Billingsley, Convergence of Probability measures, Chapter 2.11. For large $n$ these computations become universal as you can apply FCLT, see below. 2) Generally, one can use Brownian motion approximations as was suggested by fedja. Mathematic justification is given in the references below. Before going into this I will say a few words about conditioning of random walks to stay positive. There are two ways to condition random walk to be positive. First way is to condition on $\{\tau>n\}$, where $\tau:=\inf\{n\ge 1: S_n\le 0\}$. Second way, is to ''condition'' on $\{\tau=\infty\}$. Here you cannot use direct conditioning as $\mathbf P(\tau=\infty)=0$ (for the zero-mean finite variance random walk). So, the way to proceed is to use Doob's $h$ transform. As a result one obtains a Markov chain (Lamperti Markov chain, in fact) which is a discrete-time analogue of Bessel process. Now I can move on to approximations as $n\to\infty$. a) When $a$ is of order $\sqrt n$, you need to use corresponding Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT). You need functional central limit theorem as the maximum depends on the whole trajectory of the random walk. The way to use functional limit theorems is described in the above Billinsley's book, you can see an example for unconditioned random walk in Chapter 2.11. For the first type of conditioning FCLT is proved in Iglehart, 1974, Functional Central Limit Theorems for Random Walks Conditioned to Stay Positive (doi:10.1214/aop/1176996607), see also Bolthausen, 1976, On a Functional Central Limit Theorem for Random Walks Conditioned to Stay Positive. Conditioning of the second type was considered in Bertoin and Doney (1994), On Conditioning a Random Walk to Stay Nonnegative (doi:10.1214/aop/1176988497). FCLT for the second type of conditioning can be found in Caravenna, Chaumont (2008), Invariance principles for random walks conditioned to stay positive (doi:10.1214/07-AIHP119). Finally, in higher dimensions you can use FCLT from $URL$ b) When $a$ is much larger then $\sqrt n,$ then $\mathbf P(M_n<a\ |\ \tau>n)\to 1$. c) When $a<<\sqrt n$ you are dealing with small deviations probability. If you write $\mathbf P(M_n<a | \tau>n)=\mathbf P(M_n<a , \tau>n)/\mathbf P(\tau>n)$, then approximation for $\mathbf P(\tau>n)\sim Cn^{-1/2}, n\to\infty$, and $$ \mathbf P(\tau>n, M_n<a)=\mathbf P(\mbox{random walk $S_k$ stays in (0,n) for all } 0<k\le n) $$ Now, if $a\sim An^{1/2-\delta}$ for $\delta\in(0,1/2)$ you can split this trajectory in $n/a^2$ parts of length $a^2$ and use independence to obtain estimate $$ \mathbf P(\tau>n, M_n<a)\le \left(\mathbf P(\mbox{random walk $S_k$ stays in (0,2a) for all } 0<k\le a^2)\right)^{n/a^2} $$ Now, the probability inside the parenthesis is on the right scale and you can apply the FCLT to get $$ \mathbf P(\mbox{random walk $S_k$ stays in (0,2a) for all } 0<k\le a^2)\to C(A)\in(0,1). $$ This results in the following upper bound $$ \mathbf P(\tau>n, M_n<a) \le C(A)^{n/a^2}\approx C(A)^{n^{2\delta}}. $$ As $C(A)$ is in $(0,1)$ this probability is quite small. .
