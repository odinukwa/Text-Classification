One thing I often do is work with set-builder notation $\{blah\in thing| conditions\}$ where either or both of the $blah$ and $conditions$ are allowed to be (collections of) (2-)commuting diagrams. I also work with objects and arrows separately. (Edit: by which I mean I write $Obj(C) := \ldots$ and $Mor(C) := \ldots$ or similar) 

The notion of bundle gerbe is a categorification of line bundles/principal $U(1)$-bundles, and comes in two presentations: a linear version (with $Line_\mathbb{C}$-enriched underlying groupoid) and a principal version (using $U(1)$-torsors). It is really the first one that deserves the name "2-line bundle" (or line 2-bundle), and the second one "principal 2-bundle". The concept of trivialisation of a gerbe is very much like the idea of a global section of a principal $U(1)$-bundle, and one also sees the analogue in the linear setting. However, line bundles may have global sections that vanish at certain points. Hence there should be a notion of section of a 2-line bundle (which would itself be some bundle-like object) than exhibits such a behaviour. Away from the points where the "section" vanishes, one should have a trivialisation of the gerbe by that data, but at the vanishing points the data should somehow be degenerate. After that preamble, the only place I have seen such a definition is in a video of a talk at a German university (perhaps Hamburg) I started watching but gave up after prolonged buffering issues. The problem is, I cannot remember the speaker or the title or the conference! I think it was a graduate student speaking, but cannot after extensive searching figure out who it was. So my question is: what is the definition of a general section of a 2-line bundle, and what was the talk? 

where $f/_{\cong} p$ is the 2-pullback, and $f/p$ is the comma object (from the nLab). So we should just replace 2-categorical concepts here by $\infty$-categorical concepts. This presumes the definition of adjoint $\infty$-functors :) As to your second question, if we know that $\infty$Cat is enriched over itself, we use the $\infty$-categorical version of the first definition at fibration in a 2-category (nLab again) 

But I don't see that just because CH holds in $L$, we must have that $L$-sets are sufficiently structureless. One could consider that the universe of sets is of the form $L[G]$ (or rather, the topos of sheaves over $L$-sets), but this is a rather specific set-theoretic axiom and I don't know if there are results that say $V$ is a class forcing of its $L$ (this would be very cool if it were the case!) All I can say is: I really don't know what he was on about there. From where I stand, structural set theory so far lacks an analogue of inner model theory of which $L$ is but one example. For a given topos $\mathcal{E}$ These would be toposes $\mathcal{L}$ equipped with a functor $\mathcal{L}\to \mathcal{E}$ (not a geometric morphism, or a logical functor), but presumably finite-limit-preserving, fully faithful, and probably a few other things (eg structural constructions in ZFC that are absolute). Note that these are not internal categories, since they should be as "tall" as the ambient topos. I have no idea how one would actually construct such a topos corresponding to $L$, except by constructing a model of ZFC from the (boolean etc) topos, forming $L$, and then taking its category of sets, and then relying on the material-structural adjunction to get the faithful functor of interest. 

Consider the category $Cat(S)$ of internal categories in a finitely complete category $S$ equipped with a Grothendieck pretopology $J$. For $S$ and $J$ satisfying certain properties, then there is a Quillen model structure, shown by Everaert, Kieboom and van der Linden where the weak equivalences are those internally fully faithful, essentially 'surjective' (*) functors. But without the asumptions that EKvdL give, there is only a Brown model structure in general (I don't know if this is published, Urs Schreiber mentioned it to me and I wrote down the proof myself). Mostly the problem comes with not having cocompleteness of $Cat(S)$, for which they give sufficient assumptions, like $S$ being a topos with NNO, or being a finitely cocomplete regular Mal'cev category. One might claim (Urs might, for example :) that this is a special case of a category of simplicial sheaves from Otgonbayar Uuye's answer, namely those simplicial sheaves that are nerves of categories and representable. But one does not need the machinery of simplicial sheaves to talk about this case. 

(I'm not sure how much this is an answer to your question, rather it is an answer - one might say in the legal sense - to the statement in the title and the preliminary material.) Bill Lawvere explains his philosophy behind sets (and note he invented a whole new foundation of mathematics to back this up!) in his Perugia lecture notes, available from here. Essentially he says sets are the minimally structured objects: bags of dots such that the only structure is a notion of equality. Given a set $X$, which consists of elements $x,y\in X$, all we can say is if $x=y$, or not. In particular, the notion of homomorphism between this sort of structure is a function, which is defined so as to preserve the equality structure: if $x=y$, then $f(x) = f(y)$. Also, I refute the assertion that sets a priori form a graph, since we can define the category of sets from scratch using first-order reasoning (e.g. with ETCS, or SEAR if you want the stronger of the ZF(C) axioms - unnecessary for ordinary, non set-theory mathematics), and they don't come with a graph structure. The notion of set in ZF(C), or more generally a material set theory is actually not the minimal possible structure, as it is essentially that of a transitive well-founded graph (by results of Mostowski etc). Note then that the homomorphisms preserving the structure of a transitive well-founded graph are not what you want to think of as maps between minimally structured objects! 

A history of Pythagoras' theorem - from Egypt and Babylon through to the proof, then higher dimensional versions, and then a jump from that to non-Euclidean geometry (surfaces of positive and negative curvature), and then introducing the idea of a metric space, with $\mathbb{R}^2$ as an example. 

You need to have chosen products for every pair of objects using the axiom of choice, otherwise you don't get a product functor, just a product anafunctor and I recommend you don't try to use those just yet. Then you can prove - and this is the key step - that any two bracketings of an iterated product are isomorphic in a unique way when you demand the isomorphism respects the all the projections. The unique such isomorphism for a triple product is then the associator, and the uniqueness of the isomorphism for the 4-fold product means that the pentagon commutes. Ditto with the other coherence conditions. Note that you can choose the product of any object $X$ with the terminal object to be $X$. This makes the unit conditions automatic. 

A quick note, since I can't write a full answer. See the 2005 paper by Everaert, Kieboom, van der Linden. Possibly also my paper on internal categories and anafunctors, which is on the arXiv (to appear in a journal soon). But I don't think this is quite what you want, since they deal with functors which are (analogues of) isomorphisms on hom-sets. I hope though that they can be a springboard or inspiration for you. 

One reason I am interested in this is that McLarty has proved that the machinery of derived functor cohomology, in the setting appropriate for arithmetic geometry, is do-able in $Z_2$ (more precisely, derived functor cohomology over a Noetherian scheme, with coefficients in an arbitrary sheaf of modules on the Zariski site, only requires a system equiconsistent with second-order arithmetic). If one can get from working in $Z_2$ down to $ACA$, then these tools of algebraic geometry are available as soon as one accepts the existence of natural number objects (and, presumably, classical logic). 

The category of schemes has a large (and to me, slightly bewildering) number of what seem like different Grothendieck (pre)topologies. Zariski, ok, I get. Etale, that's alright, I think. Nisnevich? pff, not a chance. There are various ideas about stacks I would like to test out, but the sites I am most familiar with have few application-rich topologies. (Smooth, finite-dimensional manifolds are particularly boring in this respect, and topological spaces are not much better) What I'm after is a table listing the well-known/common topologies on $Sch$ and their relative 'fineness'. Or, if you like, containment. We of course have the canonical topology - is there a characterisation of that in terms of schematic properties, as opposed to the obvious categorical definition? And furthermore, one expects that for nice schemes, various topologies will coalesce, say one sort of covers becoming cofinal in another, when restricted to a subcategory of $Sch$. Say those schemes which are Noetherian, smooth or even just varieties. Then there are things like when categories of sheaves, or 2-categories of stacks, are equivalent. But maybe this is asking too much. Maybe I'm after something like 'Counterexamples in Grothendieck topologies'. Does such a thing exist, all in one place? I'm sure it is all there in SGA, or the stacks project, or in Vakil's Foundations of Algebraic Geometry, but I'm after the distilled essence. PS I am interested in things which are (pre)topologies even if they are not usually used as such for the purposes of sheaves.
