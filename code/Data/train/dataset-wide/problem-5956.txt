So then, as a single statement: I must act in kindness toward all people but when placed in a situation where I must choose between showing kindness to two parties I will show kindness to that more similar to me. I believe that captures rule relativity without stating it explicitly. As a broader statement: 

Now, that's pretty imprecise. Humans are animals, and there's only a differentiation from aliens in science fiction. You'd probably lose the debate, but it is possible to argue that the "human" term could include any form of life with reason and conscience (in fact, you could even argue so on basis on the Declaration). If we encountered non-human sentient life tomorrow, I would argue for its protection on this basis. ================================================================================== Lost human tribe? I'm more optimistic about this. People love things like themselves, and we'd all at least be within the same Genus (right, we're in the same Genus at least?). Especially as human and Homo sound somewhat similar, I'm sure many would be fine calling them humans. I hope that's reasonable. In terms of actual ethics, well, you see what I think about respect in my generalization. I believe we would absolutely be bound to treat them (as anything else) with the utmost respect. In accordance with the Declaration, I believe we would as well. However, these are not ironclad truths descending directly from the wording of the declaration, so your mileage may vary. ================================================================================== I think if we formulate the question as "Oh I can treat x in any way I want with no moral implications, right?" we have a fairly straightforward philosophical answer. The Declaration is a subset of this answer when x is taken to be consensus reality's definition of humans. That reduces this to a question of consensus reality, which starts to drift into theoretical sociology, so I'm fairly comfortable taking the question this far and no further. 

Google does have a separate philosophy definition for data which I didn't find meaningful different, again, it simply adopts language used more often within philosophical paradigm. I introduced the model of TM because it is helpful considerations of information theory (which I would consider this to be). I'll depart from the notation of facts/statistics and just refer to these as bitstrings for that reason. So then, provisional definitions for discussion: 

Let's take the set of everything. A member of the set of everything has an attribute on a state transition diagram: 

In that case, if you expect to be respected, you should be sure to take steps to earn respect yourself. Warning, this is going to get wordy: The best way to earn to respect is to show respect, so if you want respect you have to respect those that you want to respect you that they might earn your own respect to fulfill the objectives of showing respect. If they are still failing to earn your respect, then I'd exercise caution but still at least outwardly show signs of respect, because one of the partners in a mutually respectful relationships must be the first to show respect if showing respect is a pre-requisite for earning respect. Maybe I'll come back and edit the wordiness on this down after I've had some time to break it down a bit, but for now I would just encourage you to try to treat all others with respect at all times as this should be aligned with your own best interests. ================================================================================== Okay I slept on it and think I may have a better wording here. I'll leave the old one in case that is easier for some people. Problem: Four related conditions as follows. 

Happiness of others is important within the possibility to do so. Being nice is important if mutual. The value of life is a function of its genetic similarity to myself. Happiness of myself must be earned. Advocacy for and acceptance of justice is important. Lying is undesirable but may be made necessary. 

You are, in me belief, under no obligation to make anyone happy, but are under an obligation to treat everyone with love and respect such as can be done with equal consideration for all. For example, respect is essential but preventing someone from committing a crime, while a restriction on freedom of the individual, is also respectful to all people and that individual as crime (against this law rather than political law) is against enlightened self-interest. It is entirely possible to be nice while standing up for yourself or others. That would make you a murderer whom you have just admitted you don't afford protections on the right to life. I believe under equal consideration you are obligated only to oppose heroically and improve yourself to better defend your family, but your decision to take another's life, to me, is decidedly unjust. You can choose happiness. John Milton: 

Source Why should I not be able to simply say that it's just as likely that the mugger will make a billion people very happy if I don't give him the money, and so choose not to give him the money? Or in the original formation: 

Usually. I wouldn't say it necessarily reflects poor understanding, but I believe in practice it often does. It simply too easy to say "Oh, I've talked to conscious people. My cat never told me he was conscious as far as I can tell, so he probably isn't." There's certainly other arguments for consciousness as an attribute of human minds, but I do believe this is a common trap to fall into. 

Which I formulated as a generalization of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights to govern all actions rather than just Homo sapiens internal interactions. 

(e) is "wrong" because it isn't "right" more than anything else. By a loose kind of response, I believe what is being suggested is that it is sufficiently non-specific that the response is meaningless, as all other possible responses may reasonably be subsumed into (e). (d) is "wrong" because it would serve no legitimate rhetorical purpose if the passage were examined more closely as the intricacies of the quotes seem to suggest. So, under closer scrutiny, it is pointless. Honestly, I would only say (c) is wrong. The rest are just not completely right. And I'm certainly not that impressed with the reasoning behind (a) as being the sole right answer here. But that's just social commentary at this point. ================================================================================== To me, this question is obviously attempting to measure adherence to a particular brand of thinking, however, I don't that any reasonable argument could be constructed that the brand of thinking espoused here is necessarily correct or even optimal in the settings which this test serves as entry requirement into. All offer different and diverse backgrounds as well as different bias/decisiveness trade-offs. It is not my personal understanding from the question that any indication has been given that values decisiveness over being unbiased, and for the reason I believe (e) is actually the most correct answer, as it involves the usage of bias and is most clearly supported by the evidence. I would actually say (c) is the weakest as there is little support for quotations, but there is not actual evidence to the contrary. For example, the author could be quoting someone else saying them and using these quotations as a change of voice. I believe this is the original reason quotes began being used for emphasis. After that, I would believe that (a) is least correct as, while it has some manner of support, imposes a specific viewpoint on the author's perspective that necessarily lacks certainty. While informative, it has some chance of being a misinterpretation and, if a misinterpretation, would be vastly more harmful to understanding than any other. Next we have (b), which is similar to (a) but doesn't claim the false authority of understanding the author. Otherwise, it is wrong for the same reason. I view (d) and (e) as equivalent but prefer (d) because of it's active voice. To me, while still imperfect, these are both the most correct answers.
