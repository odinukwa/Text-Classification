This is a response to the last comment, but I don´t know how else to post it (too long). The above explains well what happens over algebraically closed fields. Pulling back hyperplanes gives a a unique divisor class dH, hence d, which it seems will not change under field extension (see below for a detail). This is the sort of divisor theory I am trying to unlearn, which led to my posts, and reading Liu´s book would be one of the best ways to proceed. I hope he won´t mind some statements about what goes wrong with divisors over arbitrary fields, which is presumably one more reason (after base change) why the sheaf approach is so prevalent. With $\phi$ and the $h_i$ as before, look at the zero set of a $k$-linear combination of the $h_i$, or of an irreducible factor of it. Is it defined by a single equation? Think for example of sections that are elliptic curves, restricted to small fields $k$. How then would we define $d$ over $k$? What happens when the field is extended? Supposing a sufficiently nice situation so that such problems can be ignored, when the field is extended the section still gives the class dH, but there is still the strange question about whether $d$ could decrease, which would happen only if the $n+1$ equations used to define the base locus (a possibly empty set) define over $K$ a variety of codimension 1. This is ruled out by the almost trivial (4), or via more sophisticated ideas about dimension such as heights of prime ideas, as in Liu´s book, or transcendence degrees. (4) does in fact have something to do with divisors, so perhaps I should write more than in my original post (not having seen this anywhere). If we think of divisors on projective space via homogeneous rational functions rather than hypersurfaces, not worrying about geometry nor 0-gradings to get partial functions, it always makes sense to extend from k to K and say what is meant for a divisor over $K$ to be $k$-rational. Given $\phi$, we can only work directly with functions of quotients $h_i/h_j$, and can in the usual way define the least divisor $D = D_\phi$ such that $\phi$ factors through $\mathcal L(D)$, then ask whether this $D$ could change under field extension. The fact that is does not is just a translation of (4). In other words, if a rational map $\phi$ between projective spaces over $K$ is definable over a subfield $k$, the same is true of $D_\phi$. This divisor turns out to be the least common multiple of the $h_i$, assuming the gcd of these is 1. No doubt all this is well-known, but what references are there? 

A good reference for all of this is Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra the 2nd Edition by Stanley. First note that a Cohen-Macaulay complex must be pure and also that a shellable complex must be pure. On page 87 of Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra the 2nd Edition Stanley defines sequentially Cohen-Macaulay complexes as a nonpure generalization of Cohen-Macaulay to fit the extension of shellability to nonpure complexes by Bjorner and Wachs found in Shellable Nonpure Complexes and Posets I and II. 

This is fairly recent (2009). A look at the papers which cite the above shows the following paper with some further results. 

In his thesis Ira Gessel provides a method which gives a combinatorial interpretation of the inverse of a counting series of a linked set. A counting series is a generalization of a generating function. Some applications on the technique in the thesis are to things like symmetric functions and formal power series in countably many variables. For the single variable case, see Theorem 4.5 on page 45 which computes the inverse of a single variable generating function for some lattice paths. I will breifly summarize and give some simple examples below to make this answer a little more self-contained. Let $P$ be a set and $S \subseteq P^*$ be a subset of the free monoid (we actually want $S$ be a linear system which is defined in the thesis). For any $V \subseteq S$ we define its conuting series to be $\Gamma(V) = \sum_{\alpha \in V} \alpha$ which is a formal sum. We also define the alternating counting series $\bar{\Gamma}(V) = \sum_{\alpha \in V} (-1)^{r(\alpha)} \alpha$ where $r(\alpha)$ is the number of prime factors in $\alpha$ (i.e. length of the word). For any $\alpha = a_1a_2 \cdots a_n$ the links of $\alpha$ are $a_i a_{i+1}$. Take some set a links $L \subseteq P^2$ and define $C$ to be the set of $\alpha \in S$ such that all links of $\alpha$ are in $L$. Also let $\bar{C}$ be the set of $\alpha \in S$ such that all links of $\alpha$ are not in $L$. On page 37 we have Theorem 4.1 (The Inversion Theorem) we states $\Gamma(C) \bar{\Gamma}(\bar{C}) = 1$. Now let's use this for some single variable generating functions. For a trivial example let $S = P^*$ where $P$ is a set of size $k$. Then let $L = P^2$. In this case $\Gamma(C) = \sum_{w \in P^*} w$ is the sum of all $k$-ary words and $\bar{\Gamma}(\bar{C}) = 1 - \sum_{a \in P} a$. If we subsitute $a = x$ for all $a \in P$ we get the $\Gamma(C)$ becomes $\sum_{n \geq 0} k^n x^n$ and $\bar{\Gamma}({\bar{C}})$ becomes $1 - kx$. For a less trivial example let $S = P^* = \{a,b\}^*$ and let $L = \{aa,ab,ba\}$. Then $\Gamma(C)$ is the sum of all binary words which have no consecutive $b$'s and $\bar{\Gamma}(\bar{C}) = 1 - a - b + b^2 - b^3 + \cdots$. Again substituting $a = b = x$ we have $$1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 5x^3 + \cdots = \frac{1}{1 - 2x + x^2 - x^3 + \cdots}$$ the inverse of an "almost" Fibonacci generating function. 

Sorry for my comment based on thinking of Weil divisors only in terms of closed points, something I have still not completely unlearned. In the Weil divisor approach one runs naturally into (4) but it can be avoided at the cost of doing something a little deeper (see earlier remark about a strange question). There are no real mathematical issues, just a matter of taste about how to proceed. To illustrate, suppose homogeneous polynomials $g_i$ of the same degree represent $\phi: P^n_k \to Y \subset P^m_k$, with $Y$ not in a hyperplane. Then $y_0$ on $P^m_k$ induces an effective Weil divisor on $P^n_k$. This is basically a polynomial, up to scalars. Is it $g_0$? In general, NO! It is $g_0/g$ that will give $d$, where $g$ is the gcd of the g_i. Under field extension does the gcd remain the same or can $d$ decrease? This is just (4). Of course (4) is no more than an easy exercise with polynomials and fields, based on adjoining an element that is either transcendent, separable, or (say) a $p^{\text th}$ root. There are several slightly deeper prooofs, including a slick one by flatness. What I find astonishing is that despite its relevance it seems to have gone unnoticed. While still searching in many likely places, I have so far found NOTHING. As a more didactic point, via (4) one needs little machinery to obtain a result on the field-independence of factoring rational maps on $P^n_k$ through Veronese embeddings, and to see that if a rational map is defined over $k$, so is its associated divisor. This does not come close to Chow´s result that there is a well-defined smallest field of definition of a divisor, which may be properly contained in $k$. Presumaby there are now more modern approaches than the original via Chow coordinates. I would like to close by thanking Prof. Qing Liu for taking the time to help clarify the ideas involved. 

Yes, the chromatic number of a Hasse diagram can be arbitrarily large. Bollobás shows in the following article that for any $k$ there exists a finite lattice whose Hasse diagram is not $k$-colorable. 

In ScrewBox: a Randomized Certifying Graph-Non-Isomorphism Algorithm by Kutz and Schweitzer it is stated that "It is generally accepted that the incidence graphs of finite projective planes confront graph isomorphism algorithms with great challenges." Also the PhD Thesis of Schweitzer discusses difficult graphs (including incidence graph of projective planes) in section 2.8. I do not know any repository of adjacencies of these graph, but Moorhouse has data online for known projective planes of order 27 online. Also the paper of Kutz and Schweitzer as well as the thesis of Schweitzer both cite data that Royle has on projective planes on order 16 but that link seems to broken for me right now. 

If I understand correctly the result you want is the corollary at the end of section 3.1 of the Brion article you mention which states $$R_{\Sigma} / M R_{\Sigma} \cong A^*(X).$$ Notice in section 1.3 of the Brion article at the bottom of page 28 it states $R_{\Sigma}$ is isomorphic to the Stanley-Reisner algebra when $\Sigma$ is a simplicial fan. Also in section 1.4 on page 29 we see that $M R_{\Sigma}$ denotes the ideal generated by linear forms, which is the $J$ in the question. 

A hypo-matching graph cannot exist. Assume $G$ does not contain a perfect matching, but $G - \{u,v\}$ does. This means $uv$ is not an edge is $G$ or else $G$ has a perfect matching. This cannot hold for an arbitrary pair of vertices since that would force $G$ to be edgeless. A hyper-matching graph definitely exists. Just consider the complete graph on $2n$ vertices. 

Thanks for the quick reply! (1) was too easy; I should have thought more. Also my remarks about divisors were not properly stated. The main point, which with great respect I don't believe has been answered correctly, is that the degree of rational maps between projective spaces, as defined in my post and used in some articles (others call it order, another overworked name) does not seem to fall out so easily from sheaf theory as may be widely believed. When extending $\phi^{*}\mathcal O_{P^n}(1)$ to the base locus $B$, it seems to me from a detailed working out presented below that the stalks above $B$ of the Module vanish, and I do not see how extending or pulling back any kind of divisors could suggest a different conclusion. Start with a dominant rational map $\phi : X \dashrightarrow Y$, where $X=P^n_k$ and $Y$ is a closed subvariety of $P^n_k$, with notation like $y_i=h_i(x)$, where the $h_i$ are homogeneous polynomials of degree d in the $x_j$ that define $\phi$. Suppose that, over $k$, the $h_i$ have no common factor. The aim (admittedly artificial, in view of the almost trivial (4) of my note) is to use sheaf theory to determine this $d$ from $\phi$ alone, and especially to see that it cannot decrease if the field is extended. Only quotients of degree 0 are directly encountered. For example, working locally, say with stalks, there is a (coordinate-based) definition of each module of $\mathcal O_Y(1)$ in terms of globally defined generators that (to emphasize their abstract nature) will be called $g_0, .. , g_n$ rather than, say, $y_0, \dots, y_n$. The relations are those of the form $g_i = y_i/y_j . g_j$ that make sense ($y_j \neq 0$ at that point in $Y$). After applying $\phi^*$, the module above a point $x \in X$ can be obtained by extending the scalars (tensoring) from one local ring to another, in effect keeping the same generators $g_i$ and the same relations $g_i = h_i/h_j . g_j$, now regarding k(Y) as a subfield of k(X). The induced sheaf on $X$ is isomorphic to a subModule of $\mathcal O_X(d)$, where $g_i$ maps to the element usually identified with the polynomial $h_i$. Less clear if we refuse to use (4) is that, even after extending the field, no smaller $d$ will work, but let's continue. Each abstract $g_i$ gives a global section that vanishes on the zero set of $h_i$ since it vanishes whenever $h_i = 0$ but some $h_j \neq 0$. Thus, above any point in the base locus $B$ the module is 0, so the sheaf is not invertible if base points exist. There no longer seems to be an obvious way to proceed with these ideas. To conclude, I believe (4) is essential for defining the degree of rational maps, and I am astonished not to have found any source mentioning something so basic. It is too elementary to merit a proof via algebraic geometry, which when given in detail would I believe involve working with a polynomial ideal (the variety may be empty), and studying quotients by prime ideals above this ideal to look at transcendence degrees of function fields. I will post in other places, say forums on commutative algebra, to try to track down good references to (4).
