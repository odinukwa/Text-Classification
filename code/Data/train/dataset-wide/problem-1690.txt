Many comets are such lucky ones... That's why we see them with their icy tails evaporating: They have only recently been scattered into the inner solar system. Just like the well-studied comet 67P, you could ask "where has 67P been for all those billion years?". For at least this comet, we know the answer: It has been orbiting in the outer solar system, until a close encounter in 1840 and a few subsequent later ones with Jupiter brought its' perihelion closer to the sun, where it started its' cometary activity. I would place my bet on the origin of those comets being in the outer solar system, because: 

Remember that in a protoplanetary disc the rotation velocity $v_r$, which is keplerian, as a distance of star r varies like $$v_r(r) = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} ~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~ (1)$$ This should serve to illustrate part of the point: at any $r<r_0$ we have $v_r>v_r(r_0)$ and the other way around. Thus viewed from the planet's position gas and dust 'left' of it is systematically flowing faster, and 'right' of it systematically flowing slower than the planet. Thus, if you would accrete a substantial fraction of your total, final mass and thus angular momentum from this flow, you'd induce a systematic spin automatically. But when is this relevant? The region from which a protoplanet or asteroid can accrete is maximally its gravitational sphere of influence, also Hill-sphere with radius $$r_H = r_0 \sqrt[3]{\frac{m_{planet}}{3 m_{star}}} ~~~~~~~~~(2) $$ where $r_0$ as above, is a semi-major axis distance. Now if this $r_H$ is too small to feel the velocity-gradients in (1), or said differently, if the accreting object is not massive enough for $r_H$ to extend significantly into the protostellar disc, then accretion will accumulate random momenta. If the protoplanet manages to grow to a substantial Hill-sphere, it starts accreting gas and solids with a huge velocity difference $v_r(r)-v_r(r_0)$, which is always systematic, instead of random. TL;DR Small objects, roughly below the size of asteroids, accrete random momenta pushes. Massive objects, protoplanetary and above, accrete systematic velocity differences, thus giving them a net angular momentum. 

There's not going to be any surface features. First of all, let's assume you could look through a thick soup of metallic hydrogen. This material has densities starting at that of water, going to the densities of solid rock and even above, while still remaining liquid. On a sidenote: No space probe will ever be able to look into that mess. Only gravitational measurments will help. In recent years, it has been shown that under such conditions typical minerals are thermodynamically not stable, and thus will dissolve into the hydrogen-helium mix. Thus, the core will not have any well-defined boundary, but it's going to look more like the following sketch (emphasis on sketch!): 

See also here for more information This graphic depicts the binary distance, approximate size of the accretion disc, and size of the companion star. The companion stars are very huge, because they reached their red giant stage, not because they have some other anomalous properties. This stage is a normal ending of a star's life, just like what our sun will experience. Just in this case there's this black hole in the vicinity that has quite strong tides, which are able to strip away parts of the evolved star's outer shell. This graphic is a few years old now, so I'm not sure what the recent state of affairs concerning the total number of those objects is. Also there are many more unconfirmed BH binary candidates amongst the X-ray binary population, and I don't even know anything about BH-exotic things pairings. But maybe someone else can comment on that. 

Apart from the field-theoretical standpoint presented by Stan, one can repel objects in a sense, when taking orbital mechanics into account. The slingshot maneuver extracts angular momentum and energy of an orbiting mass by the use of gravity. The trick here is that the probe's velocity just gets redirected in the planet's reference frame. But this results in an acceleration in the solar rest-frame that the probe essentially tries to leave. As you were asking about curvature, I don't know how and if centrifugal potentials that play a role here are described by general relativity. 

Concluding: It is important to debias the data we have about exoplanets by method. When doing this, we get rough ideas about how the true planetary populations look like. Recent results and non-stop public announcments about "hundreds of newly found planets" can lead to a certain, totally understandable euphoria that we now know everything about planets. This is however very far from true. The Number distribution in full mass-radius-semimajor axis space is still very, very thinly spread. So in the end we do low-number statistics when debiasing, which is scientifically simply unsatisfying. Or said differently: There is still a lot of exciting work to be done! 

I would like to be able to make a statement such as "Dust" or "Haze-controlled" energetics for the stratosphere of Titan, if this is so. It would be nice if you helped to clear this up. 

Instead of reading half-comprehensible newspaper articles, I found it more helpful to go to the original source. There, the authors explain their method very clearly: 

In observational astronomy, when we look at an object at a distance $d$ and it has a certain angular size $a$, thanx to the use of the century old parsec we know the objects size $s$ in AU. How does this work? When you make the image of an object, you always know $a$. This is simply the apparent size on the celestial sphere in arcseconds. Nowadays we also know the distance to objects. So by use of the fundamental relation "angle = size / distance", we always can have $s(AU) = a(arcseconds) * d(pc)$. This way any astronomer can quickly convert the apparent angular size into physical size and immediately tell about the dimensions of his object! To check this method, we can know that the HL Tau is 450Lj away, which is 140pc and if you now look at the scale given in the image, this will be vagely familiar ;) 

Buoyancy, following Archimedes' law, depends on the volume the body and the density of displaced material. The force is $$ F_{buoy} = \rho_{gas} \cdot V_{body}\cdot g$$ which has to act against the bodies' own weight $F_{weight} = -m_{body} \cdot g$. Here $\rho$ is density, $V$ is Volume, $g$ the local gravity. If you're referring to this video, then the aerogel that was created in the 1980's is essentially a high-tech balloon. There are a few points that need discussion here. 1. Balloons the size of continents don't occur naturally anywhere. I think we can take this as given. 2. The filling gas acts to decrease $F_{weight}$ and its pressure must be enough to hold up the body volume. Else the body will collapse and the buoyancy decreases to zero. A floating continent would need some appropriate filling gas in large quantities, that has lower density than the gas giant atmosphere. Impossible is a strong word, but this seems very impossible to me. Also for the continent then be able to uphold its structure under its own weight would be very difficult. 3. Particles either float or experience drag. If they float, they're coupled to the gas flows. Once they would grow larger, they start experiencing gas drag. When this happens, they loose their momentum and are dragged down into the depths of the planet. They then will contribute to the structure of the deep planet, but are lost to any continent-building process. So even if your floating continents seem impossible, I think is not a stupid question at all. I might just throw this on our students and test their understanding of buoyancy! 

Where the photosphere lies is not only a function of density $\rho$, but also of opacities $\kappa$. One will find it at a particular wavelength wherever the integral optical depth integral $\tau = \int \rho \; \kappa \; dz$ along the line of sight $z$ becomes one. As the opacities are a strong function of the composition of the atmosphere, it is insufficient to just take gravity and temperature and try to predict the location of the photosphere. 

Looking for transit timing variations of known, and seen transiting systems. That means they had the system Kepler 52, with transiting planets K52b,c . K52b because it transits way more often than c has a well-determined period (Period with small errors!) and because of that any deviation in expected future transit time could be attributed to the \textbf{maximum masses} of K52c. The more massive and the more compact a system is, the quicker it will destabilize. This fact is often used in reverse, to take the system age and at given distances derive maximum masses below which the system must lie, or else it would have already flown apart. 

This is unfortunately not true. If you already look at our solar system, even this is not co-planar. The few degrees inclination that the planets have to each other would already be enough to make some of them undetectable, when others are detectable by transits. The answer to your question therefore is not so much about the transit probability, but more about what the mutual inclinations are of the planets. Those can be stirred up by close-planet encounters or resonances after the gas disc dissipates in which the planets form. 

One second of googling reveals the whole archive: $URL$ (note you can click onto the strips to inspect them!) The archive depicts the whole decent of the Huygens lander onto Titan, with the first picture being on the ground, and some of them seem to be taken from higher up altitudes, pages 17-27 you can see the flow deltas) The three pictures per strip show the views of the three cameras into different directions. However the location on the planet doesn't change, just the viewing angle around the spacecraft upon descent. This is because Huygens was a lander without any additional propulsion, as it was already considered to be a massive feat if the lander would make it to the surface at all. Also a propulsion system would have been more expensive, and more or less useless, as the expected lifetime of the lander in Titan's atmosphere was a few hours, which happened to be true. So summa summarum, from the final position in which the lander was fixed, yes this is the only picture of Titan's surface. 

Well, they don't. You can only disprove that it's aliens. All remaining signals that are leftover after natural signals are substracted are simply of unknown origin. Then, depending how hard a particular scientist or journalist wants to sell out, he or she declares 'maybe aliens' are found. But it's not like we will ever be able to prove such a thing, unless we really get some crazy stuff like the Fibonacci sequence sent to us. The same is true for photometric signals and the recent unscientific popular discussion about Tabby's star. 

I don't think such an intermediate state exists for very long. Once you shred the moon, it's shredded and the particles orbit on locally Keplerian orbits. This would look like Saturns rings, which are also well inside the planet's Roche limit. The intermediate state you propose to name would have to form either a) a steaty state of in some dynamic variable or b) have a sufficiently long lifetime (which would be your job to prove) in order to earn its own name. 

The Chelyabinsk meteor didn't explode. In fact meteors in general usually don't explode, this is a common misconception. When an object at orbital speeds ($\sim11 km/s$) enters the atmosphere, this speed corresponds to extremely high mach-numbers (M$\sim 30$). This generates a strong shock-front in front of the meteor which causes the meteor to heat up enourmously. To give a feeling of how important this heat-up is, you can look up on Wikipedia that already at Mach-numbers of 2-3 there are severe engineering problems in not letting aircraft overheat. At Mach-numbers of 30, the air in the shock is so hot that it locally ionizes the air and easily evaporates the solids away from the falling meteor. Upon reaching the ground one hears this shock as loud thunder. The other thing that happened with the Chelyabinsk meteor is that it broke up in mid-flight. This caused the total solid surface of the meteor that is exposed to the shock to momentarily increase strongly. More surface exposure to the heat causes more surface to glow. This lasts until the smaller fragments that resulted from the breakup evaporate themselves. Taken together, the mach-shock and the increase in glowing surface area upon break-up give the impression of an "explosion". Also for an explosion a reservoir of energy would need to be suddenly tapped, which is just not there. 

In this article, they collected previous measurments of the planetary positions in HR8799, added some of their own and fitted this data with Kepler ellipses. The existence of those orbits additionally constrains the masses a little bit (they only know for all $m_p < 13 m_{jupiter}$), so that's not too much of a constraint) as the system would have already destabilized itself after the age of $\sim 30 Myr$ if they were higher. Later destabilization is of course still possible. Measurments of this type rely on very precise astrometry, which is the determinaton of an object's position. This may sound easier to do than it actually is. In the above figure the error bars of each measurment used are also given, and to suppress them to small values and at the same time make them accurate is the challenge here. One can see that the errors are of the order of 10 milliarcseconds. From the ground this precision is at the moment at the limit of what we can do, better will only Gaia be with errors down to 10-100 microarcseconds. But Gaia doesn't have the angular resolution for such systems which has slightly worse than 0.1 arcseconds angular resolution .
