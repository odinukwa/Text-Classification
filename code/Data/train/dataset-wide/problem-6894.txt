So, basically, you need to find a period in which both series have an entry, compute the ratio between them, and then transform the old series using the ratio just calculated. This is how you link two series in different base years. Remarks: you will have several months in which the series have values. If you have reasons to believe that the newest series is better, then I would make sense to take the earliest month in which the two have data (probably January of 2005). Nonetheless, the two series might be in fact different (e.g. sector composition or definitions vary). Compare the rate of monthly growth of both indexes for the months in which both have data (probably January 2005 to Feb 2011). Are they very different? If so, you might try to adjust the old series. Perhaps, there is a persistent difference, which you can account for when expanding the newest series backwards. See more in this document. 

There is some opposition to this policy though. On the one hand, some say it reduces bank lending. On the other hand, as the graph show, the official forecast for the interest paid on these reserves is likely to increase considerably in the coming years, mainly because the Fed is now increasing the interest rate. Politically, this is a hard-seller, albeit Trump might not be very worried about this. Who knows. 

Conclusion Canada is quite a progressive country in terms of taxation, redistribution quite a lot, and lowering market inequality considerably. Even more, it seems to be better than the UK in almost every comparison. Source: OECD (2012). 

$$ \hat{S}_{t+h|t} = S_t \left(1+ \Delta s_t \right)^h \quad h>0 $$ where $\Delta s_t$ is the percent growth rate of $S_t$ between $t-1$ and $t$ 

The textbook is correct (provided the assumptions behind "competitive market" and other implicit ones hold). First, assume the distribution of wealth is given. Then, based on their budget constraint, consumers will have a certain demand for goods. Firms will compete for such demand, offering the lowest price that earn them an economic profit. In competitive markets, such profits are zero. Resources are allocated such that consumers are maximising their utility at the given prices. The allocation is Pareto Optimal. This result is summarised in the First Welfare Theorem. Second, through some form of lump-sum taxation, we could redistribute wealth in order to change that allocation. A competitive market will make the equilibrium Pareto Optimal too. This is the Second welfare theorem (see link above). So, your intuition that the wealth/income distribution affects prices and the final allocation is correct. But the key to allocative efficiency is in the mechanism (market), not in what is being allocated. I hope I am answering your questions. 

So far you have got no answer to your last question, about Knight and others' view on risk and uncertainty. In fact, there is quite a radical distinction between the view of uncertainty in Knight (and Keynes) and that presented in Oliv's answer. In brief, according to Knight (1921) risk refers to situations where the classification of states, events or alternatives is objective and known, and their probabilities can be objectively determined. For example, in the context of a house insurance policy, events could be "house burns down" or "house doesn't burn down", which probabilities can more or less be asserted objectively, based on house/environment/individual characteristics. Conversely, for Knight uncertainty arises from "the impossibility of exhaustive classification of states" (Langlois and Cosgel 1993, p.459). Thus, regardless of whether probabilities of events are objective or subjective, nature/economy can be so complex that all possible states are simply not known. As such, any categorisation of events used to predict the future is based on intution and judgment, thereby being subjective. This view of uncertainty is shared by Keynes, and it is essential in his theorizing of the "animal spirits". Precisely because the future is unknown - not only in the probability of events but also on the range of events that could happen, expectations in investment decisions is not just a matter of mathematical calculation. As Keynes said, decisions to invest are taken “as a result of animal spirits – of a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities” (Keynes 2008 [1936]: 144, emphasis is mine). Interestingly, the approach highlighted in italics is what Oliv describes in his answer, and the foundation of much of neoclassical investment theory under uncertainty. Among Post-Keynesian circles, this uncertainty is called "radical, fundamental, or ontological uncertainty", in contrast with the neoclassical view of uncertainty described in Oliv's answer, which is sometimes called "epistemological uncertainty". For example, see here. Finally, regarding ambiguity, to my knowledge that concept is not used in the early literature on this matter. 

Subscription In this setting, the expected value of a consumer's surplus obtained by purchasing a subscription is $$ m\bar p -c $$ Individual purchases Here, we assume that you can choose your favorite albums. Hence, for a given population of albums, you will choose the $n$ that give you the most surplus (your favorite artists). For simplicity, I assume you do you know the universe of albums (To add more complexity, you could instead assume you know a section of it, and hence a subscription could surprise you. I leave this example to you.) The surplus from buying the best $n$ albums (subset denoted $\Theta$) is $$ \sum_{i \in \Theta} (\hat p + \epsilon_i - t) $$ where $\epsilon_i$ is the value above $\bar p$ of the $i$-th album you choose to buy. The above is equal to: $$ n(\hat p - t) + \sum_{i \in \Theta}\epsilon_i $$ Hence, the valuation hinges on this comparison: $$ m\bar p -c \text{ vs } n(\hat p - t) + \sum_{i \in \Theta}\epsilon_i $$ Analysis Since you chose the best albums, $\sum_{i \in \Theta}\epsilon_i $ is large. However, these albums are also included in the subscription. Hence, define the non-negative function $X$ as the combined value of all the albums in the subscription that you would not buy outside of it. This is: $$ X = (m - n)\bar p - \sum_{i \in \Theta}\epsilon_i $$ Notice that $\lim_{n \rightarrow m} X = 0$. The comparison is now: $$ X \text{ vs } c - nt $$ Thus, you prefer the subscription when: 

Some argue that deflation was actually a factor contributing towards the great fall in GDP, because the Fed did not act soon enough, keeping the money supply low. The Gold Standard is partly to blame for this inaction of the Fed. Inflationary recession is when a recession is accompanied with increasing prices. It is commonly known in Macroeconomics as Stagflation. That was the case on the 1973-1975 recession in the US. The graph below shows the yearly rate of change in CPI (again, shaded area represents a recession):
