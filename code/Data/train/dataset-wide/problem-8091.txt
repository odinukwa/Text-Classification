It seems to me that this is not the case, since every differential operator in $\mathrm{Diff}(E,F)$ will be locally of finite order, whereas a differential operator of infinite order defined as a map out of $J^\infty(E) \to F$ might not be of finite order locally (as far as I can tell; I don't know any infinite-dimensional manifold theory). For instance, on a compact smooth manifold, by construction $\mathrm{Diff}(E,F)$ should just consist of finite-dimensional operators. If indeed my suspicion is right, that leads me to my second question: 

Are D-modules a useful notion in the smooth manifold setting? If so, is there a good reference that discusses D-modules in the smooth manifold setting? Is the theory of D-modules useful for studying flat real vector bundles and their corresponding local systems on smooth manifolds? 

I had a look in Ramanan's Global Calculus, and sure enough he gives the necessary details: Let $\mathbb{R}_M$ denote the constant sheaf corresponding to $\mathbb{R}$ on $M$. Note that $\Omega^k_M\otimes_{\mathbb{R}_M} \mathcal{L} = \Omega^k_M\otimes_{\Omega^0_M} \mathcal{E},$ and hence the connection is recovered from the exterior derivative by the formula: $$\nabla = d \otimes_{\mathbb{R}_M} 1: \mathcal{E} \to \Omega^1_M \otimes_{\Omega^0_M} \mathcal{E}.$$ So in particular, tensoring the de Rham resolution of $\mathbb{R}_M$ with $\mathcal{L}$ recovers the twisted de Rham resolution of $\mathcal{L}$. With regards to the resolution of $i^{-1} \mathcal{L}$ on $Z$, note that we have the following canonical isomorphisms: \begin{align} \Omega^k_Z \otimes_{\Omega^0_Z} i^* \mathcal{E} &= \Omega^k_Z \otimes_{\Omega^0_Z} (\Omega^0_Z \otimes_{i^{-1}\Omega^0_M} i^{-1} \mathcal{E}) \\ &\cong \Omega^k_Z \otimes_{i^{-1}\Omega^0_M} i^{-1} \mathcal{E} \\ &\cong \Omega^k_Z \otimes_{i^{-1}\Omega^0_M} i^{-1} (\Omega^0_M\otimes_{\mathbb{R}_M} \mathcal{L}) \\ &\cong \Omega^k_Z \otimes_{i^{-1}\Omega^0_M} i^{-1}\Omega^0_M \otimes_{\mathbb{R}_Z} i^{-1} \mathcal{L} \\ &\cong\Omega^k_Z \otimes_{\mathbb{R}_Z} i^{-1} \mathcal{L}. \end{align} Hence, tensoring the de Rham resolution of $\mathbb{R}_Z$ with $i^{-1} \mathcal{L}$ gives the usual de Rham resolution of $i^{-1} \mathcal{L}$, and this computes the twisted de Rham cohomology on $Z$. The same idea works to get the resolution of $j^{-1} \mathcal{L}$ on $M \setminus Z$. Then, applying the "extension by zero" functor $j_!$, we get a resolution for $j_!j^{-1} \mathcal{L}$, which computes the relative twisted de Rham cohomology. 

Let $G$ be an infinite countable p-group. Is it true that $G\otimes G$ or $G\wedge G$ are also p-groups? (where G acts on itself by conjugation). For simplicity, you can consider that $G=[G,G]$, and then the above groups are isomorphic to the Universal Schur Cover. I am very frustrated, because a lot of websites and papers say yes, but no one writes a clear proof (and I doubt the answer is yes). And some actually impose conditions, like G is locally finite. But I am interested in general. It might be because for some people, p-group means automatically finite? For example: $URL$ Going to the reference, Ellis' paper: $URL$ we see that the theorem says yes. But he actually sends the reader to R. BROWN AND J.-L. LODAY, Van Kampen theorems for diagrams of spaces. $URL$ At page 316 they just say it is true, but I have no clue why it would be for infinite groups. Also, the article $URL$ states at page 348, paragraph 2 that this is true, and sends the reader to some other papers. None of them look like actually do the general case: infinite countable p-groups G. Can someone clarify this to me, with a proof or a counterexample? 

Given a map $f: S \to M$ of smooth manifolds, Bott & Tu define on page 78 a complex by $\Omega^q(f)=\Omega^q(M) \oplus \Omega^{q-1}(S)$ and $d(\omega, \theta)=(d\omega, f^*\omega - d\theta)$ where $f^*\omega$ is the usual pullback of forms, and the $d$'s denote the appropriate exterior derivatives. They then prove that there is a long exact sequence in de Rham cohomology $$\cdots \to H^{q}(f) \xrightarrow{\beta^*} H^{q}(M) \xrightarrow{f^*} H^{q}(S) \xrightarrow{\alpha^*} H^{q+1}(f) \to \cdots$$ where $f^*$ is the usual pullback on forms, $\alpha^*$ is induced by the obvious insertion into the first component $\Omega^q(S) \hookrightarrow \Omega^q(f))$, and $\beta^*$ is induced by the obvious projection $\Omega^q(f) \to \Omega^q(M)$ onto the first component. Moreover, $H^q(f)$ and $H^q(g)$ are isomorphic as algebras if $f$ and $g$ are homotopic maps. In the case where $f: S \to M$ is a submanifold embedding, then this de Rham group $H^q(f)$ is just the usual relative cohomology $H^q(M,S;\mathbb{R})$ 

In Bredon's Sheaf Theory text, he defines a category of all sheaves on all spaces, whose arrows, called cohomomorphisms, are pairs $(\psi, f): \mathscr{F} \to \mathscr{E}$, where $\mathscr{E} \in \mathsf{Sh}(X)$, $\mathscr{F} \in \mathsf{Sh}(Y)$, $f: X \to Y$ is a continuous map, and $\psi: \mathscr{F} \to f_*\mathscr{E}$ is a sheaf homomorphism. These compose in the obvious way. I don't see comorphisms mentioned very often in sheaf theory texts, though they are used as the arrows in the category of ringed spaces. However, we could just as well have defined our arrows to be pairs $(\theta, f): \mathscr{E} \to \mathscr{F}$ where $f: X \to Y$ is a continuous map, and $\theta: \mathscr{E} \to f^* \mathscr{F}$ is a sheaf homomorphism. This choice corresponds to the usual topological or differential-geometric definition of a bundle map, since a vector bundle map $E \to f^*F$ covering the identity on $X$ corresponds to a unique vector bundle map $E \to F$ covering $f:X \to Y$. The only disadvantage of this definition I can obviously see compared to the previous one is that $f^*$ is a left-adjoint, and rarely a right adjoint.

You can determine the possible inflation of $d$-cocycle in $G$ by lifting to a larger group $G$, from the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. For $H/K= G$, with $BG$ path connected and $\pi_1(BG)$ acting trivially on $H^*(K, U(1))$, there is a spectral sequence $\{E^{p,q}_n, d_n\}$ with $E^{p,q}_2 = H^p(G, H^q(K,U(1) ))$. The differential $d_n$: $E^{p,q}_n \to E^{p+n,q-n+1}_n$. And $E^{p,q}_{n+1}=\frac{\text{Ker} d_n}{\text{Im} d_n}$ at $E^{p,q}_{n}$. We shall focus on the $d_2$ differential of $E_2$ page in LHS spectral sequence $$d_2: E^{p,q}_2 \to E^{p+2,q-1}_2$$ $$\Rightarrow d_2: H^p(Q, H^q(N,U(1) )) \to H^{p+2}(Q, H^{q-1}(N,U(1) )), $$ $$ d_2: H^{d-2}(Q, H^{1}(N,U(1) )) \to H^{d}(Q, H^{0}(N,U(1) ))=H^{d}(Q, U(1)). $$ If we want to trivialize the $d$-cocycle $\omega_d \in H^{d}(Q, U(1))$, we can look for a larger group $G$, where $G/N=Q$ for your $G$. However, all the examples above fail to demonstrate the successful inflation. So the answer to your questions shall be negative. There may be loopholes, but I could not find any examples either. So this is the best conclusion so far. 

The isomorphism between de Rham cohomology and singular cohomology is in a sense just basic homological algebra if you take Iversen's point of view that ordinary cohomology of "reasonable" spaces (spaces homotopic to CW complexes) should be sheaf cohomology. By basic homological algebra, it follows that cohomology can be computed using any acyclic resolution. The assumption that smooth manifolds are paracompact means that smooth partitions of unity exist, and hence the sheaf of smooth functions $\mathcal{O}_M$ is fine, and hence sheaves of $\mathcal{O}_M$-modules (such has vector bundles) are acyclic. The Poincare lemma is precisely the statement that the de Rham complex is a resolution of the constant sheaf $\mathbb{R}$ on $M$. So the existence of an isomorphism is really obvious. The interesting content of de Rham's theorem, for me, isn't the existence of an isomorphism itself, but rather that there is a chain map from k-forms (as opposed to de Rham cohomology classes) to singular cochains given by integration of k-forms over singular k-chains. The proof that this is a chain map is precisely Stoke's theorem for integration over singular chains. 

Question: Given a generic finite abelian group $G=\mathbb{Z}_{N^{(1)}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{N^{(k)}}$. (1) What is the explicit forms of its cohomology group (see my definition) in a generic $n$: $$ H^n(G,R/\mathbb{Z})=H^n(G,U(1)) =? $$ (2) what are their explicit $n$-cocycles? $$ \omega_{}^{}(A_1,A_2,\dots, A_n): (G)^n \to U(1) $$ Please be very explicit in $n=4$ for priority (and the secondary are $n=5$ and $n=2$) of interests. But the generic formulas for any $n$ are the best. Thank you. References are very welcome. ps. below I provide the answer I know for $n=3$. Please feel free providing partial answers for other $n$.

I'm having some fun playing around with string diagrams for monoidal categories, expressing familiar constructions from Riemannian geometry and linear algebra in terms of elegant string diagrams. I've been wondering if there is a nice extension of this diagram calculus to bimonoidal categories (also known as rig categories)? This would allow us to work with direct sums (of bundles, or representations etc.) diagrammatically as well. 

Here's a simple picture for connections on the tangent bundle from Kock's synthetic geometry of manifolds. Let $x$ and $y$ be infinitesimally close points in a manifold, and let $\nabla(x,y)$ denote the parallel transport map which takes the infinitesimal neighbourhood $\mathcal{N}(x)$ of $x$ into the infinitesimal neighbourhood $\mathcal{N}(y)$ of $y$. If we have a third point $z$ which lies in $\mathcal{N}(x)$, then we can transport it along the infinitesimal line segment between $x$ and $y$ to get a point $\nabla(x,y)z$ in $\mathcal{N}(y) \cap \mathcal{N}(z)$. But we could instead transport $y$ along the infinitesimal line segment from $x$ to $z$ to get a potentially different point $\nabla(x,z)y$ in $\mathcal{N}(y) \cap \mathcal{N}(z)$. Thus, we have two different ways to complete the infinitesimal wedge $z \sim x \sim y$ to an infinitesimal parallelogram. Torsion measures the extent to which these two completions differ. 

This will be an ambiguous question. I am interested in various examples that appear in the literature of verbal subgroups of free groups, but which are not part of the "classical examples" like derived subgroups, lower central series, Burnside's verbal subgroup or standard ways of combining the above. The crazier and harder to prove they are verbal, the better. Also, they don't need to be defined in a universal way for all free groups. If you can define them only for the infinitely generated countable free group I would still be happy. If we have two countable groups A and B, then $[A,B]\subset A*B$ is a free group. Can the structure of A and B give rise to some exotic verbal subgroup of $[A,B]$? Can we impose conditions on A and B that will give rise to these verbal subgroups? (I was thinking at A,B-perfect groups, or reduced free groups). 

Two coupled non-linear differential equations in a radial $r$-direction in the region $r \in [0, \infty)$: 

"Modular" in the modular tensor category. (Also the "pre-modular" category.) "Modular" in the modular form. "Modular" in the topological modular form (tmf). "Modular" in the modular invariance (e.g. in Conformal Field Theory). "Moduli space" in algebraic geometry "Moduli space" in Non-supersymetric Quantum Field Theories or gauge theories "Moduli space" in Supersymetric gauge theories "Module" in the "mod" or modular arithmetic. "Modular" in modular representation theory of (finite) groups/algebraic groups. [As André Henriques suggested] "Module": $G$-module in the group (co)homology and topological $G$-module for the topological group. [Likely related to 9.] "Modulus" of convergence and "Modulus" of continuity in analysis. 

We like to ask for the comparison of two topologies of three 2-tori inside the same 4-manifolds glued from two different diffeomorphisms (see the end). Given an embedded torus $T$ with trivial normal bundle in a 4–manifold $X$, a torus surgery on $T$ (also called a logarithmic transform) is the process of removing a neighborhood $\nu T$, which will be denoted as $(X - \nu T)$ and re-gluing $D^2 \times T^2$ by some diffeomorphism $\phi$ of the boundary to attain $$X_T = (X - \nu T) \cup_{\phi} D^2 \times T^2,$$ The cup product is the gluing, and the gluing is under the diffeomorphism $\phi$. We can choose the following manifolds, 

Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold. A projective structure on $M$ is a class $p$ of torsion-free connections on $TM$ which have the same geodesics as unparametrized curves. The bundle of densities of projective weight $w$ is the density bundle $\mathcal{E}(w) \to M$ associated to the (tangent) frame bundle of $TM \to M$ for the representation $g \mapsto |\det(g)|^{\frac{w}{n+1}}$ of $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$ on $\mathbb{R}$. Now the standard projective cotractor bundle is defined to be the jet bundle $$\mathcal{T}^* := J^1 \mathcal{E}(1) \to M.$$ Now from the point of view of Cartan geometry and Klein geometry, the usual flat model for $n$-dimensional projective geometry is the projective sphere (the double cover of projective space) expressed as a homogeneous space $SL(n+1, \mathbb{R})/P$, where $P$ is the stabilizer of the ray through the first standard basis vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In the Cartan geometric picture of projective geometry, the standard projective cotractor bundle is the associated bundle to the Cartan principal $P$-bundle for the contragradient representation $g \mapsto (g^{-1})^*$ of $P$ on ${\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}^*$. Thus, for the projective cotractor bundle $\mathcal{T}^* = J^1\mathcal{E}(1)$ we should be able to write down a Cech cocycle of transition functions with values in $P$. Is there any obvious way to see how to do this? 

Triality is a relationship among three vector spaces. It describes those special features of the Dynkin diagram D4 and the associated Lie group Spin(8), the double cover of 8-dimensional rotation group SO(8). SO(8) is unique among the simple Lie groups in that its Dynkin diagram (below) (D4 under the Dynkin classification) possesses a three-fold symmetry. This gives rise to a surprising feature of Spin(8) known as triality. Related to this is the fact that the two spinor representations, as well as the fundamental vector representation, of Spin(8) are all eight-dimensional (for all other spin groups the spinor representation is either smaller or larger than the vector representation). The triality automorphism of Spin(8) lives in the outer automorphism group of Spin(8) which is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_3$ that permutes these three representations. 

Due to the lack of solutions, I thought it will still be nice to consider a particualr case --- Here are the solutions for the $n=0$ case. Define $U(r) \pm V(r)=U_\pm(r)$, and $\partial_r U_{\pm}\equiv U'_{\pm}$, the $\pm$ linear combinations give $$ -a \partial_r (U'_+(r))+ (B(r) -\frac{a}{r}) (U'_+(r))=0 $$ $$ -a\partial_r (U'_-(r))- (B(r) +\frac{a}{r}) (U'_-(r))=0, $$ Thus $$ U_+(r)= c_+ \int_{0}^r dw \cdot \exp(\frac{1}{a}\int_{0}^w ds (B(s) -\frac{a}{s}) $$ $$ U_-(r)= c_- \int_{0}^r dw \cdot \exp(\frac{-1}{a}\int_{0}^w ds (B(s) +\frac{a}{s}) . $$ In the end, we can plug in to solve. $$ U(r)=\frac{1}{2}( U_+(r)+ U_-(r)) $$ $$ V(r)=\frac{1}{2}( U_+(r)- U_-(r)) $$ As for appropriate boundary conditions, one can choose the values of $c_+$, $c_-$ which are some constants to fit the boundary conditions. Maybe there is a way to deal with the general $n$ from here.
