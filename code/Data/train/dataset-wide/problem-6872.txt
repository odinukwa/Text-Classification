(this is another book that puts intuition first, but now with more formal detail), and for an advanced graduate treatment 

I haven't seen the model you mention (so this answer should be taken with a grain of salt!) but, intuitively, I guess the story would go something like this: Suppose a firm is selling insurance. 

Although the Pigouvian tax implements the efficient level of emissions, its implementation has important normative consequences. In particular, the polluting individual is paying a tax of $d'(e^*)$ for every unit of emission, even though the marginal external cost of the first $e^*$ units is less than this (because $d$ is convex). This implies that the polluter is required to pay more than the cost that he imposes on society, which some might not consider equitable. There is also an awkward inter-temporal dimension to this problem that is not considered in the above static "textbook" treatment. Because damages are non-linear, if I allow $e$ units of pollution "today" then the marginal cost (and hence the optimal level) of emissions "tomorrow" will be different to if I had allowed $e+1$ units today. This seems to suggest that what is really needed (if the solution is, indeed, to be Pigouvian) is a time-varying tax and the problem becomes one of optimal control. That is, rather than calculating a single tax rate, we need to find the time-path $\{e_t^*\}_{t=0}^{\infty}$ that characterises the optimal evolution of emissions and change the tax over time to implement this. This increases the burden on the central authority, which is now required to calculate not only the emissions it wants to allow today, but also the emissions that it anticipates allowing into the indefinite future. This makes the informational problems noted in the question significantly more acute. 

new money is created; it belongs to somebody. that somebody can either save/invest the money, or spend it on consumption. provided at least some of the money is spent on consumption, the demand for consumer goods increases. in a competitive market, this increase in demand results in an increase in the price level. (Note that the sellers are not "willingly rising prices" because, in this simple model of competition, sellers take the price a given natural consequence of the interaction of supply and demand). 

Is anyone able to recommend a textbook that covers the following topics at a level suitable for econ undergraduates? 

I agree that air is not, in any meaningful sense, scarce. But there is no market in air! There is a market in canned air, but that's different because canned air is most definitely scarce. The can is made of metal, which is not in infinite supply. If you use metal to produce a can of air then you must take that metal away from production of, say, airplanes or paperclips. Alternatively, you could just mine more metal. But then you would need to hire more miners, so you are taking workers away from some other industry. Moreover, the can is manufactured by scarce labour. To manufacture the can, you also need machines and tools that are in limited supply abd could be used to make soup cans instead. The machines stand in a building on land that is in scarce supply and could be used for housing or farming. To get the metal to that building, you need scarce trucks, drivers, and fuel. 

Contrast this with something like a monopolist, which can set whatever price it likes and therefore obviously does not take the price as given. A firm in a perfectly competitive market would be said to be a "competitive firm". 

(*) There is also "Game Thoery" by Fudenberg and Tirole, which is less of a textbook and more of a reference. But it is, perhaps, even more rigorous as a result. 

Two goods are net substitutes if, after making this adjustment, we find that the demand for apples has increased. Thus, we say that two produces are net substitutes if 

More generally, the relationship between $e$ and $v$ is one of inverses: $e(p,u)$ tells us the mapping $$\text{target utility}->\text{money spent}$$ while $v(p,w)$ tells us the mapping $$\text{money available}->\text{attainable utility}.$$ So $e$ maps from money to utility and $v$ maps from utility back into money. In words: if we take a given $w$ and feed it into $v$, we will get an answer to the question "what is the most utility I could ever achieve, $\bar{u}$?" Now, if I take that $\bar{u}$ and feed it into the expenditure function I get an answer to the question "what do I have to spend to achieve utility level $\bar{u}$. That answer will be exactly $w$ (so $e$ 'undoes' the transformation applied by $v$, and vice-versa). That's just a long-winded way of saying that you can obtain the expenditure function by inverting $v$ in its second argument, or obtain $v$ by inverting $e$. This is made explicit in equation 3.E.1 of MWG. 

With a low amount of lube, your profit is $(p-c_L)n_L$ (in words: you earn a margin of $p-c_L$ on each unit, and sell $n_L$ units). With a high amount of lube, your profit is $(p-c_H)n_H$. You would like to know when is it true that the higher lube content is more profitable, i.e. $$(p-c_H)n_H\geq(p-c_L)n_L$$ Now, to find the number of units, $n_H$, at which the change results in break even, we can simply solve the inequality: $$n_H\geq\frac{(p-c_L) n_L}{(p-c_H)}$$ 

To complement densep's answer, here is a schematic Edgeworth box illustration of what can go wrong. The points on the dashed line are convex combinations of the Pareto optimal points $(x_1,x_2)$ and $(\hat{x}_1,\hat{x}_2)$, but the marked point is not Pareto optimal. 

Did any recipients of the economics Nobel prize receive their prize for work that was primarily or substantially empirical (rather than theoretical) in nature? 

To answer your question, one needs to know a little economics and a little physics. I only really know anything about the former. That caveat aside, stock market values and GDP are metrics that reflect productive activity. Some vector of inputs $\mathbf{x}$ (n.b. these need not be material resources) are subjected to a production process yielding outputs $f(\mathbf{x})$ (n.b. this output also does not need to be in material consumables). There are two ways to increase economic output (i.e., to achieve economic growth). 

The intuitive criterion rules out equilibrium number 2. Firstly, if type $L$ deviates to getting education then the best payoff he can get is $\pi_H-c_L<\pi_L$ so such a deviation is dominated. Secondly, suppose type $H$ deviates to getting education and the employers adopt some posterior belief $\Pr(H)=1$. The payoff of the deviating $H$-type is then $\pi_H-C_L>\pi_L$. So that the deviation would be profitable. The intuitive criterion therefore rules that the beliefs $\Pr(H)=0$ are not reasonable for a deviation to investing in education and we cannot have any equilibrium that depends of such beliefs. 

That should do the job for strict convexity. As frage_man already pointed out, the proposition fails to hold generally under weak convexity. Indifference everywhere is a very elegant example why. 

Suppose there are two products, A and B. A is monopolised and produced only by firm 1; B is supplied competitively by both firm 1 and firm 2. Common sense presents to following concern: firm 1 might try to use its market power in A to become a monopolist in B and foreclose competition from firm 2. One way to do this would be to bundle A and B1 together. Everyone who buys A would also be forced to buy B1, even if B2 were the better product. This would make it difficult or impossible for 2 to achieve any sales. This logic is flawed, as the Chicago school pointed out. Suppose consumers will pay $v$ for A, $v$ for B1, or $v+\Delta$ for B2 (so $\Delta$ is firm 2's quality advantage). Suppose that A and B1 are bundled and that consumers buy the bundle. In a desparate attempt to win business, 2 will cut the price of B2 to zero (this is the usual Bertrand logic). Thus, consumers will buy the bundle if $$2v-p_1\geq v+\Delta\implies p_1\leq v-\Delta.$$ Thus, the best 1 can do through bundling is to earn $v-\Delta$ from each sale of A and B1. But it could do better simply by selling A at a price of $v$ and giving $B_1$ away for free. Thus, the claim that bundling/leverage of market power is a profitable way to foreclose competition turns out to be logically flawed. 

I would like to get up to speed on the current state of empirical work done to test the assumptions and predictions of consumer theory (think Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 6 of Mas-Colell et al.). Can anyone recommend a good survey or provide a brief summary of what we currently know about how much empirical support there is for our primary means of modelling individual behavior? 

Based on the information you have given, both the solution manual and your solution are wrong. You are correct that the fixed cost for system I is 1. Variable cost is given by $$VC(x)=TC(x)-FC.$$ The variable cost for system I is therefore equal to $0.9x$. Note that the variable cost depends on $x$! For system II the variable cost is $0.1x$. You appear to have confused variable cost with marginal cost. Variable cost is the part of the total cost that changes with quantity; marginal cost is, roughly, the cost of producing one more unit (and is given by the slope of the total cost curve). Thus, the marginal cost of system I is $0.9$ and the marginal cost of system II is $0.1$. 

They look at the markets for books and for CDs both online and offline and estimate the price distributions. Whilst they look at price changes, they do not present data on the change in price distributions over time. 

Answer to question If we take your assumptions literally, Jim will decide not to enter the widget business. For suppose he did incur the cost of entry and that Mary is selling at price $p_m$. Jim can only sell to consumers if his price $p_j\leq p_m$. The best price for Jim is $p_m-\epsilon$ (where $\epsilon$ is some very small, positive amount). But this would leave Mary with no sales, so she will have an incentive to reduce her price to $p_j-\epsilon$. This is the price war you describe and it will result in both parties reducing their price to marginal cost (i.e. zero—this is known as Bertrand competition). Since there are no frictions in your model, this will all happen very quickly. Moreover, because a price of zero implies zero profits, Jim has no incentive to incur the cost of entry in the first place, so he will instead opt to stay out of the market.
