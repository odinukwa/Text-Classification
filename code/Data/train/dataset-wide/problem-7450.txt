Let $V$ be a real representation with determinant $L$, so $w_1(V)=w_1(L)$. Put $W=V\oplus L\oplus L\oplus L$. We find that $\det(W)=1$ and $w_2(W)=w_2(V)$. It follows that $A=\{w_2(W):\det(W)=1\}$. Moreover, if $\det(V)=\det(W)=1$ then $w_2(V\oplus W)=w_2(V)+w_2(W)$. It follows that $A$ is a subgroup of $H^2(BG;\mathbb{Z}/2)$. If $a,b\in H^1(BG;\mathbb{Z}/2)=\text{Hom}(G,O(1))$ then there are essentially unique one-dimensional representations $L,M$ with $w_1(L)=a$ and $w_1(M)=b$, and this gives $w_2(L\oplus M)=ab$ It follows that $A$ contains all decomposable elements of $H^2(BG;\mathbb{Z}/2)$. There is also a well-known isomorphism $H^2(BG;\mathbb{Z})=\text{Hom}(G,S^1)=\text{Hom}(G,SO(2))$. Using this, we see that if $c\in H^2(BG;\mathbb{Z}/2)$ can be lifted to $H^2(BG;\mathbb{Z})$, then it lies in $A$. Let $P\colon H^2(X;\mathbb{Z}/2)\to H^m(X;\mathbb{Z}/2)$ be any natural cohomology operation that annihilates $A$ for all $G$. Using point 2 we see that $P$ is zero when $X=B(C_2^2)=(\mathbb{R}P^\infty)^2=K(\mathbb{Z}/2,1)^2$. However, it is a standard fact that the obvious map $$H^*(K(\mathbb{Z}/2,n);\mathbb{Z}/2)\to H^*(B(C_2^n);\mathbb{Z}/2)$$ is injective for all $n$. It follows from this (taking $n=2$) that $P=0$. This means that there are no primary cohomological tests that we can use to determine whether elements lie in $A$. 

There is a Poincare duality isomorphism $H_k(SO_n\setminus C)=H^{d-k}(SO_n,C)$, where $d=\dim(SO_n)=(n^2-n)/2$. This works with any coefficients because $SO_n$ is oriented, but let us use $\mathbb{Z}/2$; then it is known that $H_*(SO_n)$ is an exterior algebra with generators $x_1,\dotsc,x_{n-1}$ where $|x_i|=i$, and $H^*(SO_n)$ is dual to this. It follows that both $H^d(SO_n)$ and $H^{d-1}(SO_n)$ have rank one. You want $H_0(SO_n\setminus C)=\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $H_1(SO_n\setminus C)=0$, so you need $H^{d-1}(C)=H^{d-1}(SO_n)=\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $H^d(C)=0$. More specifically, you need the restriction map $H^{d-1}(SO_n)\to H^{d-1}(C)$, or the dual map $H_{d-1}(C)\to H_{d-1}(SO_n)$, to be an isomorphism. Note that all monomials in $x_1,\dotsc,x_{n-2}$ are carried on $SO_{n-1}$, and the individual generators $x_1,\dotsc,x_{n-1}$ are all carried on a standard copy of $\mathbb{R}P^{n-1}$ in $SO_n$; we need to arrange for $C$ to carry the product $x_2x_3\dotsb x_{n-1}$. That's as far as I see for the moment. 

One thing you should bear in mind is the Kan-Thurston theorem: if $X$ is connected then there is a group $G$ and a map $f\colon BG\to X$ such that the induced map $H_*(BG)\to H_*(X)$ is an isomorphism. Thus, if $H_i(X)=0$ for $i\gg 0$ then the space $BG$ will have $H_i(BG)=0$ for $i\gg 0$ and also $\pi_i(BG)=0$ for $i>1$. Of course, the groups $G$ that arise in this context are typically quite strange and unfamiliar. 

Suppose that the inclusion $\eta\wedge 1:I\to E\wedge I$ admits a retraction, say $r$. Consider an $E$-monomorphism $f:A\to B$ and an arbitrary map $g:A\to I$. As $f$ is an $E$-monomorphism we can choose a retraction $s:E\wedge B\to E\wedge A$, and then the composite $$ h = (B \xrightarrow{\eta\wedge 1} E\wedge B \xrightarrow{s} E\wedge A \xrightarrow{1\wedge g} E\wedge I \xrightarrow{r} I) $$ satisfies $hf=g$. This shows that $I$ is $E$-injective. Now suppose we have an $E$-null map $f:A\to I$, where $I$ is $E$-injective. This gives a commutative square 

Let $T$ denote the tautological bundle over $BO(d)$ or $BSO(d)$. Suppose you have a bundle $E\to B$ of smooth closed $d$-manifolds, with vertical tangent bundle $V$. Using a Gysin map and a classifying map we get maps $\Sigma^\infty B_+\to E^{-V}\to BO(d)^{-T}$ of Thom spectra, and thus a map $B\to\Omega^\infty BO(d)^{-T}$ of spaces. With orientation conditions we can change the target to $\Omega^\infty BSO(d)^{-T}$. When $d=2$ we have $SO(2)=S^1$ and so the target is $\Omega^\infty \mathbb{C}P^\infty_{-1}$. Madsen and Weiss proved that when $E\to B$ is the universal bundle of Riemann surfaces of high genus, the map $B\to\Omega^\infty\mathbb{C}P^\infty_{-1}$ is homologically highly connected (but the fundamental groups are different unless you do some kind of plus construction or group completion to the source). There are various generalisations due to various combinations of Madsen, Weiss, Galatius and Randall-Williams, I don't have a good knowledge of the precise state of play. Anyway, for any not-necessarily-orientable bundle $E\to B$ of smooth closed 1-manifolds you get a map $B\to\Omega^\infty\mathbb{R}P^\infty_{-1}$. I don't know if there is a universal example where this map is an equivalence. 

I like the book 'Geometrical methods of mathematical physics' by Bernard Schutz: $URL$ I'd say that the approach is fairly close to what the OP asked for. I'm also a big fan of 'A first course in general relativity' by the same author: $URL$ 

Then $\pi$ is as discussed above, and $\phi$ is a local inverse for $\pi$. The group $G$ is generated by the transformations $z\mapsto z+2$ and $z\mapsto z/(2z+1)$. Using these you can plot lots of other things if you want. 

You are asking about the structure of the set $M=[T^2,U(N)]$ of homotopy classes of maps from $T^2$ to $U(N)$. The functor $H_1$ gives a map $M\to\text{Hom}(H_1(T^2),H_1(U(n)))$, and standard calculations show that $H_1(T^2)=\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $H_1(U(N))=\mathbb{Z}$, so we end up with a map $\phi\colon M\to\mathbb{Z}^2$. We can use the group structure on $U(N)$ to make $M$ into a group, and it is standard that $\phi$ is a homomorphism with respect to this structure. If we let $p_i$ denote the $i$'th projection $T^2\to S^1=U(1)\subset U(N)$, then $\phi(p_1)=(1,0)$ and $\phi(p_2)=(0,1)$, so $\phi$ is surjective. In fact, $\phi$ is injective as well. One way to see this is to check that the multiplication map $U(1)\times SU(N)\to U(N)$ is a homeomorphism, so $[T^2,U(n)]=[T^2,U(1)]\times[T^2,SU(N)]$. The first factor is $\mathbb{Z}^2$ again. The second factor is trivial, because $T^2$ is $2$-dimensional, and $SU(N)$ is $2$-connected (as one can prove using $SU(2)=S^3$ and the standard fibrations $SU(N)\to SU(N+1)\to S^{2N+1}$). For another point of view, one can argue using the above fibrations that $M$ is independent of $N$, so we can take $N=\infty$, in which case $M$ becomes the complex $K$-theory group $KU^1(T^2)$. UPDATE: We can write an integral formula as follows. For $k=1,2$ let $i_k\:S^1\to T^2$ be the $k$'th axis inclusion. Then the $k$'th component of $\phi(f)\in\mathbb{Z}^2$ is just the ordinary winding number of the composite $$ g_k = (S^1 \xrightarrow{i_k} T^2 \xrightarrow{f} U(N) \xrightarrow{\det} U(1)=S^1). $$ If we identify $S^1$ with the unit circle in $\mathbb{C}$, this is just $$ \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{S^1} \frac{g'_k(z)}{g_k(z)}\, dz. $$ 

there exists $J\in\mathcal{J}$ such that $a\in J$. Moreover, the class of rings for which one can write down a choice function is quite large. It certainly contains all rings for which we have an explicit enumeration $\mathbb{N}\to R$, and is closed under taking quotients, products, tensor products, finitely generated algebras and so on. Of course we do not have choice functions for nontrivial algebras over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Q}_p$. However, in some cases like this the ring will have a topology and it will be sufficient to have a choice function for nonempty open subsets of nonempty closed subsets, which can be arranged explicitly. 

You cannot have commutativity even for zero-dimensional manifolds, as you will see by considering the case where $\alpha=\beta$ and $M_\alpha=M_\beta=\{0,1\}$. For associativity, my guess is that the monoid of isomorphism classes is probably a free abelian monoid (so we have "unique factorization"). If that is true then you can certainly arrange associativity. It would be a bit fiddly to write down a precise proof and I do not have time just now. However, you will get the idea if you first consider a category in which all objects are isomorphic to $A^i$ for some fixed object $A$ and some $i\in\mathbb{N}$, and then consider a category in which every object is of the form $A^i\times B^j$. 

You have a space $E=\text{Emb}(M,\mathbb{R}^n)$ of smooth embeddings, topologised in a way that respects all derivatives. In more detail, we give $C^\infty(M)$ the smallest topology such that the inclusion in $C(M)$ is continuous, as is the map $C^\infty(M)\to C^\infty(M)$ given by any smooth vector field. We then topologise $E$ as a subspace of $C^\infty(M)^n$. One needs to check that for sufficiently small open sets $U\subseteq E$, there is a continuous choice of diffeomorphisms $r_{e,e'}\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ for $(e,e')\in U^2$ such that $r_{e,e'}\circ e'=e$. Over $E\times M$ there is a vector bundle $\mu$, whose fibre at $(e,m)$ is $\mathbb{R}^n\ominus e_*(T_mM)$. Thus, $\mu|_{\{e\}\times M}$ can be identified with the normal bundle $\nu_e$. One needs to check that for sufficiently small open sets $U\subseteq E$, the restriction $\mu|_{U\times M}$ is isomorphic to a bundle pulled back from $M$, so $\nu_e$ is essentially independent of $e$ for $e\in U$. There is also a space $F$ of thickened embeddings. A point of $F$ is a pair $(e,f)$ where $e\in E$, and $f$ is an embedding of the total space of $\nu_e$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $f(m,u)\simeq e(m)+u$ to first order in $\|u\|$. There is an evident way to topologise $F$ so that it has the same kind of $E$-local triviality as $\mu$. One then needs to check that the projection $q\colon F\to E$ is a weak equivalence (or even a homotopy equivalence). This can be done by elaborating the standard proof of uniqueness of tubular neighbourhoods, combined with some paracompactness technology if you want an actual homotopy equivalence. There is an evident fibrewise Pontrjagin-Thom construction $p\colon F_+\wedge S^n\to (F\times M)^{q^*\mu}$, and a projection $q'\colon (F\times M)^{q^*\mu}\to (E\times M)^\mu$. If we regard the homotopy category as a category of fractions in which weak equivalences are inverted, then we now have a morphism $p'=q'\circ p\circ(q\wedge 1)^{-1}\colon E_+\wedge S^n\to (E\times M)^\mu$. This is the most natural incarnation of the Pontrjagin-Thom construction. 

This turns out to be a remarkably interesting question. I don't have a complete answer but here is a start. First, for any space $X$ I'll write $F_n(X)\subset X^n$ for the space distinct $n$-tuples. The question asks whether there exist $\Sigma_n$-equivariant maps $f:F_n(B^2)\to\Delta_{n-1}$ with the fixed point $b=(1/n,\dotsc,1/n)$ not in the image. If there is such a map then we can push it away from $b$ to the boundary of $\Delta_{n-1}$, which is homeomorphic to $S^{n-2}$. On the other side, there is an obvious embedding $i:B\to\mathbb{R}^2$ and one can choose an embedding $j:\mathbb{R}^2\to B$ such that $ij$ and $ji$ are isotopic to the respective identity maps; using this we see that $F_n(B^2)$ is equivariantly homotopy equivalent to the space $X=F_n(\mathbb{R}^2)$. This space is well-known: the following paper is one entry point to the literature: 

It is perhaps worth mentioning that you only need a choice function for nonempty subsets of the ring that you are working with. Indeed, given such a function $c$ and an ideal $I$ you can define $d(I)=\{x\not\in I : I + Rx \neq R\}$ and then $$ e(I) = \begin{cases} I + R c(d(I)) & \text{ if } d(I)\neq\emptyset \\ I & \text{ if } d(I) = \emptyset \end{cases} $$ You can then iterate transfinitely by the rule $$ e^\alpha(I) = \begin{cases} e(e^\beta(I)) & \text{ if } \alpha = \beta + 1 \\ \bigcup_{\beta<\alpha}e^\beta(I) & \text{ if } \alpha \text{ is a limit ordinal}. \end{cases} $$ Now $e^\alpha(I)$ will be independent of $\alpha$ when $\alpha$ is large enough, equal to $I^*$ say; and $I^*$ will be maximal provided that $I$ is proper. If you prefer a description without ordinals, we can say that $a\in I^*$ if for each family $\mathcal{J}$ of ideals such that
