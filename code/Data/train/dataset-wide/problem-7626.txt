I need to prove very specific assertions concerning convex sets of $\mathbb{R}^2.$ However, despite the very intuitive aspect of these propositions, the formal aspect is pretty hardcore for me. First, it seems to me that noncompact convex sets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be characterized in 3 categories 1) Half plans (which contains lines and have a connected boundary). 2) Strips (which contains lines and have a boundary with $2$ connected components). 3) Convex which contains no lines and have a connected boundary. Is this true ? For example, how can we prove that a plane convex set has a connected boundary if and only if it is a half-plan or does not contain any line ? Another question for me is the following. Consider $r>s>0$ and the thickenings $S_r$ and $S_s$ of a noncompact convex $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with connected boundary. Is this true that for big enough $R$, the circle centered at $0$ with radius $R$ intersect $\overline{S_r\backslash S_s}$ and that this intersection is the disjoint union of two arcs of circle ? Can we formally prove that we have a compact set which is borded by four pieces (namely the two arcs and the part of $\partial S_r$ and $\partial S_s$.) All these considerations are trivial on pictures but I'm looking for very formal proofs. I learned convex analysis with the excellent book of Rockafellar but this kind of questions is not treated. Thank you for any help. 

Let $C$ be category, let $PSh(C) = [C^{op},$ *Set*$]$ be the category of presheaves on $C$, the Karoubi envelope of $C$, denoted $\overline{C}$, is defined as the full subcategory of $PSh(C)$ which are retracts of objects in $C$ under the Yoneda embedding. I'm reading this paper on Karoubi envelopes ("Cauchy completion in category theory" by Borceux and Dejean), on page 3 (theorem 1) they say: "(4) The category $PSh(\overline{C})$ of presheaves on $\overline{C}$ is equivalent to the category $PSh(C)$ of presheaves on $C$" I'm interested to see how they proved this equivalence so I've been trying to follow the whole proof to get to where they prove it but frankly I'm stuck and a lot of what they're saying is going over my head, like for example this: "If every idempotent of $C$ splits, every retract of a representable functor $C(-,c)$ induces an idempotent on $C(-,c)$, thus an idempotent $e$ on $C$, $e$ splits in $C$, which produces a retraction of $c$ and thus a retraction of $C(-,c)$, which..." That's where I first got lost, every retract of a representable functor induces an idempotent on itself thus an idempotent $e$ on $C$ that splits?? Don't follow at all, I tried to skip to the next paragraph (where they prove the equivalence), it says: "To prove (4), it suffices to show that every presheaf $F$ on $C$ can be uniquely (up to an isomorphism) extended in a presheaf $\overline{F}$ on $\overline{C}$." ("extended IN a presheaf $\overline{F}$"? I guess they mean "extended TO a presheaf $\overline{F}$" right?), then they write: "From the uniqueness of the splitting in $\overline{C}$ of an idempotent $e \in C$ and the Cauchy completeness of the category of sets (Proposition 1), $\overline{F}$ has to map the splitting of $e$ on the splitting of $F e$." (Don't they mean $\overline{F}$ has to map the splitting of $e$ TO the splitting of $F(e)$? What do they mean by ON?) The proof is longer but I just about stopped there, couldn't follow the rest of the proof, can anyone provide some clarification on this? Please be nice to me :) 

I'm interested in the following kind of theorems : Let $M$ be a real analytic manifold and $U$ an open set of $M$. Let $f : U \to \mathbb{R}$ a continuous function. Then, there is a $C_{\infty}$ function $g : U \to \mathbb{R}$ and a constant $C>0$ such that $$|f(x)-g(x)| \leq C, \quad \forall x \in U.$$ I would like to know what can be standard (or less common) constructions of such $g$ and $C$. Note that I don't put any condition on the open set but I also don't ask a true approximation (i.e. for all $\epsilon$ as small as one wants). I just want the inequality to be true for a specific constant. If one needs more specific conditions on $U$ and $f$, it can also be interesting for me but I would like to have the more general constructions that it is possible to have. Thank you in advance for any help or references. 

In term of this definition, our first construction achieves $(O(\ell^2), \ell^2, \ell, 2, \ell/2)$, and the second construction achieves $(O(\ell\log\ell), \ell^{O(1)}, O(\ell\log\ell), O(\log\ell), \ell)$. General Question Suppose that we enforce $a = \ell$. Because forbidden sets are disjoint, thus with a worst-case guarantee of $k$ chunks, we need each set to have $n \ge k\ell$ elements. Do we have $(O(k\ell), \ell^k, k\ell, k, \ell)$ designs for all sufficiently large integer $k$? (note that for $k=O(\log\ell)$ construction 2 works, but I want to ask for constant $k$. Also, construction 1 can be used to give a $(O(\ell^2), \ell^k, k\ell, k, \ell)$. Relaxations. Here I will describe some relaxations which already satisfy some applications in my mind. Can we have, for example, $(O(2^k\ell), \ell^k, k\ell, k, \ell)$-designs? Note that the dependence on $k$ is exponentially weaker than stated above. Thank you for the attention. 

Honestly I had never heard of Hochschild cohomology objects (or derived centers?) or Hochschild (co)homlogy used in this type of context but mostly I wanted to know: What is the relationship between Hochschild cohomology and Drinfeld centers? 

Let $HH_*(A,N)$ (or $HH^*(A,N)$) be the Hochschild homology (or cohomology) of an associative algebra $A$ with coefficients in an $A$-bimodule $N$. I was reading nlab's entry on Hochschild cohomology and I saw this term: 

The proof focuses on proving that the inner products are positive and the "rest of the proof of this proposition is carried out by routine calculations", which, as it were, I'm stuck with, pardon my lack of familiarity with the whole subject but I just have to ask: 

, which, when $N = A$, is also called the ($\infty ,1$)- or derived center of $A$. In this paper ($URL$ they say that for an associative algebra object $A$ in a closed symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{S}$, the derived center or Hochschild cohomology $Z(A) = HH^*(A) \in \mathcal{S}$ is the endomorphism object $End_{A \otimes A^{op}} (A)$ of $A$ as an $A$-bimodule. Then I found this on page 45:
