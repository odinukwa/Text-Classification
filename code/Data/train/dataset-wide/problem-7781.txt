As a person interested in group theory and all things related, I'd like to deepen my knowledge of group actions. The typical (and indeed the most prominent) example of an action is that of a representation. In this case the target space has so much structure that one can deduce a huge number of properties of a given group just by working out some linear algebra (to put it bluntly). Now, I am wondering 

As is often the case in mathematics there is an option of studying a more general topic but this comes with a price of losing some interesting properties which are only present in the more specialized area. In this case, I am interested in learning about relative usefulness of a metric space carrying some additional structure. To give some obvious examples: 

I want to learn about more examples of this kind (not necessarily as important though) to get a better idea about how different kinds of metric spaces look like and also about the fields that are based on them. 

Consider the Grassmanian $G(k,n)$ ($k\le \frac{n}{2}$) and take its Plucker embedding. Consider now the space of all normal rational curves of degree $k$, contained in the Plucker embedding of the Grassmanian. Finally, take the closure of this space. I would like to know if this closure has some nice description. Example. The Grassmanian $G(2,4)$ is a quadric $Q$ in $\mathbb P^5$. A normal curve of degree two in this quadric is just the intersection of $Q$ with a $\mathbb P^2$. So the corresponding space in this case is $G(3,6)$. 

Let $A$ be Noetherian ring that is an integral domain and let $\frak a$ be a proper ideal. I would like to know if it can happen that $\cap_{1}^{\infty}{\frak a}^n\ne 0$ and at the same time the sequence of ideals ${\frak a}^n$ does not stabilise? What would be a "natural example"? (this question is motivated by trying to understand Krull intersection theorem). PS. I was thinking of the following version of Krull intersection theorem: Theorem. Let a $\frak a$ be be an ideal in a noetherian ring $A$. If $\frak a$ is contained in all maximal ideals of $A$, then $\cap_{1}^{\infty}{\frak a}^n=0$. 

I am currently interested in hamilton cycles (i.e. a cycle through every vertex) in planar triangulations (i.e. planar graphs with every face a triangle). There are non-hamiltonian planar triangulations about which I have nothing to say or ask. However if a planar triangulation is hamiltonian then it has at least 4 hamilton cycles, and Hakimi, Schmeichel and Thomassen (HST) found an infinite family of planar triangulations with exactly 4 hamilton cycles. However the only infinite families of planar triangulations with a bounded number of hamilton cycles have separating triangles (i.e. 3-vertex clique-cutsets) and can in some sense be viewed as "reducible'' configurations. Therefore HST asked what is the smallest number of hamilton cycles that a $4$-connected planar triangulation on $n$ vertices can have, and conjectured that the answer is $2(n-2)(n-4)$ hamilton cycles. Furthermore they conjectured that the unique example realising this is the complete join of $2K_1$ (two isolated vertices) to a cycle of length $n-2$. My question is whether this has been proved or any progress has been made on it. I have searched fairly hard through MathSciNet and Google, and have convinced myself that there are no small counterexamples. 

It turns out that it is nice to read books. The answer to the weaker version of my question with $O|z|^{n+1}$ term is contained on page 17 of McDuff-Salamon book [MS] (no need of Micallef-White!): $URL$ Proof. In the proof of Lemma 2.2.3 of [MS] one uses coordinates in $\mathbb C^2$ such that $C_1$ is given by $w=0$ and the almost complex structure $J$ along the line $(z,0)$ is the standard one. Then it is explained that the almost complex map $z\to \mathbb C^2$ corresponding to $C_2$ is given by $$z\to (p(z)+O(|z^{n+1}|), az^n+O(|z^{n+1}|))$$ where $p(z)$ is a polynomial of order at most $n$, $a\ne 0$. In our case of course $p'(0)\ne 0$. It is now clear that in these coordinates $C_2$ is as need. QED. Comment. The above proof is elementary and does not use Micallef-White. Similarly to Micallef-White's, statement it can be used to answer the original question with a $C^1$-smooth change of coordinates (instead of $C^{\infty}$). Indeed, after a smooth reparameterization in $z$ and scaling in $w$ the above map for $C_2$ looks as $$z\to (z, z^n+O(|z^{n+1}|)).$$ Denote the second term by $f(z)$. Then the map $(z,w)\to (z,w-(f(z)-z^n)/z^n)$ is $C^1$ and it sends the couple $C_1,C_2$ to the couple $(w=0, w=z^n)$. I wonder still if one can make this last change of coordinates $C^{\infty}$... 

This answer just suggests a couple of directions that you can continue searching, rather than being definitive. Brouwer, Cohen and Neumaier use the term edge regular for the property that every pair of adjacent vertices have the same number of common neighbours (in other words, like strongly regular but dropping the condition on non-adjacent vertices). So your property is then edge regular with $\lambda = 1$. Of course any graph that is actually strongly regular with $\lambda = 1$ will do the trick, hence the Brouwer-Haemers graph and the Paley graph on 9 vertices that you already found. There are other SRGs with $\lambda=1$. There are various papers on edge-regular graphs of different types, but I don't know offhand if $\lambda=1$ has been tackled. On another tack, a graph is called locally $X$ if every neighbourhood is isomorphic to $X$, and so you are looking for graphs that are locally $rK_2$. Again there is lots of work on graphs that are locally this, locally that and locally the other, but I don't know offhand for $X =rK_2$. A third direction in which you may search is to observe that your condition is equivalent to every edge being in a unique triangle (+ regularity). This sounds like a condition that somebody should have studied, but at the risk of sounding like a broken record, I don't know offhand of any such results. However I think that there is definitely scope there for some interesting work. 

Suppose $C_g$ is a smooth compact complex curve (of genus $g$), and let $J$ be its Jacobian. Recall that the Jacobian $J$ of a curve $C_g$ is a complex torus that can by obtained by contractions of all rational curves on the $g$-th symmetric power of $C_g$, e.i., $Sym^g(C_g)$. Recall also that there is a theta divisor $\Theta$ in $J$, depending on a point $p\in C_g$. The divisor $\Theta$ is the image in $J$ of the set of points $(p,p_1,...,p_{g-1})$ with $p$ fixed. Question. How to calculate the dimension of the set of divisors on $J$ linearly equivalent to $\Theta$? In other words, what is $dim( H^0(J,\cal O(\Theta)))$? 

Suppose $X$ is a normal projective variety over $\mathbb C$. In the case $X$ is smooth according to Hodge theory $h^1(X,O(X))$ is the dimension of the space of holomorphic $1$-forms on $X$ and this number is equal as well to the half of the first Betti number $b_1(X)/2$ . I would like to know what happen in the case when $X$ is singular and normal. 1) Is there some relation (equality or inequality) between $h^1(X,O(X))$ and $b_1(X)$? For example does $b_1(X)=0$ imply $h^1(X,O(X))=0$? 2) Suppose that $h^1(X,O(X))=n$ is it true that there is a canonical $n$-dimensional space of $1$-forms on $X$, holomorphic outside of its singularities? (if yes, can something be said about their behaviour at singularities?) Is there some pedagogical reference treating these questions? 

This question is not a 100% fit for MO, but it is a serious question that can be viewed as a sort of reference request, and I think fits here more than elsewhere. I have been asked to write a chapter describing computational resources for the practical computation of the Tutte polynomial. To keep the scope reasonable, I have decided to look at, evaluate and describe programs that are 

A lot of effort in discrete maths / combinatorics is expended in the construction of lists, catalogues or census [sic] of combinatorial objects such as groups, graphs, designs etc. These catalogues are now a fundamental part of computer algebra systems. Obviously nowadays most of this is done by computer, but a surprisingly large amount of this work predates (electronic) computers - for example, G.A. Miller worked on creating lists of "substitution groups" (permutation groups) in the late 1800s and early 1900s, while Ronald Foster created the "Foster Census" of cubic symmetric graphs in the 1930s. I'd like to know some more examples of famous "cataloguers" of mathematical (well, particularly combinatorial) objects predating electronic computers. 

I'd say every statically typed functional language is such. Why? There's a well-known relation between propositions and types, or more precisely between certain theories of logic and certain type theories going by the name of Curry--Howard correspondence. This relation has a less well-known cousin known as Curry--Howard--Lambek correspondence that extends it to categories. Thus, because every reasonable statically typed functional language is based on type theory, it has direct connection to category theory as well. You simply cannot escape it, try as you might. Bob Harper likes to call this The Holy Trinity -- categories, languages and logic. The list of such languages follows: Haskell, ML, OCaml, Idris, Coq, Agda, etc. Of course, you have to take all of this with a grain of salt. Safe for Coq and Agda -- both of which are foremost theorem provers -- these languages contain many industry-driven quirks that make them less susceptible to the formal reasoning mentioned in the first paragraph. In a bit different direction, because type theory is so expressive (for example, it can replace set theory as foundations of mathematics), it's fairly straightforward to express many algebraic structures in it. All of the above languages use this feature profoundly, with e.g. monads in Haskell playing a very prominent role. 

The graph is not edge-transitive because the three "cross edges" are not equivalent to the 12 other edges. Each one-factor of this graph must use exactly one of the three cross-edges, e.g. 2-5, and a pair of opposite edges from each of the two four-cycles induced by the vertices on each side other than 2, and 5, making a total of four one-factors using 2-5. Similarly there are four using 3-6 and four using 4-7. So we have twelve one-factors, giving a total of 60 edge-occurrences in a one-factor. Twelve of those occurrences were cross edges, leaving 48 occurrences shared between the remaining 12 edges, meaning that each non-cross-edge also appears in four one-factors. 

Do you want to count the graphs or find the graphs (by computer)? If you actually want to find the graphs then it is pretty easy - you just want a graph with a partition of the vertex set into two parts - those with loops, and those without. nauty allows you to impose an arbitrary (ordered) partition on the vertex set (i.e. a "colouring" in graph theory language) and compute a canonically labelled version of the graph that respects that partition. Two graphs with loops are isomorphic if and only if 

Note: sorry, if this is too vague or too basic. But I don't have a solid mathematical background, so it's hard to know where to look for answers to these questions. I am just trying to learn about topology in general and about metric spaces in particular (mainly because of their applications in probability theory) and I will definitely accept as an answer a reference to a standard literature. 

I realize my question is probably a bit naive and ignorant of what is probably a standard knowledge but I actually can't think of that many useful actions and wikipedia article on them doesn't provide many examples (at least not very interesting and non-linear). Not that I can't think of anything at all. Coming from physics, I am aware of stuff such as gauge symmetries (free transitive fiber-wise actions on fiber bundles) or various flows (whether for time evolution, or as an symmetry orbit). And I am also aware of the usual Lie theory, left/right translations, etc. But I am looking for more. Note: feel free to generalize the above to any action. I'd be certainly also interested in actions of algebras, rings, etc. 

I am aware that the following result is a classical one (by now). But I am not able to understand who proved it. What should be a proper reference to this statement? Theorem. Let $M^4$ be a compact symplectic manifold with $\pi_1\ne 0$ and let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be two symplectic spheres embedded in it with $S_1^2=S_2^2=0$. Then $S_1$ and $S_2$ are symplectically isotopic in $M^4$. In other words, is there an article/book (say pre 2000) claiming that any two symplectic spheres with zero self-intersection in an irrational ruled (non-minimal) surface are symplectically isotopic? 

I believe that the following questions are very basic, but I don't know how to get a reference. Consider a curve in the plane $C\in \mathbb C^2$ with a singularity at $0$ and suppose it is unibranch at zero (i.e. analytically irreducible). Then I guess one should be able to define "arithmetic genus defect" of the curve at $0$. Namely if one smooths analytically $C$, its geometric genus will grow by a positive number (in case of the cusp $x^2=y^3$ it will grow by one), and let us call this number the defect. Question 1. Is this defect well defined (independent of a smoothing)? How is it called and how one should calculate it (say it terms of the local ring of $C$ at $0$)? Question 2. Suppose we have an explicit local parametrisation of $C$ at $0$, say by two holomorphic functions $f(t), g(t)$ (polynomials if you wish). Is it possible to find this "defect" as a certain invariant of this pair of functions at $t=0$? Question 1 is settled in the answer of unknown and Question 2 in comments to it by Roy and Vivek
