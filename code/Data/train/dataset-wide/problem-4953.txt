if by being a monastic we mean observing the Vinaya, then i believe it's possible as long as Vinaya rules presupposing mandatory expulsion (parajika rules) aren't violated there're 4 parajika rules 

Kakacupama sutta (MN 21) to be sure, bearing no ill-will towards the perpetrator doesn't negate bringing him/her to justice, but the very act of bringing to justice is certainly not dissimilar to taking revenge, because that particular moment occurs after the fact, by the time the victim or the object of the crime is usually out of danger, and deprivation a person of freedom for X amount of time isn't after all an act of compassion or benevolence 

[unconfirmed, proceed with caution] since in his previous lives he already was a bodhisatta and so a noble disciple, becoming awakened was only a matter of time since according to the Dhamma after attainment of the sotapatti noble level (the 1st of the four) nibbana is to be attained within 7 lives at the most. thus the Buddha was predestined to become one. even he himself couldn't change that. it's only that all his previous practice and wholesome kamma ripened in that particular life 2500 years ago 

Mallika sutta (SN 3.8) in the aspect of existence of other beings i don't think it's contradictory to the concept of anatta, otherwise the concept of dukkha would as well be at odds with it, because if there's no self there's supposedly no one to experience suffering also such understanding would effectively undermine the concept of kamma, because if everything is suffering anyway, there's supposedly no point in securing for oneself a happier future life by moral conduct in the current one 

what Dhamma does recognize is that being a family person diminishes one's chances to attain nibbana but Dhamma is not God's Commandments, the Buddha explained what's preferable, the choice is up to us 

without knowledge of the hierarchy and distribution of powers at the workplace it's difficult to offer suggestions, but if there're enough powers to effect a dismissal of such manipulative and brazen subordinates, they can be given a warning, maybe in an indirect form 

is there anything in the Dhamma which you can positively and cogently disprove to substantiate your lack of trust? as for me, i don't over-rationalize about things outside of my range, i gravitate towards the tenets which i can understand and accept easily and that's still more than enough for seeing a sage in the Buddha and putting trust in his Dhamma 

One factor of the Noble Eightfold Path is Right view (sammaditthi). Without Right view as taught by the Buddha whatever you practise is not Buddhadhamma. Suttas study allows one to find out what actually goes into the Right view. Besides this suttas contain a lot of advice with regard to the practice and explain many finer points of the Dhamma. I'm not sure that the Buddha said verbatim that . However what I know he did say is that the Dhamma is a raft, when one needs to cross over the stream (samsara) to the other shore (nibbana) this raft is indispensable, but it can be discarded when the other shore has been reached. So without the Dhamma as it has been taught by the Buddha the prospects of realizing nibbana are extremely faint, practically non-existent. And if one adheres to the idea that the Buddha's teaching shouldn't be taken as a dogma, how then one is to verify that what they practises and follows is the genuine Buddhadhamma and not their own diluted makeshift version of that? The Dhamma is not only hard and fast rules, but also principles by which to be guided in life so it's skillful, conducive to personal development and leads to good kammic results. It's not about dogma, it's about what's beneficial. One either accepts these principles, seeing their benefit, or one doesn't, and the latter case means that a person doesn't accept the Dhamma in its entirety, which indicates deficiency of the Right view. 

i think all strategies must be based on certain principles, which are also dhammic, and in fact grow out of them, so that a few strategies as possible would cover as much base as possible, because otherwise the practice becomes unnecessarily particular, unsystematic and caught up in strategies in fact the method described in the suttas is very simple and straightforward: one analyzes whether or not their actions, speech and thoughts enhance the existing and engender the absent wholesome qualities and whether or not they reduce the existing and prevent emergence of the absent unwholesome qualities, and so acts accordingly doing more of that which enhances and engenders wholesome qualities and less of that which enhances and engenders their opposites 

To often reflect on the First Noble Truth in the context of a daily life. And to do maranasati (contemplation of death). 

i don't think requires a response, because it itself is a response or a reaction much like the exclamations , which normally don't envisage any response 

here's an interesting perspective on this from the Pali Canon, which implies that it's rather when human morals are high that the population is growing, not the other way round superstitious quite a bit 

in the discourses the Buddha is often quoted as giving similes whos employed allegory is punishment for crimes with the latter often described as being very harsh and cruel much in accordance with ancient customs to be sure, in using similes the Buddha's interest was to convey certain messages and not pass judgement on the then practised legal system still it's noteworthy that on these occasions the cruelty of punishments is never criticized even in passing implying that it's maybe well deserved and for the perpetrator, from the ethical perspective, which the Buddha's teaching is characterized with, the cruelty of the state punishment is in fact a blessing as a means of deterrence from acting immorally and spoiling their kamma 

it's not a sin for the simple reason that a concept of sin is alien to the Dhamma, if anything it would be an unskillful, impure act on the basis of sexual misconduct description from the Nikayas it's impossible to construe that being homosexual or engaging in homosexual sex per se is a violation of the precept
