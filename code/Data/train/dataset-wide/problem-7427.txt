Let $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$ denote the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-module defined by the inversion action on $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $G_0$ be a finite group that acts trivially on $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$. Then one can compute via the Künneth Theorem and UCT for cohomology,\begin{align}H^3(G_0\times\mathbb{Z}/2;\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv})&=\text{Tor}(H^3(G_0;\mathbb{Z}),\mathbb{Z}/2)\times H^2(G_0;\mathbb{Z})\otimes_\mathbb{Z}\mathbb{Z}/2\times \mathbb{Z}/2\\&=H^2(G_0;\mathbb{Z}/2)\times \mathbb{Z}/2.\end{align}We find that every non-zero element in the cohomology group is of order $2$. Now let $G_0\rightarrow G\xrightarrow{x} \mathbb{Z}/2$ be a possibly non-trivial extension of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ by $G_0$. A $G$-action on $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$ is defined by $g:n\mapsto (-1)^{x(g)}n$. Is it true that every non-zero element in $H^3(G;\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv})$ is of order $2$? 

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a monoidal category. There is a notion of Morita equivalence of algebra objects internal to $\mathcal{C}$. Does each Morita class have a symmetric Frobenius representative? A Hopf representative? Following arXiv:math/0111139, suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple and rigid with finitely many irreducible objects and irreducible unit. Each indecomposable semisimple module category over $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to one of the form $\text{Mod}_\mathcal{C}A$ for some algebra object $A$ internal to $\mathcal{C}$; such algebras are called indecomposable semisimple, and their Morita classes are in bijective correspondence with such module categories. In this language, my question is whether, given such a module category $\mathcal{M}$ over $\mathcal{C}$, there is a symmetric Frobenius (or Hopf) algebra object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $\text{Mod}_\mathcal{C}A$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{M}$. If not, are there conditions on $\mathcal{C}$ under which $A$ exists? 

Ignoring the absence of sphericality from the first definition (is it implied by ribbon?), these definitions disagree unless the answers to the above are affirmative (perhaps assuming fusion and sphericality). 

Given two spectra $A$ and $B$, the set $[A,B]$ of homotopy classes of maps from $A$ to $B$ forms an abelian group. Can the dual abelian group $\text{Hom}([A,B],\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$ be expressed as a group of homotopy classes of maps between spectra? The Brown-Comenetz dual $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E$ of a spectrum $E$ is defined here. A key property of $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E$ is that its homotopy is dual of that of $E$ in the sense that $\pi_*I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E=\text{Hom}(\pi_*E,\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$. Naively, I suspect that $\text{Hom}([A,B],\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$ can be expressed in terms of $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}A$ and $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}B$. What if I replace ${\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}$ by ${\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}$ or ${\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}}$? 

The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence \begin{equation*}E^2_{p,q}=H_p(B,h_q(F))\Rightarrow h_{p+q}(E),\end{equation*} computes the generalized homology $h$ of a total space $E$ of a Serre fibration from the ordinary homology $H$ of the base space $B$ with coefficients in the generalized homology of the fiber $F$. In particular, using the fibration $\text{pt}\rightarrow X\rightarrow X$ computes $h_n(X)$ from $h_n(\text{pt})$ and knowledge of the differentials. For simplicity, suppose that $h$ satisfies $h_0(\text{pt})=\mathbb{Z}$. (This may not be necessary in the end.) As a generalized homology theory , $h$ corresponds to a topological spectrum (also called $h$). Trivially, the Eilenberg-Maclane spectrum $H$ is a Postnikov truncation of $h$; in particular, the homotopy groups agree at degree $0$ and there are no k-invariants to check. My intuition is that the spectral sequence refines $H$ by incorporating data from the higher degrees of the Postnikov tower of $h$. The new homotopy groups $\pi_n(h)$ in the Postnikov tower appear as the coefficient modules $h_n(\text{pt})$ in the spectral sequence, while the new k-invariants appear as differentials. Now, my question. Suppose $h$ and $g$ are topological spectra such that $g$ is a Postnikov truncation of $h$. Is there an analog to the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence that computes $h$ from $g$? (Perhaps Postnikov truncation is too strong or too weak an assumption. Please feel free to interpret my question to make it more interesting!) 

A wonderful mistake, which paved the way to singular cardinals, was done by Felix Bernstein in his dissertation. I learnt this from Menachem Kojman. Berstein thought he had proved that for every ordinal $\alpha$, $\aleph_\alpha^\omega=\aleph_\alpha \cdot 2^{\aleph_0}$. This is true for every $\alpha < \omega$ but already fails for $\alpha=\omega$. Berstein's mistake was to assume that every cardinal has an immediate predecessor. Kőnig later used Berstein's result to prove that the continuum is not an aleph, thus disproving at once two of Cantor's main beliefs: 1) every set can be well-ordered and 2) the continuum hypothesis! He presented his result at the third International Congress of Mathematicians in Heidelberg in 1904 and the organizers cancelled all parallel session to allow all participants (which included Cantor and Hilbert) to attend Kőnig's lecture. And his discovery was even reported in the local news! Here is Kőnig's reasoning: First he proves the correct result that for every ordinal $\beta$, $\aleph_{\beta+\omega}^\omega>\aleph_{\beta+\omega}$ (a special case of what is now known as Kőnig's Theorem). He then reasons that if the continuum were an aleph, say $2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_\beta$, then substituting $\alpha=\beta+\omega$ into Berstein's result one obtains that $\aleph_{\beta+\omega}^\omega=\aleph_{\beta+\omega} \cdot 2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_{\beta+\omega}$, which is a contradiction! 

Call a family $\mathcal{F}$ of infinite subsets of a countable set strongly centered if every finite subfamily of $\mathcal{F}$ has infinite intersection. We say that a set $S$ is a pseudointersection of the family $\mathcal{F}$ if $S \setminus F$ is finite for every $F \in \mathcal{F}$. Now $$\mathfrak{p}:=\min \{|\mathcal{F}|: \mathcal{F} \mbox{ is a strongly centered family without an infinite pseudointersection} \}$$ Since $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of subsets of a countable set we have $\mathfrak{p} \leq \mathfrak{c}$. Moreover, you can cook up an infinite pseudointersection of a given countable family of infinite subsets of a countable set by an easy diagonalization, so $\mathfrak{p} \geq \omega_1$. It is known that $\mathfrak{p}>\omega_1$ is consistent. For example, under Martin's Axiom we have $\mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{c}$, and hence it suffices to take a model of Martin's Axiom plus the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis. 

The reason why my Hausdorff non-regular counterexample above is perfect is that it is a countable union of closed discrete sets. Now, Uspenskij constructed $\sigma$-closed discrete ccc regular spaces of arbitrarily large cardinality. So that answers my question in the negative. See this paper: $URL$ 

Given 4 points on $S^3$. If we look at the spherical polygon formed on $S^3$, is there a formula for the 3-dimensional Hausdorff measure for it? E.g.: When I tried to set up a spherical coordinate for the following 4 points, it's not clear to me what is the domain of the spherical angles: $\vec{0}$, $\vec{e_1}$, $\vec{e_2}$, $\vec{e_2}$, $(0,0,1/\sqrt{2},1/\sqrt{2})$. How about higher dimensions? Thanks! 

If there is a Skorokhod decomposition for both X and Y, it may helps quantifying your intuition about "reflecting Brownian motions don't vanish simultaneously after time 0". This kind of pathwise information may help showing independence. 

Let $$J_1=\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t_2}}dt_2,$$ $$J_2=\int_0^1 \int_0^{t_2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t_2}}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t_3}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{t_2-t_3}})dt_3dt_2,$$ $J_3=\int_0^1 \int_0^{t_2}\int_0^{t_3}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t_2}}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t_3}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{t_2-t_3}})(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t_4}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{t_2-t_4}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{t_3-t_4}})dt_4t_3t_2,$ and so on. Is it true that $$J_N\leq C^N\quad \text{for some }C\;?$$ Mathematica and Maple both tells me that $J_1=2$, $J_2=2+\pi$ and $J_3=4+\frac{10\pi}{3}$, but they fail to compute $J_4$. Any help will be appreciated. 

Suppose $D$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain in $R^n$ and $X_1$, $X_2$ are two independent reflected Brownian motions (RBMs) in $D$. Is it true that $$P[X_1(t)\neq X_2(t) \text{ for all }t>0]=1$$ It seems to be true for dimension $n\geq 2$. But how to prove it? Does anyone know any reference? Thanks! 

ps: The largest of the $N!$ terms in $J_N$ is exactly $$\int_0^1 \int_0^{t_2}\cdots\int_0^{t_N}\prod_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{\sqrt{t_i-t_{i+1}}}dt_{N+1}\cdots dt_3dt_2=\frac{\pi^{N/2}}{\Gamma(\frac{N+2}{2})}$$ which is too large, while the smallest term is $$\int_0^1 \int_0^{t_2}\cdots\int_0^{t_N}\prod_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t_{i+1}}}dt_{N+1}\cdots dt_3dt_2=\frac{2^N}{N!}$$ 

I got an alternative approach to prove the upper bound $J_n \leq C^n$, based on Fedja's idea of covering simplexes by cubes, and on David's description of $J_n$ using the functions $f$. Using a change of variable, we convert all the $n!$ integrands in $J_n$ to be the same, namely $1/\sqrt{x_1x_2\cdots x_n}$. Now the integrands are $n!$ polytopes {$P_i:\;i=1,\cdots,n!$} which has a one to one correspondence to the collection of matrices {$M_f: f$} where $f:\{ 2,3,\ldots, n+1 \} \to \{1,2,\ldots, n \}$ obeys $f(i) < i$. We now describe the correspondence. Given such a function $f$, we create an upper triangular $n\times n$ matrices matrix $M_f$ as follows: All entries of $M_f$ is either 0 or 1, and on the $j-$th column, an entry $M(i,j)$ is 1 if and only if $f(j-1) \leq i\leq j$. For example, when $n=3$ and $(f(2),f(3),f(4))=(1,2,1)$, then the $M_f=$ $\begin{matrix} 1 0 1, \\ 0 1 1,\\ 0 0 1 \end{matrix}$ (These are the 3 rows of $M$ in the correct order, the output does not show the matrix in this environment and I don't know why) These row vectors of $M_f$, together with the origin, gives rise to the polytope in $\{P_i:\;i=1,\cdots,6\}$. The job now is to show that these polytopes patch up around the origin at most $C^n$ times. An idea is to project the vertices (except the origin) of each polytope onto a sphere to form a spherical polygon, then check how may times these polygons patch up on the sphere. This maybe as hard as the original problem (high dimensional polytopes are hard to deal with) but the symmetry of the integrand .may simply the counting job. It'd be interesting to know if such an approach works.
