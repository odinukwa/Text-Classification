Suppose you have a tetrahedron $T$ in Euclidean space with edge lengths $\ell_{01}$, $\ell_{02}$, $\ell_{03}$, $\ell_{12}$, $\ell_{13}$, and $\ell_{23}$. Now consider the tetrahedron $T'$ with edge lengths $$\begin{aligned} \ell'_{02} &= \ell_{02} & \ell'_{13} &= \ell_{13}\\ \ell'_{01} &= s-\ell_{01} & \ell'_{12} &= s-\ell_{12}\\ \ell'_{23} &= s-\ell_{23}& \ell'_{13} &= s-\ell_{13} \end{aligned} $$ where $s = (\ell_{01} + \ell_{12} + \ell_{23} + \ell_{03})/2$. If the edge lengths of $T'$ are positive and satisfy the triangle inequality, then the volume of $T'$ equals the volume of $T$. In particular, if $T$ is a flat tetrahedron in $\mathbb{R}^2$, then $T'$ is as well. This is easily verified by plugging the values $\ell'_{ij}$ above into the Cayley-Menger determinant. In fact, it's possible to show that the linear symmetries of $\mathbb{R}^6$ that preserve the Cayley-Menger determinant form the Weyl group $D_6$, of order $2^5 * 6! = 23040$. This is a factor of $15$ times larger than the natural geometric symmetries obtained by permuting the vertices of the tetrahedron and negating the coordinates. The transformations don't always take Euclidean tetrahedra to Euclidean tetrahedra, but they do sometimes. For instance, if you start with an equilateral tetrahedron $T$ with all side lengths equal to $1$, then $T'$ is also an equilateral tetrahedron. Thus if $T$ is a generic Euclidean tetrahedron close to equilateral, $T'$ will also be one, and $T$ and $T'$ will not be related by a Euclidean symmetry. I can't be the first person to observe this. (In fact, I vaguely recall hearing about this in the context of quantum groups and the Jones polynomial.) What's the history? How to best understand these transformations (without expanding out the determinant)? Are $T$ and $T'$ scissors congruent? Etc. 

The answer to the second question is "no". For a family of polynomials $p_t$ depending polynomially on a complex parameter, as in the polynomials satisfied by your $B_r(t)$, define its Galois group to be the group of permutations of the roots you see by moving around the branch points. (Assume that the roots of $p_t$ are distinct for generic values of $t$ to make this work well. This is the same as the Galois group of $\mathcal{C}(t)(\text{roots of }p_t)$ over $\mathcal{C}(t)$.) Then there are families of polynomials exhibiting an arbitrary finite group as its Galois group. Any finite family of $B^j(t)$ will only exhibit finitely many groups $G_j$, and any tower of roots of the $B^j$ will give only groups whose composition factors are among the $G_j$. Since there are infinitely many finite simple groups, you cannot acheive all possible finite groups this way. However, I suspect the question was stronger than you meant to ask, since even the original conjecture that all polynomials are solvable by radicals wouldn't fit in to the framework of your second question. 

There is a similar formula $$ \small{\left(P_n^m(\cos\theta)\right)^2=(\sin{\theta})^{2m}\frac{(m+n)!}{(n-m)!}\sum_{k=0}^{n-m}\frac{(-1)^k}{4^{k+m}}\binom{n+m}{k+2m}\binom{n+k+m}{n+m}\binom{2k+2m}{k+m}\sin^{2k}{\theta}} $$ obtained from the following representation for associated Legendre polynomials $$ P_n^m(z)=(-1)^m \left(\frac{1-z}{1+z}\right)^{\frac{m}{2}} \frac{(m+n)!}{m! (n-m)!} \, _2F_1\left(-n,n+1;m+1;\frac{1-z}{2}\right) $$ and the formula (6.1) from the paper W.N. Bailey, Some Theorems Concerning Products of Hypergeometric Series, Proc. London Math. Soc. 38, 377–384 (1935): $$ {}_2F_1(a,b;c;x){}_2F_1(a,b;a+b-c+1;x)={}_4F_3\left({a,b,\tfrac{a+b}2,\tfrac{1+a+b}2\atop a+b,c,a+b-c+1};4x(1-x)\right). $$ 

The following formula gives a parametric extension of $(1)$ for $|a|$ sufficiently small \begin{align} \small\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{\left(e^x+e^{-x}+e^{a+ix\sqrt{3}}\right)^2}+e^a\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{\left(e^{a+x}+e^{-x}+e^{ix\sqrt{3}}\right)^2}+e^a\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{\left(e^{a+x}+e^{-x}+e^{-ix\sqrt{3}}\right)^2}=1 \end{align} This means that $(1)$ is not an isolated result. In view of this one might be very sceptical that any number theoretic interpretation of the integral exists. 

It turns out that the answer is quite easy. Take $p=q^2$,$~z=1$,$~b=q^2a$, then $$ \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty (bq^n,p/aq^n;p)_\infty z^n q^{n(n-1)/2}=2 \left(q a,q/a;q^2\right){}_{\infty }\sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty \frac{\left(-1/a\right)^n q^{n^2+n}}{1-a q^{2 n+1}}. $$ The sum on the RHS is proportional to Appell-Lerch sum $$ m(qa^2,q^2,q^2/a) $$ in the notation of the paper E. Mortenson, D. Hickerson, Hecke-type double sums, Appell-Lerch sums, and mock theta functions (I), Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, (3) 109 (2014), no. 2, 382-422. In general Appell-Lerch sums do not have infinite product representations. For example take $a=q^{-1/2}$, then we get the sum of the type $m(1,q^2,z)$,$~z\neq 1$ which is related to mock theta function of order $2$, formula $(4.2)$ in the paper cited above. Therefore $(1)$ can not have a closed form. 

A more general result is due to C. Störmer (Acta Mathematica December 1895, Volume 19, Issue 1, pp 341–350) 

The paper Two-dimensional series evaluations via the elliptic functions of Ramanujan and Jacobi deals exactly with double sums of this kind and shows how to evaluate them in terms of elliptic functions. The book Lattice sums then and now gives alternative methods to calculate lattice sums. 

In chapter 5 of his paper Cais gives a general methodology to construct modular forms which then can be generalized as above, thus giving an infinite family of formulas like $(1)$ and $(2)$. Then one can take linear combination of arbitrary number of these functions. Will this be the most general function of this kind or there are others? This question is related to the previous question. The formula $$ \prod_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1+e^{-\pi\alpha\sqrt{(2n+1)^2+\beta^2}}}{1+e^{-\pi\sqrt{(2n+1)^2/\alpha^2+\beta^2}}}=\exp\left\{\frac{1}{2}\int_0^\infty\ln\frac{1+e^{-\pi\alpha\sqrt{x^2+\beta^2}}}{1+e^{-\pi\sqrt{x^2/\alpha^2+\beta^2}}}\ dx\right\}.\tag{1} $$ is a limiting case ($m,n\to\infty$, with $m/n$ fixed) of the following proposition If $\cos\frac{\pi (j-\frac{1}{2})}{n}+\cosh\alpha_j= \cos\frac{\pi (k-\frac{1}{2})}{m}+\cosh\beta_k=x$ for all integers $1\le j\le n,\ 1\le k\le m$ then $$ \prod_{j=1}^n2\cosh m\alpha_j=\prod_{k=1}^m2\cosh n\beta_k.\tag{1a} $$ The formulas defining $\alpha_j$ and $\beta_k$ arise during solution of Helmholtz equation on a finite rectangular lattice with suitable boundary conditions (see e.g. Phillips, B.; Wiener, N. (1923). Nets and the Dirichlet problem. Journal of Math. and Physics, Massachusetts Institute, 105–124). 

Since the main contribution to the integral comes from $t<<1$, analytically one has \begin{align} \lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_c^{\pi/2}\frac{c}{t}\sqrt\frac{1+t^2}{t^2-c^2}dt&=\lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_c^{\pi/2}\frac{c}{t}\sqrt\frac{1}{t^2-c^2}dt\\ &=\lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_{2/\pi}^{1/c}c\sqrt\frac{1}{1-c^2t^2}dt\\ &=\lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_{2c/\pi}^{1}\sqrt\frac{1}{1-t^2}dt\\ &=\int_{0}^{1}\sqrt\frac{1}{1-t^2}dt\\ &=\frac\pi{2} \end{align} 

Rohlin's argument, which is actually quite geometric. You start with an immersion of the 3-manifold in $\mathbb{R}^5$. You modify the immersion by a cobordism until it is an embedding, and then find an explicit 4-manifold bounding it. This is nicely explained in "A la recherche de la topologie perdue". I believe this is also Richard Kent's answer above. Thom's argument, with lots of algebraic topology. This is probably not the most elegant route if you only want this piece, although of course Thom tells you much more. Rourke's argument as sketched by Daniel Moskovich above. Indeed, any proof that the mapping class group is generated by Dehn twists also gives a proof that $\Omega_3 = 0$. Dehn and Lickorish also have proofs of this. I also have a proof with Francesco Costantino, also direct and geometric. You take the compact 3-manifold and look at a generic map to $\mathbb{R}^2$. The preimage of a generic point is a disjoint union of circles, which bounds a convenient canonical surface (a union of disks). Take these disks as the start of your 4-manifold. In codimension one singularities, two of these circles can merge, and the preimage of a little transversal is a pair of pants, which can be filled in with a 3-sphere (together with the disks already attached). In codimension 2, there are only two different interesting local models, and both can be filled in canonically with a 4-ball. 

The game Hanabi is a cooperative, hidden-information game. You can read the rules elsewhere, but broadly speaking the players are attempting to cooperatively build a fireworks display by playing cards from their hand. The goal is to get as high a score as possible, by playing as many valid fireworks card as possible. The catch is that you hold your cards facing away from you, so without information from other players you are just blindly guessing which card to play. On your turn, you can either 

There's a more geometrically natural description of a $\mathbb{Z}$-central extension in both cases. For $\operatorname{Diff}(S^1)$, the central extension are diffeomorphisms $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ which are equivariantly periodic, i.e. $f(x+1) = f(x) + 1$. For $\mathcal{A}$, the central extension consists of holomorphic structures on the strip $I \times \mathbb{R}$ (where $I$ is an interval) which are invariant under translation by $1$ in the $\mathbb{R}$ direction, together with an equivariant parametrization of both boundaries by $\mathbb{R}$. These are considered up to equivariant isomorphism. (If the interval $I$ has length $> 0$, then you can assume the parametrization is by the identity map by shearing your holomorphic structures. But this way makes the compatibility with $\widetilde{\operatorname{Diff}}(S^1)$ more obvious.) In both cases the composition is clear, and it's also obvious that $\widetilde{\operatorname{Diff}}(S^1)$ acts on $\widetilde{\mathcal{A}}$. Presumably these two extensions embed in the $\mathbb{R}$-central extension you describe.
