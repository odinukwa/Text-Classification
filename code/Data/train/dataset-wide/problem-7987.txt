If you don't ask for the variety to be proper, the answer is no. Consider the affine plane A^2. Given any finite set of points (xi, yi), there is a polynomial f(x) which vanishes at each xi. Then (x,y) --> (x, y+f(x)) is an automorphism fixing those points. From your stated motivation, I'm sure you want to say the variety is proper. That's an interesting question; I'll think about it. 

Here is a route I took when teaching this material to bright high school students at PROMYS. (Of course, not using this language.) Let $R$ be a subring of $\mathbb{C}$, of finite rank over $\mathbb{Z}$. I was actually only doing the particular case of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-D}]$, for some positive integer $D$, but you could presumably be more general with your audience. It is easy to show that ideal classes form a semi-group, and that this semi-group is finite (using Minkowski's theorem). Moreover, the proof is constructive; they can compute the class semi-group in practice without difficulty. It is also easy to show that, if the class semi-group is a group, then unique factorization into prime ideals holds. I then had them compute lots of examples, and see that the class semigroup often was a group. You can then discuss those examples without mentioning integral closure at all. When you do get to integral closure, you can have them check their list of examples and see that the class semi-group is a group precisely when the ring is integrally closed. Hopefully, this will make the notion seem better motivated. I never actually got to proving that "all ideals invertible" is equivalent to "integrally closed", but I don't see why I couldn't have if I had more time. In your setting of general commutative algebra, my proposal is to define the class semi-group; show that one dimensional, Noetherian and class semi-group is a group implies unique factorization into ideals; and compute class semi-groups, using Minkowski's theorem, for the number fields which you wish to exhibit. 

Let $K_0(X)$ be the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves on $X$. There is a ring structure on $K_0(X)$, where $$[\mathcal{E}] [\mathcal{F}] = \sum (-1)^j [\mathcal{T}or_j^{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{F}) ]$$ for any coherent sheaves $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{F}$. Here I am using $[\mathcal{A}]$ to mean "class of $\mathcal{A}$ in $K_0(X)$", and I am using that $X$ is smooth to guarantee that the sum is finite. $K_0(X)$ has a descending filtration, $K_0(X) \supseteq K_0(X)_{1} \supseteq K_0(X)_{2} \supseteq \cdots \supseteq (0)$ where $K_0(X)_i$ is spanned by classes of sheaves with support in codimension $i$. This makes $K_0(X)$ into a filtered ring, meaning that $$K_0(X)_i K_0(X)_j \subseteq K_0(X)_{i+j} \quad (\ast)$$ Containment $(\ast)$ is NOT obvious, and we will return to this point. Let $gr \ K_0(X)$ be the associated graded ring $\bigoplus_{i \geq 0} K_0(X)_j/K_0(X)_{j+1}$. Then there is a map of graded rings from $gr \ K_0(X)$ to the Chow ring $A^{\bullet}(X)$. This map sends $[\mathcal{O}_V]$ to $[V]$. So, let $V$ and $W$ live in codimensions $i$ and $j$. We want to compute $[V] [W]$ in $A^{i+j}(X)$. From the above, we see that it would be enough to compute $$\sum (-1)^j [\mathcal{T}or_j^{\mathcal{O}_X}(\mathcal{O}_V, \mathcal{O}_W) ] \quad (\ast \ast)$$ as an element of $K_0(X)_{i+j}/K_0(X)_{i+j+1}$. Every summand in $(\ast \ast)$ is supported on $V \cap W$. So, if $V \cap W$ lives in codimension $i+j$, then we can just compute the image of each summand separately in the quotient $K_0(X)_{i+j}/K_0(X)_{i+j+1}$. Working this out gives Serre's formula. Suppose now that $V \cap W$ has codimension $k$, which is less than $i+j$. Then the individual Tor terms live in $K_0(X)_k$ and plugging into Serre's formula gives the image of $(\ast \ast)$ in $K_0(X)_k/K_0(X)_{k+1}$. But, by containment $(\ast)$, the sum $(\ast \ast)$ actually lives farther down the filtration, in $K_0(X)_{i+j}$. This is why simply plugging into the formula you quote gives $0$. 

By the "standard argument", this map is finite. I now recall the standard argument. Since $V$ is proper, we just need to check that the map has finite fibers. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the the fiber above $$(a_0: a_1 : \cdots a_{i-1} : 1 : a_{i+1} : \cdots : a_d)$$ has positive dimension. Let $C$ be a curve in this fiber, so $f_j^{R/r_j} - a_j f_i^{R/r_i}$ vanishes on $C$ for all $j \neq i$. The curve $C$ must meet the hypersurface $f_i=0$, say at $z$. Then all the $f_i$ vanish at $z$, contradicting our construction. 

This seems impossible to me, at least with the kind of embedding considered or anything remotely close to it. I'll think classically, in terms of $\mathbb{C}$ points. Your embedding $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ sits inside $SL_2(\mathbb{C}) \subset Sp_{2g}(\mathbb{C})$. Note that $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ is three dimensional. So the Zariski closure of $\bigcup g_i SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) g_i^{-1}$ is contained in the closed subscheme $\bigcup g_i SL_2(\mathbb{C}) g_i^{-1}$. But the latter is a union of finitely many $3$-dimensional varieties, so it can't fill up the $2g^2+g>3$ dimensional variety $Sp_{2g}(\mathbb{C})$. This argument applies whenever the map $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \to Sp_{2g}(\mathbb{Z})$ extends to a map $SL_2(\mathbb{C}) \to Sp_{2g}(\mathbb{C})$. If you just ask for a map of abstract groups, ignoring algebraic geometry, I don't know what to expect. 

$\def\RR{\mathbb{R}}$This isn't the right answer for your class, because it works for a level of generality you don't need, but last summer I found what I think is the right way to prove this result for a general bipartite planar graph or, working harder, for any planar graph and I thought I'd record it here. I'm sure this isn't original, but I didn't find it in a quick literature search. Let $G$ be a bipartite graph. We'll define an immersion of $G$ to $\RR^2$ to be a map $\phi: G \to \RR^2$ which is injective except that $\phi$ is allowed to make edges cross transversely in their interiors; $\phi$ is not permitted to create triple crossings. For example, we can send the vertices of $G$ to generic points of $\RR^2$ and join them by line segments. Assign a weight $x_e$ to each edge of $G$. For a perfect matching $M$ of $G$, define $\mathrm{cross}(M, \phi)$ to be the number of places where edges of $M$ cross. Define the matching polynomial of $(G, \phi)$ to be $$\mu(G, \phi) = \sum_M (-1)^{\mathrm{cross}(M, \phi)} \prod_{e \in M} x_e$$ where the sum is over all perfect matchings of $G$. We claim that there is a way to take the adjacency matrix of $G$ and replace the entry corresponding to $e$ by $\pm x_e$ to make a matrix $A$ with $\mu(G, \phi) = \det A$. In particular, if $G$ is a planar graph, we can get the generating function for matchings with no signs. Proof First, suppose that all of the black vertices lie on the line $y=0$ and all the white vertices lie on the line $y=1$, in the same order as the rows and columns of the matrix, and joined by line segments. Then we can put $x_e$ in all positions of $A$, and $(-1)^{\mathrm{cross}(\phi, M)}$ is the sign of the permutation $M$. Now, consider varying $\phi$ while preserving $G$ and we claim that the result stays true. If we vary $\phi$ generically, we can get from any immersion to any other while passing through singularities of the following sorts: 

The poster clarifies below that he means smooth varieties. In this case, the answer is yes. If $X$ is a smooth projective variety of dimension $d$ over an infinite field then it can be embedded in dimension $2d+1$. The idea of the proof is to embed in $\mathbb{P}^{N-1}$ and consider the Grassmannian of projections $\mathbb{P}^{N-1} \to \mathbb{P}^{2d+1}$. This has dimension $(2d+2)(N-2d-2)$; one shows that the conditions that the projection is not defined on $X$, identifies two points of $X$, or is not injective somewhere on the Zariski tangent space of $X$ all have lower dimension. 

A counter-example to show that this result does not extend to characteristic $p$: Let $K= \mathbb{F}_p(s,t)$, the rank two transcendental extension of $\mathbb{F}_p$. Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be roots of $$\alpha^{p-1} - s=0$$ $$\beta^p - s \beta - t=0.$$ Then $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have degrees $p-1$ and $p$ over $K$. The element $\alpha + \beta$ obeys $$(\alpha+\beta)^p - s (\alpha+\beta) - t=0.$$ 

The statement is true. Write $F_n$ for the $n$-th Fibonacci (my indexing starts at $(F_0, F_1, F_2, F_3, \dots) = (0,1,1,2,\dots)$). We are being asked to show that $$\frac{1}{F_{j+1}} > \sum_{m=F_{j}+1}^{F_{j+1}} \frac{1}{m} - \sum_{m=F_{j-1}+1}^{F_{j}} \frac{1}{m} > 0\ \mbox{for}\ j \geq 6.$$ Computer computations easily check this for $6 \leq j \leq 20$, so we only need to check large $j$. We know that $$H(n) = \log n + \gamma + \frac{1}{2n} + O(1/n^2)$$ where the constant in the $O( \ )$ can be made explicit -- something like $1/12$. So $$\sum_{m=B+1}^C \frac{1}{m} - \sum_{m=A+1}^B \frac{1}{m} = \log \frac{AC}{B^2} + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{A}-\frac{2}{B}+\frac{1}{C} \right) + O(1/A^2)$$ where the constant in the $O( \ )$ is something like $1/3$. Now, $F_{j-1} F_{j+1} = F_j^2 \pm 1$. So $$\log \frac{F_{j-1} F_{j+1}}{F_j^2} = \log \left( 1 \pm \frac{1}{F_j^2} \right) = O(1/F_j^2).$$ So, up to terms with error $O(1/F_j^2)$ and a fairly small constant in the $O( \ )$, we are being asked to show that $$\frac{1}{F_{j+1}} > \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{F_{j+1}} - \frac{2}{F_j} + \frac{1}{F_{j-1}} \right) > 0.$$ Set $\tau = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, and recall that $F_j = \frac{\tau^j}{\sqrt{5}} + O(\tau^{-j})$. Then, up to errors of $O(\tau^{-3j}) = O(1/F_j^3)$, this turns into the inequalities $$\frac{1}{\tau^2} > \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \frac{2}{\tau} + \frac{1}{\tau^2} \right) > 0.$$ The latter is obviously true; the former can be checked by calculation. It looks like the same analysis should apply sufficiently far out any linear recursion with solution of the form $G_j = c_1 \theta_1^j + \sum_{r=2}^s c_r \theta_r^j$ where $1 < \theta_1 < 1+\sqrt{2}$ and $|\theta_r|<1$ for $r>1$. (So $\theta_1$ should be a Pisot number.) The inequality $|\theta_r|<1$ makes $\log \frac{G_{j+1} G_{j-1}}{G_j^2} \approx \frac{\max_{r \geq 2} |\theta_r|^j \theta_1^j}{\theta_1^{2j}}$ be much less than $1/G_j \approx 1/\theta_1^j$. The inequality $\theta_1 < 1+\sqrt{2}$ makes $1/\theta^2 > (1/2)(1-2/\theta+1/\theta^2)$. 

The answer of jvp (above) is completely right in characteristic zero. I'll be annoying and point out the following example, due to Serre: let K be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2 and let F be the field with two elements inside K. Let L be the vector space of cubics in K[x,y,z] that vanish at the 7 points of P^2(F). Every cubic in this family is singular, yet there is no point at which they are all singular. Now, L has dimension 3 (and its projectivization has dimension 2), so this is still smaller than the 7 (projectively 6) dimensional spaces of cubics which are singular at a given point. But it is a warning about the kind of issues that can come up when you ask this question in finite characteristic. 

Your sequence is bounded by $(125+\epsilon)^n$. Obviously, this isn't close to a good bound, but it answers the question. We start by bounding a different question: Let $\Gamma_n$ be the convex hull of $(0,0)$, $(0,n)$ and $(n,n)$. (So $\Gamma$ is rotated $180^{\circ}$ with respect to your $\Delta$.) Let $q_n$ be the number of ways to pack non-overlapping triangles into $\Gamma_n$. Given any packing of triangles in $\Gamma_n$, which uses at least one triangle, let the largest triangle be of size $k$ and have a vertex at $(0,r)$. (If there is more than one largest triangle, make an arbitrary choice; this will just lead to a larger bound in the end.) So all the other triangles must fit into one of two trapezoids: one with base $r$ and height $k$ and the other with base $n-r$ and height $k$. In any case, these two trapezoids fit into translations of $\Gamma_r$ and $\Gamma_{n-r}$. So we obtain the inequality $$q_n \leq \sum_{r=1}^{n-1} q_r q_{n-r} + 1,$$ where the $+1$ is because we have to remember the possibility that there might be no triangles in the packing. If we take $q_0=0$ for convenience, we get that $\sum q_n z^n$ is term by term dominated by the solution of $$Q(z) = Q(z)^2 + \frac{z}{1-z}.$$ Solving the quadratic, $$Q(z) = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \sqrt{1-\frac{4z}{1-z}} \right).$$ Notice that $Q(z)$ has radius of convergence $1/5$ so $q_n \leq (5+\epsilon)^n$. I previously had an argument here that didn't work, so here is something even more sloppy. All the triangles you are considering fit inside $\Gamma_{3n}$. So your quantity is bounded by $q_{3n}$, and hence by $(125+\epsilon)^n$. I suspect that $5^n$ may be pretty close to the right rate of growth, especially given Roland Bacher's computation. 

and an explicit formula in radicals is $$8000 \left(\ 5569095 + 1350704 \sqrt{17} + 4 \sqrt{2 (1938444620639 + 470141877665 \sqrt{17})}\ \right).$$ So this is clearly a quadratic extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-17}, i)$. It isn't easy to me to see that it is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-17})$, though. I note that the element $2(1938444620639 + 470141877665 \sqrt{17})$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{17})$ has norm $-421496^2 = - 2^6 19^2 47^2 59^2$ in $\mathbb{Q}$. 

The vertices of a twisted prism will achieve this for any even $n$. Choose $0 < r < 1$. Put $$A_k = \left( r \cos \frac{2 \pi k}{n}, r \sin \frac{2 \pi k}{n}, (-1)^k \sqrt{1-r^2} \right) .$$ 

In response to the comment below: Interesting, you are right! The construction literally makes sense without choice, but it doesn't give a long exact sequence. Indeed, if $X$ is a discrete space and $\mathcal{E}$ a sheaf on $X$, then $Gode(\mathcal{E}) \cong \mathcal{E}$, so the Godemont resolution stops in one step and all higher cohomology vanishes. However, as Blass shows, in the absence of choice, if we want long exact sequences, we must define $H^1(X, \mathcal{G})$ to be nonzero for discrete $X$ in some cases. The fundamental issue is that, without choice, we can have a collection of exact sequences $0 \to A_i \to B_i \to C_i \to 0$, indexed by $i \in I$, so that $0 \to \prod A_i \to \prod B_i \to \prod C_i \to 0$ is not exact. Interesting! 

Let me suggest Lauren Williams and my paper as a starting point: David Speyer and Lauren Williams, MR 2164397 The tropical totally positive Grassmannian, J. Algebraic Combin. 22 (2005), no. 2, 189--210. It's earlier than a lot of the other references mentioned, so it isn't as sophisticated but, for that reason, it is a lot more concrete. 

$\def\dr{d_{\rightarrow}}\def\du{d_{\uparrow}}$ This is true. I don't know a reference, but here is a proof. I will show, more strongly, that, at every stage in the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence, we have a perfect pairing $E^{pq}_r \times E^{(n-p)(n-q)}_r \to k$. In particular, $E^{pq}_{\infty}$ and $E^{(n-p)(n-q)}_{\infty}$ are dual and, since $H^k_{DR}(X)$ is filtered with associated graded $\bigoplus_{p+q=k} E^{pq}_{\infty}$, this shows that $H^k_{DR}$ and $H^{2n-k}_{DR}$ are dual. 

Projective space has a larger symmetry group: dimension $n^2+2n$ rather than $n^2+n$. Projective space is compact. 

I may as well write down how I've been attacking this, although I don't have a solution yet. Sequences $(p_i)$ of nonnegative integers with sum $r$ are in bijection with weakly increasing $r$-tuples $(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r)$ of positive integers. Specifically, given the sequence $(p_0, p_1, p_2, \ldots)$, form the sequence of partial sums $(q_1, q_2, \ldots)$ given by $q_i:=p_0+p_1+\ldots+p_{i-1}$. Let $n_j$ be the minimal $i$ for which $q_i \geq j$. For example, $(1,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,\ldots)$ corresponds to $(1, 4, 7,7)$. So, we want to compute the sum over all weakly increasing $r$-tuples and prove it is equal to $1/r!$. For each weakly increasing $r$-tuple, let us sum instead over all $r!$ permutations of the $r$-tuple. So we can view our sum as being over all $r$-tuples of nonnegative integers, and we want to prove now that the sum is $1$. One difficulty is that some $r$-tuples will appear more than once. For example, $(1,4,7,7)$ will appear twice, because the permutation which switches the $7$'s stabilizes this quadruple. It turns out that the multiplicity of an $r$-tuples is precisely $\prod (p_i)!$. So, what we want to show is that $$\sum_{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r \geq 0} \frac{1}{\prod (p_i)! \prod \binom{p_{k-1}+p_k+k}{k}} =1$$ Now, when none of the $n_i$ are equal to each other, and when none of them differ by $1$, the summand is $$\frac{1}{n_1(n_1+1)n_2(n_2+1) \cdots n_r(n_r+1)} = \left( \frac{1}{n_1} - \frac{1}{n_1+1} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{n_2} - \frac{1}{n_2+1} \right) \cdots \left( \frac{1}{n_r} - \frac{1}{n_r+1} \right).$$ This is set up beautifully to telescope. If I could just find a similar nice description for when the $n_i$ collide or are adjacent ...
