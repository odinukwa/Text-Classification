Jodrell Bank's 76m Lovell Telescope is sometimes used as a movie screen, having shown 2001: A Space Odyssey. 

Astronomical events such as the solstices and equinoxes occur at a specific instance in time on a specific day, often given in Universal Time. For example, this winter's solstice occurs on 21 Dec 2014 at 23:03 Universal Time. Since most of Europe is an hour ahead, this may occur on 22 Dec 2014 at 00:03 (and subsequent hours) given in local time based on the time zone. So British and American calendars will show the solstice occurring on 21 Dec, and in countries east of Greenwich on 22 Dec. 

The terminator at a certain time near sunset, is the one shown towards the east (darkness approaches), running NE/SW. As time progresses, it moves into the top horizontal location, running E/W; this consistent with the more northerly latitudes having continual daytime, coinciding with a certain parallel polar circle. As morning approaches, the terminator moves towards the west (bringing daylight with it), and runs NW/SE. 

If you discount cosmological expansion, it will simply be wrong. However, first-order corrections to the Newtonian gravity part of simulations do exist in the post-Friedmann formalism. I'm not really familiar with PFF, but according to Bruni et al. (2014), the leading-order correction to Newtonian gravity introduces a vector potential in the $g_{0i}$ term in the metric that can produce weak lensing effects but doesn't affect matter dynamics. Which is entirely sensible because that kind of gravitomagnetic effects should be suppressed by a further $v/c$ term for matter, just like magnetism. 

The author hears that the age of the universe is $13.772$ billion years, and completely ignores any error bounds on that estimate. The author hears from somewhere else that the dark-energy-dominated era began when the universe was around $7$ billion years old, and again treats this number as exact. The author then subtracts the two. 

The first order theoretical limit on stellar size is from the Eddington Limit. As the star collapses it is balances by radiation pressure from fusion. However, the fusion rate scales strongly with density (which is why the most massive stars have extremely short lifetime) so if the star was massive enough, the radiation pressure would probably blow it apart. In fact, this could lead to a pair-instability supernova and there wouldn't even be a black hole remnant even though the star is so massive. 

The mass luminosity relation is non-linear (L = M^3.5 for the main sequence) so more massive stars burn at a much faster rate. This is a non-linear relationship because the fusion is caused by pressure in the core from the star trying to gravitationally collapse on itself. 

In the ultrarelativistic limit, the electric field in the transeverse direction becomes infinitely strong, but it is also Lorentz-contracted to be infinitely thin. Without ignoring the magnetic field, the result is an electromagnetic plane wave with a Dirac delta profile. The gravitational case is analogous, though quantitatively different. Some details on this can be found in arXiv:gr-qc/0110032. 

Unfortunately, I don't have any precise information on the time scales you want (and I doubt that it's possible to make any quantitative statements with any degree of certainty). But vaguely, yes, it will almost certainly be different from today. However, even on shorter time scales, the duration of the sidereal year is not constant, as a variety of physical effects, primarily perturbations from other objects in the solar system, introduce a certain level of messiness into Earth's orbit. If one thinks of the duration of the sidereal year as a continuous parameter defined at an instant of time, then it expresses the instantaneous rate of change of the mean longitude. Essentially, we ask how long it would take for the body to make a full $360^\circ$ motion if its mean longitude changed at the current rate. Specifically, if $t$ is measured in thousands of Julian years from the J2000 epoch, then we can express the mean longitude as a power series $$\lambda = \lambda_0 + \lambda_1t + \lambda_2t^2+\lambda_3t^3 + \ldots$$ with the coefficients1 $$\begin{eqnarray*}\lambda_0 &=& +\!100^\circ\!.46645683\text{,} \\ \lambda_1 &=& +\!1295977422''\!.83429\text{,} \\ \lambda_2 &=& -\!2''\!.04411\text{,} \\ \lambda_3 &=& -\!0''\!.00523\text{.}\end{eqnarray*}$$ The rate of change is therefore $$\dot{\lambda} = \lambda_1 + 2\lambda_2t + 3\lambda_3t^2 + \ldots\;\text{.}$$ We can check what this gives for J2000: at $t = 0$, the rate of change is simply $\lambda_1$, and a Julian millennium is $3.15576\times 10^{10}$ seconds, so: $$\frac{360\times 3600\times 3.15576\times 10^{10}}{1.29597742283429\times 10^9} = 31558149.76\,\mathrm{s}\text{,}$$ which is within a second of the figure Phil Plait gave. 

All of these effects are related to the 11 year solar cycle. And while we know there are times when the sun is "active" versus "inactive" we aren't necessarily predicting exactly where sunspots or solar flares will occur, but how many we see in total. 

Since basically all metals come from some stellar process, the question of elemental distribution can vary greatly between different environments depending on when you're observing that particular galaxy, star/galaxy cluster, etc. Galaxy mergers, supernova, and stellar winds can be particularly good at moving metals around a galaxy or galaxy cluster. Interestingly Wolfram has element data with Universe abundances but I'm not sure where they derive those. 

You're right, a redshift will give you a measure of a velocity, not an acceleration. I'm assuming when you say acceleration, you're referring to the accelerating expansion of the universe so you're not looking at the particular acceleration of an object (which you could get from examining the force of gravity imparted on that object). So in addition to a redshift, you need to find a way to independently measure the distance. To get out to an appreciable redshift (z~0.5), Type Ia supernova are used as "standard candles". They are considered standard because they're believed to be from white dwarfs that explode because they have reached their maximum possible mass, the Chandrasekhar limit, of 1.4 solar masses. Therefore, when they explode, they should all look about the same and any difference in brightness would be from how far they are away from us. So they measured the distance and the redshift of the galaxy the supernova originated from to determine the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating over time. 

I would go to the Arctic circle, where you can experience an almost perpetual sunset, without having to drive around. Edited to answer the question: My interpretation of the diagram, is: 

Technically, the distance between Sun and Earth changes throughout the year. The Earth moves around the Sun on an elliptical orbit. It's distance from the Sun changes between 152m km (aphelion) and 147m km (perihelion), a difference of 5 million kilometres, twice per year. 

I think it is going to depend on the type of object being examined. Planetary objects tend to be more spherical than stars, which in turn tend to be more spherical than galaxies. My vote goes toward the Heliospheric current sheet, which is thought to extend 10-20 astronomical units (about 1.5x10^9km to 3x10^10km) from the Sun, and is thought to be about 10,000 km near the orbit of the Earth. But it tends to be influenced more by electromagnetic forces, than due to spin forces. 

There is a Dantes Standardized Subjet Test (DSST) in astronomy. I have no idea if and how widely colleges give credit for these exams. Typically, you will start with physics and choose to specialize in astronomy. Therefore, most standardized exams are for physics which may have a handful of astronomy questions. 

This is a spectral energy distribution (SED). Since astronomical objects don't emit light a single frequency an SED tells you how much emission you're getting across a range of frequencies. 

With the Tully Fisher relation, the inclination angle is determined from the major-minor axis ratio where $sin(i) = \sqrt{1-q^2} $ and q is the inverse of your ratio. You need to apply the sine of the angle to the rotational velocity because the measure is based on our line of sight observation which must be converted to the true 3D velocity. 

This this alternative still makes grand assumptions about the structure of the universe beyond what we can observe, I don't see why you attribute more 'meaning' or 'acceptability' to it. At the end of the day, all we really know is that the bit of the universe around us is very close to being flat. Any statement whatsoever about the larger structure of the universe is going to introduce some assumptions not backed by observations, and you haven't provided much guidance to what kind are 'meaningful and acceptable'. 

The notation $(x;\;y:z)$ seems to be $(30\times 60)x+60y+z$ in minutes of arc. The calculation seems to take just the integer part rather than rounding. Thus, for example, step 8 is $$\begin{eqnarray}((64552 / 292207) \times 360) - 3 &=& 79^\circ \lfloor 31.7\rfloor' - 3' \\ &=& (2\times 30 + 19)^\circ 28' \\ &=& (2;\;19:28)\text{,}\end{eqnarray} $$ and step 10 is $$134\,\sin(0:32) = \lfloor 1.247\rfloor = 1 = (0:01)\text{.}$$ Some passages in the paper that point towards this interpretation: 

There is alien life, who have already visited, but have not made formal contact with us, for any one of a number of reasons. We are the alien life, who has forgotten how we arrived here, and doesn't know how we get back. Some of us are alien life, and we just keep a low profile. 

I think you're question is incorrect, and what you should be asking is "Which of these is plausible", in which case, all of them are. I think you are also missing other options: 

I think the arrows would be better if the tip of the one on the right, joined the base of the one on the left, showing your car journey as a continuous one. 

Stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes likely form from very different mechanisms. While we have a pretty good idea how stellar mass black holes form, we're still not sure about how supermassive black holes form because they occur very early on in the Universe. 

For starbursts, their star formation rates are best estimated by a combination of their ultraviolet and infrared emission. [O II] and [O III] as well as Hydrogen recombination lines can be used to estimate star formation, but like the UV, these suffer from extinction. 

This radius of the observable universe is measured by the comoving distance which is the same in every direction. Using CosmoCalc (a common tool for astronomers measuring cosmological parameters) you get 46 Gly for the comoving radial distance.
