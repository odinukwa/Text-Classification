There are no "commonly" used words to describe these things, but there are apt words developed in SciFi books. The adverbs, spinward and antispinward would seem to do the trick. Inwards and ouwards will do for radial motion. Movement towards towards the end of a spiral arm would be outwards and antispinward. Trailing and leading can also be used to state relative position with respect to Galactic rotation (for objects not too far separated). 

There aren't any. A 25-30 $M_{\odot}$ main sequence star would have a spectral type of $\sim$ O7 and an absolute $V$ magnitude $M_V \simeq -5$ (see Zombeck 1982). A giant star with this mass would be even more luminous. At a distance of 30pc, the apparent magnitude of such a star would be $V=-2.6$. Closer examples would of course be brighter. Sirius is the brightest star in the sky with $V=-1.46$. The nearest O-star may be zeta Ophiuchus which is at about 450 light years (or about 140 parsecs). This might be a bit lower than $25M_{\odot}$. Betelgeuse, a red supergiant at a Hipparcos-measured distance of $152\pm 20$ pc, probably has a mass of about $15 M_{\odot}$, but I think this is quite uncertain. The secondary of $\gamma^{2}$ Velorum has an O7.5V spectral type and reasonably well-determined mass of about $30M_{\odot}$ (Eldridge 2009) and a distance of $336 \pm 8$ pc (North et al. 2007). 

Well done you. I double checked the calculations and couldn't fault what you had done. So I contacted the lead author of the paper about it and here is the response: "After checking the numbers in our paper, I found an error: we actually used a mass of 1.0 MSun for J1407 in our simulations, instead of the 0.9 MSun as stated. This accounts for the difference in pericentric velocities (as well as the different semi-major axes, which would be smaller in the 0.9MSun case). We will attempt to correct this in the published version, and send a correction to arXiv." 

Look up the laboratory wavelengths of the Calcium H and K lines Calculate the redshift implied by the observed wavelengths of the H and K lines. $$ v/c = (\lambda - \lambda_0)/\lambda_0,$$ where $v$ is the implied recession velocity, $c$ is the speed of light, $\lambda$ is the observed wavelength and $\lambda_0$ is the laboratory wavelength. Plot recession velocity versus distance and see what you get. Read about the Hubble redshift-distance relation. 

Slitless two dimensional spectroscopy is also possible using integral field spectrographs. Fibers record spectra over a two dimensional area. This can also be referred to as two dimensional spectroscopy. 

Work to overcome these issue will be slow and incremental. Asteroseismology is certainly helping for solar-type stars because for these stars, you can estimate the age in an independent (though model-dependent) way, which offers an alternative calibration route. The original Kepler project has also observed a number of older clusters and there are a few more which might prove to be decent calibrators in the K2 fields. However, my bet would be that the problems of calibration for K and M dwarfs will still be there even after all this data has come in. You can find a discussion of the above and a comparison with other age estimation techniques in Jeffries (2014). Estimates of age based on metallicity would be very crude indeed, and subject to catastrophic errors. For instance, the metallicity of young, star-forming clusters in the solar vicinity is almost identical to the Sun. What you can probably say, is that if a star has a metallicity less than about 0.5 solar then it is likely to be older than 5 Gyr; anything less than 0.1 solar is likely to be older than 10 Gyr. But that's about it. EDIT: So, the paper that triggered your question is Meibom et al. (2015) "A spin-down clock for cool stars from observations of a 2.5-billion-year-old cluster", which talks about Kepler observations of the open cluster NGC 6819, in which the rotation periods have been found for 30 cool stars with masses between 0.85 and 1.4 solar masses. These data are indeed an extremely useful calibration set which fills in the gap for solar type stars between the ages of the Sun and the well-studies clusters like the Hyades and Praesepe below 1 Gyr. However, all the problems I mentioned above still exist. The range of masses probed here is rather small, but what they are able to establish is that the 20 or so stars below about 1.2 solar masses have a dispersion around a mean period-colour relationship with a standard deviation of only 5%. This means that the solar mass stars have converged to a fairly tight relationship between rotation period, mass and age and that errors in measuring the periods are also relatively small. Because $t \propto P^{2}$, this leads to the claim that ages could be determined with a precision of 10% at this age, if the age-rotation-mass space were fully calibrated. Note though that these rotation periods were measured by Kepler; that the median peak-to-peak amplitude was only 4 milli-mag and that in most cases the period is a mean from several independent measurements of the same star. Such excellent data will not be forthcoming for very large samples of field stars anytime soon. 

Simple really. You observe again and see if the pair are moving together. If the star plus "planet" are quite widely separated (e.g. tens of au or more), then you would expect negligible orbital motion in the course of say a year and their relative position should remain quite constant. On the other hand, if the "planet" is a much more distant star then it is quite likely to have a very different proper motion on the sky to the foreground star and so they will show an appreciable difference in their relative positions second time around. More than two observations might be needed to be sure. The bigger the proper motion of the foreground star, the more decisive the test. 

Short answer: A tiny fraction of the gravitational potential energy released by the very rapid collapse of the inert iron core gets transferred to the outer layers and this is sufficient to power the observed explosion. In more detail: Consider the energetics of an idealised model star. It has a "core" of mass $M$ and initial radius $R_0$ and an outer envelope of mass $m$ and radius $r$. Now suppose the core collapses to a much smaller radius $R \ll R_0$ on such a short timescale that it decouples from the envelope. The amount of gravitational potential energy released willâ€‹ be $\sim GM^2/R$. A fraction of this released energy can be transferred to the envelope in the form of outward moving shocks and radiation. If the transferred energy exceeds the gravitational binding energy of the envelope $\sim Gm^2/r$ then the envelope can be blown into space. In an exploding star (a type II core collapse supernovae) $R_0\sim 10^4$ km, $R\sim 10$ km and $r \sim 10^8$ km. The core mass is $M \sim 1.2M_{\odot}$ and the envelope mass is $m \sim 10M_{\odot}$. The dense core is mostly made of iron and supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The star is said to have "run out of fuel" because fusion reactions with iron nuclei do not release significant amounts of energy. The collapse is triggered because nuclear burning continues around the core and so the core mass is gradually increased and as it does so it gradually shrinks (a peculiarity of structures supported by degeneracy pressure), the density increases and then an instability is introduced either by electron capture reactions or photodisintegration of iron nuclei. Either way, electrons (which are what is providing the support for the core) are mopped up by protons to form neutrons and the core collapses on a free fall timescale of $\sim 1$ s! The collapse is halted by the strong nuclear force and neutron degeneracy pressure. The core bounces; a shock wave travels outwards; most of the gravitational energy is stored in neutrinos and a fraction of this is transferred to the shock before the neutrinos escape, driving away the outer envelope. An excellent descriptive account of this and the previous paragraph can be read in Woosley & Janka (2005). Putting in some numbers. $$GM^2/R = 4\times 10^{46}\ {\rm J}$$ $$Gm^2/r = 3\times 10^{44}\ {\rm J}$$ So one only needs to transfer of order 1% of the collapsing core's released potential energy to the envelope in order to drive the supernova explosion. This is actually not yet understood in detail, though somehow supernovae find a way to do it. A key point is that the rapid collapse takes place only in the core of the star. If the entire star collapsed as one, then most of the gravitational potential energy would escape as radiation and neutrinos and there would be insufficient energy even to reverse the collapse. In the core collapse model, most (90%+) of the released gravitational energy is lost as neutrinos, but what remains is still easily sufficient to unbind the uncollapsed envelope. The collapsed core remains bound and becomes either a neutron star or black hole. A second way to cause a star (a white dwarf) to explode is a thermonuclear reaction. If the carbon and oxygen can be ignited in nuclear fusion reactions then enough energy is released to exceed the gravitational binding energy of the white dwarf. These are type Ia supernovae. 

I think what you have established here is just that $\rho$ tends to increase with mass. The density of planets isn't constant. Let $\rho = \rho_0 (M/M_{earth})^{\alpha}$, so that $M = (4/3)\pi R^{3} \rho_0 (M/M_{earth})^{\alpha}$ Then $$g = \frac{GM}{R^2} = \frac{4\pi G}{3} R \rho$$ Replace $R$ with $(3M/4\pi \rho)^{1/3}$ so that $$ g = \frac{4\pi G}{3} \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi \rho}\right)^{1/3} \rho$$ $$ g = \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{2/3} G M^{1/3} \rho_0^{2/3} (M/M_{earth})^{2\alpha/3}$$ $$ g = \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{2/3} GM_{earth}^{1/3} \rho_0^{2/3} (M/M_{earth})^{(2\alpha+1)/3}$$ So, bar a (highly possible) algebraic slip, if you plot $\log g$ vs $\log M$, the gradient is $(2\alpha+1)/3$, which from your plot, gives $\alpha \simeq 0.92$ - i.e. the average planet density increases almost linearly with mass. The intercept then is $$ b = \log \left[ \left(\frac{4\pi}{3}\right)^{2/3} GM_{earth}^{1/3} \rho_0^{2/3}\right],$$ which yields $\rho_0 \simeq 3.5$ kg/m$^3$ (NB: I subtracted 2 from your $b$ to make it SI; giving a density of around 814 kg/m$^3$ at a Jupiter mass). The fact that density is almost proportional to mass can be found from the same dataset. e.g. see below. Below 0.1 Jupiter masses, the relationship appears to break down, though in actual fact very few of the densities for such planets are very accurately measured (since it requires a radius from a transit), but it works well enough in the range you have plotted. The physics here is that gas giants are governed by a partially (electron) degenerate equation of state that results in them all having a similar radius from about a tenth of a Jupiter mass to about 50 Jupiter masses (albeit with considerable and largely unexplained scatter). Thus the density is proportional to mass. This relationship does not work for small rocky planets, where the radius decreases for smaller masses. Thus your nice line in log space does not continue to lower masses (see plot at bottom - NB: some of the low-mass points have huge uncertainties). 

The location part of the problem is mostly dealt with in Zephyr's answer. I completely concur, but the last part - the azimuth - is indeed tricky, but you also have to define what you mean by position in azimuth. If you are in the recent past or future then some definition would be possible based on the directions of a network of radio-loud, high-redshift quasars. Indeed, accurate measurements of their redshifts could then be combined with a cosmological model to tell you at what exact cosmic epoch your measurements were made at. Similarly, a cosmological model could be combined with a precise measurement of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background to give you your cosmic age. This would work at any cosmic epoch (assuming we have got the cosmological model correct) and be far more precise than some alternatives you could think of, like measuring the current age of the Galaxy using the luminosity of the coolest white dwarfs or the ages of stars in the oldest globular clusters (maybe accurate to a billion years). However, if you are billions of years into the future or past then defining the azimuthal location in any well-defined way becomes impossible. The Galaxy rotates with a not precisely known speed that varies with radius. Distant quasars come and go (or more precisely, turn on and off); local galaxies move with respect to our Galaxy with not precisely known (tangential) motions. Perhaps you could make a definition with respect to the cosmic ray dipole alignment, but this would change as the Galaxy's motion changes due to the influence of other galaxies in the local group and supercluster.
