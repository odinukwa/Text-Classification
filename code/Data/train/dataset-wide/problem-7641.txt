The general statement to know is, if $\mathbb G_m$ acts on a smooth complete scheme $X$, then each Białynicki-Birula stratum is an affine bundle over its fixed-point set. This is in the original paper [B-B]. It's tempting to try to apply it to the ind-scheme $\mathcal G$, but that's infinite-dimensional, and more importantly, not ind-smooth. To actually apply it, start with $\mathcal G^\lambda$, take its closure, and resolve the singularities thereby introduced equivariantly w.r.t. the loop rotation action. Use that equivariance argue that $\mathcal G^\lambda$ is a B-B stratum of either its closure or the resolution. 

(I did write Schmid, though I suspect if he knew of such a reference he would have referenced it. Of course one may have come out in the intervening time, and if he has an answer I will include it here.) ADDED: Schmid's derivation sounded (on the phone) pretty isomorphic to mine, except where I write out a page (being an outsider to the field, and not clear on which parts are considered easy and which hard) he often puts just a sentence. Nothing wrong with that, of course, if you know your audience and know what will suffice for them. Anyway that doesn't answer my reference-request. 

Equations are for cutting schemes out of ambient schemes. Are you sure you want to cut your flag manifold out of projective space? There are easier places to find it. To begin with, you could embed $Flags(n) \to \prod_{k=1}^{n-1} Gr_k(n)$, taking the flag to its list of subspaces. Then the equations are "for each $i < j$, the $i$-plane should be contained in the $j$-plane". You could Plücker embed each Grassmannian $Gr_k(n)$ into projective space, or you could regard it as $GL(k) \backslash \backslash M_{k\times n}$, i.e. look at row-spans of $k\times n$ matrices. Then the equations above say that when you stack your $i\times n$ matrix and $j\times n$, the resulting $(i+j)\times n$ matrix should only have rank $j$, so all $(j+1)\times (j+1)$ determinants should vanish. There's some equations. If you do Plücker embed, it means you only have the Plücker coordinates on those Grassmannians, and so you get Plücker relations between the Plücker coordinates of size $i$ and $j$. I find these much harder to remember than the determinants above. Once you've Plücker embedded the Grassmannians, then you can Veronese them each by different amounts, then Segre the whole thing together, and you get all the projecively normal embeddings of the flag manifold. It's interesting to note that all the equations encountered along the way are linear or quadratic (a theorem of Ramanathan for general $G$). Anyway one very good answer to your actual question is [Miller-Sturmfels], chapter 15 I think it is, as Victor Protsak suggested. 

The construction you describe appears in Tamvakis' The connection between representation theory and Schubert calculus. Basically, instead of working with representations of $GL(n)$ he works with representations of Vec, which he then applies to the tautological bundle over the Grassmannian. The main result is that this map corresponds (part of) the basis of irreps with the basis of Schubert classes. 

Equivalently, does $C$ have a subscheme $C'$ such that $p_C - p_{C'}$ is finite? $C$ satisfies Serre's condition S1 iff $C$ is the closure of the union of the generic points of its geometric components ("no embedded components"). If $C'$ misses one of those generic points, $p_C - p_{C'}$ will grow like the Hilbert polynomial of the missing component, so by your positive-dimensionality condition the difference wouldn't be finite. One place to read about S1 is the book [Eisenbud], which includes the exercise "Show $X$ reduced $\iff$ it is R0 (generically reduced) + S1." Local complete intersection $\implies$ Cohen-Macaulay $\implies$ S1, so you're good. For a non-example, let $C = \{[x,y,z] : x^2 = xy = 0\}$, $C' = \{[x,y,z] : x = 0\}$. 

Let $f$ be a Hilbert polynomial, and $X := Hilb_h(P^d_{F_p})$ a Hilbert scheme defined over $F_p$. Then there is an absolute Frobenius map $F: X \to X$. I'm even interested in the case $f \equiv 1$, so $X = P^d$. Which of the following is a sensical question? 

Let $G$ be a simply connected complex Lie group, $\theta$ an involution, and $K = G^\theta$ the fixed point subgroup. Pick a $\theta$-invariant Borel subgroup $B$. Then there is a natural map $K\backslash G \to G$ taking $Kg \mapsto \theta(g^{-1}) g$, inducing a map $\varphi : K\backslash G/B \to B\backslash G/B \cong W_G$. Most of what I know about this is in papers of [Richardson-Springer], where they study what one might call the weak Bruhat order on $K\backslash G/B$. Unfortunately, I want the strong Bruhat order. In particular, I seek proofs (and of course, references) for the following. 

Actually the second, plus the Gel'fand-Cetlin system, gives the first, as I proved in my thesis. The first is the Verlinde formula in this genus zero setting. 

First break $p$ into its homogeneous components, since Schubert polynomials are homogeneous. Now find the lex-last term $c \prod_i x_i^{L_i}$ of $p$ -- look for the largest $n$ such that $x_n$ occurs in a term, then take the terms with the highest power of that $x_n$, then of those take the terms with the highest power of $x_{n-1}$, and so on. The resulting exponent vector $L$ is the Lehmer code of a permutation $\pi$, and its Schubert polynomial $S_\pi$ has that same lex-last exponent vector. Subtract $c S_\pi$ from $p$ and continue. This process terminates. It's rather weird to ask whether a polynomial is a $\mathbb Z$-combination of double Schubert polynomials, insofar as they are a $\mathbb Z[y_1,y_2,\ldots]$-basis. To compute those expansions, the only modifications to the above recipe are that we look for the lex-last term of the highest degree in the $x$ variables, and the coefficient $c$ is now a polynomial in the $y$ variables. Your second question is then whether these $c$ all happen to be in $\mathbb Z$, but I can't imagine a natural situation where that would happen. 

You're right that blowing up a divisor does nothing if it's normal crossings, but more generally the condition is that it be "Cartier", i.e. locally given by a single equation. Here the local picture is of $n$ points in $\mathbb C$, and the single equation is the Vandermonde $\prod_{i<j} (z_i-z_j)$. So the answer is that blowing up makes sense but does nothing. 

Maschke tells you that $\mathbb C[G] \cong \bigoplus_V V^*\otimes V$, where $V$ runs over the irreps of a finite group $G$. Apply this to $G= S_n$ and take dimensions, and you get $n! = \sum_{\lambda \vdash n} \#SYT(\lambda)^2$, which can be proven combinatorially with the Robinson-Schensted correspondence. Generalizing this, consider the $GL(k)\times GL(n)$-representation $Sym(Hom(\mathbb C^k,\mathbb C^n)) \cong \bigoplus_{\lambda_1 \geq \ldots \geq \lambda_{\min(k,n)}} (V^{GL(k)}_\lambda)^* \otimes V^{GL(n)}_\lambda$. The LHS has a basis of monomials, corresponding to $k\times n$ matrices of naturals. The RHS has a basis of pairs of same-shape SSYT. This $\cong$ can be proven combinatorially, the RSK correspondence. There is another such story with $Alt$ in place of $Sym$. 

It's not true scheme-theoretically, at least. Let $X=\mathbb P^4$ with coordinates $w,x,y,z,\Omega$, let $A$ be the $xy\Omega$-plane, and $B$ the union of the $wx\Omega$- and $yz\Omega$-planes. Then $A\cap B$ is a fat point of length $3$, whereas the intersection number is $2$. 

Naively, there can be no reasonable way of distinguishing the red nodes from green in the case $A_{even}$, as the Dynkin diagram automorphism switches them. Less naively, there is indeed a way of distinguishing them in all other cases: the affine Dynkin diagram is also bipartite, and the affine vertex can be taken to be a fixed color. (Unfortunately in your $D_n$ example it would be red, whereas in your $E_6$ example it would be green, so if you're set on those choices I can't help you.) As others mentioned, you can multiply reds then greens and get a Coxeter element. If you raise it to half its order, you get the long element $w_0$. Of course you can only do this if the Coxeter number is even, which is again all cases except $A_{even}$. 

Let $R$ be a Poisson algebra (over $\mathbb C$, say) with Poisson center $Z = \{c \in R : \{c,R\} = 0\}$ and consider two types of ideals $I \leq R$: 

Let's coordinatize $G/B = Proj\ \mathbb C[m_{11}\ldots m_{33}]/\langle trace=0, rank \leq 1\rangle$, with $F_Q(M) = M^T$, the image of $(L,P) \mapsto L P^T$ (a column vector times row vector). Then the $F_Q$-invariants are generated by $n_i := m_{ii}, q_{i < j} := m_{ij}m_{ji}, s_{i < j} := s_{ij}s_{ji}$. They satisfy $${n}_{1}+{n}_{2}+{n}_{3}, \qquad {p}_{12} {p}_{13}+{p}_{12} {p}_{23}+{p}_{13} {p}_{23},\qquad {n}_{2} {p}_{13}+{n}_{2} {p}_{23}+{n}_{3} {p}_{23}$$ $${n}_{3} {p}_{12}+{n}_{2} {p}_{23}+{n}_{3} {p}_{23},\qquad {n}_{3}^{2}+{p}_{13}+{p}_{23},\qquad {n}_{2} {n}_{3}-{p}_{23},\qquad {n}_{2}^{2}+{p}_{12}+{p}_{23}$$ $${n}_{3} {s}_{12}^{2}+{n}_{2} {s}_{13}^{2}-{s}_{12} {s}_{13} {s}_{23}-{n}_{2} {s}_{23}^{2}-{n}_{3} {s}_{23}^{2}+4 {n}_{2} {p}_{23}+4 {n}_{3} {p}_{23}$$ $${n}_{3} {s}_{12} {s}_{13} {s}_{23}+{p}_{13} {s}_{12}^{2}+{p}_{23} {s}_{12}^{2}-{p}_{23} {s}_{13}^{2}-{p}_{13} {s}_{23}^{2}+4 {p}_{13} {p}_{23}$$ $${n}_{2} {s}_{12} {s}_{13} {s}_{23}-{p}_{23} {s}_{12}^{2}+{p}_{12} {s}_{13}^{2}+{p}_{23} {s}_{13}^{2}-{p}_{12} {s}_{23}^{2}+4 {p}_{12} {p}_{23}$$ $${n}_{2} {p}_{23} {s}_{12}^{2}-{n}_{2} {p}_{12} {s}_{13}^{2}-{n}_{2} {p}_{23} {s}_{13}^{2}+{p}_{12} {s}_{12} {s}_{13} {s}_{23}+{p}_{23} {s}_{12} {s}_{13} {s}_{23}+{n}_{2} {p}_{12} {s}_{23}^{2}-4 {n}_{2} {p}_{12} {p}_{23}$$ $${n}_{2} {s}_{13}^{3} {s}_{23}-{s}_{12} {s}_{13}^{2} {s}_{23}^{2}-{n}_{2} {s}_{13} {s}_{23}^{3}-{n}_{3} {s}_{13} {s}_{23}^{3}-{p}_{13} {s}_{12}^{3}-{p}_{23} {s}_{12}^{3}+{p}_{23} {s}_{12} {s}_{13}^{2}+4 {n}_{2} {p}_{23} {s}_{13} {s}_{23}+4 {n}_{3} {p}_{23} {s}_{13} {s}_{23}+{p}_{13} {s}_{12} {s}_{23}^{2}-4 {p}_{13} {p}_{23} {s}_{12}$$ $${s}_{12}^{2} {s}_{13}^{2} {s}_{23}^{2}+{p}_{13} {s}_{12}^{4}+{p}_{23} {s}_{12}^{4}-2 {p}_{23} {s}_{12}^{2} {s}_{13}^{2}+{p}_{12} {s}_{13}^{4}+{p}_{23} {s}_{13}^{4}-2 {p}_{13} {s}_{12}^{2} {s}_{23}^{2}-2 {p}_{12} {s}_{13}^{2} {s}_{23}^{2}+{p}_{12} {s}_{23}^{4}+{p}_{13} {s}_{23}^{4}+8 {p}_{13} {p}_{23} {s}_{12}^{2}+8 {p}_{12} {p}_{23} {s}_{13}^{2}-8 {p}_{12} {p}_{23} {s}_{23}^{2}-8 {p}_{13} {p}_{23} {s}_{23}^{2}+16 {p}_{12} {p}_{23}^{2}+16 {p}_{13} {p}_{23}^{2}$$ $${n}_{3} {p}_{23} {s}_{13}^{3} {s}_{23}+{p}_{13} {s}_{12} {s}_{13}^{2} {s}_{23}^{2}+{p}_{23} {s}_{12} {s}_{13}^{2} {s}_{23}^{2}+{n}_{3} {p}_{13} {s}_{13} {s}_{23}^{3}+{p}_{13}^{2} {s}_{12}^{3}+2 {p}_{13} {p}_{23} {s}_{12}^{3}+{p}_{23}^{2} {s}_{12}^{3}-{p}_{13} {p}_{23} {s}_{12} {s}_{13}^{2}-{p}_{23}^{2} {s}_{12} {s}_{13}^{2}-4 {n}_{3} {p}_{13} {p}_{23} {s}_{13} {s}_{23}-{p}_{13}^{2} {s}_{12} {s}_{23}^{2}-{p}_{13} {p}_{23} {s}_{12} {s}_{23}^{2}+4 {p}_{13}^{2} {p}_{23} {s}_{12}+4 {p}_{13} {p}_{23}^{2} {s}_{12}$$ a quick, if useless, Macaulay 2 computation: 

Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian $F$-algebra, where $F$ is a field (perfect, say). Assume that $R \otimes_F \overline F$ is a polynomial ring over the algebraic closure $\overline F$. Does it follow that $R$ was already a polynomial ring over $F$? I doubt it, but haven't had any luck constructing a counterexample. The question arises because I'm trying to understand Bruhat cells in flag manifolds for non-split algebraic groups. In split ones, Bruhat cells are affine spaces. 

Let $H_{\vec n}$ be the subfamily where the $n$ points cluster in groups of size $n_1,\ldots,n_k$ (adding up to $n$). Then it's obvious that $\dim H_{\vec n} = \sum_i \dim H_{n_i}$, so we can study just the case that all $n$ lie in the same spot, and add $2$ for moving the spot. The dimension of that "punctual" Hilbert scheme is $n-1$. In my opinion, the best way to think of this is the following. Assume further that $X$ has a holomorphic symplectic structure and that $L$ is an irreducible Lagrangian curve in $X$. Then the Hilbert scheme (of dimension $2n$) also gets a symplectic structure, and the subfamily where all $n$ points are at the same spot, anywhere in $L$, is irreducible and Lagrangian (hence of dimension $n$) in that Hilbert scheme. (Now subtract $\dim L$ to get the previous statement.) For $n=3$ as in your question, the punctual Hilbert scheme is a toric surface, the cone on the 3rd Veronese of $\mathbb P^1$. You might expect it to be toric because once we go to the punctual case, we can replace the surface by the formal neighborhood of the point, and that then carries a $T^2$-action. The three $T^2$-fixed points correspond to $\langle x^3,y \rangle, \langle x^2, xy, y^2 \rangle, \langle x,y^3 \rangle$ in the formal coordinates. The natural reference is Nakajima's book on Hilbert schemes of points. 

While I'm not sure this question is appropriate for this site, here goes. First, you need a maximal torus. Inside SO(5) we have SO(4) and then SO(2) x SO(2). Write your antisymmetric matrices as $$\begin{matrix} aJ & C & v \end{matrix} $$ $$\begin{matrix} -C^T & bJ & w \end{matrix} $$ $$\begin{matrix} -v^T & -w^T & 0 \end{matrix} $$ where $J = \left( {0\atop -1}{1\atop 0} \right) $, $C$ is square, and $v$ and $w$ are columns. Then the $a$ and $b$ parts are the torus, the $v$ gets you the $\pm x_1$ weights, the $w$ gets you the $\pm x_2$, and the $C$ gets you the $\pm x_1\pm x_2$. Taking $x_1$ and $x_2 - x_1$ as simple roots, the $e_{x_1}$ is $$ 0 0 0 0 1 $$ $$ 0 0 0 0 i $$ $$ 0 0 0 0 0 $$ $$ 0 0 0 0 0 $$ $$ -1 -i 0 0 0 $$ and the $e_{x_2-x_1}$ is $$ 0 0 1 i 0 $$ $$ 0 0 i -1 0 $$ $$ -1 -i 0 0 0 $$ $$ -i 1 0 0 0 $$ $$ 0 0 0 0 0 $$ Sorry for the ugly matrices -- I'm having trouble getting the matrix environment working here. 

Littelmann's, which gives a positive formula (counting Littelmann paths). His ICM address is here: $URL$ He proves its validity using Demazure operators -- I hope that doesn't disqualify it! 

There's a slight stupidity here which is that if the dimension of the fiber jumps up, the degree can go down. E.g. let $X = (T \times C) \cup (p \times \mathbb P^2) \subseteq T \times \mathbb P^2$, where $C$ is a plane conic and $p\in T$ is a point. Then over most points of $T$, the fiber is $C$ of degree $2$, but over $p$ it's $\mathbb P^2$ of degree $1$. But this is just because studying the leading coefficient of a polynomial, as the polynomial changes degree (careful! this means "dimension" here), is a silly thing to do. Assuming that the dimension is constant not just semicontinuous, then the degree is indeed semicontinuous. Let $X' \subseteq X$ be the closure of the fiber over the generic point, i.e. the union of the components of $X$ that dominate $T$. Then since $C$ is $1$-dimensional and regular, $X' \to X$ is flat, so the degree of fibers is actually constant. Adding back any remaining components of $X$, each of which maps to a point, we increase the degree at those points. 

If $\lambda,\mu$ are two dominant weights for a Lie group $G$, then there is a canonical (up to scale, perhaps) surjection $V_\lambda \otimes V_\mu \to V_{\lambda+\mu}$ of finite-dimensional representations, which I have occasionally heard called the "Cartan projection". To each irreducible (or standard) Harish-Chandra module for $({\mathfrak g},K)$, one can associate a $K$-orbit on $G/B$. For finite-dimensional representations, this orbit is the open $K$-orbit. 

de Branges' proof of Bieberbach's conjecture was, if I recall correctly, one or two hundred pages. (And wrong, but correctable.) Now there is a two-page proof. EDIT: those 2 pages are not a complete proof (oops!), rather they are shortening Weinstein's four-page proof.
