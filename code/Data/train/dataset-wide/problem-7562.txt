Number 2 is answered in the affirmative if we take "functions" to mean "analytic functions". Take $\cos(x)$. It can be shown that there exists no function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \cos(x)$. This follows by the fact: $\cos(x_0) = x_0$ where $x_0 = 0.739805...$, and $-1<\cos'(x_0) < 0$. Therefore if there was such an $f$, $\cos'(x_0) = f'(f(x_0))f'(x_0) = f'(x_0)f'(x_0)$ and $f'(x_0)$ cannot be real. To show there does exists an $f: I \to I$, where $I$ is the immediate basin of attraction about $x_0$ and $\mathbb{R} \subset I$, is a little trickier. You'll have to track down a nice paper constructing it (it's a real hassle to construct); but it is possible. It would take about 10 pages of written work to get it out. Then $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$. There exists exactly two such $f$ corresponding to $f'(x_0) = i\sqrt{|x_0|}$ or $f'(x_0) = -i\sqrt{|x_0|}$. If you want a more trivial example just look at $-x$ which has a square root $ix$, but no real analytic square root. 

I think I just found my answer. The Jacobians in the family are equipped with an action of the group ring $\mathbb{Z}[\xi_{m}]$. So the action on $V_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is that of the group ring $\mathbb{Q}[\xi_{m}]=\prod_{d|m} K_{d}$. So it is a module over this group ring and not just a vector space. 

I think this should be true: This is a sort of Bertini-like argument. Since $X$ is smooth projective (say over $\mathbb{C}$) Bertini says that the set of hyperplanes not containing $X$ and with smooth intersection with it is even dense in $|H|$. Cutting out by generic hyperplane lowers the degree by one and since the dimension of $dimX=d$, the intersection $X\cap H_{1} \cap...\cap H_{d}$ is zero dimensional for generic choices of hyperplanes. We can arrange the Hyperplanes so that the intersection contains the points you said. Just, I am afraid that my argument depends on the position of these points. But I think it might be true in general, you can probably fill in the details! 

Suppose $f_n$ is a sequence of holomorphic functions taking $\mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{C}$ where $\mathbb{D}$ is the unit disk. Further, $f_n$ has a continuous extension to $\overline{\mathbb{D}}$. We can assume $\sum_{n=0}^\infty f_n$ converges normally on compact subsets of $\mathbb{D}$ to a holomorphic function $f$. Additionally, for each $f_n$ we know $\int_C |f_n| < \infty$ for any contour $C \subset \overline{\mathbb{D}}$. Less strictly, so we don't have enough to use the monotone convergence theorem, we know that $\sum_{n=0}^\infty |\int_C f_n| < \infty$. But additionally, for any closed contour $C^*$ in $\overline{\mathbb{D}}$ we know $\int_{C^*}f_n = 0$. Must it follow $$\int_C f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \int_C f_n$$ I'm asking because all the naive instances where the monotone convergence theorem fail are exempt from these criterion. I think there's something more subtle in this instance. I've been able to strengthen the condition to a proof that $$\int_C f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \int_C f_n \,\,\Leftrightarrow\,\, \sum_{n=0}^\infty \sup_{C\subset \overline{\mathbb{D}}}|\int_Cf_n| < \infty$$ Or rephrase it to $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty |\int_C f_n| < \infty\,\, \Leftrightarrow \,\,\,f \, \text{can be continuously extended to}\,\overline{\mathbb{D}}$$ Those are the two avenues I've taken. None have really given me an answer. Any suggestions, comments, questions are greatly appreciated. 

A construction due to Bhargava embeds any finite etale extension of degree $n$ (in characteristic $0$) into an $S_n$-Galois algebra. It seems that the theory of such algebras is similar in depth to, but not a trivial consequence of, Galois theory of fields (e.g. for part 2, how do we compute $[K^H : F]$?) We no longer have that every subalgebra of $K$ is the fixed field of some subgroup; but on the other hand, the elegant properties 4 and 5 are missing from the classical presentation (because the tensor product of fields need not be a field). It could be that this is all a special case of Grothendieck's theory of finite etale covers of schemes, but I wouldn't like to dredge up Grothendieckian formalism while discussing mainly about elementary properties of number fields, with a bit of class field theory. 

Look at Ramanujan Summation, also called indefinite summation. Ramanujan extended The Euler Mclaurin summation method using Bernoulli numbers and a whole stack of ideas. This is a well studied subject. In general, if your $g$ is defined in the right half plane and satisfies for $z = x + iy$ $$|g(z)| < C e^{\rho|x| + \kappa|y|}$$ where $\kappa < \pi$ and $\rho$ is arbitrary, then a unique solution exists, where $f(0) = 0$ and $f(z+1) - f(z) = g(z)$. Ramanujan's formula is rather simple $$f(z) = C + \int_0^zg(t)\,dt + \frac{1}{2}g(z) + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \dfrac{B_{2k}}{2k!}g^{(2k-1)}(z)$$ where $C$ is a constant making $f(0) =0$ and $B_{2k}$ are the bernoulli numbers. Since this is a linear operator on $g$ it is common to write $$\sum_z g = f$$ $$\sum_{j=1}^z g(j) = f(z)$$ $$\sum_1^z g(p)\Delta p = f(z)$$ where each draws the similarity between it and the integral. I can give you a formula for the more restrictive case $\kappa < \pi/2$, which is a modification of Ramanujan's method. $$f(z) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(1-z)}\Big{(}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n+1}g(j)\frac{(-1)^n}{n!(n+1-z)} + \int_1^\infty\big{(}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^{n+1}g(j)\frac{(-w)^n}{n!}\big{)}w^{-z}\,dw\Big{)}$$ which follows by Ramanujan's master theorem. All in all the subject has four names: Indefinite summation, continuum sums, Ramanujan summation, Euler-Mclaurin summation. I can't remember the names of the books, but there are some books on the calculus of finite differences that deal with this subject. The idea goes hand in hand with Newton series as well, where in such a case it is rather trivial to produce an indefinite sum if the function is expanded in a Newton series. I.e: if $$g(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\dbinom{z}{n}$$ In this case it's much easier to work with $g$ bounded in the right half plane, so it's more restrictive. Also, if $g(z)$ has nice decay properties we can always take the wondrous classical equation $$f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty g(z-k) - g(-k)$$ or $$f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty g(z+k) - g(k)$$ which was Ramanujan's motivation, but these are more volatile. 

Let $F$ be a field. By a Galois algebra over $F$ I mean a finite etale extension, that is, a product $K = K_1 \times \cdots \times K_r$ of finite (separable) field extensions, of total degree $[K : F] = n$, equipped with a subgroup $G \subseteq \operatorname{Aut}_F K$ of $n$ linearly independent automorphisms. For example, $\mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{C}$ equipped with the set of four automorphisms $(z,w) \mapsto \{(z,w), (\bar{w},z), (\bar{z},\bar{w}), (w,\bar{z})\}$ is a cyclic Galois algebra over $\mathbb{R}$ of degree $4$. I'd like to find a reference (or counterexample) to the following simple assertions: 

Supposing the pair $f(\cdot)$ and $\phi(s,\cdot)$ don't have to map $\mathbb{C}$ to itself, that $\mathbb{C}$ is weakened to the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$, and $f(0) = 0$ with $|f'(0)| \neq 0,1$, then there always exists a $\phi$ satisfying $f$. It seems though, as soon as we lift from $\mathbb{D}$ (or any simply connected domain biholomorphic to $\mathbb{D}$) to $\mathbb{C}$ it fails. I can show the result in a restricted form, which I also think is interesting 

Let $\phi(\xi) :\mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{D}$ be holomorphic; $\mathbb{D}$ is the unit disk. Let $\phi(0) = 0$, and $0<\phi'(0) = \lambda <1$. Let $\vartheta(w,\xi) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \phi^{\circ n}(\xi)\frac{w^n}{n!} : \mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{C}$, $\vartheta$ is holomorphic. Let $\mathcal{D} = \frac{d}{d\xi}\Big{|}_{\xi=0}$. Then, notably $$\mathcal{D}\vartheta(w,\xi) = e^{\lambda w}$$ $$\frac{d}{dw}\vartheta(w,\xi) = \vartheta(w,\phi(\xi))$$ Naturally $\mathcal{D}$ commutes with $\frac{d}{dw}$. As do its 'iterates' $\mathcal{D}^k = \frac{d^k}{d\xi^k}\Big{|}_{\xi = 0}$. From here we get the weird PDE $$\frac{d}{dw}\mathcal{D}^k \vartheta(w,\xi) = \mathcal{D}^k\vartheta(w,\phi(\xi))$$ We can solve inductively for the functions $\vartheta_k(w) = \mathcal{D}^k\vartheta(w,\xi)$. Off the initial conditions $\vartheta_1(w) = e^{\lambda w}$ we can as our inductive hypothesis assume $$\vartheta_k(w) = \sum_{j=1}^k a_{kj}e^{\lambda^jw}$$ There exists a sequence $\{b_{kj}\}_{1\le j \le k < \infty}$ which can be defined by $$\mathcal{D}^k \vartheta(w,\phi(\xi)) = (\mathcal{D}\phi)^k\vartheta_k + \sum_{j=1}^{k-1}b_{kj}\vartheta_j$$ The initial term $(\mathcal{D}\phi)^k = b_{kk} = \lambda^k$ and the preceding terms $b_{kj}$ can always be solved for purely in terms of algebraic combinations of $\phi^{(k)}(0)$. For an explicit form, the solution is a specific case of Faa Di Bruno's formula. Exploiting the recursion, we return back to our PDE, which we can now write as a list of ODEs, each looking like $$\frac{d}{dw}\vartheta_k - \lambda^k\vartheta_k = \sum_{j=1}^{k-1}b_{kj}\vartheta_j = \sum_{j=1}^{k-1} b_{kj}\sum_{m=1}^ja_{jm}e^{\lambda^mw}$$ Solving these ODEs recursively: constructs the sequence $\{a_{kj}\}_{1\le j\le k < \infty}$, and inductively constructs $$\vartheta_k(w) = \sum_{j=1}^k a_{kj}e^{\lambda^jw}$$ Since $\vartheta$ is holomorphic while $\xi$ is in the unit disk, we can write $$\vartheta(w,\xi) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \Big{(}\sum_{j=1}^k a_{kj}e^{\lambda^jw}\Big{)} \frac{\xi^k}{k!}$$ As the title of the question indicates: 

Yes, you can view this equation as a family of curves (cyclic covers of $\mathbb{P}^{1}$) , as you said we can move each three points to $0,1,\infty$ and hence your family in fact reduces to a point in the moduli space of curves (or $A_{g}$). Your curve will have genus $1$ and is smooth so is an elliptic curve. You can find alot about cyclic covers of $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ in the book "cyclic coverings, calabi-Yau manifolds and complex multiplication" by J.C.Rohde. The main stream of this book as the name suggests is something else, but the generalities on cyclic covers is treated quite nicely here.
