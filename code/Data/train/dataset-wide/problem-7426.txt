If we consider the category of finite, pointed sets and declare cofibrations to be inclusions and weak equivalences to be bijections, we get a Waldhausen category whose $K$-theory spectrum is the sphere spectrum. Given a pointed space $X$, is there a nice description (analogous to the one above) of a Waldhausen category whose $K$-theory spectrum is the suspension spectrum of $X$? My first guess is something like finite, pointed sets equipped with a pointed map to $X$, but I don't really know enough about $K$-theory to prove that this guess is correct (if it even is....) 

Before I answer the question as stated, let me point out that you can also prove the claim as follows: the transfer is induced by a stable map $Y_+\rightarrow X_+$, and the pth Adams operation is a stable cohomology operation after inverting p, so the result is just naturality of cohomology operations. Now for Quillen's argument. Embed $X$ into $S^n$ and so factor the map f as $X\rightarrow Y\times S^n \rightarrow Y$. If the normal bundle of the first map is, say, Spin oriented, then the Gysin map is defined as the composite: $KO(X) \rightarrow KO(Th(\nu)) \rightarrow KO(S^n \times Y) \rightarrow KO(Y)$. Here we use the Thom isomorphism, then the collapse map, then suspension isomorphism- I'm writing on a phone so I didn't put in the proper indices on the KO's or that some of those should be reduced K-theory. Anyway, in this case the normal bundle in question is always trivial, and the Thom isomorphism for a trivial bundle is just the suspension isomorphism. This is what Quillen means by doing a suspension isomorphism and then undoing it. The two arguments aren't unrelated of course, especially if you recall how the stable map yielding the transfer is constructed. 

I don't know what 'explicit' means, but this is all covered in Higher Algebra very well. If you want a simplicial category at the end of the day, you can either... 

Probably not quite what you're looking for, but it certainly involves modular representation theory, and it's really neat! A baby version of descent is used in a proof of Quillen's stratification theorem. Suppose we have a compact Lie group, $G$, and a smooth $G$-manifold $X$ (if you'd like to feel modular, take $G$ to be finite and $X$ to be a point). We'd like to show that the map $H_G^*X \rightarrow \lim H_G^*A$ is an F-isomorphism, where cohomology has coefficients in some fixed prime, the limit is taken over a certain category involving components of fixed point subspaces and the elementary abelian subgroups of $G$, and an "F-isomorphism" is a map of rings such that all elements of the kernel are nilpotent and every element, $s$, in the codomain satisfies $s^{p^n} \in \text{image}$ for some $n$. (This implies, in particular, that the Krull dimensions of each ring are the same.) In the case of the point, the right hand side is the limit over elementary abelian subgroups of $G$. Here's one of the ways that Quillen does this. First he constructs a space $\mathcal{F}$ as follows: Choose a faithful unitary representation of $G$, say on $U(n)$, and let $\mathcal{F} = U(n)/S$ where $S$ is the subgroup of the maximal torus consisting of elements of order $p$ (i.e. matrices with $p$-roots of unity on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere). This space has all sorts of nice properties as a $G$-manifold (in particular, all of the isotropy groups are elementary abelian subgroups.) Now, Quillen proves the theorem for the $G$-manifold $X \times \mathcal{F}$ (notice that even if all you cared about was when $X$ is a point, you'd still need the general statement of the theorem) and then uses a fun argument using a baby version of faithfully flat descent to deduce the theorem for $X$! I won't give the argument here, but basically he uses the sequence $X \times \mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow X \times \mathcal{F} \rightarrow X$ (I don't know how to make a double arrow here...) and shows that applying H^* gives an equalizer sequence (this is the "descent" part), and applying the functor appearing on the right hand side of the theorem also gives an exact sequence. Then one does a 3-lemma esque argument to conclude the result. It's really neat! For a much more detailed and entertaining account, see $URL$ 

When $G=*$, a space $X$ represents a functor with homotopy coherent transfers if and only if $X$ is a $\Gamma$-space (and hence equivalent to an $E_{\infty}$-space). Actually, you might take 'being a $\Gamma$-space' as the definition of having homotopy coherent transfers. One could (and Quillen did) ask whether this is equivalent to just asking that $[-,X]$ has functorial transfers for finite covers. That was called "the transfer conjecture". This turns out to be the same as asking that $X$ be an $H_{\infty}$-space. And so one asks "Is every $H_{\infty}$-space an $E_{\infty}$-space?" The answer is no, and a counterexample was provided by Kraines and Lada. For finite $G$, a $G$-space $X$ represents a functor with homotopy coherent transfers for finite covers (of $G$-spaces) if and only if it admits the structure of an equivariant Segal space (and hence is equivalence to a $G-E_{\infty}$-space. So, up to group completion, $X$ is the zeroth space of a genuine $G$-spectrum (and so represents an $RO(G)$-graded cohomology theory). If $X$ is a $G$-space representing a functor with homotopy coherent transfers for finite covers fibered in trivial $G$-sets, then this is like saying $X$ is an $E_{\infty}$-space in $G$-spaces. In particular, up to group completion, it admits ordinary deloopings and represents a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded cohomology theory for $G$-spaces. In your situation, you seem to have a space $X$ as in (3) and are asking if it's possibly to ask that $[-,X]$ admit transfers for all covers without requiring that $X$ admit $RO(G)$-deloopings, i.e. without requiring that $X$ be equivalent to a $G-E_{\infty}$-space. My guess is that this is possible, but that any example would be manufactured (like the counterexample of Kraines and Lada). However, I should point out that this situation is not precisely parallel to that in (1) because you have already placed an $E_{\infty}$-structure on $X$, so it's at least plausible that this homotopy coherence together with some weak notion of more exotic transfers could be enough... but again, I doubt it. In your last comment you mention that you are only interested in transfers for covers with cyclic structure group. Even for those, I think I stand by my intuition from (4), but I could be wrong. One imagines that whatever obstruction is responsible for establishing the conjectured example in (4) would be known to cyclic covers, especially after localizing at a prime. I've gone this whole answer without saying $N_{\infty}$-operad. Consider it said. (It's relevant to this business of asking for fewer transfers, somewhere between "fibered in trivial $G$-sets" and "fibered in arbitrary $G$-sets". Blumberg-Hill is the place to learn about these.) 

Let me expand a little on what Qiaochu and Craig mentioned. If you want an obstruction theory for building an uber-gadget, you'll need (i) an algebraic approximation to such gadgets, and (ii) a way to resolve every uber-gadget by special uber-gadgets where the algebraic approximation remembers everything about the thing you started with. Condition (i) usually takes the form of a functor $Uber \rightarrow Approx$ with some nice properties, and then for (ii) you hope that maybe there is an adjoint to this functor, and that $Uber$ is generated under sifted colimits by the essential image of this adjoint (I'm sweeping everything important and techncal under the rug). Once you have this, you can start trying to formulate the problem of starting with an object in $Approx$ and adding structure until you get to an object in $Uber$ (this shouldn't be too surprising: you've essentially required that $Uber$ is monadic over $Approx$ so that elements of $Uber$ are like elements of $Approx$ with extra structure). If you do this very carefully, you'll have expressed the space of objects lifting a given one. All of this is developed for $E_\infty$-ring spectra in Goerss-Hopkins and you can find write-ups here: $URL$ . I'm pretty sure the same proofs give you an $E_n$-obstruction theory, and this appears elsewhere as well. Now, you probably already knew all that. But I said it to remind you that there's just no hope of proceeding if you don't have (ii) and for (ii) you need your algebraic approximation to be strong enough. So you shouldn't ask: "Given a spectrum, what's the space of $E_\infty$ ring structures on is?" You need to have a little bit to get going, some candidate for the Dyer-Lashof operations or (in the Goerss-Hopkins case) a commutative comodule algebra over $E_*E$ for a suitable cohomology theory, $E$. Otherwise your answer will probably be ridiculous and uncomputable (this is sort of what Qiaochu was pointing out.) 

Since this example is kinda fun, let me spell it out. (The intuition should be clear though: the simplicial category I defined is really the result of taking a not-so-exciting (2,2)-category and applying the nerve. This 2-category has non-invertible 2-morphisms, so its nerve shouldn't magically have invertible 2-morphisms. And indeed that's what we'll see: the horn filling condition for 3-horns forces the 2-morphisms to be invertible (up to yet higher morphisms, which won't play a role here)) First of all, for any poset $P$ with pairwise maxima, the assignment $(a,b) \mapsto \mathrm{max}(a,b)$ gives $P$ the structure of a commutative monoid in the category of posets. Taking the nerve now yields a simplicial commutative monoid $NP$, and we can then build a simplicial category with one object, which I'll call $\mathcal{C}_P$ since $BNP$ looks strange. Here is what the coherent nerve of $\mathcal{C}_P$ looks like in low dimensions: 

For this question I should be more specific about $BX_U$. This is defined as the geometric realization of the nerve of the topological category $X_U$ whose points are pairs $(x, U_{\sigma})$ where $U_\sigma$ is a finite intersection of elements of $U$ and $x \in U_\sigma$. Morphisms are inclusions $U_\sigma \subset U_\tau$. The filtration on $BX_U$ is given by looking at the images of $(NX_U)_n \times \Delta^n$ in $BX_U$, where $NX_U$ is the nerve. 

Just a few ideas/observations... For 1: a. A functor is an isomorphism if and only if the induced map is an isomorphism of simplicial sets. b. So a functor is an equivalence if and only if the induced map on the nerves of skeleta is an isomorphism. (This isn't very helpful though...) c. Any map of simplicial sets $NC \rightarrow ND$ gives us a functor $C \rightarrow D$ (just look at the map on 0-simplices, 1-simplices, and 2-simplices to see what to do). So a map $NC \times \Delta^1 \rightarrow ND$ corresponds to functor $F: C \times [1] \rightarrow D$ (since $N[1] = \Delta^1$), but this is precisely a natural transformation of functors $C \rightarrow D$. Thus, if we have $NC \rightarrow ND$ and $ND \rightarrow NC$ such that the composites are "homotopic" to the identity (where I mean, use $\Delta^1$), then the original functor is an equivalence. d. None of what we have said so far is any easier than just proving your original map is an equivalence. One thing you could do, that allows for homotopy theory, is associate to $C$ a stronger invariant. For example, take the bisimplicial set call it $\mathfrak{N}C$ given by: $\mathfrak{N}C_k = N(\text{iso }C^{[k]})$ (where "iso C" means "maximal groupoid" or "just take isomorphisms as your morphisms." This is a special case of a construction of Rezk's). It turns out that a functor is an equivalence if and only if the induced map of these special nerves is a weak equivalence. e. I don't think that checking it's a weak equivalence works for the usual nerve, since (for example) any category with a final object has a nerve that's weakly equivalent to a point. However it is probably the case that if the induced map on nerves is a categorical equivalence then the original categories are equivalent. This brings us to point 2... For 2 a. I'm not sure if there is any way of showing that a functor between $\infty$-categories is an equivalence (in general) that does not amount to showing the induced map on mapping spaces is an equivalence. However, you can do all of this without mentioning simplicial categories. Given an $\infty$-category, $\mathcal{C}$, we can define something (or several things) equivalent to the mapping space between two objects in $\mathfrak{C}[\mathcal{C}]$; let Hom_C^R(x,y) be the simplicial set defined by requiring that a map $\Delta^n \rightarrow \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}^R(x,y)$ be a map $z: \Delta^{n+1} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ such that $d_0z$ is the constant diagram on $y$ and $z$ evaluated on the initial vertex is $x$. (Actually this might be $\text{Hom}^L$, I can't remember off the top of my head). Anyway, this turns out to be a Kan complex (i.e. a space), and Lurie/Joyal show that it's the same as what you get after doing $\mathfrak{C}$. See Lurie for more. b. Given the description above, we can say a functor is an equivalence if it induces a weak equivalence of Kan complexes for all mapping spaces as we defined above (i.e. fully faithful), and essentially surjective (i.e. every object is equivalent to something in the image). This isn't easy to do but... c. In general, an equivalence of $\infty$-categories is kind of a big deal. In particular, it should be at least as hard as writing down various Quillen equivalences of model categories, right? Maybe slightly easier, but still quite hard. Anyway, I realize this probably isn't what you want, but it's the best I can do at the moment! I'll let you know if I think of anything more helpful (but probably someone brighter will end up posting something more helpful soon...) 

I don't know if this is short enough, but: Once we know $R^{(-)}$ preserves coproducts we're left with reflexive coequalizers, and we can compute those after forgetting down to Set. But it's not so hard to see that for any set $Y$, the functor $\text{Hom}(-, Y): Sets^{op} \rightarrow Sets$ commutes with coequalizers as long as $Y$ is nonempty. 

I think you prove this pretty much as one does in an ordinary abelian category. First note that the coequalizer $f,g: X \rightarrow Y$ is also given by the pushout of $(f, 1)$ and $(g, 1)$, both maps $X \oplus Y \rightarrow Y$. (This is proven exactly as in the ordinary case, by checking universal properties). So it suffices to identify this pushout with the other. For this, note that the pushout of $X \rightarrow 0$ along the map $X \rightarrow X \oplus Y$ given by $(1, -g)$ is $Y$ together with the map $X \oplus Y \rightarrow Y$ given by $(g, 1)$ (since $g-g = 0$). Now use the pasting lemma for pushouts (which works in an $\infty$-categorical context, Lemma 4.4.2.1 in HTT). Here's a few more details if you don't appreciate how reckless I'm being: For the first step it suffices by Lemma 4.2.4.3 of HTT to show that the map $\text{Fun}(\text{Fork}, \mathcal{C}) \rightarrow \text{Fun}(\Delta^1 \vee \Delta^1, \mathcal{C})$ given by the construction I've outlined above, is fully faithful. That way the object representing the functor assigning to an object the space of maps out of a fork diagram or a deleted square corresponding to it will be represented by equivalent objects, by Yoneda. To prove this, note that we have an inverse functor defined on the essential image which is an equivalence by the universal property of a coproduct, then the result follows by 2 out of 3. To show that the pushout of $X \rightarrow 0$ by $X \rightarrow X \oplus Y$ is as described we will use another pasting argument. First note that the cofiber of the anti-diagonal $$X \stackrel{(1,-1)}\rightarrow X \oplus X$$ is just $X$ where the map $X \oplus X \rightarrow X$ is addition. Using this pushout square and the fact that the pushout of $+: X \oplus X \rightarrow X$ along $$X \oplus X \stackrel{(1, g)}\rightarrow Y$$ is $Y$ with the desired map, we can apply the pasting lemma and we're done. I think I can make this last part a little more rigorous using the characterization of the additive inverse of a morphism given by Lemma 1.1.2.10 in Higher Algebra. If you like I can add that in later... 

I assume that he's referring to Steenrod operations at the end there... Anyway, I know there are probably fancier examples using Zabrodsky mixing, but I like this one because we see an explicit obstruction to straightening the homotopy associativity, via the Steenrod operations.
