In my economics classes we have studied some really rudimentary concepts about insurance. I'm not really sure what qualifies as insurance to be honest. I was wondering if options are considered a form of insurance? Is that the right way to think about options? Perhaps a better way of phrasing the question is, "Is the primary purpose of options to provide insurance against changes in the stock's underlying value?" 

Suppose I have $U(x,y)$ and a level set of indifference curves. Suppose the value of $U$ along a given curve is $\bar{U}$. We know $dU = 0$. We compute total derivative, rearrange, and now have $$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{U_x}{U_y}$$ My Confusion and Question: $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is written as a function of a single variable right? But when we talk about $MU$, we always talk about it as a multivariable function. I thought $MRS$ was the ordinal utility analog of the cardinal utility $MU$. So why is $MRS$ a single variable function? 

A Lagrangian optimization problem that solves for a Pareto optimal allocation. A Lagrangian optimization problem that solves for an allocation that is a Walrasian equilibrium. 

Two goods $x,y$ are perfect complements if they have the utility function $$U(x,y) = \min \lbrace ax,by \rbrace $$ $$a,b \in \Bbb{Q}^+$$ My professor said $x,y$ have to be normal goods but didn't explain why well enough that I could understand. My Question: Are perfect complements always normal goods? If so, why? 

I did a practice problem set. I was given a production function $F(K,L)$ and had to derive the firm's cost function. To do this, I used the following relationship: \begin{equation} \frac{MP_L}{MP_K}=\frac{w}{r} \end{equation} I found this formula in a set of lecture notes online. I have no idea where it comes from. I understand what $MP_K$, $MP_L$, $w$, and $r$ are but I don't know why these ratios are equal. I got the problem correct, but I want to understand this point better. My Question: Can someone explain why this ratio is true? 

The social planner problem is \begin{align} \max_{\lbrace x_i,y_i,x_j,y_j \rbrace } &\theta_i U_i(x_i,y_i) +\theta_j U_i(x_j,y_j) \\ & \text{s.t.}\\ &x_i+x_j = \omega_i^x + \omega_j^x\\ &y_i+y_j = \omega_i^y + \omega_j^y\\ \end{align} where $\theta_i,\theta_j$ are weights. As I understand it, with a proper choice of weights, one can turn the Social Planner's problem into 

In my professors lecture notes (it's more like a book), he states four properties of preferences relations: 

In my econometrics and economics classes, the term autocorrelation has come up this quarter. I have read the Wikipedia pages about it and tried to understand them, but they are a bit beyond me. They use too much math from signal analysis that I don't have time to study at the moment. But I would still like to understand the general idea. Can someone provide a brief explanation of what autocorrelation is and how this concept is used to understand price and analyze price trends? 

MY QUESTION What is the income effect and substitution effect in the case of changing $A$? According to what my instructors have said (and I don't think they explain it well at all), the income effect is the latter change I described due to $A$ (i.e. decrease in $\ell$) whereas the substitution effect is due to the former change (increase in $\ell$). But these don't match the income and substitution effects I learned about in my class on Marshallian and Hicksian demand functions. It seems very confused. Can someone define these explicitly or explain why my instructor has misused these two terms? 

For a single variable price change, $$CV = - \int_{p_x^o}^{p_x^f} x_H(\rho,p_y,v^o)d\rho$$ $x_H$ is the Hicksian demand function for good $x$. What happens if both prices change? How does one calculate this? What about for an $n$ dimensional price vector where all the prices are changing? Please give an example using double integrals. 

As I wrote the question, I noticed the following: I can see one would write for $n$ agents $$\sum_{i} p_{x_i}\frac{MU^i_g}{MU^i_{x_j}} = p_g$$ Now we can write that as $$\frac{MU^i_g}{MU^i_{x_i}} + \sum_{j\neq i} \frac{p_{x_j}}{p_{x_i}} \frac{MU^j_g}{MU^j_{x_j}} = \frac{p_g}{p_{x_i}} $$ 

Suppose I have two goods $x$ and $y$ and their associated prices $p_x$ and $p_y$. Income $m$. $x^H$ is Hicksian demand and $x^M$ is Marshallian demand. Slutsky Equation: $$\frac{\partial x^M}{\partial p_x} = \frac{\partial x^H}{\partial p_x} -\frac{\partial x^M}{\partial m} x^M $$ Elasticity Version: $$\varepsilon_{x,p_x}^M = \varepsilon_{x,p_x}^H - \eta_x s_x$$ $$s_x = \frac{p_x x}{m}$$ My professor claims $$\varepsilon_{x,p_x}^H =-s_y \sigma $$, but didn't give a proof even when asked. Nor could my TA provide one. $\sigma$ is the elasticity of substitution My Question: Can someone show why $\varepsilon_{x,p_x}^H =-s_y \sigma $? 

Suppose I have $$\text{apples} \succ \text{pears} \succ \text{pineapples}$$ I can map this onto the natural numbers as follows $$\text{apples}\mapsto 1$$ $$\text{pears}\mapsto 2$$ $$\text{pineapple}\mapsto 3$$ But for weak preferences we might have $$\text{apples} \sim \text{pears}$$ But this wouldn't map bijectively onto the natural numbers because then for example $$\text{apples} \mapsto 2$$ $$\text{pears} \mapsto 2$$ My Question: What do we map weak preferences on to? Or do we relax the assumption the map has to be bijective and allow it to be a surjective mapping onto $\Bbb{N}$? 

Consider a Robinson Crusoe economy. Let $c$ be consumption and let $l$ be leisure. Our utility function is defined as $$U(c,l)$$ Geometrically, I think we can say his indifference curve should be concave up, so therefore $\frac{dc}{dl} >0$ and $\frac{d^2c}{dl^2} >0$. Typically we have a production function $$y = f(\ell)$$ where $\ell$ is labor, $f'>0$,$f''<0$ and $c \leq y$. Also, I think $l = 1 - \ell$. Also, note $$MRS = MPL$$ WHY INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY MIGHT INCREASE LABOR Suppose $f(\ell)=A \sqrt{\ell}$. Then $$MPL = f'(\ell) = \frac{A}{2\sqrt{\ell}}$$ So then if $A \rightarrow \lambda A$, then for fixed $MPL$ we must have $$MPL = \frac{\lambda A}{2\sqrt{\lambda^2 \ell}}$$ In other words, if $A$ increases, Crusoe works harder if we assume $MPL$ is fixed. 

So far, the models of Signaling Games I have seen involve two players. One player is known as the Sender and has more information. The other player is known as the Receiver and has less information. But suppose I have two people who each don't have information about the other. Now they start sending signals and learn about the other. Are there models of Signaling Games that cover such dynamics where both players are senders and receivers? 

Does a monotonic transformation of a homothetic utility function imply the preference relation on the set of consumption bundles is still homothetic? Obviously, if a utility function on a set of consumption bundles is homothetic, then the preference relation is homothetic. 

I am having difficulty with a particular bliss point problem. The basic issue I have is my approaches seem flawed and I can't tell why. The equation is $$U(x,y) = 36x -4x^2 + 6y-2y^2$$ subject to $$ 5x + 7y=40$$ My first instinct was to use the method of Lagrangian multipliers. But I had this on an exam this afternoon and my professor said I shouldn't use it here. I don't understand why. I tried it using wolfram alpha and also solved it by hand and got the same results $$(4.78,2.29)$$ approximately as the optimum bundle. But seemingly this isn't the train of thought I was supposed to use. I then had another idea. I can solve for $$U_x=U_y=0$$ because at the bliss point you should have MU equal to zero. \begin{align*} 36-8x &= 0 \\ x&=\frac{36}{8}=4.5\\ 6-4y&=0\\ y&=\frac{6}{4}=1.5 \end{align*} But this lead to different results than just using TMoLM. My Question: Can someone explain why TMoLM isn't the right approach? Why does it lead to different results then what my professor suggested and what others have said in the comments? 

I understand that there are two common applications of Lagrangian multipliers in consumer theory: the utility maximization problem (UMP) ans the expenditure minimization problem (EMP). These seem like the same problem to me but with different parameters being the focus. Why does my professor emphasize the importance of duality between these theories? I don't understand why both are needed. my question: To what extent are the UMP and EMP different economic ideas/problems as opposed to just simply being a different way of mathematically stating the same thing? 

He then goes on to discuss utility levels and indifference curves. He describes indifference curves as level sets and that consumption bundles that the consumer is indifferent between lie on the same indifference curve. My Question: For a given set of consumption bundles, how do we know there are any bundles that the consumer is indifferent between? I don't see how we can define indifference curves without knowing that. 

In my last problem set, I had to solve both the Utility Maximization Problem (UMP) and Expenditure Minimization Problem (EMP) for a Cobb Douglas utility function. Recall, Cobb Douglas is defined as $$U(x,y) = x^\alpha y^\beta$$ I can compute the EMP or UMP. I can then find the other by "duality". But writing the problem was very tedious and messy. I ended up with an indirect utility function like this $$v(p_x,p_y,m) = \left(\frac{\alpha m}{p_x}\right)^\alpha \left( \frac{\beta m }{p_y}\right)^\beta$$ and doing the Lagrangian was kind of clunky with all this multiplication going on. Is there a simpler way to write the problem that can save me time / effort? 

I recently learned how to solve the following type of problem using the method of Lagrangian multipliers: Given a consumer with utility function $u(x,y)$, wealth $w$, prices $p =(p_x,p_y)$, budget constraint $w = xp_x + yp_y$. Find the demand function for $x$ and $y$. I also learned how to find cost functions by plugging these demand functions into my budget constraint and rewriting to give a cost function. But those cases all involved having $w$ and somehow budgeting with respect to that budget. Problem Setup: Suppose a firm is a price-taker with market price for the good in question $p$. Suppose the firm has a production function $F(K,L)$. Derive the firms cost function. My Question: How should I approach this problem? My Ideas / Thoughts Relevant for Solving Problem: I am not given wealth $w$ although I suppose I could assume any firm who is purchasing has some budget. All previous problems I have done involved two goods, but this involves one. Perhaps I could therefore have a budget constraint $w = qp$ where $q$ is the quantity and $p$ is the price as given to the price-taking firm. But Lagrangian multplier problems I have seen involve two variables and this is just a function of one. Remark: The specific production function I am using is $F(K,L) = \sqrt{k} + \sqrt{l}$. I only include this in case it's relevant. I want to solve the problem myself. 

I have never used FRED before. I need to locate the annual growth rate in Real GDP to do some data analysis for my intro macro class. The TA and the Prof were utterly unhelpful and I'm frankly lost. Specifically, I think I am supposed to use this site: $URL$ If you click on Graph tab, I can adjust the data present. However, there are a bunch of options and I can't tell which one I need. MY QUESTION (1) Am I looking in the right spot on FRED for the aforementioned information I'm interested in? (2) If I am in the right spot, which version of the data do I want? Do I want "Percent change from preceding period" or "Percent change from year ago" for example. Also, what aggregation method. I googled this terms to no avail. 

WHY INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY MIGHT DECREASE LABOR But increasing $A$ would also mean essentially that Crusoe gets more production per unit of labor consumed. This gives him more $c$ available. This will mean his $MU_c$ goes down. Recall $$MRS = \frac {U_l} {U_c}$$ If we assume $MRS$ remains constant, then $MU_l$ must go down to offset this change. This implies $l$ goes up and therefore, $\ell$ goes down. So one could also argue changing $A$ results in $\ell$ going down.
