Reason #2 is enough, on its own, that this would never happen in practice. But since the premise of the question appears to be that, somehow, that reason has been bypassed, let me go through the relevant calculations. First of all, the amount of energy in the particle needs to be enough to cancel out the binding energy of the galaxy and all the stars and planets inside it. From this presentation, slide 10, suppose the galaxy's gravitational binding energy is $M(10^{-3}c)^2$, which works out to roughly $10^{53}\text{ J}$ assuming $M \approx 10^{12}M_\odot$. This would be the amount of energy required to separate the galaxy into individual stars. Then, let's approximate the amount of energy required to separate all the stars, planets, etc. into atoms as $10^{42}\text{ J}$ per solar mass, which gives another $10^{54}\text{ J}$ total. So the incoming particle will have to have $10^{54}\text{ J} \approx 10^{73}\text{ eV}$ in the galaxy's rest frame. (Actually a little more because it needs to transfer some energy to the remnants of the galaxy as kinetic energy, but this excess is something like a factor of $10^{-6}$ smaller and thus negligible.) So suppose we have a particle of energy $10^{73}\text{ eV}$ somehow propagating through the universe. Now, we know nothing about how a particle with such a tremendous amount of energy would actually interact with ordinary matter. Such a high energy is firmly into the domain of (beyond-)nstandard-model physics. For purposes of a science fiction story, you could make it do all sorts of weird things. But, sticking to the current science for the sake of argument, let's say you naively extrapolate the known behavior of high-energy scattering to this $10^{73}\text{ eV}$ cosmic ray. The next thing to figure out is the probability of the cosmic ray scattering off the particles it meets. And the relevant parameter to characterize this is the squared center-of-mass energy, $s$. For a collision between a massive particle in motion, with mass $m_1$ and energy $E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2$, and a massive particle at rest, with mass $m_2$ and energy $E_2 = m_2 c^2$, this is $$s = m_1^2 c^4 + m_2^2 c^4 + 2E_1 E_2$$ Alternatively, for the same massive particle and a photon which has energy $E_2$ and is approaching the moving particle at angle $\theta$ (with $\theta = 0$ being a head-on collision), assuming $E_1 \gg E_2$, the CM energy is $$s = m_1^2 c^4\biggl(1 - \frac{E_2}{E_1}\cos\theta\biggr) + 2(1 + \cos\theta)E_1 E_2 + \text{negligible terms}$$ So $s$ for an interaction between the cosmic ray and a massive particle is a fixed, very large value. Interactions of this sort generally get less likely as $s$ increases, so a particle with $10^{73}\text{ eV}$ is basically going to pass right through matter as if it doesn't exist. But for an interaction between the ray and a photon, $s$ varies depending on the angle. It goes as low as $s = (m_1 c^2)^2$, when $\theta = \pi$ (the photon and the cosmic ray are traveling in the same direction), and goes all the way up to more than $4E_1 E_2 \approx 10^{89}\,\mathrm{eV}^2$. This is important because the interaction between two particles is most likely at a resonance, a center-of-mass energy which corresponds to the mass of some intermediate particle. For example, the delta baryon has a mass of $1232\,\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$, and therefore interactions between charged particles and photons are particularly likely when $s = (1232\,\mathrm{MeV})^2$. The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides an ample supply of photons traveling in all directions, and thus any charged particle with enough energy to achieve $s \ge (1232\,\mathrm{MeV})^2$ in a collision with a CMB photon will be very likely to do so quickly. Particles with such high energy simply do not propagate very far through space. This effect is known as the GZK limit, and the associated energy cutoff is on the order of $10^{19}\text{ eV}$ (in the rest frame of the CMB). The exact order of magnitude varies by the type of particle involved, but regardless of what type of particle it is, anything that has $10^{73}\text{ eV}$ will be well over it. In fact, a high-energy cosmic ray with enough energy to destroy a galaxy will hit not only the delta resonance, but the resonances of every particle in the standard model, and any unknown particles that may exist with higher masses up to a very high threshold. (Higher than the Planck mass, thus underscoring the need for a theory beyond the standard model to explain what happens.) Anyway, the gist is that a particle with this huge amount of energy will pretty much immediately produce a shower of other particles of all sorts, with energies rapidly dropping as the shower progresses. This is actually perfect for your scenario, because it spreads out the immense amount of energy from one particle (which, as I mentioned, passes right through matter) to a broad swath of particles which is rather well distributed for galaxy destruction. One might then consider the question of how close to the galaxy you have to produce the highly energetic particle in order to make this work. The answer to that depends on the characteristic length scale of the shower, which in turn depends on the scattering cross section and some complicated math that I don't want to get into now. If I figure it out later, I'll come back and add details, but for now, my conclusion is that if you ignore the main reason this could never happen, it actually seems quite plausible. 

screenshot from the film This may have something to do with the fact that the initial plasma jet from the aliens' weapon is a tall, thin cylinder, rather than a small sphere as a nuclear bomb would be. That would tend to push the explosive force horizontally outward at first. (This may also explain why they prefer to shoot into tall buildings... though why not go for the Washington Monument?) But once the fireball expands to larger the height of the cylinder, it won't really matter what its initial shape was; it will continue to expand in all directions equally. This, I think, is the most difficult thing for real science to explain. Explosions don't choose directions unless forced to do so. (citation: rockets) So the aliens' technology must be doing something to alter the dynamics of the explosion. I can think of two obvious possibilities: 

As you realized, conservation of energy is the key. Destroying buildings takes energy, and that energy has to come from somewhere. It can't come from the buildings themselves (citation: cities do not spontaneously explode1), so it has to come from the weapon. Basically, the weapon has to shoot enough energy to destroy a city into one building. Physically, there's no problem with having that amount of energy concentrated in a small area. We do it with nuclear weapons, as other answers have pointed out. Now, when a nuclear weapon explodes, the nuclear reaction itself takes something on the order of microseconds. After that time, the explosion is just an expanding ball of hot plasma. So it's relatively believable that the aliens could have some sort of plasma jet weapon, perhaps, which could create an equivalent ball of plasma without needing a nuclear bomb to get it started. The aftermath would be pretty much the same as a nuclear weapon's explosion: you'd get more or less the same shockwave, the same mushroom cloud, the same intense heat near ground zero, and so on. Of course, that's not what happened in the movie. The destructive force from the aliens' weapon spread out along the ground, not in a spherical shell as would happen from a nuclear bomb. 

Going by real-world physics, this situation is actually quite a bit simpler than it may seem because you only care about the perspective of people on the ships, not the people on the planet (or whatever) they are moving at 70% of light speed with respect to. Imagine yourself, the "narrator", moving along with ship B. In your reference frame, both ships start out just sitting there at rest. Ship A changes its velocity, i.e. it accelerates up to some speed and flies away, then later it comes back. As long as the acceleration happens quickly, this is precisely the classical twin paradox. The speed at which ship A winds up moving, in your reference frame (where B stays at rest), can be calculated from the velocity addition formula: $$\frac{u - v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}} = \frac{0.995c - 0.7c}{1 - 0.995\times 0.7} = 0.972c$$ This is enough information to figure out the total distance ship A will have traveled, as seen by ship B: $$0.972c\times 100\ \text{years} = 97.2\ \text{light years}$$ Half of this distance is covered on the way out, and half on the way back, so ship A has gone $48.6\ \mathrm{ly}$ ahead, as seen by ship B. Furthermore, the time dilation factor a.k.a. Lorentz factor corresponding to this speed is $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.972^2}} = 4.26$$ which means that, if the ships meet again when $100\ \text{years}$ have passed for ship B, the amount of time that will have passed on ship A is $\frac{100\ \text{years}}{4.26} = 23.5\ \text{years}$. For your situation, where the mother is on ship A and the son is on ship B, it is entirely realistic that the son will be biologically older than the mother (or honestly, dead, unless you assume a longer-than-average human lifetime) when she gets back. Of course, you'd also want to know how long ships A and B have left before they run into "the Problem" that ship A found. (Assuming they can't just change course to avoid it... maybe ship B is disabled, and ship A doesn't want to leave it behind for sentimental reasons or some such thing. Doesn't really matter for the calculations.) That really depends on how fast and in which direction the Problem is moving, and by adjusting the velocity of the Problem, you can give them as much or as little time as you want. But I suspect you meant for the Problem to be at rest in the "planet reference frame", i.e. the same reference frame in which the ships are moving at $0.7c$ to begin with. If that's the case, then consider how this situation looks from ship B:
