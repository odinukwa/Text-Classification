Here "nice" means that there is an explicit description of the action of the standard generators of $\mathfrak{g}$, so one could actually write (infinite) matrices for the Lie algebra elements. I have checked some sources including Lie Algebras of Finite and Affine Type by R. Carter and Affine Lie Algebras, Weight Multiplicities and Branching Rules by Kass, Moody, Patera and Slansky, but none contains such details even for the smallest cases like $\tilde{A}_1$. Here is a picture from the second: 

Here $H$ is the maximal split torus of $G_2$, $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $K$ such that $\sigma^2\varphi=1$, $\varphi$ is the Frobenius, $U^1$ and $V^1$ are the subgroups of upper and lower unitriangular matrices stable under the exceptional automorphism of $G_2$ induced by $\sigma$ and the root length changing symmetry of the Dynkin diagram, the subgroup $G^1=\langle U^1, V^1\rangle$ and $H^1=H\cap G^1$. My question: is this still the case? 

My question is just as in the box. Is every smooth projective toric variety diffeomorphic to a quotient of $\prod_i S^{n_i} \times T^k$ (I know torus is a one-sphere but I just wanted to make clear I allow this) by a free torus action? If not which ones can be realized like this? Maybe it can be proven using the Geometric Invariant theory construction. Namely, when is the fiber of the corresponding torus action on $\mathbb{C}^l$ diffeomorphic to the one of the above spaces? 

Let P be a lattice polytope and lying in $ N \times {1} \subset N \times \mathbb{R}$. Let $\sigma$ be the cone over this polytope and $X_\sigma$ be the corresponding toric variety, which is an affine,Gorenstein, toric variety. Is there a simple algorithm for computing the ring of global sections of the structure sheaf on X_{\sigma}? I would like the presentation in terms of generators and relations if possible. If this is not possible in general, I would be happy if this is possible under some nice, fairly general situation. Thank you for your help. I suppose a different version of this question is: Are there computer programs which are freely available and which can make these computations quickly? 

Corollary 7.10 extends this result to rings of the form $A[x_1^\pm,\ldots,x_k^\pm,x_{k+1},\ldots,x_n]$ for $A$ regular. For other Chevalley groups the situation is complicated. One has the stability theorems for $K_1(\Phi)$ in terms of stable rank (or its ramifications such as absolute stable rank or $\Lambda$-stable rank), but they give pretty bad bounds for polynomial rings. There is, however, the following version of Suslin's theorem for symplectic group in a paper "On symplectic groups over polynomial rings" by F. Grunewald, J. Mennicke and L. Vaserstein: 

Your question is essentially about surjective stability for relative symplectic $K_1$. The latter follows from the usual (absolute) surjective stability for $K_1$, which in symplectic case starts at $2n\geq \mathop{\mathrm{sr}}(R)$. To prove this, one can use so-called "Stein relativization", as described in M. Stein, "Relativizing Functors on Rings and Algebraic K-Theory", J.Algebra, 1971. See Corollary 1.7 therein or the remark after Theorem 4.2 in Stein's other paper, "Stability theorems for $K_1$, $K_2$ and related functors modelled on Chevalley groups", Japan J. Math, 1978. It is also possible to prove it directly under somewhat weaker assumprion on a ring by explicit calculations with generators, but since you are interested in Dedekind domains, the usual stable rank condition should suffice. 

Edit: I realize the mathematics below is lacking a precise phrasing. I hope that the intuitiion behind the question is clear enough that a reader will understand the question and provide guidance. The question is essentially to what extent a degeneration of tropical curves reflects an actual degeneration of complex tropical curves in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ More precisely, On page 10 of his paper, $URL$ Mikhalkin discusses the degeneration of a smooth tropical curve to a nodal tropical curve. Given such a local degeneration, which we assume occurs in a one dimensional real family paramaterized by $t$, via some reconstruction process, we can associate for each $t$ an actual hypersurface in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ (either a curve in some degenerated complex structure or a complex tropical curve), whose tropicalization is the tropical curve $\Pi_t$. Is it true that the limiting curve over the nodal tropical curve is nodal? To be more demanding, can one associate to this degeneration in a canonical way a fibration of curves in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$, $H_t \to Spec(\mathbb{C}[\tau,\tau^{-1}])$ such that one fiber has a nodal curve and the rest of the fibers are smooth? The following example makes me believe this may be possible: In the local model corresponding to Mikhalkin's example, we may consider the family of hypersurfaces: $$\tau+x+y+xy $$ when $\tau$ is not $0,1$, the smooth tropical curve is a smooth deformation retract of the amoebaas of curves in this family. The singular tropical is the (tropical) amoeba of: $$ 1+x+y+xy=(1+x)(1+y) $$ 

This is an expansion of my comment. The Smith normal form is a normal form of a matrix with entries in any given PID (but this probably works for non-domains and for Bezout rings in general). It goes as follows: given an $m\times n$ matrix $A$, there exist invertible $m\times m$ and $n\times n$ matrices $B$ and $C$ such that $BAC=\operatorname{diag}(a_1,\ldots,a_r,0,\ldots,0)$. Moreover, the entries $a_i$ satisfy $a_i\mid a_{i+1}$ and are unique up to the multiplication by a unit. This decribes the representatives of $GL(m,R) \backslash M(m,n,R) / GL(n,R)$. From here you can obtain the decription for $SL(m,R) \backslash M(m,n,R) / SL(n,R)$ — no independent multiplication by a unit anymore, so the difference is the same as between $K_1$ and $SK_1$. When $R$ is a Euclidean ring, one has an algorith for computing the Smith normal form. This works for any PID, in fact, but the resulting matrices $B$ and $C$ are not necessary elementary in this case. For a Euclidean ring the algorithm gives you the chain of elementary transfromation for obtaining the SNF. As you mentioned, $E(n,R)=SL(n,R)$ when $R$ is Euclidean, but this is not the case for a PID. This equality fails, for example, for the ring $S^{-1}\mathbb{Z}[x]$, where $S$ is the multiplicative system generated by all cyclotomic polynomials. This is a result of D. R. Grayson — $SK_1$ of an interesting principal ideal domain. Here are two other links with examples: 

I have a naive question I am asking. Given a higher geometric stack X in the sense of Simpson, Toen etc is it true that there is an affinization Spec Gamma(O_X) such that Hom(X, Spec(A))= Hom(A,Gamma(O_X)) for every affine scheme Spec(A)? Or does this require some more hypotheses. I have very much a hard time finding this out. 

Is there an elementary description of the affinization of the algebraic cotangent bundle of $CP^n$? I know that it can be described as some sort coadjoint orbits, but I am interested in a translation of that to concrete equations. Is it correct that the cotangent bundle can be obtained from the affinization by a blowup at a point? If the general equations are too complicated, I would be interested in some low dimensional examples such as n=2,3...

If you ask the matrices to be unipotent, then, first, you can only get matrices from $SL_n$, and second, three is not enough, the torus is the obstacle. But if you take four upper and lower unipotent triangular matrices, you can do it (still in $SL_n$). For this the keyword is "unitriangular factorisation". 

By locally principal ring they mean a commutative ring such that its localization at any maximal ideal is a principal ideal ring. For euclidean ring $A$ this gives $K_1(\mathsf{C}_\ell,R)=0$. As a byproduct they also prove a stronger version of Suslin's theorem for $SL$ and a locally principal ring. They also have a version for Laurent polynomial rings and claim that by using stability theorems for $K_1$ as in M. Stein's papers one can prove the same results for classical simple algebraic groups of relative rank $\geqslant2$, but the latter has never been written in full details.
