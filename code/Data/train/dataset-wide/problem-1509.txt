Swift et al. (2013) performed a similar type of analysis but focused mostly on M Dwarfs. They inferred that M Dwarf stars are expected to have, on average, $\sim2$ planets per star. There are certainly many more such analyses and almost all of them come to the conclusion that there are hundreds of billions of planets in our galaxy. This can be confidently stated based on only the ~3500 exoplanets found so far. 

If this is indeed the source of NTFs, then any galaxy which has or did have starburst formation would likely have NTFs as well. 

Yes it has been observed. There are numerous papers covering this concept. Before I get into weak-lensing (because that is what you reference in your question) I'll note that cosmic shear is simply a specific type of distortion of an object by a lensing event. It is not limited to the weak lensing regime and cases of strong lensing exhibit cosmic shear as well. So images like this one show cosmic shear. As far as cosmic shear by weak lensing goes, the first published and recorded case of a weak lensing measurment was in 1996 and published by Brainerd, Blandford, & Smail (1996). The cosmic shear you speak of is referred to as polarization in that paper, but they're essentially trying to measure cosmic shear. Note also, while this is weak lensing, most of that lensing occurs by one galaxy lensing another. As such it is also termed galaxy-galaxy lensing. Since the first detection, there's been steady, but limited work on galaxy-galaxy lensing and shear measurments by papers such as Mandelbaum et al. (2006), van Uitert et al. (2011), and Velander et al. (2013). I think the Velander paper is the latest and greatest measurements you can get and they have a lot of good material in there. Because you requested an image, I'll pull out one from this paper. 

Yes and no. In general, Dark Matter tends to exist in the same places as galaxies. It isn't really distributed throughout all of space uniformly. It has voids and filaments just like normal matter does. In fact, on the whole, normal matter is a pretty good tracer of where Dark Matter is. In some cases Dark Matter can separate from normal matter, and it's believed by some that Dark Matter can clump in areas where normal matter doesn't, but more or less, on a cosmological scale, it is distributed and acts like regular matter. On short timescales, Dark Matter most just sits there. There isn't mass motion or propagating waves. On long timescales and in very large views, you can see actual motion and interesting structures (e.g., Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations - technically we observe these in normal matter, but Dark Matter would be affected in the same way). To give you an idea of this, check out the Millennium Simulation (that's a YouTube video which moves around and views the results of the simulation). This was a set of simulations of the universe as a whole, in an attempt to test out current theories about our universe and see if those theories could produce a universe that looks like ours. Suffice to say, they were pretty successful. An image of the results of the simulation is shown below. This represents the universe at a very very large scale and you can see all the dark matter and how it is distributed. 

The simplest and shortest answer to this question is that since our universe is flat (to within our error bars), its density must be that of the critical density - that's what it means to be flat! In that case the overall density of the universe, accounting for matter, dark matter, dark energy, etc. is (assuming $H_0=100\ \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$) $$\rho_c = 1.8788\times 10^{-26}\ \mathrm{kg/m^3} = 1.8788\times 10^{-29}\ \mathrm{g/cm^3}$$ If you want to be more precise about it and actually use measurements of our universe, you can go about calculating it by using the density parameters. By definition, the density parameter is defined as $$\Omega \equiv \frac{\rho}{\rho_c}$$ where $\rho_c = 1.8788\times 10^{-26}h\ \mathrm{kg/m^3}$ (notice that little $h$ now included). Numerous missions such as WMAP and Planck have measured these density parameters for the variety of mass-energies in our universe and you can look them up and put them all together to get the total mean density of our universe. Overall, you should find that $$\rho = (\Omega_m + \Omega_c + \Omega_\Lambda + ...)\rho_c$$ where the various $\Omega$s are defined for the various mass-energies in our universe. You can look up values for the density parameters from recent results such as from WMAP or Planck. Just decide on your chosen model and pull out the $\Omega$ values $-$ or more properly the $\Omega h^2$ values if you want to use your own value of $H_0$. It's not too difficult to plug everything in. You'll pretty much always find though, that the sum of the density parameters very nearly equals one and to an order of magnitude you can say $\rho=\rho_c$. 

Short Answer: The simple power law which applies for larger asteroids and comets actually doesn't extend that well to smaller bodies and shouldn't be trusted too much in that range. Long Answer: You're right to be suspicious of using a simple power law to relate asteroid size to quantity at small sizes. Especially because there are known deviations from that power law at certain radii. As wikipedia notes: 

A website trappist.one has been created to detail information about this discovery. In the "Future" section, they specifically state: 

What you're really asking about is less to do with Astronomy and more to do with mathematics. You're basically asking if, given a system of differential equations, will a unique solution exist for all time? For an answer, you should check out the Existence and Uniqueness theorems of differential equations. You'd be better to ask questions like this on the Mathematics stack exchange. However, to discuss the particular, astronomical case you've asked about, the answer is yes, you can run that system both forwards and backwards if you know some initial state. Newtonian mechanics is completely deterministic in that if you know all the equations of motion involved, as well as the entire state of the system at a given time, you can figure out the state of that system at any other time, both in the past and the future. To speak to your particular 3-body orbiting problem though, I'll say that the system of equations is not solvable in closed form - that is, you can't write down an analytic solution to the equations like you could for the 2-body case. As userLTK states, you can write down approximate solutions in the restricted 3-body problem, where one mass is significantly less than the other two and orbits under specific conditions. To get a solution at any time $\hat{t}$, you need to use numerical methods. Of course numerical methods are inherently flawed. Numerical errors build up the longer you simulate due to time steps which are not infinitesimal, from errors within the numerical algorithms used, and general floating point errors. In theory, if you had a computer with infinite precision and infinite computing power, you could solve a 3-body (or n-body) system perfectly, but we live in the real world where such things are impossible. To prove though, that you can figure out the state at any time in the past or present for a three body body, I've written a basic simulation in Python 3. It can run both forwards and backwards from a given start condition and start time. Essentially it puts three nearly identical masses in contrived starting positions and velocities. Below the code are plots of results.
