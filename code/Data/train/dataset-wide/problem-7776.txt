The answer is yes, it is easy to check whether the ordered pair $(A, B)$ generates $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ for $q$ the power of a prime number. Indeed, there exist simple criteria according to Daryl McCullough and Marcus Wanderley, see [1, Section 11]. (Italic means that I am quoting the authors). 

The answer is yes. The identity $SL_n(\ell^{\infty}) = E_n(\ell^{\infty})$ holds for every $n \ge 2$ and $\mathbb{C}$ can be replaced by any normed field. This can be inferred using the following lemma and the two observations below. 

The above claim follows from a theorem of Macbeath [1, Theorem 8.2] while the criteria are based on Dickson's Theorem [1, Theorem 6.1] and another theorem of Macbeath [1, Theorem 8.1]. Side note. Let $G$ be a finite group generated by $k$ elements. Let $\varphi_k(G) = \frac{\vert \text{Epi}(F_k, G) \vert}{\vert \text{Hom}(F_k, G) \vert}$, where $F_k$ denotes the free group on $k$ generators. The ratio $\varphi_k(G)$ is the probability that two uniformly chosen random elements generate $G$. By a theorem of Liebeck and Shalev, we have $\lim_n \varphi_2(G_n) = 1$ for any sequence of non-isomorphic finite simple groups, see [3, Theorem 1.1.1]. For a simple group $G_n(q)$ of Lie type of untwisted rank $n$, we have $\varphi_2(G_n(q)) = 1 - O(\frac{n^3 \log^2(q)}{q^n})$ by results of Kantor, Lubotzky, Liebeck and Shalev, see [3, Theorem 1.1.2]. Addendum. Let $Q(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) \Doteq \alpha^2 + \beta^2 + \gamma^2 - \alpha \beta \gamma - 2$ be the Fricke polynomial. This name was coined because of Fricke's trace identity $$\text{Tr}([A, B]) = Q(\text{Tr}(A), \text{Tr}(B), \text{Tr}(AB)).$$ Here are the five conditions derived by Daryl McCullough and Marcus Wanderley from Dickson's Subgroup Classification Theorem and Macbeath's Fricke polynomial criterion: 

Side note. The answers to this MSE question show why $i(D) = D \setminus \{0\}$ when $D$ is a Dedekind domain and point to interesting references. The condition $i(D) = D \setminus \{0\}$ implies that any ideal of $D$ is generated by two elements, i.e., $D$ is a Bass domain. The class of Bass rings has a well-developed theory, see Bass’s Work in Ring Theory and Projective Modules by T. Y. Lam.

This was proved in [2] and the result was shown to be sharp in [3]. I can’t resist mentioning a humble result of mine, which I would like to believe is entertaining. A finitely generated group $G$ of rank $n$ is said to satisfy the generalized Andrews-Curtis conjecture if every $n$-tuple of elements which normally generate $G$ can be transitioned to an $n$-tuple of generators of $G$ by means of finitely many $AC$-moves, i.e., applying transvections or replacing one component by a conjugate a finite number of times. (If $G$ is the free group on $n$ generators, this is just the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, still unsettled.) Then the result reads as: 

The goal of my answer is to elaborate on steps (1) and (2) of the accepted answer of Steven Landsburg. In particular, I would like to make clear how a "small enough ideal" looks like and how to produce a non-reducible row like the one in Oblomov's comment. This consists essentially in revisiting the proof of [2, Proposition 1.9], with some K-theoretical shortcuts. 

Combining the last observation with the lemma yields the result. Let us detail the case of $SL_2(\ell^{\infty})$. 

Note that the group $S(\Gamma_n)$ is just the kernel $K_n$ of Jim Beck's answer to the initial MSE question. 

Addendum. I found the discussion of Qiaochu Yuan and YCor about projective modules (see comments above) particularly enlightening. This is why I would like to assemble all its fragments here. 

So, the above claim settles OP's question when $n = 1$. Unsurprisingly, the result generalizes to $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the following way. 

This is only a comment about classes of rings in which no counter-examples can be found. Since a one-dimensional GCD domain is a Bézout domain [1, Corollary 3.9], GCD domains will not provide any counter-example. We will show that Dedekind domains will not provide any counter-example either. To do so, we will use the following well-known lemma (see e.g., Matsumura's "Commutative Ring Theory") and two subsequent claims. 

Note that there exists principal ideal domains which are not $GE_2$-rings, e.g., $R = \mathbf{Z}[\frac{1 + \sqrt{-19}}{2}]$ by [1, Theorem 6.1]. The following claim is straightforward. 

[1] I. Kaplansky, "Elementary divisors and modules", 1949. [2] H. Matsumura, "Commutative Ring Theory", 1986. 

Here we denote by $E_n(R)$ the subgroup of $GL_n(R)$ generated by matrices that differ from the identity by a single off-diagonal element. 

In general, we observe that $\{ bX - a \,\vert \, q = \frac{a}{b} \} = \{ dX - dq \,\vert \, d \in \mathfrak{d} \setminus \{0\}\}$ is the set of polynomials in $\ker(\text{eval}_q)$ with degree $1$. The question as to whether the latter set generates $\ker(\text{eval}_q)$ was answered in the negative by a user44191's comment: this doesn't hold when $R = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{5}]$ and $q = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \in \text{Frac}(R)$. Clearly, the ideal $\mathfrak{d}$ of denominators of $q$ contains $2$ and $1 - \sqrt{5}$. It is easy to check that the ideal $\mathfrak{m} = R \cdot 2 + R \cdot (1 - \sqrt{5})$ is a non-principal maximal ideal of $R$ of index $2$. Thus $\mathfrak{d} = \mathfrak{m}$ is not principal. As $X^2 - X -1 \in \ker(\text{eval}_q)$, any polynomial in $\ker(\text{eval}_q)$ is of the form $f(X)(X^2 - X - 1) + g(X)$ with $f(X), g(X) \in R[X]$, $g(X) = 0$ or $\deg(g(X)) \le 1$. Therefore $$\ker(\text{eval}_q) = R[X]((1 - \sqrt{5})X + 2) + R[X]((2X - (1 + \sqrt{5})X) + R[X](X^2 - X - 1).$$ But we can get a positive answer for a class of rings which are not necessarily Noetherian. A domain $R$ is called a locally GCD domain if every localization $R_{\mathfrak{m}}$ of $R$ at a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $R$ is a GCD domain. 

The goal of my answer is to provide references to articles that studied the class of groups under consideration. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the class of the finitely generated groups in which every weakly generating subset is a generating subset. Then this class has been studied, to some extent, in [1] and [2] in the context of the Andrews-Curtis conjecture. Indeed, the authors considered in [1] and [2] the class $\mathcal{MN}$ of finitely generated groups in which every normally generating subset is a generating subset (the notation $\mathcal{MN}$ is used here because the latter class coincides with the class of groups whose maximal subgroups are normal; this is also the class of groups $G$ for which $[G, G] \subset \text{Frattini}(G)$). Clearly, $\mathcal{MN}$ contains $\mathcal{C}$. If every lift in $G$ of a generating subset of $G/[G, G]$ normally generates $G$, then $G \in \mathcal{C}$ if and only if $G \in \mathcal{MN}$. Finitely generated soluble groups have this property. Unfortunately, none of these references answer OP's question: the non-nilpotent examples given in [2] are the Grigorchuck groups and the Gupta-Sidki groups and they don't admit any finite presentation. Still, I find these articles helpful for they certainly improve our understanding of $\mathcal{C}$. Some stability conditions for $\mathcal{MN}$ are established in [2] (the class $\mathcal{MN}$ is stable under direct product [Corollary 2.4, 2], it enjoys some stability under taking finite index subgroups [Proposition 2.3, 2]) and many examples of groups that don't belong to $\mathcal{MN}$ are given (groups with finitely many ends [Proposition 2.5, 2], groups containing a non-abelian free subgroup of finite index [Corollary 1, 2]). There is also this remark, which wasn't mentioned yet, see [Corollary 2, 2]:
