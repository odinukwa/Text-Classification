Good day! Let $V = H^1(\Omega)$, $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^3$. Consider the linear parabolic equation $y' + Ay = f$ where $f \in L^q(0,T;V')$, $y \in W = \{y \in L^p(0,T;V) \colon dy/dt \in L^q(0,T;V')$. $1/p + 1/q = 1$ $ A\colon W \to L^q(0,T;V') $ - linear operator I can't find the theorem of existence of the solution of this equation. Usually it is written about the space $W_0 = \{y \in L^2(0,T;V) \colon dy/dt \in L^2(0,T;V')$. Could you help me, please? Thank you. 

Good day! We have an equation $y'+Ay=Bu$ where $y=\{\theta,\varphi\}$, $A, B$ are nonlinear operators. $u \in L^\infty(\Gamma)$, $\theta, \varphi \in W = \{y \in L^2(0,T;V) : y'\in L^2(0,T;V')\}$, $V = H^1(\Omega)$. If $v = \{v_1, v_2\}$ then $ (Bu, v) = \int\limits_\Gamma \beta u v_1 d\Gamma + \int\limits_\Gamma \gamma u^4 v_2 d\Gamma $. We consider an optimal control problem with the control $u$: $$ J(u) = \| \theta - \theta_d \|_{L^2(0,T;L^2(\Omega))}^2 \to \inf $$ or maybe $$ J(u) = \| \theta - \theta_d \|_{L^2(0,T;L^2(\Omega))}^2 + \mu\|u\|_{L^2(\Gamma)}^2 \to \inf $$ (Here $\theta$ is a solution of the equation $y'+Ay=Bu$.) The set of admissible controls is $$ U_{ad} = \{ u: 0 \leq u \leq M \}. $$ Our goal is to prove the existence of the optimal control. Let $J(u_k) \to j = \inf J$. Since $U_{ad}$ isn't compact we should use weak convergence. $\{u_k\}$ is bounded therefore $u_k \to u$ weakly in $L^2(\Omega)$ (or its subsequence, we also may use any $L^p(\Omega), p\geq 1$). Also $y_k \to y$ weakly in $W$ (because $\{y_k\}$ is bounded in $W$) therefore $y_k \to y$ strongly in $L^2(0,T;H)$. Next we should prove that the pair $\{y, u\}$ satisfies our equation $y'+Ay=Bu$. Thus we need to prove that $u_k^4 \to u^4$ weakly. But in the general case it isn't so. How to prove the existence of the optimal control? Thanks for your help! 

Good day! Let $V = H^1(\Omega)$, $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^3$. Consider the space $W = \{ y \in L^2(0,T;V) \colon dy/dt \in L^2(0,T;V') \}$. It is well-known that $W \subset C([0,T];H)$ where $H = L^2(\Omega)$. My question: for what $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we may assert that $W \subset L^\alpha(0,T;L^\beta(\Omega))$? For example, $W \subset L^\infty(0,T;L^2(\Omega))$ and $W \subset L^2(0,T;L^6(\Omega))$ because $H^1(\Omega) \subset L^6(\Omega)$. May we assert that $W \subset L^8(0,T;L^{24/5}(\Omega))$? Thank you! 

Update (and counter-update) A few weeks after this problem was posted Gjergji Zaimi (private communication) proposed a more general conjecture: Conjecture: Let $P$ be a polytope with no triangular face. Then the maximum number of vertices such that every two vertices belongs to a common facet is attained by all vertices of a single facet. The original question is the case of the associahedron. The case of the permutahedron is known- it is a result by Frankl and Deza- and it is related to extremal combinatorics on permutations. For the cube the result is immediate but can serve as a good starting point for extremal combinatorics (Problem 1 here). Update: Bruno le Floch showed that the more general conjecture is false: He described a quadrangulation of S^2 with 15 vertices and 13 quadrangles having 5 vertices each two on a face. Update Paco Santos proposed the following intermediete conjecture: Conjecture: For every flag simplicial polytope, the maximum size of a set of pairwise intersecting facets is achieved by the facets containing some common vertex. A flag simplicial polytope is a simplicial polytops so that every set of vertices that any two form an edge is the set of vertices of a face. Santos's conjecture thus asserts that the conjecture about polytopes with no triangular faces still applies for dual-to-flag polytopes. 

Alexander Postnikov gave a detailed series of lectures on the positive Grassmanian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (see links below). He also briefly referred to the amplituhedron. Folowwing Postinkov, I can briefly explain the situation as follows: A) The stratification of the positive Grassmanian: Regard the Grassmanian as represented by equivalence classes of $m$ by $n$ matrices ($m \le n$) under row operators. The positive grassmanian is the set of totally-non negative matrices namely those where all $m$ by $m$ minors are nonnegative. It has an important cell-like structure (the open cells are known to be homeomorphic to open balls, their closures are conjectured to be homehomorphic to closed balls) that can be defined in two equivalent ways as follows: Given an ordering of the $n$ columns the cell of the Shubert stratification indexed by a subset $S$ (of size $m$) are matrices whose lexicographically first non-zero minor (w.r.t. the ordering) is $S$.The matroidal stratification is the common refinement of these Shubert decomposition with respect to all permutations. The cell structure studied by Postnikov can be seen a) as the matroidal stratification reduced to this part of the grassmanian; b) Start with the common refinement of Shubert cells with respect to a cyclic family of permutations (for the whole Grassmanian this lies between the Shubert stratification and the matroid one). Then restrict it to the positive Grassmanian. This cell structure has beautiful combinatorial description in terms of certain planar graphs and statistics of permutations. B) The amplituhedron: Recall that every polytope is a projection of a simplex and projections with respect to totally positive matrices give precisely the cyclic polytope. Now, replace the simplex by the positive Grassmanian: The amplitutahedron is a projection of the positive Grassmanian based on a totally positive matrix. So the amplituhedron is a common generalization of the positive grassmanian and the cyclic polytope. 

Let $p$ be a fixed prime. A group $G$ is termed $p$-central if every element of order $p$ in $G$ lies in the center. Having a finite $p$-group $G$ of rank $k$ (the least integer, such that every subgroup of $G$ is $k$-generated), one can prove that $G$ has a normal $p$-central subgroup of index bounded in terms of $k$. This can be proved by taking the centralizer $C$ of a maximal normal elementary abelian subgroup $A$ of $G$; the index of $C$ is clearly bounded in terms of the rank of $A$, and so in terms of $k$, and $C$ is $p$-central by a nice result of Alperin (or, in fact, of Thompson and Feit) which says that every element of order $p$ in $G$ which commutes with $A$ lies in $A$. On the other hand, one can consider the set of all normal subgroups $N$ of $G$, for which $G/N$ is $p$-central. A nice fact is that the quotient of $G$ by the intersection $L(G)$ of all such subgroups, is still $p$-central; so $G/L(G)$ is the unique largest $p$-central quotient of $G$. Is it true that that the order of $L(G)$ is bounded in terms of $k$ the rank of $G$? Thanks in advance 

Let $G$ be a finite minimally $d$-generated $p$-group. If $G$ is relatively free, that is $G$ is a quotient of the free group $F$ on $d$ generators by a fully invariant subgroup of $F$, then the order of $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ reaches its maximal value $|\Phi(G)|^d|\operatorname{GL}(d,p)|$. I thaink this holds also if $G$ is a quotient of $F$ by a characteristic subgroup. Is the converse true? that is, is true that if $|\operatorname{Aut}(G)|=|\Phi(G)|^d|\operatorname{GL}(d,p)|$, then $G$ is a quotient of the free group on $d$ generators by a characteristic subgroup? Thanks in advance. 

Given a finite nilpotent group $G$ and let us denote by $L_n(G)$ the set of left $n$-Engel elements in $G$. Assume that $n$ is the smallest positive integer such that $L_n(G)=G$. Is it true that $G$ is always generated by $G-L_{n-1}(G)$? 

Let $P$ be a $d$-dimensional polytope with $n$ vertices. For every $2$-dimensional face $F$ triangulate $F$ by non crossing diagonals. So if $F$ has $k$ sides you add $(k-3)$ edges. It is known that the total number of edges you get , denoted by $f^{\bf +}_1(P)$ (including the original edges of the polytope) satisfies the inequality $$f_1^{\bf +}(P) \ge dn - {{d+1} \choose {2}}.$$ A polytope is called elementary if equality holds: $$f_1^{\bf +}(P) = dn - {{d+1} \choose {2}}.$$ It is known that If $P$ is elementary so is its dual $P^*$. We can consider the following classes of graphs: 1) $E_d$ = Graphs of elementary $d$-polytopes and all their subgraphs 2) $F_d$ = Graphs obtained by elementary $d$-polytopes by triangulating all 2 faces by non crossing diagonals, and all their subgraphs. For $d=3$ both classes are the class of planar graphs. Conjecture (weak) Graphs in $E_d$ are $(d+1)$-colorable. Conjecture (strong) Graphs in $F_d$ are $(d+1)$-colorable. Remarks: We can start instead of polytopes by arbitrary polyhedral $(d-1)$-dimensional pseudomanifolds. But it is conjectured that with such extensions we will not get new elementary objects. 

$$1-H(\delta) \le R(\delta) \le H(\frac{1}{2} -\sqrt {\delta (1-\delta)}).$$ This formula describes the state-of-the-art lower and upper bound for the rate of binary codes of length $n$, as $n$ tends to infinity, and minimal distance $\delta n$, $0 < \delta < 1/2$. The lower bound is due to Gilbert (1952). Now better lower bound is known today. The upper bound is by McEliece, Rudemich, Rumsey, and Welsh (MRRW) (1977), who described also an improved upper bound for $\delta \ge 0.273$. No better upper bounds than those discovered by MRRW are known today. Van Lint's book on the theory of error-correcting codes is a good source. (*)

Having a finite $p$-group $G$ ($p$ odd). we denote by $\Omega_1(G)$ the subgroup generated by all the elements of $G$ of order dividing $p$. Is there an example of such a group $G$, such that $|G:G^p|>|\Omega_1(G)|$? Assume now that $|G:G^p|>|H:H^p|$, whenever $H<G$. Is it true that $G$ has exponent $p$? Thanks in advance. 

A finitely generated soluble group which satisfies a generalized identity of an arbitrary degree $n$ is not necessarily finite (the infinite dihedral group satisfies an identity of degree $4$). More generally, there is an infinite f.g metabelian group which satisfies a generalized identity of degree $n^2$, for any integer $n\geq 2$. 

Let $G$ be a finite abelian $p$-group. What is known about the minimal number of generators of a $p$-sylow of $Aut(G)$? is it bounded in terms of $d(G)$ the minimal number of generators of $G$ (and perhaps $p$)? 

First I note that your assertion about Alperin's theorem is not true for $p=2$. I think the answer to your second question is negative. There is $p$-groups ($p>3$) having abelian subgroups of index $p^{\frac{p+3}{2}}$, and no normal abelian subgroup of that index. In particular, for $p=5$ the analogue of Alperin's theorem for the index $p^4$ is false. Such a counter example can be found in Berkovich's book "Groups of prime power order I" (see §39) 

Assume that $G$ has order $pq$, where $p\neq q$ are primes. Can $G$ satisfy a generalized identity of degree $p$? 

Let be $G=F/F^p[F,F,F]$, with $F$ denotes the free group on $n$ generators. Then $G$ satisfies $Z(G) = \Phi (G)=G'$. If $x \in G-Z(G)$ then $C_G(x)= \langle x, Z(G) \rangle$ which is abelian as $C_G(x)/Z(G)$ is cyclic. Now we have your condition (1). For (2) observe that $C_G(x)$ has index $p^{n-1}$ in $G$, whenever $x \notin Z(G)$. You can also consider any non-abelian $p$-groups (of order $>p^3$) with a center of index $p^2$. Clearly, for such a group the centralizer of any non-central element $x$ is a maximal subgroup, so has index $p$.
