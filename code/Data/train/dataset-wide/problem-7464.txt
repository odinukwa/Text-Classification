It is hard to know where to begin! A general principle is that as long as you are only concerned with the derived category of a single variety, it is generally sufficient to consider it as a triangulated category; while as soon as you are interested in families of derived categories, it becomes impossible to stay in the triangulated setting, so that it becomes necessary to pass to some homotopical refinement. The basic reason for this is the extremely poor behaviour of the homotopy theory of triangulated categories. The most striking example is the work of Orlov on Fourier-Mukai functors. A triangulated functor between derived categories of schemes is called of Fourier-Mukai type if it of geometric origin, i.e. if it is given by twisting by a complex on the product of the schemes. Orlov showed in the 90's that for smooth projective varieties over a field, any fully faithful functor between derived categories of coherent sheaves is of Fourier-Mukai type. It was expected, or hoped, that every functor is Fourier-Mukai, but this turned out to be impossible to prove in the setting of triangulated categories, literally: a counter-example was finally found last year by Van den Bergh and Rizzardo (arXiv:1410.4039), while the dg-categorical analogue was proved ten years ago by Bertrand To\"en (arXiv:0408337). A brief glance at the latter paper will be enough to convince oneself that the proof relies heavily on studying the homotopy theory of dg-categories. A second important application is algebraic K-theory. At the triangulated level, the only part of the algebraic K-theory of $X$ that can be defined from only the triangulated structure is the Grothendieck group. However, it has been believed that the algebraic K-theory of a scheme can be recovered from its derived category for a long time (in the sense that, if two schemes have triangulated-equivalent derived categories, then their higher K-theory groups are isomorphic). Neeman spent many years working on this problem, and I believe that in the end, his work implies that this is true under some assumptions like regularity. However, the proof takes up eight papers of around one hundred pages each. On the other hand, after work of Schlichting, To\"en and others, it is possible to define the algebraic K-theory of a dg-category in such a way that it recovers Thomason-Trobaugh K-theory for the dg-derived category of a scheme. In fact, one can deduce from this the analogous result for triangulated categories: using the theory of Fourier-Mukai functors mentioned above, it is possible to prove that the derived categories of two schemes (quasi-compact, separated over a field, if I recall correctly) are triangulated-equivalent iff their dg-derived categories are quasi-equivalent. Related to this is the question of descent. As bananastack mentioned, the derived category satisfies Zariski descent only at the dg-level. In fact, at the dg-level it even satisfies Nisnevich descent. I believe the latter fact is due independently to Bhatt, Drinfeld and Lurie. From this it is possible to deduce a nice proof of the theorem of Thomason-Trobaugh on Nisnevich descent for K-theory. The missing ingredient is the localization fibre sequence, which can be deduced from compact generation properties of the derived category, which can in turn be proved in an elegant way at the dg-level, as explained in the beautiful paper arXiv:1002.2599 of To\"en. Finally, let me note that, even though the various dg-enhancements constructed in the literature seem rather complicated, the dg-categorical derived category is in fact a more natural object than the triangulated one, in the following sense. The reason one considers the derived category of $X$ in the first place is in order to talk about "homotopy theory of chain complexes of coherent sheaves on $X$, up to quasi-isomorphism". The naive way to make this precise is to take the Gabriel-Zisman localization of the category of chain complexes at the class of quasi-isomorphisms, and then manually identify the distinguished triangles. The smart way is to take the Dwyer-Kan simplicial localization instead, which is a homotopically correct version of Gabriel-Zisman localization which doesn't kill higher homotopies; more precisely, it is a simplicially enriched category whose simplicial Hom-sets have $\pi_0$ identified with the Hom-sets of the Gabriel-Zisman localization. This gives rise to a dg-enhancement where the distinguished triangles are already built in as the (co)fibre sequences. 

One way to understand your question is in the framework of $\mathbf{A}^1$-homotopy theory. This is because your nerve functor is better understood when defined on a cocomplete category like the category of motivic spaces $\mathrm{Spc}(k)$. The latter is roughly speaking the free $\infty$-cocompletion of the category $\mathrm{Sm}(k)$ of smooth $k$-schemes, localized with respect to Nisnevich covers and $\mathbf{A}^1$-equivalences. (So its objects are $\infty$-presheaves, and it is presented by a model structure on the category of simplicial presheaves on $\mathrm{Sm}(k)$.) The nerve functor $N : \mathrm{Spc}(k) \to \mathrm{sSet}$ is just the restriction of scalars functor induced from $\Delta^\bullet_k : \mathbf{\Delta} \to \mathrm{Spc}(k)$. Since $\mathrm{Spc}(k)$ is cocomplete, by abstract nonsense (as tetrapharmakon mentioned in his answer) this admits a left adjoint which is the (motivic) geometric realization functor $|-|_k : \mathrm{sSet} \to \mathrm{Spc}(k)$. Certainly these constructions have been studied in this setting, in various papers of Voevodsky for example, though I am not sure if he ever used the term "nerve". There is another functor $\mathrm{Sing}_* : \mathrm{Spc}_k \to \mathrm{Spc}_k$ which is given by the formula $$ \mathrm{Sing}_n(X)(U) = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Spc}(k)}(U \times \Delta^n_k, X) $$ for a smooth scheme $U$. This seems to be a more refined version of the construction of Suslin-Voevodsky referenced by Tom Goodwillie, and I believe that these simplicial sets are more directly analogous to the nerve or singular simplicial complex in topology than the above nerve $N$. When one takes for $X$ the motivic Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces, the induced functor $$\mathrm{Sing}_*(K(\mathbf{Z}(n), 2n)) : \mathrm{Sm}(k)^{\mathrm{op}} \to \mathrm{sSet} $$ is particularly interesting. For a "good" smooth scheme $U$, the simplicial set it gives has its homotopy groups identified with the motivic cohomology of $U$. So certainly the topology of this simplicial set is relevant to the study of cohomological invariants. Surely there are many more interesting things to be said, but I am not an expert so I will refer to papers of Voevodsky. His ICM talk may be a good place to start. Edit: The fact that $\mathrm{Sing}_*$ should be viewed as a refined version of the nerve $N : \mathrm{sSet} \to \mathrm{Spc}(k)$ can be made more precise by the following observation: $\mathrm{Spc}(k)$ is presented by a simplicial model category, and hence is tensored and powered over $\mathrm{sSet}$. This means in particular that there are adjoint pairs $(- \otimes \Delta^n, \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(\Delta^n, -))$ for each $n$. For $X \in \mathrm{Spc}(k)$ each $\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(\Delta^n, X)$ is a actually a presheaf (and not a set, like $N(X)_n = \mathrm{Hom}(\Delta^n, X)$). And the point is that $\mathrm{Sing}_n$ is by definition precisely the power functor $\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(\Delta^n, -)$. Edit 2: Since you asked for a reference, I just noticed that there is a good discussion about the functor $\mathrm{Sing}_*$ in section 2.3.2 of 

For classroom purposes, you can tell your students they probably already studied covering maps in kindergarten when folding paper, cutting out a figure and then unfolding the paper to see a paper dolls chain: 

A group is said to satisfy the Tits alternative if every finitely generated subgroup of $G$ is either virtually solvable or contains a nonabelian free subgroup. Tits proved this for linear groups, and a MathSciNet search gives 38 papers with "Tits alternative" in the title (and 154 papers quoting Tits's original paper), so certainly a lot of groups do enjoy this property. What then is an example of a group which does not satisfy the Tits alternative? 

Let $k$ be a field of characteristic 0 and $G$ a connected reductive algebraic group defined over $k$. Let $g \in G(k)$ be a unipotent element. Is it true that there is a homomorphism $\varphi: SL_2(k) \to G(k)$ mapping some unipotent element $u \in SL_2(k)$ to $g$? Background: There is some nilpotent element $n \in Lie\, G$ which corresponds to $u$. If $Lie\, G$ is semisimple, the Jacobson-Morozov lemma states that $n$ is part of a $sl_2$-triple, so ''integrating'' would yield the desired homomorphism. (Apparently, Jacobson-Morozov holds more generally for completely reducible Lie subalgebras of $gl(V)$, though I don't have a precise reference.) 

Let $G$ be an adjoint Kac-Moody group over a (sufficiently large) finite field $\mathbf F_q$. By results of Caprace-R'emy, $G$ is simple when its diagram is connected and has indefinite type, i.e. neither spherical nor affine, and finitely presented when the diagram does not contain an edge labelled with $\infty$. In this case, $G$ itself is not amenable as it contains the free product of two root groups $U_\alpha * U_\beta$. Varying the ground field and the diagram then gives a two-parameter family of examples. 

Note that $M$ is invariant under the $GL_n(F)$-action given by $a \cdot (x,y):=(axa^{-1},aya^{-1})$. It follows that its closure $N$ is also invariant under $GL_n(F)$. Since $F$ is infinite and $GL_n$ is reductive, the rational points $GL_n(F)$ are Zariski-dense in $GL_n(K)$ by Borel, Linear Algebraic Groups, Corr. 18.3. (This is probably the piece of information you were missing). Then it follows that $N$ is $GL_n(K)$-invariant, as claimed. 

It is known that the (global) Bernstein-Sato polynomial is the least common multiple of all local Bernstein-Sato polynomials. In the case at hand, the local polynomials are given by $b_{p,i}(s) = (s+\frac{1}{n_i})\cdots (s+\frac{n_i-1}{n_i}) (s+1)$ (localization at $a_i$) or 1 (localization somewhere else), which gives your desired formula. Experimenting with these polynomials online is possible with Macauley2 at $URL$ For example, 

As explained by A. Sisto here on p.20 and p.21, "The subgroup generated by $z$ in the Heisenberg group $$〈 x,y,z | [ x,y ] = z, [ x,z ] = [ y,z ] = 1 〉$$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf Z$ and distorted." As $\langle z \rangle$ is the center of the Heisenberg group and hence normal, this gives one example. 

For a prime $p \neq 2$, the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z_p \times \mathbb Z/(p-1)$, while $\mathbb Q_2^\times$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z/2$, cf. Serre, A course in arithmetic, Theorem II.3.2 (p. 17). Since a field isomorphism $\varphi\colon \mathbb Q_p \to \mathbb Q_r$ will preserve the torsion subgroup of the multiplicative subgroup, this shows that $\mathbb Q_p \not\cong \mathbb Q_r$ whenever $\{p,r\} \neq \{2,3\}$. The remaining case is taken care of by the fact that $\mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ / $\mathbb {Q}_p ^{\times 2}$ $ \cong \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2$ whenever $p \neq 2$, while $\mathbb Q_2^\times$ / $\mathbb Q_2^{\times 2} \cong \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2$, cf. loc. cit., p.18. 

In Bridson's "A condition that prevents groups from acting nontrivially on trees" it is shown that for $n\geq 3$, $Aut (F_n)$ is generated by subgroups $A_1,A_2,A_3$ such that $\langle A_i,A_j \rangle$ is finite for $i,j=1,2,3$. This answers your question and moreover implies (via Helly's theorem) that for $n\geq 3$, any action of $Aut (F_n)$ on a tree fixes a point. Beautiful stuff! 

PM Cohn's "Skew fields: Theory of general divison rings", CUP 1995 should prove a valuable reference. In particular, Proposition 2.3.5 states that for each field $k$ there is a skew field $D$ whose centre is $k$ and such that $D$ is infinite-dimensional over $k$. 

Let $f,g \in \mathbf {C}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\subseteq \mathbf {C}[x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}]$ be two polynomials with complex coefficients and suppose that there exists $h_1 \in \mathop{GL}_{n+1}(\mathbf C)$ such that $h_1 \cdot f=g$. Does there exist $h_2 \in \mathop{GL}_n(\mathbf C)$ such that $h_2\cdot f=g$? This is a toy example of a more general question I'm interested in: given a family of representations $\rho_n: \mathop{GL}_n \to \mathop{End}(V_n)$ such that $V_n$ embeds naturally in $V_{n+1}$ (e.g., $V_n=\Lambda^r(\mathbf C^n)$), what can be said about the $\mathop{GL}_{n+1}$-orbits of elements of $V_n$? 

Let $q=p^e$ be a prime power and $\mathbb F_q$ the finite field with $q$ elements. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p$ and let $\varphi: SL_2(\mathbb F_q) \to GL_n(k)$ be a representation. Is it true that $\varphi$ maps a diagonal matrix $D$ to a matrix $\varphi(D)$ which can be diagonalized over $k$? (The question in the title more or less boils down to this question.) Background: Since $\mathbb F_q$ is finite, $\varphi$ can be described by a polynomial map $f$ which is defined over $k$. Then $f$ induces a map $SL_2({\bar k}) \to GL_n({\bar k})$, where $\bar k$ is an algebraic closure of $k$. Suppose that the induced map actually is a morphism of algebraic groups. As the diagonal matrices are in particular a $k-$split torus and the map is defined over $k$, the image again will be a $k-$split torus, from which the claim would follow. But to all appearances the induced map will not be a group homomorphism, so I might as well have asked about the smallest counterexample...
