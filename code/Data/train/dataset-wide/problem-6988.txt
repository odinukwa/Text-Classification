Profit is revenue minus costs. So we have $q = 12500$ and $p = 35$. (Note that I'm assuming you've correctly figured this out.) Then we have revenue: $$R = \int_{0}^{12500} MR dq = \int_{0}^{12500} (60 - 0.004q)dq$$ And costs: $$C = 300000 + \int_{0}^{12500} 10dq = 300000 + 125000 = 425000$$ The profit is $\Pi = R - C$. The average cost is $C/12500$. I leave you to crunch the integrals. Edit: In looking at your problem, $p(q) = 60 - 0.002q$ is definitely an inverse demand function. The revenue $R = qp(q) = (60q - 0.002q^{2})$ (quantity times prices). This yields the profit maximization problem (maximizing with respect to quantity produced): $$\max_{q} qp(q) - c(q) = (60q - 0.004q^{2}) - 10q - 300000$$ The First Order Conditions are: $$60 - 0.004q - 10 = 0 \implies 60 -0.004q = 10$$ You did the work from there to solve for $q$. 

It's hard to make a best advisement given that we don't know your background. One can struggle with proofs for a few reasons: terseness of the presentation, a weak background in the prerequisite material, or a weak background in proof-writing in general. (1) and (3) are generally associated with mathematical maturity. I advise folks interested in economics to pursue an undergraduate degree in mathematics. If that is not feasible or realistic, then I suggest at a minimum some proofs-based work in linear algebra and real analysis. Friedberg's Linear Algebra text is a good exposition and will help you build up some maturity. It's a solid prerequisite for analysis. Once you start talking about the derivative as a linear operator, linear algebra is a must-have. However, linear algebra doesn't otherwise appear in real analysis before that. For analysis, Abbott is friendlier than Rudin, and will likely provide you with sufficient background to move forward. Abbott is geared towards juniors in an undergraduate curriculum, while Rudin is the hard-core senior level text. If you don't have mathematical maturity, Rudin will force you to struggle. Once you have mathematical maturity, the conciseness his writing is quite nice. Fudenberg and Tirole is a very technical, terse book. It is a good reference, but not my favorite exposition into game theory. I might be inclined to look through Maschler, Solan, and Zamir instead. It's gotten good reviews, though I haven't had a chance to look through it myself.So take this with a grain of salt. It is definitely more comprehensive than Fudenberg and Tirole, though. 

In a Bayesian game, information is incomplete. To cope, players have beliefs about the state of the game. In a sense, each player strategizes as if the game was as he or she believes. So each player operates in his or her own world. And if every player plays a Nash equilibrium in one's own world, that's a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. In a stochastic game, the information about the current state of the game may indeed be public. At a given time step, the next state is determined by the current state, the strategy profile played at that time step, and some stochastic process (like a Markov chain, for example). We can have a stochastic Bayesian game where information is incomplete and there is a stochastic switching device like a Markov chain. 

There are two firs in the market. They produce perfect substitutes at cost $c(y_i)=y_i/3$ for i=1,2. The demand function is $p=1-(y_1+y_2)$ Consider the Cournot competition where firms simultaneously produce their respective outputs. However firm 1 has the opportunity to announce the output it will produce to firm 2 before the firms have produced any output. How can I find the equilibrium quantities? ———————— What I have done... For basic case, Cournot equilibrium For firm 1, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_1-y_2-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_1={2-3y_2\over 6}$$ For firm 2, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_2-(y_2/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_2-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_2={2-3y_1\over 6}$$ So, $$y_1=(1/3)-(1/2)(2-3y_1/6)$$ $$y^*_1=2/9$$ $$y_2^*=2/9$$ For Stackelberg eqn in basic cases First firm is mover first $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_2-(y_2/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_2-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_2={2-3y_1\over 6}$$ For firm 1, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ $$max[(1-y_1-({2-3y_1\over 6}))y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_1-(1/3)y_1-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_1^*=1/5$$ $$y_2^*=7/30$$ I just find only Stackelberg equilibrium and Cournot equilibrium in basic cases. But I cannot find the part that I write above. How can I solve this part? Thank you. 

I have also following budget set $$B=\{x=(x_1,x_2)\in R^2_+ \mid 2\sqrt{x_1}+x_2\le y\}$$ where y is income. Assume that there are two stories. The agent can shop in both of them. The first store has a quantity discount on good1 as described above. And a fixed unit price of good 2. $p_2=1$. The other store charges fixed unit prices, $p_1=2$ and $p_2=1/2$ respectively. Assume that income y is 6. How can I write the feasible budget constraint for utility maximization $U(x_1, x_2)=x_1x_2$. And since there is two stores, how can I write Lagrangian function for calculation of the optimization problem. I know I have to write my trials. But I cannot write properly any budget constraint and Lagrangian therefore, I cannot post my solution. Any help is appreciated. Thank you. Edit 

What I did is Leaks inverse demand function $p=a-bq$ And $q=q_1+q_2$ And since marginal cost is constant c, then cost function is $cq_i$ First of all, I find Cournot equilibrium outputs $q_c$ I obtain by the profit maximization problem $$q_c=\frac{a-c}{3b}$$ for both firms. Secondly, since firm 2 also has a choice $q_2^* >> q_c$ Then let’s assume that $q_2^* = \frac{a-c}{2b}>>\frac{a-c}{3b}=q_c$ Then in order to obtain Stackelberg setup, by backward induction method Let’s calculate $q^*_1$ which is the firm 1’s quantity when firm 2 chooses $q_2^*=\frac{a-c}{2b}$. $$\pi_1=(a-bq_1-b(\frac{a-c}{2b}))q_1-cq_1$$ By FOC, $$q_1^*=\frac{a-c}{4b}$$ And $$q^*_1<< q_c$$ Thirdly I calculated profits for four cases Case 1: firm1’s quantity and firm 2’s quantity are both $q_c$ Then both firms’ profits are equal and equal to $\frac{(a-c)^2}{9b}$ Case 2: firm1’s quantity is $q_1^*$ firm 2’s quantity is $q_c$ Then, Firm 1’s profit =$\frac{5(a-c)^2}{48b}$ Firm 2’s profit =$\frac{5(a-c)^2}{36b}$ Case 3: firm1’s quantity is $q_c$ firm 2’s quantity is $q_2^*$ Then, Firm 1’s profit =$\frac{(a-c)^2}{18b}$ Firm 2’s profit =$\frac{5(a-c)^2}{12b}$ Case 4: firm1’s quantity is $q_1^*$ firm 2’s quantity is $q_2^*$ Then, Firm 1’s profit =$\frac{(a-c)^2}{16b}$ Firm 2’s profit =$\frac{(a-c)^2}{8b}$ Now let’s look at the part (A) I construct the following table Table So as it is seen, only $(q_c, q_c)$ is Nash equilibrium. But $(q_1^*, q_2^*)$ is not Nash equilibrium. Next let’s look at the part (B) I construct tree in this case. Tree When we look at the table, First of all, it is for firm 2, In the left hand side, since the payoff of $q_c$ is greater than the payoff of $q_2^*$, the firm 2 will choose $q-c$. In the right hand side, since the payoff of $q_2^*$ is greater the payoff of $q_c$ for firm 2, then the firm 2 will choose $q^*_2$. Now, as for firm 1, if firm 1 choose $q_c$ then it knows that its payoff will be $(a-c)^2/9b$. But if firm 1 choose $q^*_1$ the its payoff will be $(a-c)^2/16b$. So the firm 1 will decide to choose $q_c$. That’s SPNE is $(q_c,q_cq_c)$. That is, $(q_1^*,q_2^*)$ is not SPNE. 

The fact that the burden of a tax on sellers can by borne by buyers, and vice versa. More generally, the fact that true tax incidence is largely or completely unrelated to who is nominally being taxed (e.g. taxes on yacht purchases can in principle hurt the poor more than the rich, etc.). The fact that in a perfectly competitive market with free entry and exit, all firms make zero profits in the long run (if opportunity costs are taken into account). Coase's theorem: "if trade in an externality is possible and there are sufficiently low transaction costs, bargaining will lead to a Pareto efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property". (E.g. under a cap-and-trade system for pollution permits with sufficiently low transaction costs, the final allocation of permits is independent of the initial allocation, even if some permits are sold and others are arbitrarily given away for free.) This one's a bit more "in the weeds", but the difficulty of eliminating the marriage penalty: "it is mathematically impossible for a tax system to have all of (a) marginal tax rates that increase with income, (b) joint filing with income splitting for married couples, and (c) combined tax bills that are unaffected by two people's marital status." 

This question only considers federal taxes in the United States. Also, by "capital income" I am including dividends, interest, capital gains, corporate incomes and estates. The Chamley-Judd result states that under certain assumptions, capital income should be untaxed to maximize economic efficiency. More recently work has called some of those assumptions into question and suggested that a positive capital income tax is optimal, but I believe that there is more or less of a consensus across economists that from a pure economic efficiently standpoint, capital income taxes should be significantly lower than they currently are. Nevertheless, many economists oppose lowering the capital income tax rate (possibly offset by a uniform increase in the ordinary income rates) on fairness/distributive grounds, as people who earn capital income tend to be wealthier than average, so the capital gains tax is significantly progressive (at least in the short term, when we can neglect changes in economic growth), and so such a change would probably be regressive. Opponents of capital income taxation respond that any decrease in the overall progressivity of the federal tax system brought about by eliminating capital income taxation can simply be compensated for by making the ordinary income tax rates more progressive. While there would certainly be individual winners and losers under such a change (e.g. people who earn significantly more or less of their income from capital than most people at their same income level), in principle the distribution of effective overall federal tax rates across the entire US population could be left completely unchanged by sufficiently precise tweaks to the ordinary income brackets. Such a change would boost the tax code's efficiency while leaving its progressivity unchanged. (I'm assuming that everyone pays their taxes honestly and neglecting any changes in tax evasion that this change might cause.) If all capital income taxation were eliminated in the US, how would the ordinary income tax brackets need to change in order to keep the federal tax system's overall progressivity the same? 

Consider an oligopoly between two identical firms producing a homogenous good with constant marginal cost where firms face linear market demand. $B_i(q_j)$ denotes firm i’s best response given the output by firm j for i,j=1,2 and $i\not= j$. Let $q_c$ denote the Cournot equilibrium output choice where firms choose output simultaneously. Assume now a Stackelberg setup, where firm 2 observes firm 1’s choice before making its own output choice. Consider the following pair of strategies in the Stackelberg setup: firm 1 chooses $q_c$. Firm 2 chooses $q_c$ if firm 1 chooses $q_c$ otherwise firm 2 chooses $q^*_2 >>q_c$. (A) show whether or not the pair of strategies described above constitutes a Nash equilibrium in the game. (B) show whether or not the pair of strategies described above constitutes a subgame perfect equilibrium in the game. 

I solve this question in this way. But I am exactly not sure about my way. Please share your ideas with me. I will be happy if say something abou my solution. Thank you. 

Two firms are in a market together. They produce a product. Total revenue from sales is $y=K+L$ K is the amount of capital L is the amount of labor These two firms each specialized in supplying one of inputs and the cost of the input supplied is incurred by the person providing it. For capital, the cost is $K^2/2$ and for labor, the cost is $L^2/2$ And they share revenue from their business equally. I need to find firstly that if eac is interested in maximizing his own profit, then how much of each input will they use, and how much profit will each make. And secondly, I need to find the profit maximizing level of inputs for whole business. As a result, I need to compare what I have found in both parts. ———- my solution For firm 1, $$max [1/2(K+L)-K^2/2]$$ FOCs: $1/2-K=0$ So $K=1/2$. He use 1/2 unit of capital. And his profit is $\pi= 1/2*(1/2+L)-1/4=1/2*L\ge 0$ for $L>0$ Similarly, For firm 2, $$max [1/2(K+L)-L^2/2]$$ FOCs: $1/2-L=0$ So $L=1/2$. He use 1/2 unit of labor. And his profit is $\pi= 1/2*(1/2+K)-1/4\ge 0$ for $L\ge 0$ ======= And I have tried to find the profit maximization for entire business $$max[(K+L)- K^2/2-L^2/2]$$ FOCs; $1-K=0$ so K=1 and $1-L=0$ so L=1 And profit $= (1+1)-(1/2+1/2)=1>0$ Now, all parts of my solution are correct? 

I have multiple question. (1) when John doesn’t work in the underground economy at all , t=0, how can I find the optimal value of $l$ and consumption bundle and his utility. (2) And when john work in the underground economy, t>0, how can write his optimization problem? Can I say that $l=0$ for t>0 by using the equation (1) in the picture? And in this case, when he is not fined, which way I can find his optimal consumption bundle and his expected utility? (3) finally, I would like to derive an inequality in order to describe for which parameter values John elects to work in the underground economy. And how can I decide whether John is willing to work in the underground economy or not if m and w increase by the same dollar amount ? Sorry for not posting my answer, because I am not familiar with such a question, my answer is really trivial.
