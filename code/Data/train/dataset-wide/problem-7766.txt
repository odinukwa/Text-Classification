When $R$ is a simple curve singularity, the category $MCM(R)$ has finite type and the structure of its Auslander algebra is known. (When $\mathcal{C}$ is a Krull-Schmidt category with only finitely many indecomposables up to isomorphism, one can form a basic representation generator $M$ as the direct sum of one copy of each indecomposable object. The Auslander algebra of $\mathcal{C}$ is then defined as the endomorphism ring of $M$.) A good reference for information about the Auslander algebras of simple curve singularities is Chapter 9 of Yoshino's book Cohen-Macaulay Modules over Cohen-Macaulay Rings. In particular, Yoshino computes the Auslander-Reiten quivers of $MCM(R)$ for the A-D-E singularities, which can also be viewed as the Ext-quiver (or bound quiver) of the associated Auslander algebra, call it $\Gamma$. Thus $\Gamma$ is a quotient of the (completed) path algebra of this quiver, and I believe the relations of $\Gamma$ can be chosen to be the "mesh relations" (i.e., there is one relation coming from each almost split sequence in $MCM(R)$. Unfortunately, I don't have a good reference for this fact, but it should not be too hard to verify by choosing nice irreducible maps corresponding to the arrows of the quiver and computing the relations they satisfy.) Now the endomorphism ring of a single indecomposable MCM $R$-module can be computed as a corner ring of $\Gamma$. For instance, I would start by identifying the minimal nonzero cycles at the vertex corresponding to the indecomposable module of interest. I haven't tried to do this myself for the $f=x^3+y^4$ example, so perhaps it is harder than it sounds. In fact, in this case it seems nontrivial to compute even the endomorphism ring of $R$ itself in this way. 

Yes, any indecomposable projective-injective $A$-module $P$ is (isomorphic to) a direct summand of every tilting $A$-module $T$. Just check that $T \oplus P$ is also a tilting module, and then use the fact that any two tilting $A$-modules have the same number of isomorphism classes of idecomposable summands. 

FYI: in crystallography, G are called space groups in three dimensions. Space groups which are semidirect products, are called symmorphic. Some thoughts that might lead to the solution: 1. Since T is normal in G we can write for every isometry $(t_q,q)\in G\quad$ ($t_q$: translational component, q linear component) $\quad\quad T=(t_q,q).T.(t_q,q)^{-1}$ $\Leftrightarrow T= (t_q,q).\lbrace (t,id)\rbrace.(-q^{-1}.t_q,q^{-1})$ $\Leftrightarrow T=\lbrace (q.t,id)\rbrace=q.T$ So q is a permutation of T. Since T is isomorphic (as a free $\mathbb Z$-module) to $\mathcal{L}^{n}$ and since q is orthogonal ($q\in O(\mathbb{E}^n)$), we find that $q\in Aut(\mathcal{L}^{n})$. This means that the set of all linear parts of G, which we'll call $Q(\mathcal{L}^{n})$ is a subgroup of $Aut(\mathcal{L}^{n})$. 2. Consider a coset $(t_q,q).T\ $ of T, then we can write $\quad\quad (t_q,q).T=\lbrace (t_q,q).(t,id): t\in \mathcal{L}^{n}\rbrace$ $\Leftrightarrow (t_q,q).T=\lbrace (t_q+q.t,q): t\in \mathcal{L}^{n}\rbrace$ $\Leftrightarrow (t_q,q).T=\lbrace (t_q+t',q): t'\in \mathcal{L}^{n}\rbrace$ which means that each q belongs to exactly one coset of T so that $Q(\mathcal{L}^{n})$ is isomorphic to $Q$. 3. From 1. and 2. we find that in any case (i.e. also when G is not a semidirect product) $Q$ is isomorphic to a finite subgroup of $Aut(\mathcal{L}^{n})$. 4. If we have $G=T\rtimes Q$, there exists a homomorphism from $Q$ to $Aut(T)$ and since T is isomorphic to $\mathcal{L}^{n}$ (as a free $\mathbb Z$-module) $Hom:Q\rightarrow Aut(\mathcal{L}^{n})$ 

How can I determine whether $A_1,A_2\in GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ conjugate in $GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ and if they are, how can I find a $P\in GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ for which $A_2 = P^{-1}.A_1.P$ ? In $GL(n,\mathbb Q)$ one could achieve this by checking if the Frobenius normal forms (FNF) are equal and if they are $\quad\quad FNF_2 = FNF_1$ $\Leftrightarrow P_2^{-1}.A_2.P_2=P_1^{-1}.A_1.P_1$ $\Leftrightarrow A_2=M^{-1}.A_1.M\quad\quad\quad M=P_1.P_2^{-1}$ I found an algorithm which gives the FNF of a matrix with P a matrix of integers. Is there an way of performing subsequent elementary similarity transformations on $P_i$ (and hence also on $P_i^{-1}$) until $P_i\in GL(n,\mathbb Z)$ while also checking whether it is even possible to arrive at such a $P_i$? 

As far as I understood, the Fourier decomposition of a function $\boldsymbol{F}\colon\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}^{m}$ where $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is endowed with the Euclidean inner product $\left<\cdot,\cdot\right>$ is given by $\boldsymbol{F}(\bar{x})=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}{\tilde{\boldsymbol{F}}(\bar{\nu})e^{2\pi i \left<\bar{\nu},\bar{x}\right>}}{d\bar{\nu}}$ where $\tilde{\boldsymbol{F}}(\bar{\nu})=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}{\boldsymbol{F}(\bar{x})e^{-2\pi i \left<\bar{\nu},\bar{x}\right>}}{d\bar{x}}$ How does this come about and for which functions does it apply? I'm not even able to find the right framework to work in (Hilbert spaces?). Secondly, could I just replace the Euclidean inner product by the Minkowskian inner product when in Minkowski space? 

Yes $D$ must be finite-dimensional over $F$. This follows from a Theorem of Kaplansky's that I found in Herstein's monograph "Noncommutative Rings". The first step is to show that an algebraic algebra of bounded degree satisfies a polynomial identity (see Lemma 6.2.3 in Herstein), i.e., is a P.I. algebra. Note, however, that the degree of this polynomial identity may be larger than the degree of the algebra, as defined in the question. Then since a division algebra $D$ is primitive, one can use: 

To the best of my knowledge, this is an open problem. There are no known examples where $\mbox{mod-}A$ is periodic (say, with a common period $n$ for all modules), but $\Omega^n$ is not isomorphic to the identity functor on the stable category. In fact, $\mbox{mod-}A$ being periodic may well imply that $A$ is a periodic algebra, meaning that $A$ has a periodic projective resolution as a module over its enveloping algebra. This is another open question. Examples where this happens include the preprojective algebras of Dynkin type and generalized Dynkin type, and their deformations [K. Erdmann, A. Skowronski. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 359 (2007), no. 6, 2625--2650], and all self-injective algebras of finite representation type [J. Pure Appl. Algebra 214 (2010), no. 6, 990â€“1000]. One class of examples where $\mbox{mod-}A$ is periodic, but it is not known (at least to me) whether $\Omega$ has finite order or not, is the so-called higher preprojective algebras studied by O. Iyama and S. Oppermann [arXiv:0912.3412v1]. Here, I believe the problem is connected to the question of whether the Nakayama automorphism has finite order. 

The simplest counterexample I know is when A is the mesh algebra of generalized Dynkin type $C_3$ (see the paper "Periodic algebras" by Erdmann and Skowronski). Its quiver is the same as the preprojective algebra of Dynkin type $D_4$, but the relations are slightly different. It is symmetric and periodic of period $6$. If the central vertex is labeled 2, and the three other vertices are 0, 1, and 3, the indecomposable projective $e_2A$ has structure: $$\begin{array}{ccc} & 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 3 \\ 2 & \ 2 \\ 0 & 1 & 3 \\ & 2\end{array}$$ Thus $e_2Ae_2 \cong k[x,y]/(xy, x^2+y^2)$, which is not periodic. Your other observation at the end is interesting. While I don't expect that to hold in general, at the moment I don't know a counterexample.
