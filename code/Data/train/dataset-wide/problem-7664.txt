This should be a comment to Robin's answer. Take any irreducible polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ of degree 3 with real roots, say $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$. Set $f_1 = x + \alpha y + \alpha^2 z$, $f_2 = x + \beta y + \beta^2 z$, $f_3 = x + \gamma y + \gamma^2 z$. You can find plenty of polynomials here. 

A natural number $n$ is the product of precisely two prime powers if and only if there exists an abelian group of order $n$ having precisely two maximal subgroups. (And that group is unique up to isomorphism.) 

This is a comment, but I can't post any as such... In case $r = 1$, there is only one fundamental unit, whence your minimax is exponential in the regulator. So something better is only possible in case $r > 1$. 

In case $G$ is finite, this cannot happen. (This might extend to the general case of finitely generated groups, as Fred told me when we talked about this in my office :-) ) 

Now let me go back to the original problem. As $R_0$ is a subring of both $R$ and $R_{(H)}$, it is of finite type over the noetherian ring $A$. Therefore, $R_0$ is noetherian as well. So in case $G$ is finite, the above shows that $R$ is of finite type over $R_0$, and thus also over $A$. 

I don't know how good the bound is you can obtain from this, but what about taking a Korkine-Zolotarev reduced basis of $\Lambda$, say $(b_1, \dots, b_n)$: then, by this paper, $\|b_i\|_2^2 \le \frac{i + 3}{4} \lambda_i(\Lambda)^2$, where $\lambda_i(\Lambda)$ is the $i$-th successive minimum of $\Lambda$. By Minkowski, $\prod_{i=1}^n \lambda_i(\Lambda) \le \gamma_n^{n/2} \det \Lambda = \gamma_n^{n/2}$ (in your case), $\gamma_n$ being the $n$-th Hermite constant, whence you get $A \le \prod_{i=1}^n \|b_i\|_2 \le \frac{\gamma_n^{n/2}}{2^n} \prod_{i=1}^n \sqrt{i + 3}$. 

Take $A$ the set of even numbers, $B$ the set of odd numbers. Than $d(A) = d(B) = \frac{1}{2}$, while $d(A \cap B) = 0$ since $A \cap B = \emptyset$. 

The existence of a finite $S_2$ follows from Hilbert's basis theorem, as $\mathbb{R}$ is obviously Noetherian. Just take a finite generating system of the ideal generated by $S$. About your auxilliary questions: a) This is wrong. Just take $f = x^2 + y^2$; then $\{ f \}$ has the unique zero $(0, 0)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, while it has no isolated zero in $\mathbb{C}^2$. b) The ideal generated by $S$ is finitely generated. The set $S$ itself does not needs to have any algebraic structure, unless you take the set of all polynomials which vanish in $p$ (then it is a maximal ideal in $\mathbb{R}[x_1, \dots, x_n]$). In any case, replacing $S$ by the ideal generated by $S$ does not change the zero set (variety) of $S$. 

In most of the current schemes, it is very unlikely that elliptic curves are defined over F_1. They are certainly not in Deitmar's or Toen-Vaquie since they restric to toric varieties. For Soule/Connes-Consani old notions, all the examples found so far seem to come from torified varieties (as defined by Oliver and myself in this paper. Also in CC new notion, up to the torsion part of the monoidal scheme their schemes appear to be generalized torified (see Theorem 2.2 in the reference you mention). But all torified schemes are rational, so elliptic curves are not in there. On the other hand, Manin was very confident that the set of torsion points of an elliptic curve would define a convenient model for it. But if that was the case I don't think it would fit CC models, but rather Manin/Marcolli analytic approach, conjecturally related to Borger's, but no there is clear explanation on that relation just yet. 

If I remember correctly, that statement can be proven via the equivalence between the (group) representations of $G$ and the (algebra) representations of the group algebra $K[G]$. If $K=\mathbb{C}$ is the field of complex numbers (or any other field of characteristic 0, or in general if $\textrm{char} K$ does not divide the order of $G$) then by Maschke's Theorem $K[G]$ is semisimple, and moreover it is Artinian (by finite-dimensionality) so by Artin-Wedderburn it decomposes (as a module over itself) as a direct sum of matrix rings over some division ring over $K$. If $K=\mathbb{C}$, there are no finite dimensional division rings over $\mathbb{C}$ so each summand is a ring of matrices over the complex numbers. The irreducible representations of the group are in one to one correspondence with left ideals of this ring, which are well known (look for instance here. A simple dimension counting argument should convince you that you have at least one ideal for each conjugacy class. 

Quick answer (to the second part): noncommutative rings don't have enough ideals to make a decent spectrum. In words of Fred van Oystaeyen: "it doesn't matter how you try to define what is a point of a noncommutative space, you never have enough of them". There were some attempts of following more classical lines in the late seventies and early-mid eighties (see papers by Van Oystaeyen, Verschoren, and many others) but eventually everybody agreed that a more abstract approach was needed to get meaningful geometric information. 

First, let me show that $R$ is of finite type over $R_0$ in case $R_0$ is noetherian and $G$ is finite. For that, it suffices to show that every $R_g$, $g \in G$ is finitely generated as an $R_0$-module. Now fix some $g \in G$. In case $R_g = \{ 0 \}$, we are done. Otherwise, let $\alpha \in R_g \setminus \{ 0 \}$. As $G$ is a finite group, there exists some $n > 0$ such that $n g = 0$. As $R$ is integral, $\beta := \alpha^{n-1} \neq 0$ is a non-trivial element of $R_{g^{-1}}$. Now the map $\varphi : R_g \to R_0$, $x \mapsto \beta x$ is an injective $R_0$-module homomorphism. The image, $\beta R_g$, is therefore isomorphic to $R_g$ as an $R_0$-module. As $R_0$ is noetherian, every $R_0$-submodule of $R_0$ is finitely generated, whence $\beta R_g$ and thus $R_g$ is a finitely generated $R_0$-module. This shows that $R$ is of finite type over $R_0$. 

I was wondering how random unit lattices in number fields are. To make this more precise: If $K$ is a number field with embeddings $\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_n, \overline{\sigma_{r+1}}, \dots, \overline{\sigma_n} \to \mathbb{C}$ (so we have $r$ real embeddings and $2 (n - r)$ complex embeddings), let $\mathcal{O}_K$ be the ring of integers and $\Lambda_K := \{ (\log |\sigma_1(\varepsilon)|^{d_1}, \dots, \log |\sigma_n(\varepsilon)|^{d_n}) \mid \varepsilon \in \mathcal{O}_K^\ast \}$ be the unit lattice, where $d_i = 1$ if $\sigma_i(K) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and $d_i = 2$ otherwise. Then $\Lambda_K$ is always contained in $H := \{ (x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 0 \}$, and $\det \Lambda_K$ is the regulator $R_K$ of $K$. Let us normalize $\Lambda_K$ by $\hat{\Lambda}_K := \frac{1}{\sqrt[n]{R_K}} \Lambda_K$; then $\det \hat{\Lambda}_K = 1$. Now my question is: can we say something on how random the lattices $\hat{\Lambda}_K$ are among all lattices in $H$ of determinant 1? (For example, for fixed signature $(r, n-r)$ of $K$.) Since these lattices are not completely random (they consist of vectors of logarithms of algebraic numbers), it is maybe better to ask something like this: 

(Of course, this question is only interesting when $n > 2$.) I assume that this is a very hard problem, so I'd be happy about any hint on whether something about this is known, whether someone is working on this, how one could proof such things, etc. 

I am trying to understand some construction done by Lusztig in his book on quantum groups. Given some Cartan datum, let $U=U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ the standard quantized enveloping algebra of the Kac-Moody algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Its negative part $U^{-}$ (the subalgebra of $U$ generated by the $f_i$'s) has a canonical basis $B$. In his book Introduction to Quantum Groups (don't be fooled by the title!), Lustzig constructs the non-unital extension $\dot{U}$ and proves that it has a canonical basis $\dot{B}$. As a set, $\dot{B}$ is in bijection with $B\times X \times B$ (where $X$ is the lattice of weights, normally called $P$ in any other books on quantum groups), and its elements are described with the rather cryptic notation $b\diamond_\zeta b''$. The definition of those elements is however very obscure and non-explicit. I would appreciate finding an easier, more explicit, description, like the one given in section 25.3 in Lustzig's book for $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, also described in great detail by Lauda in the first part of his paper A categorification of quantum sl(2). It is not clear to me how this description can be extended to more complicated quantum groups. Does anyone know any similar simple description of the canonical basis $\dot{B}$, even in some other particular cases? I am also very interested of knowing if is there any relation with crystals, akin to the equivalence between $B$ and Kashiwara's crystal basis $B(\infty)$. 

Don't be fooled by the $A\otimes A^{op}$ thing, $A$ seen as a module over $A\otimes A^{op}$ is just the same thing as seen as a bimodule over itself. 

Since one has to write everything down, the natural tendency is to make short, concise statements. Things stay on display for longer periods. If there is a mistake, you just erase and correct it, this is harder to do with a beamer talk (unless you have an electronic board or a tablet). The writing pace ensures not to rush over concepts that one finds trivial or boring. Very important when teaching freshmen (or any undergrads). 

First of all, apologies for the really non-standard question/announcement. I know this is not what MO was intended for, but in this situation it is the easiest way to reach (perhaps) the right person. On my way back to London from some workshop in Ohio, I got stuck in NYC because of that infamous volcano. No definite news except there is no chance I can get back to Europe before next Friday. I thought I could make something productive with all this time, but have no contact with any mathematicians in any of the Universities nearby. So, if anybody in NYC or surroundings is interested on hearing about my work (lately mostly about the field with one element, plus some quantum groups and noncommutative geometry stuff), you have the perfect occasion to bring me to your department. For free! I am open to discussions, seminars or in general anything that is going around, if anybody is up, just send an email! 

Assuming that $A$ has a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$ (for example, by using Zorn's Lemma), one can proceed as follows: if $M$ is a free $A$-module with basis $(v_i)_{i\in I}$, then $M \cong A^I$, whence $M / \mathfrak{m} M \cong A^I / \mathfrak{m} A^I \cong (A / \mathfrak{m} A)^I$. This is a vector space over $k := A / \mathfrak{m} A$ of dimension $|I|$. Since over fields, all vector space bases of the same vector space have the same length, and since the $k$-vector space structure of $M / \mathfrak{m} M$ is independent of the choice of the basis, this shows that all $A$-bases of $M$ have the same cardinality. I don't remember where I first saw this though... maybe someone else has a reference? I saw this first in the case that $A = \mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathfrak{m} = (2)$ for free abelian groups $M$, to show that the rank is well-defined. 

Any algorithm for computing fundamental units of a real quadratic number field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$ can be used for solving Pell's equation. (You might have to do a bit of work to convert the result, but that can be done in polynomial time...) See for example M. Jacobson, H. Williams: Solving the Pell Equation. Springer, 2009. 

Sections to the morphism $X \to S$ are more or less $S$-rational points of $X$: if for example $S = Spec(R)$ and $X = Spec(R[x_1, \dots, x_n]/(f_1, \dots, f_m))$ with polynomials $f_1, \dots, f_m \in R[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, then sections to $X \to S$ correspond to points $(a_1, \dots, a_n) \in R^n$ with $f_i(a_1, \dots, a_n) = 0$ for all $i$. On the other hand, the elements of $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ can be seen as holomorphic functions on $U$. So the one kind of sections can be seen as "points" of the geometric object, the others can be seen as "functions" on the geometric object. 

There is an LLL analogue for arbitrary norms; the original paper by Lovász and Scarf can be found here. I recently found a bachelor thesis on lattice reduction in infinity norm, which contains several other references (for example, work by Kaib and Ritter).
