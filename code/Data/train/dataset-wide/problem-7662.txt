For a prime $p \neq 2$, the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z_p \times \mathbb Z/(p-1)$, while $\mathbb Q_2^\times$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z/2$, cf. Serre, A course in arithmetic, Theorem II.3.2 (p. 17). Since a field isomorphism $\varphi\colon \mathbb Q_p \to \mathbb Q_r$ will preserve the torsion subgroup of the multiplicative subgroup, this shows that $\mathbb Q_p \not\cong \mathbb Q_r$ whenever $\{p,r\} \neq \{2,3\}$. The remaining case is taken care of by the fact that $\mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ / $\mathbb {Q}_p ^{\times 2}$ $ \cong \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2$ whenever $p \neq 2$, while $\mathbb Q_2^\times$ / $\mathbb Q_2^{\times 2} \cong \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2$, cf. loc. cit., p.18. 

A group is said to satisfy the Tits alternative if every finitely generated subgroup of $G$ is either virtually solvable or contains a nonabelian free subgroup. Tits proved this for linear groups, and a MathSciNet search gives 38 papers with "Tits alternative" in the title (and 154 papers quoting Tits's original paper), so certainly a lot of groups do enjoy this property. What then is an example of a group which does not satisfy the Tits alternative? 

Let $R$ be a ring and suppose $j\colon R \to R$ is an injection such that $j(a) \neq a,a+1$ for all $a \in R$. (Such an injection exists iff $R$ has more than two elements: take $j$ to be a translation $x \mapsto x+c$.) Define $a \star a:=j(a)$ and $j(a)\star b:=a+b$. Since $j(a) \neq a$, this is well defined and $(a \star a) \star b=a+b$. Now define $(j(a)+1) \star b :=ab$. Again this is well-defined, and $ab=((a \star a)\star 1)\star b)$. 

The paper Djoković, Dragomir Ž.(1983). Classification of trivectors of an eight-dimensional real vector space, Linear and Multilinear Algebra, 13: 1, 3 — 39 gives a systematic classification of 3-forms over a real vector space of dimension 8, including the classification of 3-forms over a real vector space of dimension 7. Djoković attributes the first classification of 3-forms over a real vector space of dimension 7 (by ad-hoc methods) to Westwick: R. Westwick. Real trivectors of rank seven, Linear and Multilinear Algebra 10 (1981), 183-204. 

Pick a $\sigma \in \Gamma_F$ such that $\sigma |_E$ generates $\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$. There is an $A \in \mathrm{GL}_n$ such that for all $x \in \Gamma_E$, $\rho(\sigma x \sigma^{-1}) = A \rho(x) A^{-1}$, and if $q$ denotes the order of $\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$, we get that $\rho(\sigma^q x \sigma^{-q}) = A^q \rho(x) A^{-q}$, which by irreducibility and Schur's lemma implies that $\rho(\sigma^q) A^{-q} = \lambda \mathrm{Id}$. Choose any $\mu$ such that $\mu^q = \lambda$. Then setting $\rho(\sigma)=\mu A$ is one of the $q$ ways to extend $\rho$. 

Take $f(x)=(x+1)e^{-x}$ and $g(x)=e^x$, then $f(x)-v/g(x)=(x+1-v)e^{-x}$ and the derivative with respect to $x$ is $(v-x)e^{-x}$. 

As HenrikRüping wrote, my comment is false. Nevertheless, I think the method is interesting (obviously, it isn't mine), although it gives something "explicit", but not "compact". Maybe you could provide us with context? For example, are you interested in the behavior when $k \rightarrow + \infty$ (assuming the field is topological)? If $XAX^{-1}$ and $YQY^{-1}$ are "nice" (diagonal or Jordan normal form), then make the change of variable (is this English?) $P'=XPY$. Then viewing $S_k$ as a linear function of $P$, $XS_k(P)Y=\sum_{i=1}^k XAX^{-1} P' YQY^{-1}$, so up to a change of base on $M_{m,n}(K)$, the endomorphism $S_k$ of this vector space is given in a nice form (eigenvalues are known). But I'm not sure this is really what you're asking for, and your last comment suggests you already know what I just wrote. 

Assume $L/k$ normal, and take $\sigma \in G$, which can be extended to an element of $Gal(L/k)$. Then $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu} \in L$, and if $\gamma$ is the nontrivial element of $Gal(L/K)$, $\sigma^{-1} \gamma \sigma$ is trivial on $K$, and being nontrivial on $L$ it has to be equal to $\gamma$. So $\gamma\left( \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\mu \right) = \sigma(\gamma(\sqrt{\mu}))/\gamma(\sqrt{\mu}) = \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$, so we can take $\alpha_{\sigma} = \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$, it is an element of $K$. Now for the other way, take $\tilde{\sigma} \in Gal(\bar{L}/k)$. Denote the restriction of $\tilde{\sigma}$ to $K$ by $\sigma$. Then $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}= \pm \alpha_{\sigma}$ (this equality is in $\bar{L}$), so $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu}) = \pm \alpha_{\sigma} \sqrt{\mu} \in L$, so $L$ is normal. Consider a set-theoretic section $\sigma \mapsto \tilde{\sigma}$ for the surjective morphism $Gal(L/k) \rightarrow G$. Then the (up to a coboundary) 2-cocycle $\beta_0$ associated to the group extension is given by the formula $\tilde{\sigma} \tilde{\tau} = \beta_0(\sigma,\tau) \widetilde{\sigma \tau}$. Evaluating at $\sqrt{\mu}$ gives the equality between $\beta$ and $\beta_0$, if for every $\sigma \in G$, $\alpha_{\sigma} = \tilde{\sigma}(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$. You can always choose your section so that it is the case (change of section = associating a sign to each $\sigma \in G$). 

The Cartan-Dieudonne theorem states that each element $g \in O(V)$, where $V$ is a quadratic space of dimension $n$ over a field of characteristic $\neq 2$, can be written as a product of $\leq n$ reflections. Something similar is true for $SL_n(k)$ for $char\ k \neq 2$: each element $g$ can be written as a product of elements of order $4.$ Indeed, it suffices to prove this for $n=2$. Then $s_t:=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & t \\ -\frac 1t & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ is of order $4$ . Let $h(t):=s_ts_{-1}=\begin{pmatrix} t & 0 \\ 0 & \frac 1t \end{pmatrix}$, then each element in $U$, the group of upper triangular matrices, is a product of two conjugates of elements $h(t),h(t')$ (provided $|k|\geq 4$). Similarly for the lower triangular matrices $V$, and then $SL_2$ is generated by these subgroups. Since a simply connected semisimple $k$-split group is generated by $SL_2$'s, the same argument applies. What can we say about other algebraic groups? Clearly unipotent groups (in characteristic 0) don't have elements of finite order, so nothing there. What about (the k-rational points of) anisotropic groups? 

Let $k$ be a field of characteristic 0 and $G$ a connected reductive algebraic group defined over $k$. Let $g \in G(k)$ be a unipotent element. Is it true that there is a homomorphism $\varphi: SL_2(k) \to G(k)$ mapping some unipotent element $u \in SL_2(k)$ to $g$? Background: There is some nilpotent element $n \in Lie\, G$ which corresponds to $u$. If $Lie\, G$ is semisimple, the Jacobson-Morozov lemma states that $n$ is part of a $sl_2$-triple, so ''integrating'' would yield the desired homomorphism. (Apparently, Jacobson-Morozov holds more generally for completely reducible Lie subalgebras of $gl(V)$, though I don't have a precise reference.) 

Just want to add that $G$ has a quotient isomorphic to $H:=\mathbb Z_p \ltimes_\varphi \mathbb Z^{p-1}$ where $\varphi(1)\cdot v=Av$ for some $A \in SL_{p-1}(\mathbb Z)$ of order $p$; in particular, $G$ is infinite. Indeed, such an $A$ exists: take $A$ to be a companion matrix to the polynomial $\frac{x^p-1}{x-1}$. Then any element in $H$ not contained in $ \{0\} \times \mathbb Z ^{p-1}$ has order $p$, so mapping $x$ to $(1,0)$ and $y$ to $(1,e_1)$ will give a well-defined homomorphism which can be shown to be surjective. 

You need to add some assumption, otherwise $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & n \\\\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ add to a matrix with eigenvalues $1 \pm \sqrt{n}$. Maybe your operators are self-adjoint? 

EDIT: There's a left/right action problem, because $\beta_0(\sigma,\tau) = \sigma(\alpha_{\tau}) \alpha_{\sigma} \alpha_{\sigma \tau}^{-1}$ with what I wrote. I think it has to do with the fact that you use exponential notation, so somehow your action is on the right? Maybe you define $x^{\sigma} = \sigma^{-1}(x)$? Otherwise the definition of $\beta$ doesn't make it a 2-cocycle, with the definitions I know. Could you clarify? 

It is also true for local rings. Let $A$ be a matrix with coefficients in $K = \mathrm{Frac}(R)$, such that $A \mathrm{GL}_n(R) A^{-1} \subset \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$. Then in particular, $A (I_n + E_{i,j})A^{-1} \in M_n(R)$ and $A (I_n+E_{i,i}+E_{i,j}+E_{j,i})A^{-1} \in M_n(R)$ for all $i \neq j$, so that $a_{i,j} b_{k,l} \in R$ for all $i,j,k,l$, where $a$, $b$ denote the coefficients of $A$, $B:=A^{-1}$. Since $\sum_j a_{1,j}b_{j,1}=1$, there is a $j_0$ such that $a_{1,j_0} b_{j_0,1} \in R^{\times}$. Let $A'=a_{1,j_0}^{-1} A$. Then the coefficients of $A'^{-1} = a_{1,j_0} B$ are in $R$, and those of $A'$ also because $\frac{a_{i,j}}{a_{1,j_0} }= \frac{a_{i,j}b_{j_0,1}}{a_{1,j_0}b_{j_0,1}} \in R$. For a general $R$, this just shows that $A \in K^{\times} \mathrm{GL}_n (R_m) $ for any maximal ideal $m$ of $R$. Edit: This implies that the normalizer is indeed $K^{\times} \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$ in the case $R$ is a UFD. Indeed we have that $I^n=(\det (A))$ where $I=\sum_{i,j} a_{i,j} R$ by localization ($i/\det(A) \in \cap_m R_m = R$ for any $i$ product of $n$ coefficients of $A$). Looking at decompositions, we see that $\mathrm{gcd}(a_{i,j})^n = \det(A)$, and so $A/\\mathrm{gcd}(a_{i,j}) \in \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$. 

By induction on $n$. If $n=1$, no problem. If $n \geq 2$, if the polynomials $p_{m_j}$ are all constant, still no problem. So assume $p_{m_1}$ nonconstant. Approximating $f$ is the same as approximating $t \mapsto e^{-\lambda_1 t} f(t)$, so we may assume $\lambda_1=0$. Then we approximate $f'$, using induction (since $\lambda_1=0$, $\sum_{j=1}^M (m_j+1)$ is less for $f'$). Now if $f'-u_0$ is small, with $u_0(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} c_k e^{\mu_k t}$, then $f-u$ is also small, where $u(t)=f(0)-\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} c_k/\mu_k + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{c_k}{\mu_k} e^{\mu_k t}$ (using integration). The only problem here is that maybe $\mu_k=0$ for some $k$. But we can take $\mu_k$ very small but nonzero instead, $u_0$ is still close to $f'$. This method gives an algorithm: everything is computable, and the only approximations are in fact the choices of "replacements" for zero $\mu_k$ (if you take it to be $1/n$, you get a sequence). 

The answer is no, as expected. The following proof is "joint work" with L. Scheele. Consider $G=\mathbb{Z}$, $K=D_\infty$ and $H:=\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. Then $G \approx K$ and $K\approx H$, but $G \not\approx H.$ Indeed, the Cayley graph associated to $\{-1,1\}$ for G and the Cayley graph associated to $\{s,t\}$ where $D_\infty=\langle s,t: s^2=t^2=1 \rangle$ are clearly isometric. Similarly, the Cayley graph associated to $\{s,st,ts\}$ for $K$ and the graph associated to $\{(0,1),(-1,0),(1,0)\}$ for $H$ are isometric. However, let $S$ be some symmetric generating set for $G$. Then $S_k$, the set of vertices which have distance precisely $k\geq 1$ from the identity, has even cardinality because $S_k$ is invariant under the mapping $x \mapsto -x$ and doesn't contain 0. Now let $T$ be some symmetric generating set for $H$. Let $k_0$ be the distance of $(0,1)$ from the identity in the associated graph. Then $T_{k_0}$, the set of vertices which have distance precisely $k_0$ from the identity, has odd cardinality. Indeed, it is invariant under the mapping $(x,y) \mapsto (-x,-y)$ since $T$ is assumed to be symmetric. But $(0,1)$ is a fixed point. 

The answer is no. Consider the family of groups $G_k:=(\mathbf Z_2{}^k)\rtimes \mathbf Z_2$, where the group on the right acts by interchanging the first and second coordinate. Then the commutator subgroup $G_k'$ is generated by $g_k:=((1,1,0,\ldots, 0),0)$, i.e. is of order two. So $G_k$ is non-abelian (of arbitrarily large order), but as little non-abelian as possible. Note that each element in $G_k$ has order dividing 4. Now let $A=\lbrace a_1,\ldots, a_n \rbrace \subseteq G_k$. Then any element in $A^m$ can be written as $a_1^{e_1} \cdots a_n^{e_n} g_k^{e_k}$, where $0\leq e_i \leq 3$ for $i=1,\ldots n$ and $e_k=0,1$. This follows by applying the identity $ab=[a,b]ba$ repeatedly. In particular, $|A^m|$ is bounded by a constant depending on $n$ only, not on $m$. Edit: To be explicit, any two elements in $G_k$ will generate a subgroup of order at most 32, so $(n,m)=(2,31)$ is one counter-example. 

Note that $M$ is invariant under the $GL_n(F)$-action given by $a \cdot (x,y):=(axa^{-1},aya^{-1})$. It follows that its closure $N$ is also invariant under $GL_n(F)$. Since $F$ is infinite and $GL_n$ is reductive, the rational points $GL_n(F)$ are Zariski-dense in $GL_n(K)$ by Borel, Linear Algebraic Groups, Corr. 18.3. (This is probably the piece of information you were missing). Then it follows that $N$ is $GL_n(K)$-invariant, as claimed.
