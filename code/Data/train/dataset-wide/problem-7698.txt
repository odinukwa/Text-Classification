As you find in "Humphreys, Reflection and Coxeter groups" (link behind paywall) in Section 5.7, the set of reflections of a Coxeter system $(W,S)$ is given by $R = \{ wsw^{-1} : w \in W, s \in S\}$, this is, all elements in $W$ that are conjugate to the generators $S$. For the permutation group $\mathcal{S_n}$ of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ generated by the set of simple transpositions $(i,i+1), 1 \leq i < n$, these then are exactly all transpositions $(i,j), 1 \leq i < j \leq n$. A few more words: A priori, a Coxeter group $W$ is an abstract group together with a distinguished set $S$ of generators. In this sense, the above notion of reflections $R$ is well-defined but not related to any geometric notion of reflection you ask for. But given $(W,S)$, one can construct a geometric representation of $W$ on a real vector space with basis $\{ \alpha_s : s \in S\}$ (see Section 5.3 in the above reference). In this representation, one can now ask for those elements that have $|S|-1$ eigenvalues $1$ and one eigenvalue $-1$. And these are the exactly the reflections $R$ in the above sense. 

(in contrary to what I thought first,) here is a proof that the "exchange condition" holds in the following sense. It is based on the root configuration in $URL$ [1]. Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system, $Q \in S^*$ a word in $S$, $w \in W$, $P$ a subword of $Q$. We everywhere consider subwords as being indexed by positions in $Q$, so if $Q = ss$, then the two subwords $s{-}$ und ${-}s$ are considered to be different. Let $(Q,w,P)$ be the set of subwords $X$ of $Q \setminus P$ such that the complement $R = Q \setminus X$ has greedy product $Dem(R) = w$ and the skips in the greedy product are in exactly the positions in $P$, we call these positions the greedy skips. (So this is the situation Allen introduced in the question, except that he did not mention the part about the complement.) Let $D(Q,w,P)$ be the simplicial complex with facets given by $(Q,w,P)$. This complex is clearly pure since every facet contains exactly $len(Q)-\ell_S(w)-len(P)$ many letters. Observation 1: For every facet $X$ of $D(Q,w,P)$, the disjoined union $X \cup (P\setminus P')$ is also a facet of $D(Q,w,P')$ for $P' \subseteq P$. Construction 2: The root configuration in Definition 3.1 in [1] is given for a facet $X$ of $D(Q,w,\{\})$ as follows. Associate to each letter $q_i$ in $Q$ a root $R(X,i)$ by applying the prefix up to position $q_{i-1}$ of the word $Q \setminus X$ of $w$ to the simple root $\alpha_{q_i}$. In my example $Q = tsstst$, the element $w = sts = tst$ and the facet $t{-}s{--}t$ with complement ${-}s{-}ts{-}$ which is a reduced word for $w$, the root configuration is $$ R(X,\cdot) =\beta,\alpha,s(\alpha),s(\beta),st(\alpha),sts(\beta) $$ where $\alpha = \alpha_s, \beta = \alpha_t$ which is equal to $$ 23,12,-12,13,23,-12 $$ where I write $12$ for $\alpha$, $23$ for $\beta$, and $13$ for $\alpha+\beta$. Observation 3: The collections of roots of the root configuration of the complement of $X$ is exactly the inversion set of $w$ (in particular, that's all positive roots). Observation 4: The negative roots in the root configuration could be used as greedy skips. This also means that picking a a facet $X$ of $D(Q,w,\{\})$, and a subset $P$ of the letters for which the root configuration is negative results in a facet $X \setminus P$ of $D(Q,w,P)$. Observation 5: If a root in the root configuration is negative, than all appearances of the same root "to the right" are also negative. Analogously, if a root there is positive then all appearances "to the left" are positive. Statement 6: The simplicial complex $D(Q,w,P)$ is vertex-decomposable has the exchange property in the following sense. Let $q_1$ be the first letter in $Q$ If $\ell_S(q_1w) < \ell_S(w)$, then for any facet $X$ of $D(Q,w,P)$, there exists a facet $Y$ of $D(Q,w,P)$ containing $X \setminus q_1$. Proof: Consider $X' = X \cup P$ as a facet of $D(Q,w,\{\})$ as in Observation 1. We now know from Observation 4 that $P$ is a subset of the negative roots in the root configuration of $X'$. We know from $\ell_S(q_1w) < \ell_S(w)$ that $\alpha_{q_1}$ is in the inversion set of $w$ which is by Observation 3 equal to the root configuration of the complement of $X$. This provides to obtain $Y'$ by "flipping" $q_1$ in $X'$ to the unique position not in $X'$ for which the root configuration is given by the same simple root $\alpha_{q_1}$. Call this position $q_i$ and we have $Y' = (X' \setminus q_1 ) \cup q_i$. It remains to show that $Y'$ contains $P$ and that all roots in the root configuration of $Y'$ at positions in $P$ are negative, since Observation 1 then tells us that $Y = Y' \setminus P$ is the desired facet of $D(Q,w,P)$. Lemma 3.3(3) in [1] tells us how the root configuration changes when doing the flip $X'$ to $Y'$. This is indeed easy to see: the roots in the root configuration after $q_i$ are not changed, while we apply $s_{q_1}$ to all the roots before that, $R(Y',j) = R(X',j)$ for $j>i$, and $R(Y',j) = s_{q_1}\big(R(X',j)\big)$ for $j \leq i$. Since we only care about the signs, observe that $s_{q_1}$ does only affect the sign of $\alpha_{q_1}$, while all other signs are unchanged. But since $R(X',i)$ is positive (and ind.eed in equal to $\alpha_{q_1}$), Observations 4 and 5 finally tell us that $P$ is a subset of the letters for which the root configuration of $Y'$ is negative. As desired, we conclude that $Y=Y' \setminus P$ is a facet of $D(Q,w,P)$. 

This is more of an expansion of Sam's comments, but too long for a comment itself: As pointed out by Sam in that Theorem 4.2.2.2, tilting modules of the linear type $A_n$ quiver are in natural correspondence to triangulations of a regular $(n+3)$-gon. Short answer: Any bijection between triangulations and Dyck paths would work, and there are plenty. Everyone is "natural" in some respect and "unnatural" in others. Longer answer: Triangulations of a polygon might be generalized to all finite type using either of the following: 

In , see , you find the algorithm G. Brinkmann and B.D. McKay, Fast generation of planar graphs, MATCH-Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry, 58(2):323-357, 2007. implemented, for which the optional package needs to be installed. From the documentation: 

As said in the comments above, this is not right what Tom wanted, but I added the content of Volume 2 to the wiki, see $URL$ So far, I left it in German - do you think it is worth translating? 

and there is a uniform type-independent bijection between them. On the other hand, Dyck paths might be generalized to antichains in the root poset of a finite crystallographic type $AC$. One now has $$|NC| = |CL| = |CS| = |AC|$$ and indeed many refinements of this identity hold (such as the one mentioned in Section 4.7). The closest connection between the two that is known is (caution, self-reference!) the article A uniform bijection between nonnesting and noncrossing partitions jointly with Drew Armstrong and Hugh Thomas. There is much more to say and more references to give, please look into (again caution!) Cataland: Why the Fuss? for all needed notions and references. 

Consider the (strong) Bruhat order on the symmetric group: This order is defined for $a,b \in \mathcal{S}_n$ as $a \leq b$ if $\ell(a) < \ell(b)$ and $at=b$ for a transposition $t$. Therefore, your factorizations are exactly the maximal chains in this poset. You find some further information about such maximal chains in A Weighted Enumeration of Maximal Chains in the Bruhat Order by John Stembridge. You indeed see the $\mathcal{S}_3$ example with 4 factorizations at the end of Section 1. 

You want to print a deck of cards of the following type: Each card shows $k$ items out of $n$ different items such that any two cards in the deck share exactly one item. 

Hello, I wonder if anyone has a copy of Deligne's letter to Looijenga from 1974 mentioned as reference [26] in Bessis' paper Finite complex reflection arrangements are $K(\pi,1)$ from 2006, see $URL$ and is willing to share it / make it publicly available. We were recently proving some results generalizing particular aspects of things that are supposed to be proven in there, and we were asked about the historical background. Unfortunately, we cannot really provide an answer since we don't have access to the letter... 

(This is more of a longer comment without a proper answer to the question.) I assume you mean "An embedding $(W,S) \hookrightarrow (W',S')$ is an injective map from $S$ to the set $T' = \{ w s w^{-1} : w \in W', s \in S' \}$ of reflections in $W'$ generating a Coxeter system isomorphic to $(W,S)$". 

I recommend reading Macdonald's volume University Lecture Series Vol 12 Symmetric functions and orthogonal polynomials. It is a rather short introduction to Macdonald polynomials for the symmetric group and for general finite Weyl groups, but everything is very well explained, organized, and self-contained. After reading this, I found myself much more comfortable getting back to Symmetric functions and Hall polynomials for futher background and details. 

This is more a comment, but here I have more space: Did you try to use the characterization of f-vectors of simplicial complexes given by Kruskal in "Joseph B. Kruskal. The number of simplices in a complex. In Mathematical optimization techniques, pages 251â€“278. Univ. of California Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1963." ? It states that a vector $(f_{-1},\ldots,f_{d-1})$ is the f-vector of a $d$-dimensional downset if and only if $$f_{-1} = 1, \quad f_j \leq f_{j-1}^{(j)}, j = 1,\ldots,d-1,$$ where $$a^{(i)} := \binom{a_i}{i+1} + \binom{a_{i-1}}{i} + \ldots + \binom{a_j}{j+1}$$ for the (unique) $i$-canonical expression $$a = \binom{a_i}{i} + \binom{a_{i-1}}{i-1} + \ldots + \binom{a_j}{j}$$ with $a_i > a_{i-1} > \ldots > a_j \geq j \geq 1$. This might give some insight on min/max values of the alternating sum of f-vectors of downsets. 

Here is a bijection to Dyck paths (or to well-formed bracketings): Take a SYT of shape $2\times n$ (so it contains the numbers $\{1,\ldots,2n\}$, and we aim to form a word of $n$ up-steps (opening brackets) and $n$ down-steps (closing brackets). Well, there is an obvious way of doing so: make the $i$-th symbol for $1 \leq i \leq 2n$ an up-step if $i$ appears in the top row of the STY and a down-step if $i$ appears in the bottom row. Then, indeed, the property of being a STY simply says that any prefix of the constructed word of $2n$ symbols contains at least as many up-steps as down-steps. This is exactly the property of being a Dyck path of length $2n$, or, equivalently, a well-formed backeting of $2n$ opening and closing brackets. I haven't actually checked, but this bijection gotta be in Stanley's list, and you certainly find it in various other places. Indeed, there is an $m$-dimensional version that gives a bijection between rectangular SYT and multidimensional Dyck paths: Let $e_i$ ($1 \leq i \leq m$) be the $i$-th standard basis vector in $\mathbb{R}^m$. One can then send a SYT of shape $m \times n$ to the sequence of length $mn$ by making the $i$-th symbol for $1 \leq i \leq mn$ equal to $e_j$ if $i$ appears in the SYT in row $j$. This map sends SYT of shape $m \times n$ to multi-dimensional Dyck paths given by all paths from $(0,\ldots,0) \in \mathbb{R}^m$ to $n\cdot(1,\ldots,1) \in \mathbb{R}^m$ which stays inside the wedge $x_1 \geq x_2 \geq \ldots \geq x_m$. These are then counted by the multi-dimensional Catalan numbers, given by $URL$ and you can find this correspondence for example in this paper of mine with Paco Santos and Volkmar Welker on page 3. 

Both are deeply related in the context of the $q,t$-Catalan numbers appearing in the theory of symmetric function as a bigraded Hilber series of (the alternating part of) the space of diagonal coinvariants. As Darij mentions, both (and as well the $q,t$-Catalan numbers and the space of diagonal coinvariants) can be found e.g. in Jim Haglund's book $URL$ You actually find quite a bit as well in our online project $URL$ and $URL$ 

The two options that seem to be best suited to compute these canonical forms are nauty and bliss. My questions are 

Eduard Looijenga provided a scanned version of the letter, which now can be found at $URL$ Many thanks for making it publicly available! I also added a section on Deligne's hand-written letters to his wikipedia page, though I am not quite sure this is the right place to collect his publicly available letters. 

Properties $B$ and $C$ are equivalent since $B2$ implies that $a_1 = 0$. This then implies that every $i \in a$ has an $i-1$ somewhere to its left, and we can drop this part of condition $B2$ to obtain Property $C3$. $a$ satisfies Property $D$ if it satisfies $C1$ and $C2$. Sequences with Property $D$ are item $u$ on Stanley's list, and are in natural bijection to Dyck paths (which are here lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ that never go below the diagonal $x=y$) by sending a path $D$ to the sequence $a$ where $a_k$ is the number of complete boxes between $D$ and the diagonal at height $i$ (this is a well-known bijection). Since Property $C$ is strictly stronger than Property $D$, we now have reached an embedding of Sequences of length $n$ with Property $A$ into Dyck paths of length $2n$. Next, we apply the ''zeta map'' $\zeta$ as defined in Jim Haglund's book on $q,t$-Catalan numbers on page 50. This map is defined by given a sequence $a = (a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ satisfying Property $D$, it returns a Dyck path as follows:
