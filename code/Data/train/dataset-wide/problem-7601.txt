I think it's completely unreasonable to expect authors to have read and completely understood the details of every paper that they cite in their references. Most authors certainly do not do that. We'd never have time to write any of our own papers if we had to thoroughly digest every single other paper that is relevant to our work. As I see it, the rules should be: (1) don't cite anything you don't refer to in the paper. (2) only cite those papers which are relevant to your work, although it's okay to have some papers in your references which are only cited in the sense of "papers [x] and [y] and [z] also consider similar problems..." and (3) you should completely understand the statement of any result you use. If you haven't actually checked the details of the proof, most mathematicians with experience in their fields can skim over a proof and decide whether or not they believe it. If the reference has been published and later turns out to be incorrect (which sadly happens all too often) then you cannot be held responsible for that. Of course, the language of the paper you cite is completely irrelevant. I've never before heard of a referee caring about this. 

I promised Sean a detailed answer, so here it is. As Jos√© has already mentioned, it is only $G_2$ (of the five exceptional Lie groups) which can arise as the holonomy group of a Riemannian manifold. Berger's classification in the 1950's could not rule it out, and neither could he rule out the Lie group $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$, but these were generally believed to not possibly be able to exist. However, in the early 1980's Robert Bryant succeeded in proving the existence of local examples (on open balls in Euclidean spaces). Then in the late 1980's Bryant and Simon Salamon found the first complete, non-compact examples of such manifolds, on total spaces of certain vector bundles, using symmetry (cohomogeneity one) methods. (Since then there are many examples of non-compact cohomogeneity one $G_2$ manifolds found by physicists.) Finally, in 1994 Dominic Joyce stunned the mathematical community by proving the existence of hundreds of compact examples. His proof is non-constructive, using hard analysis involving the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a non-linear elliptic equation, much as Yau's solution of the Calabi conjecture gives a non-constructive proof of the existence and uniqueness of Calabi-Yau metrics (holonomy $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ metrics) on Kahler manifolds satisfying certain conditions. (In 2000 Alexei Kovalev found a new construction of compact $G_2$ manifolds that produced several hundred more non-explicit examples. These are the only two known compact constructions to date.) It is exactly this similarity to Calabi-Yau manifolds (and to Kahler manifolds in general) that I will explain. When it comes to Riemannian holonomy, the aspect of the group $G_2$ which is important is not really that it is one of the five exceptional Lie groups, but rather that it is the automorphism group of the octonions $\mathbb O$, an $8$-dimensional non-associative real division algebra. The octonions come equipped with a positive definite inner product, and the span of the identity element $1$ is called the real octonions while its orthogonal complement is called the imaginary octonions $\mathrm{Im} \mathbb O \cong \mathbb R^7$. This is entirely analogous to the quaternions $\mathbb H$, except that the non-associativity introduces some new complications. In fact the analogy allows us to define a cross product on $\mathbb R^7$ in the same way, as follows. Let $u, v \in \mathbb R^7 \cong \mathrm{Im} \mathbb O$ and define $u \times v = \mathrm{Im}(uv)$, where $uv$ denotes the octonion product. (In fact the real part of $uv$ is equal to $-\langle u, v \rangle$, just as it is for quaternions.) This cross product satisfies the following relations: \begin{equation} u \times v = - v \times u, \qquad \qquad \langle u \times v , u \rangle = 0, \qquad \qquad {|| u\times v||}^2 = {|| u \wedge v ||}^2, \end{equation} exactly like the cross product on $\mathbb R^3 \cong \mathrm{Im} \mathbb H$. However, there is a difference, unlike the cross product in $\mathbb R^3$, the following expression is not zero: \begin{equation} u \times (v \times w) + \langle u, v \rangle w - \langle u, w \rangle v \end{equation} but is instead a measure of the failure of the associativity $(uv)w - u(vw)$, up to a factor. Note that on $\mathbb R^7$ there can be defined a $3$-form (totally skew-symmetric trilinear form) using the cross product as follows: $\varphi(u,v,w) = \langle u \times v, w \rangle$, which is called the associative $3$-form for reasons that we won't get into here. Digression: In fact one can show that only on $\mathbb R^3$ and $\mathbb R^7$ can one construct such a cross product, and this is intimately related to the fact that only the spheres $S^2$ and $S^6$ can admit almost complex structures. But I digress... Getting back to $G_2$ geometry: a $7$-dimensional smooth manifold $M$ is said to admit a $G_2$-structure if there is a reduction of the structure group of its frame bundle from $\mathrm{GL}(7, \mathbb R)$ to the group $G_2$ which can actually be viewed naturally as a subgroup of $\mathrm{SO}(7)$. For those familiar with $G$-structures, this tells you that a $G_2$-structure determines a Riemannian metric and an orientation. In fact, one can show on a manifold with $G_2$-structure, there exists a non-degenerate $3$-form $\varphi$ for which, given a point $p$ on $M$, there exists local coordinates near $p$ such that, in those coordinates, at the point $p$, the form $\varphi$ is exactly the associative $3$-form on $\mathbb R^7$ discussed above. Now one can show that there is a way to canonically determine both a metric and an orientation in a highly non-linear way from this $3$-form $\varphi$. Then one can define a cross product $\times$ by essentially using the metric to ``raise an index'' on $\varphi$. In summary, a manifold $(M, \varphi)$ with $G_2$-structure comes equipped with a metric, cross product, $3$-form, and orientation, which satisfy \begin{equation} \varphi(u,v,w) = \langle u \times v , w \rangle. \end{equation} This is exactly analogous to the data of an almost Hermitian manifold, which comes with a metric, an almost complex structure $J$, a $2$-form $\omega$, and an orientation, which satisfy \begin{equation} \omega(u,v) = \langle Ju , v \rangle. \end{equation} Essentially, a manifold admits a $G_2$-structure if one can identify each of its tangent spaces with the imaginary octonions $\mathrm{Im} \mathbb O \cong \mathbb R^7$ in a smoothly varying way, just as an almost Hermitian manifold is one in which we can identify each of its tangent spaces with $\mathbb C^m$ (together with its Euclidean inner product) in a smoothly varying way. For a manifold to admit a $G_2$-structure, the necessary and sufficient conditions are that it be orientable and spin. (This is equivalent to the vanishing of the first two Stiefel-Whitney classes.) So there are lots of such $7$-manifolds, just as there are lots of almost Hermitian manifolds. But the story does not end there. Let $(M, \varphi)$ be a manifold with $G_2$-structure. Since it determines a Riemannian metric $g_{\varphi}$, there is an induced Levi-Civita covariant derivative $\nabla$, and one can ask if $\nabla \varphi = 0$? If this is the case, $(M, \varphi)$ is called a $G_2$-manifold, and one can show that the Riemannian holonomy of $g_{\varphi}$ is contained in the group $G_2 \subset \mathrm{SO}(7)$. These are much harder to find, because it involves solving a fully non-linear partial differential equation for the unknown $3$-form $\varphi$. They are in some ways analogous to Kahler manifolds, which are exactly those almost Hermitian manifolds that satisfy $\nabla \omega = 0$, but those are much easier to find. One reason is because the metric $g$ and the almost complex structure $J$ on an almost Hermitian manifold are essentially independent (they just have to satisfy the mild condition of compatibility) whereas in the $G_2$ case, the metric and the cross product are determined non-linearly from $\varphi$. However, the analogy is not perfect, because one can show that when $\nabla \varphi = 0$, the Ricci curvature of $g_{\varphi}$ necessarily vanishes. So $G_2$-manifolds are always Ricci-flat! (This is one reason that physicists are interested in such manifolds---they play a role as ``compactifications'' in $11$-dimensional $M$-theory analogous to the role of Calabi-Yau $3$-folds in $10$-dimensional string theory.) So in some sense $G_2$-manifolds are more like Ricci-flat Kahler manifolds, which are the Calabi-Yau manifolds. In fact, if we allow the holonomy to be a proper subgroup of $G_2$, there are many examples of $G_2$-manifolds. For example, the flat torus $T^7$, or the product manifolds $T^3 \times CY2$ and $S^1 \times CY3$, where $CYn$ is a Calabi-Yau $n$-fold, have Riemannian holonomy groups properly contained in $G_2$. These are in some sense ``trivial'' examples because they reduce to lower-dimension constructions. The manifolds with full holonomy $G_2$ are also called irreducible $G_2$-manifolds and it is precisely these manifolds that Bryant, Bryant-Salamon, Joyce, and Kovalev constructed. We are lacking a ``Calabi-type conjecture'' which would give necessary and sufficient conditions for a compact $7$-manifold which admits $G_2$-structures to admit a $G_2$-structure which is parallel ($\nabla \varphi = 0$.) Indeed, we don't even know what the conjecture should be. There are topological obstructions which are known, but we are far from knowing sufficient conditions. In fact, this question is more similar to the following: suppose $M^{2n}$ is a compact, smooth, $2n$-dimensional manifold that admits almost complex structures. What are necessary and sufficient conditions for $M$ to admit Kahler metrics? We certainly know many necessary topological conditions, but (as far as I know, and correct me if I am wrong) we are nowhere near knowing sufficient conditions. What makes the Calabi conjecture tractable (I almost said easy, of course it is anything but easy) is the fact that we already start with a Kahler manifold (holonomy $\mathrm{U}(m)$ metric) and want to reduce the holonomy by only $1$ dimension, to $\mathrm{SU}(m)$. Then the $\partial \bar \partial$-lemma in Kahler geometry allows us to reduce the Calabi conjecture to a (albeit fully non-linear) elliptic PDE for a single scalar function. Any analogous ``conjecture'' in either the Kahler or the $G_2$ cases would have to involve a system of PDEs, which are much more difficult to deal with. That's my not-so-short crash course in $G_2$-geometry. I hope some people read all the way to the end of this... 

Sorry it took so long. The scanned version of Uhlenbeck's preprint is available here: $URL$ I can leave it there for a few months, at least. 

I believe you can find this in the papers of Lockhart and McOwen. Specifically, check Lockhart, Robert B.; McOwen, Robert C. Elliptic differential operators on noncompact manifolds. Ann. Scuola Norm. Sup. Pisa Cl. Sci. (4) 12 (1985), no. 3, 409--447. MR0837256 0837256 or Lockhart, Robert. Fredholm, Hodge and Liouville theorems on noncompact manifolds. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 301 (1987), no. 1, 1--35. MR0879560 0879560 At least, that's where I learned these things. A more recent and very clear exposition can be found in the thesis of Stephen Marshall, which is available on Dominic Joyce's website, but his treatment is specific to asympotically cylindrical or asympototically conical Riemannian manifolds. The ALE spaces are similar and are amenable to essentially the same treatment, if I recall correctly. 

There are several different "definitions" of Calabi-Yau manifolds, not all equivalent, and not all contained in one general definition. A good discussion of some of these inequivalent definitions can be found in Joyce's book: Compact Manifolds with Special Holonomy The other answers you have gotten so far seem to be from the algebraic geometry side of things, and are fine in that context. From a Riemannian geometry point of view, the most natural definition of a Calabi-Yau manifold (whether compact or non-compact) is a $2n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold for which the holonomy of the Levi-Civita connection is exactly $SU(n)$. Allowing the holonomy to be a proper subgroup of $SU(n)$ is also common. In that case, hyperKahler (which is holonomy $Sp(n/2)$ in dimension $4n$) can also be considered as being Calabi-Yau, for example. This Riemannian geometry definition is equivalent to the existence of the "Calabi-Yau package": a Riemannian metric $g$, an integrable complex structure $J$ (orthogonal with respect to $g$) together which induce the associated Kahler form $\omega$ by $\omega(X,Y) = g(JX, Y)$, and a holomorphic volume form $\Omega$, which is a holomorphic $(n,0)$-form on $M$. These tensors must satisfy: (1) $\nabla \omega = 0$ (equivalent to $\nabla J = 0$, the Kahler condition) This is also equivalent to $d\omega = 0$ because we are assuming $J$ to be integrable. (2) $\nabla \Omega = 0$ (3) $\frac{\omega^n}{n!} = c_n \, \Omega \wedge \bar \Omega$ for some universal constant $c_n$ depending only on the dimension which I can never remember. These conditions imply, in particular that $g$ is Ricci-flat and $c_1(M) = 0$. Also, if the holonomy is exactly $SU(n)$ rather than a proper subgroup, then it also follows that $h^{p,0} = h^{0,p} = 0$ for all $1 \leq p \leq n-1$. 

There are lots of links to various pages filled with online video lectures here: $URL$ Go to "Links" on the left hand side. Some of the links are broken or out of date, but there's still a ton of good stuff here. 

I started thinking about this question because of this discussion: $URL$ about how journals often change a paper (for the worse) after acceptance. Here's my question: Since it doesn't make sense to number every single equation (especially if you will only refer to it once in the text), I often use the phrase "the equation above" or "the equation below" to refer to the previous or next displayed equation. I am well aware that after compiling, said equation may be on the previous or next page, respectively, and not strictly above or below. I thought this was common practice. One journal publisher changed every single one of my "the above equation" phrases to "the earlier equation". I didn't bother protesting, but in my mind it definitely made the text worse. Do other people avoid using "above" and "below"? 

I can give you a partial answer- a reformulation of your question. Perhaps others will then be able to give a counterexample. (I think it is not true in general.) Let's start from the beginning. A map $h : M \to \mathbb C$ is $J$-holomorphic iff $h_* (J Y) = i h_* (Y)$ for every vector field $Y$ on $M$. Equivalently, $dh(JY) = i dh(Y)$, or $(JY) (h) = i Y(h)$, or $(Y + i JY)h = 0$, or $(Y - iJY)h = 2Yh$ for any $Y$. The condition that $X$ is an infinitesmal automorphism of the almost complex structure $J$ is that $[X,JY] = J[X,Y]$ for all $Y$. We want to investigate the question of under what conditions on $J$, for such an $X$, is it true that $(X- i JX)f = 2 Xf$ will be $J$-holomorphic for any $J$-holomorphic $f$. Ignoring the factor of $2$, we see that \begin{equation*} Xf \text{ is $J$-holomorphic} \Leftrightarrow (Y + iJY)(Xf) = 0 \text{ for all $Y$} \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} \Leftrightarrow Y(Xf) = -i(JY)(Xf) \text{ for all $Y$} \end{equation*} Recall the definition of the Nijenhuis tensor $N_J(X,Y) = [JX, JY] - J[JX, Y] - J[X,JY] - [X,Y]$. Since $X$ is an infinitesmal automorphism of $J$, the last two terms cancel. Applying both sides of this equation to a $J$-holomorphic map $f$, we get \begin{equation*} N_J(X,Y) f = (JX)((JY)f) - (JY)((JX)f) - (J[JX,Y])f = (JX)(iYf) - (JY)(iXf) - i [JX,Y]f \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} = i \left( (JX) (Yf) - (JY)(Xf) - (JX)(Yf) + Y((JX)f) \right) \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} = i \left( - (JY)(Xf) + i Y(Xf) \right) \end{equation*} which is exactly the quantity that we need to vanish. Therefore, $Xf$ will also be $J$-holomorphic iff $N_J(X,Y)f = 0$ for all vector fields $Y$. In particular, this always holds if $J$ is integrable, since then $N_J$ vanishes identically. I don't know an example where $J$ is not integrable but where such an $X$ and $f$ exist. If there is one (which I would bet there is), then in that case $Xf$ would not be $J$-holomorphic. 

Using the additional information that the OP provided in the comments to Yael Fregier's answer, I can elaborate as follows: I still don't know what "special complex manifold" means, but in any case, I will assume the following. If $(M, J, \nabla)$ is a complex manifold with a connection $\nabla$ coming from a metric $g$, (that is, $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection of $g$), then we get an associated symplectic form $\omega(X,Y) = g(JX, Y)$, and $\omega$ is parallel with respect to $\nabla$ if and only if $J$ is parallel with respect to $\nabla$, if and only if $J$ is integrable and $\omega$ is closed. That is, $(M, g, J, \omega)$ is Kaehler. In this case, $\omega$ is harmonic, so its Hodge decomposition is $\omega = \omega \in \Delta_2$, where $\Delta_2$ is the space of harmonic $2$-forms on $M$, using the notation of the OP. If $\nabla$ does not come from a metric, you still need some metric to define the co-derivative $d^* = \delta$ of $d$, and to define the Laplacian $\Delta$. One can indeed do this with a different connection $\nabla$, as long as you have a metric. But in this case it is not clear to me what the symplectic form $\omega$ is, and how it is related to $J$ and $\nabla$. Added later: I think I just realized that the OP is not asking about the Hodge decomposition of the form $\omega$ in particular, just the "Hodge decomposition" for a "special symplectic manifold." There is a version of "symplectic Hodge theory." See, for example, these notes by Victor Guillemin: $URL$ --- I don't know if this is the same thing mentioned in Yael Fregier's answer. Otherwise, I remain confused by the question.
