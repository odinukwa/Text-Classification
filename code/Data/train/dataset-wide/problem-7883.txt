Here is a partial answer. Given a directed set $D$, we say that a subset $A\subseteq D$ is cofinal if for each $d\in D$ there is some $a\in A$ with $d\leq a$. We say that $A\subseteq D$ is bounded if $A\subseteq\downarrow d=\{x\in D|x\leq d\}$ for some $d\in D$ and we say that $A$ is unbounded if it is not bounded. Let $D,E$ be two directed sets. Then we say that a function $f:D\rightarrow E$ (not necessarily order preserving) is a cofinal map (also called a convergent map) if the image of every cofinal subset of $D$ is a cofinal subset of $E$. A function $g:E\rightarrow D$ (not necessarily order preserving) is said to be unbounded (also called a Tukey map) if the image of every unbounded subset of $E$ is an unbounded subset of $D$. If $D,E$ are posets, then there is an unbounded map $f:D\rightarrow E$ if and only if there is a cofinal map $g:E\rightarrow D$, and in either case we say that $D$ is Tukey reducible to $E$ and we write $D\leq_{T}E$. The Tukey ordering $\leq_{T}$ in a sense measures how big your directed set is. Clearly the class of directed sets can be made a category where the morphisms are either the cofinal maps or the unbounded maps, and these categories are enough for us to define the Tukey ordering. I conjecture that one can take a quotient category of one of these categories to get a more natural category of directed sets(i.e. where a directed set is isomorphic to each of its cofinal subsets), but I don't see how exactly to go about this. Perhaps someone else will give a better and more complete answer to this question. 

Let $x=^{\lim}_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mu^{*}(A_{n}\cap E)$. If $x=\infty$, then clearly $\mu^{*}(\bigcup_{n}(A_{n}\cap E))=\infty=^{\lim}_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mu^{*}(A_{n}\cap E)$. Now assume that $x<\infty$. Then for each $\epsilon>0$ there is some $N$ where $x-\mu^{*}(A_{N}\cap E)<\epsilon$. Let $B_{n}=E\cap(A_{n+1}\setminus A_{n})$ for all $n$. Then for all positive integers $L$, the sets $A_{N}\cap E,B_{N+1},B_{N+3},...,B_{N+2L+1}$ are pairwise separated, and the sets $A_{N}\cap E,B_{N+2},B_{N+4},...,B_{N+2L}$ are pairwise separated as well. Therefore, we have $$\mu^{*}(A_{N}\cap E)+\mu^{*}(B_{N+1})+\mu^{*}(B_{N+3})+...+\mu^{*}(B_{N+2L+1})$$ $$=\mu^{*}((A_{N}\cap E)\cup B_{N+1}\cup...\cup B_{N+2L+1}) \leq\mu^{*}(A_{N+2L+2}\cap E)\leq x,$$ so $$\mu^{*}(B_{N+1})+\mu^{*}(B_{N+3})+...+\mu^{*}(B_{N+2L+1})\leq x-\mu^{*}(A_{N}\cap E)<\epsilon.$$ Similarly, we have $$\mu^{*}(A_{N}\cap E)+\mu^{*}(B_{N+2})+...+\mu^{*}(B_{N+2L})$$ $$=\mu^{*}((A_{N}\cap E)\cup B_{N+2}\cup...\cup B_{N+2L})$$ $$\leq\mu^{*}(A_{N+2L+1})\leq x.$$ Therefore, $\mu^{*}(B_{N+2})+\mu^{*}(B_{N+4})+...+\mu^{*}(B_{N+2L})\leq x-\mu^{*}(A_{N}\cap E)<\epsilon$. We therefore conclude that $\mu^{*}(B_{N+1})+\mu^{*}(B_{N+2})+...+\mu^{*}(B_{N+2L+1})<2\epsilon$. Since $L$ is arbitrary, we have $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mu^{*}(B_{N+k})\leq 2\epsilon$. Therefore, we conclude that $$\mu^{*}(\bigcup_{n}(A_{n}\cap E))\leq\mu^{*}(A_{N+1}\cap E)+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mu^{*}(B_{N+k})\leq x+2\epsilon.$$ 

whenever $d$ is a metric inducing the topology on $X$ there is a metric $d'$ inducing the topology on $Y$ with $L(d,h)=L(d',h)$ for each monotone mapping $h:[0,a]\rightarrow[0,b]$ with $h(0)=0$ and $x\leq y\Rightarrow h(x)\leq h(y)$, and whenever $d$ is a metric inducing the topology on $Y$, there is a metric $d'$ inducing the topology on $X$ with $L(d,h)=L(d',h)$ for each monotone mapping $h:[0,a]\rightarrow[0,b]$ with $h(0)=0$ and $x\leq y\Rightarrow h(x)\leq h(y)$. 

Since all of the answers to this question(except the one involving Alexander's subbase lemma) refer to a usually strange rehashing of the ultrafilter proof (BOO), I decided to give two nice proofs to Tychonoff's theorem here for Hausdorff spaces. The first proof of Tychonoff's theorem for Hausdorff spaces uses the Stone-Cech compactification. This proof is useful when one constructs the Stone-Cech compactification before Tychonoff's theorem. Proof: Assume that $X_{i}$ is compact for $i\in I$. Let $X=\prod_{i\in I}X_{i}$ be the product space. Then each projection $\pi_{i}:X\rightarrow X_{i}$ extends to a continuous map $\overline{\pi_{i}}:\beta X\rightarrow X_{i}$ since each $X_{i}$ is compact. Therefore the map $f:\beta X\rightarrow X$ where $f(x_{i})_{i\in I}=(\overline{\pi_{i}}(x))_{i\in I}$ is a continuous surjection, so $X$ is compact being the continuous surjective image of $\beta X$. QED For the second proof we use the following facts about uniform spaces that every mathematician should be aware of. i. Every compact Hausdorff space has a unique compatible uniformity and that uniformity is complete and totally bounded. ii. If a uniform space is complete and totally bounded, then it is compact. Tychonoff's theorem then immediately follows from the fact that the product of complete uniform spaces is complete and that the product of totally bounded uniform spaces is totally bounded. And this proof is intuitive because it is easier to imagine that the product of complete and totally bounded uniform spaces is complete and totally bounded than to imagine that the product of compact spaces is compact. 

One can generalize the notion of compactness so that the property that bijection implies homeomorphism still holds. Suppose that $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal. Then a completely regular space $X$ is said to be a $P_{\kappa}$-space if whenever $|I|<\kappa$ and $U_{i}$ is open for each $i\in I$, then $\bigcap_{i\in I}U_{i}$ is open as well. A topological space $X$ is said to be $\kappa$-compact if every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $X$ has a subcover $\mathcal{V}$ with $|\mathcal{V}|<\kappa$. Then whenever $X,Y$ are $\kappa$-compact $P_{\kappa}$-space and $f:X\rightarrow Y$ are continuous bijections, then $f$ is a homeomorphism. The proof is exactly the same as the proof using compact Hausdorff spaces. In fact, the much of the basic theory of $\kappa$-compact $P_{\kappa}$-spaces is identical the the basic theory of compact Hausdorff spaces, so many results about compact Hausdorff spaces also apply to $\kappa$-compact $P_{\kappa}$-spaces. 

The transfinite process that you mentioned above is well defined since there is a limitless supply of ordinals and you never enter an infinite loop in the transfinite process. On the other hand, one can avoid transfinite induction simply by using connectedness in a different topology. Let $X$ be a poset. We say that $U\subseteq X$ is an upper set if whenever $x\leq y$ and $x\in U$, then $y\in U$ as well. The Alexandroff topology on $X$ is the topology where the open sets are precisely the upper sets. It is easy to see that a poset $X$ is connected as a poset if and only if $X$ is connected in the Alexandroff topology. Now let $X$ be a Priestley space. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the topology on $X$ where $U\in\mathcal{T}$ if and only if $U\subseteq X$ is an open upper set. Then what you call a component in a Priestley space should be the components in the topology $\mathcal{T}$ (I have not checked all the details in making sure that this notion of connectedness coincides with the transfinite procedure you mentioned yet but it seems like it will work.). I should also mention that the topology $\mathcal{T}$ mentioned above has uses besides defining a notion of connectedness for Priestley spaces. The topology $(X,\mathcal{T})$ turns out to be a stably compact space. Furthermore, one obtains a duality between all stably compact spaces and compact Hausdorff ordered spaces $X$ (where $\leq$ is closed in $X^{2}$) using the topology consisting of upper open sets. These notes give some information on the duality between stably compact spaces and compact Hausdorff ordered spaces.
