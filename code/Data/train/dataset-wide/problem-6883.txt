Regarding Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) [in a $2\times2$ normal form game, where Row player chooses between Top and Bottom]: 

You said that the consumer hates both goods. Compare the utilities from the bundles $(10,10)$ and $(5,5)$ and see which is higher (and thus more preferred). 

Most theorems in economics would satisfy the consensus requirement. However, depending on what you consider to be common sense, different results will qualify. The following are two results that I found sufficiently hard to believe when I first encountered them. 

Fudenberg and Tirole (1991) Fudenberg and Tirole's Game Theory textbook defines perfect information informally (on page 72) as follows 

This is not true. Instead WARP would say that it is not possible for Andrew to be chosen whenever both Andrew and Barbara are in the choice set, which is different than your claim above. Just because $b$ is chosen from the set $\{a,b\}$ doesn't mean that $b$ should always be chosen, e.g. from the set $\{b,c\}$. It just means that $b$ is revealed-preferred to $a$, but it doesn't mean that $b$ is preferred to all other possible alternatives (in particular, $c$). For example, the preference $c\succ b\succ a$ is perfectly consistent with the revealed choice pattern of the firm. Write out the two conditions explicitly: $$ \begin{align} C(\color{red}{\varnothing},\color{red}{\{a\}},\{b\},\color{red}{\{a,b\}})&=\{b\}\tag{1}\\ C(\color{red}{\varnothing},\color{red}{\{b\}},\{c\},\color{red}{\{b,c\}})&=\{c\}\tag{2} \end{align} $$ $(1)$ just says that whenever the four choices --- hire no one, hire $a$ only, hire $b$ only, hire both --- are present, the firm hires $b$ only. Likewise, $(2)$ says whenever the four choices --- hire no one, hire $b$ only, hire $c$ only, hire both --- are present, the firm hires $c$ only. These two are consistent with WARP (for $(1)$, the x in your quoted definition is $a$ and y is $b$; for $(2)$, x is $b$ and y is $c$). For restrictions on $C(2^{\{a,b,c\}})$, writing it out explicitly, we get $$ C(\color{red}{\varnothing},\color{red}{\{a\}},\color{red}{\{b\}},\color{black}{\{c\}},\color{red}{\{a,b\}},\color{black}{\{a,c\}},\color{red}{\{b,c\}},\color{black}{\{a,b,c\}})=\{\{a\},\{a,c\},\{a,b,c\}\} $$ where the elements colored in red are revealed to be inferior according to $(1)$ and $(2)$. 

I know Harvard posts its past comprehensive exams: $URL$ I imagine many other schools would have such resources available to the public as well. You'd just have to do a little bit of Googling to find out. However, I doubt that any of these past exam questions would have solutions available (and they should not be). You should try the questions on your own. If you're stuck, discuss the issues with your classmates/friends/professors. You're also welcome to ask questions here, but be sure to following our policy on homework questions and the general guidelines of this site. 

Observe that \begin{align} L_2&=L_1+(0.01,-0.11,0.1)\\ L_3&=L_4+(0.01,-0.11,0.1). \end{align} Therefore, the indifference curves passing through $L_1$ and $L_4$ should be parallel. Since $L_1\succ L_2$, the latter lottery should lie below the IC through $L_1$. By implication of the parallelism of the ICs, $L_3$ should also lie below the IC through $L_4$. But we're given that $L_3\succ L_4$. This means that $L_4$ lies below the IC through $L_3$ (the blue dashed line). Since parallelism of ICs is a necessary condition of independence, the agent's preference is inconsistent with independence, because it can only be justified by a set of non-parallel ICs. Alternatively, you can think of the inconsistency between the agent's preference and expected utility theory in the following way. Suppose expected utility theory holds. Then $L_1\succ L_2$ is equivalent to the inequality \begin{equation} u(\$1)>0.01u(\$0)+0.89u(\$1)+0.1u(\$5). \end{equation} Adding $0.89u(\$0)-0.89u(\$1)$ on both sides, we get \begin{equation} 0.89u(\$0)+0.11u(\$1)>0.9u(\$0)+0.1u(\$5). \end{equation} But this second inequality is simply saying $L_4\succ L_3$, which is contradictory to the agent's preference. 

In such an auction, it is a weakly dominant strategy for every bidder to bid their true valuation of the object. The reasoning is similar to the second price auction. 

A colleague of mine pointed me to Steven M. Sheffrin's Rational Expectations, where I found the explanation (on p.122): 

Identities here simply means names. When applying an impartial SWF, one only looks at the profile of utilities, not who those utilities are associated with. Consider the following two cases: \begin{array}{ccc} &U_{\text{President}}&U_{\text{CEO}}&U_{\text{Farmer}} \\\hline \text{Case 1}& 100 & 80 & 10\\ \text{Case 2}& 10 & 100 & 80 \end{array} The patterns of the distribution of well-being/utility in the two cases are essentially the same, and yet they differ in who is better/worse off. An impartial SWF would generate the same outcome in both cases, since it only focuses on the pattern (i.e. the utility numbers) of the well-being distribution and not on who (i.e. the identity) has which level of utility. In particular, the fact that the President is the happiest person in Case 1 but the most miserable in Case 2 has no impact whatsoever on the outcome of the impartial SWF. 

Consider a typical car, which is made of one car-body (for lack of a better word) and four tires. Let $x_1$ denote the number of car-bodies and $x_2$ denote the number of tires. Most consumers would prefer cars in the form of one car-body with four tires, and not in any other combinations. So we may represent their preference as $$U(x_1,x_2)=\min\{4x_1,x_2\}.\tag{1}$$ Thus two cars are preferred to one car can be expressed as $$ (2,8)\succ(1,4)\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad U(2,8)=8>4=U(1,4). \tag{2} $$ One car with two extra tires does not increase one's utility: $$ (1,4)\sim(1,6)\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad U(1,4)=4=4=U(1,6). \tag{3} $$ Equation $(1)$ is the utility function associated with a perfect complement preference. In particular, it is a special case of the general form $\min\{ax_1,bx_2\}$ where $a=4$ and $b=1$. Let's now apply an affine positive transformation to $U(x_1,x_2)$. To avoid notational confusion, let's use $\alpha\in\mathbb R$ and $\beta>0$ as the parameters: $$ V(x_1,x_2)=\alpha+\beta U(x_1,x_2). $$ For concreteness, suppose $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=0.5$. And we can verify that the preference illustrated in $(2)$ and $(3)$ is preserved: $$ (2,8)\succ(1,4)\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad V(2,8)=5>3=V(1,4). $$ $$ (1,4)\sim(1,6)\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad V(1,4)=3=3=V(1,6). $$ Therefore, while $\min\{ax_1,bx_2\}$ represents some perfect complement preference, its monotonic transformation, $\alpha+\beta\min\{ax_1,bx_2\}$, also represents the same preference. 

Your quoted definition of strict/weak dominance solvability makes me a little uncomfortable though. I'd say 

I think you do mean cue utilization theory. According to the link provided in @NickJ's comment, and as far as economic theory goes, I'd say that cue utilization is basically a signaling story. Putting "cues" on organic food products (e.g. the "organic" label, information on nutrition and natural content) amounts to a signaling act committed by the seller. Since the organic cues is less costly for the real organic food producers to produce (for instance, labeling non-organic foods as organic would face legal disputes, and hence a negative expected cost), these cues (or signals) are reliable. Thus in principle, organic food sellers sending cues to consumers is no different from the classical signaling model where job seekers uses university degrees to signal their ability. 

A stronger hint: Write $p_2=1-p_1$, so that $Z(p)=Z(p_1,1-p_1)$. Use the conditions $Z_1(0,1)>0,Z_1(1,0)<0$ etc. and the intermediate value theorem to argue that there exists a $p_1^*\in(0,1)$ such that $Z_1(p_1^*,1-p_1^*)=0$. 

NB: The book is huge --- 1798 pages, and yet still modestly priced (Â£30 or $47). Definitely a bargain. 

The value function used in Kahneman's prospect theory (which your plot shows) is supposed to capture empirically observed behavior of people's attitudes towards gains/losses as well as to risks in those domains. In the domain for gains, people are usually risk averse. However, in the domain for losses, people do tend to take larger risks. A nice illustration is the observation that when a gambler is losing money (relative to the amount he came to the casino with), he tends to wager on higher stakes (larger risks), perhaps in an attempt to "win back" the losses. So the convex curvature in the domain of losses is meant to capture this type of behavior.
