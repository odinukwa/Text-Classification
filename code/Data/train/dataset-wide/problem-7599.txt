$\newcommand{\M}{\mathcal{M}}$ Suppose I have a monoidal simplicial model category in which every object is cofibrant $(\M,\otimes,\mathbb{1})$ and I want to look at its underlying monoidal quasicategory, which I'll write as $N(\M)$, the simplicial nerve of $\M$. One way to do this is the following construction (following Variant 4.1.3.17 of Lurie's Higher Algebra): First take the sub-simplicial monoidal category of fibrant and cofibrant objects of $\M$, denoted $\M^\circ$. This is still a monoidal simplicial category. Now produce its so-called "category of operators," i.e. the free semi-cartesian monoidal category on its underlying simplicial multicategory. To be explicit, do the following: Let $Multi(\M^\circ)$ be the simplicial multicategory whose objects are the objects of $M^\circ$ and whose "multimapping" objects are $$Mul(\{m_1,\ldots,m_k\},m)=\coprod_{\alpha\in\Sigma_k} Hom_{\M^\circ}(m_{\alpha(1)}\otimes\cdots\otimes m_{\alpha(k)},m).$$ Now produce the category of operators of this multicategory, which I'll write as $(\M^\circ)^\otimes$. This category has as objects pairs $(\langle k\rangle,\{m_1,\ldots,m_k\})$ where $\langle n\rangle$ is the finite pointed set $\{\ast,1,\ldots,k\}$ and $\{m_1,\ldots,m_k\}$ is a finite list of objects of $Multi(\M^\circ)$ (hence a finite list of objects of $\M^\circ$). This category has mapping objects given by $$Hom_{(\M^\circ)^\otimes}((\langle k\rangle,\{m_1,\ldots,m_k\}),(\langle j\rangle\{l_1,\ldots,l_j\}))=\coprod_{f:\langle k\rangle\to\langle j\rangle}\prod_{1\leq r\leq j}Mul(\{m_i\}_{i\in f^{-1}(r)},l_r).$$ This construction probably seems a bit unwieldy, but the point is that this final category $(\M^\circ)^\otimes$ admits a forgetful functor $(\M^\circ)^\otimes\to Ass^\otimes$, the category of operators of the associative operad. In this case, since all of our mapping objects are Kan complexes (this follows from the fact that we took bifibrant objects and that cofibrant objects are closed under tensor product), we get that $N((M^\circ)^\otimes)\to N(Ass^\otimes)$ defines a monoidal structure on the quasicategory $N(M^\circ)$. Now, my question is about the following: Suppose my simplicial monoidal model category $\M$ has a tensor product that preserves fibrant objects in addition to cofibrant objects. Then take the opposite category of $\M^\circ$, which we'll write $(\M^\circ)^{op}$, which is still a simplicial monoidal category. Moreover, since the tensor product preserves fibrancy, the mapping objects of $((\M^\circ)^{op})^\otimes$ are Kan complexes and so we still have a structure map of quasicategories $N(((\M^\circ)^{op})^\otimes)\to N(Ass^\otimes)$ defining a monoidal structure on $N((\M^\circ)^{op})$. My question is the following: is the monoidal structure so defined on $N((\M^\circ)^{op})$ equivalent to the monoidal structure on $N(M^\circ)^{op}$ obtained by using the Grothendieck construction to get a functor $N(Ass^\otimes)\to Cat_\infty$, composing with $op$ to get a functor $N(Ass^\otimes)\to Cat_\infty\overset{op}\to Cat_\infty$ and then reversing the Grothendieck construction? ----(EDIT)---- Perhaps a bit of background. The main point of this whole thing here is to take a simplicial monoidal model category and lift strict comonoids and comodules therein to its associated monoidal quasicategory (in the sense of Lurie). These can be relatively easily defined to be strict monoids and modules in the opposite category, but one runs into difficulties using Lurie's set-up to access the monoidal structure on the nerve of the opposite category. When the tensor product preserves fibrancy it seems like the above construction might be a work around. At the very least, it lets you define comodules and comonoids in SOME monoidal quasicategory, but it's not clear that this is equivalent to the canonically defined (up to contractible space of choices) opposite monoidal quasicategory. If anyone has some other idea for lifting comonoids and comodules, I'd be very interested to know about it. 

The spectrum $T(n)$ which is the telescope of a finite spectrum of type n along its self-map, has a unique Bousfield class $\langle T(n)\rangle$ which only depends on $n$. It is also known, from Ravenel's paper "Localization with respect to certain periodic homology theories" that $\langle S\rangle=\langle T(0)\rangle\vee\langle T(1)\rangle\vee\ldots\vee\langle T(n-1)\rangle\vee\langle F(n)\rangle$ where $F(n)$ is a finite spectrum of type n. Is it known whether or not $\langle S\rangle=\bigvee_n\langle T(n)\rangle$? In the same vein, is it known whether or not $\bigvee_n\langle K(n)\rangle=\langle S\rangle$? 

It is an old theorem of Heaton's (based on work of Eilenberg and MacLane), that a polynomial 3-cocycle $f(x,y,z)$ which is "symmetric," in the sense that $f(x,y,z)-f(x,z,y)+f(z,x,y)=0$, is always a coboundary. Does anyone know of a similar theorem for polynomial 4-cocycles? The proof of the theorem for 3-cocycles doesn't seem to be written down in one clear piece anywhere, so I've had a tough time just generalizing it, thus a good reference for a modern treatment of even that case would be much appreciated as well. 

In homotopy theory there are lots of nice constructions that seem designed to have some effect on the homotopy of a space, i.e. completing, localizing, and taking various homotopy (co)limits. It seems like some of these (for instance Quillen's + construction) have moderately visual interpretations by attaching cells and things like that. In general, does anyone out there have interest in constructing such things geometrically, i.e. drawing a picture of what a sphere looks like after you, I don't know, complete it at a prime, or something like that? Are there sensible ways to visually represent mod p Moore spaces? Do such constructions usually cause things to have to leap into higher, non-visual, dimensions or something? Or is it simply that this kind of thing doesn't really serve any purpose, and we can just prove that it works and that it exists? In general it also seems very interesting to me to know what a sphere localized at a given homology theory might look like. 

For a spectrum $X$, Bousfield constructs a spectrum (which is only well-defined up to Bousfield equivalence) $aX$, which he shows satisfies some nice properties, like $\langle a^2X\rangle=\langle X\rangle$, and converts arbitrary joins to meets and arbitrary meets to joins. If we restrict ourselves to Bousfield idempotent spectra ($\mathbf{DL}$), or even the sensibly named "complemented" spectra ($\mathbf{BA}$), these properties get even better. For nice spectra, like $K(n)$, $BP$, Thom spectra, finite telescopes, etc., have explicit models of these spectra been thought about or are they of any interest? It seems, though I have not yet read Bousfield's original work on it, that $aX$ is a choice of generator for the class of $X$-acyclics. I am curious to know, though it may not be of any practical use, what the homotopy of $aK(n)$ might look like. We know that $K(n)$ is complemented, so we must have $\langle aK(n)\vee K(n)\rangle=\langle S\rangle$, so clearly $\langle aK(n)\rangle\>\langle\bigvee_{m\neq n}K(n)\rangle$. I guess however that it's actually quite clear what $aT(n)$ (the finite telescope) should be. 

I mentioned that I proved this in the comment above but am "answering" just for closure. A link to the proof is here: $URL$ 

Given a split Hopf algebroid $(S,\Sigma)=(S,S\otimes B)$ over $K$, Ravenel leaves as an exercise the proof of the following: An ideal $J\subset S$ is invariant under the action of the group $\mathrm{Hom}(B,K)$ if and only if $\eta_R(J)\subset J\Sigma$, where $\eta_R$ is the right unit. Is it clear where the group action of $\mathrm{Hom}(B,K)$ on $S$ or $J$ comes from? Obviously, by the fact that the algebroid is split, there is an action of $\mathrm{Hom}(B,K)$ on $\mathrm{Hom}(S,K)$.
