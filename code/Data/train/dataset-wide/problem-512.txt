With 500 rooms (yikes!) meaning perhaps 1000 people, and an average stay of maybe one week, you could swap out 1000 per week. Let's assume the shuttle to the station can fit 25 people. That's 40 flights a week (about 6 per day). Assuming that the pilots only make one trip a day (i.e. a two-day round trip), that means they can make 3.5 flights per week. So you need 11 crews, at least, plus a backup one or two - 77 total people. 6 shuttles in the station mean you need five technicians in each bay, so perhaps 30 total. Let's do the addition: $$77 + 10 + 30 + 25 + 25 + 200 = 367$$ So you'd need 367 people. 

2Were we to assume vanishing pressure, as in a true dust solution, things could get simpler (and, perhaps, more interesting). For now, though, we'll treat it as a perfect fluid, and treat it as homogenous. 

An idea for a story I’m working on involves a far away world that was once inhospitable. Scientists - likely alien ones - terraformed it so it could support life (coincidentally, Earth-like life). They then introduced new species to the world, species that had been genetically engineered to have certain minor modifications. In short, they built a habitable world from a desolate planet and populated it with new plants and animals. The researchers decided to do one thing, though, which was to mess with the single, planet-wide food web. Instead of the web being built up from plants to herbivores to carnivores to more carnivores in the normal ecological pyramid, they made all the animals omnivores, designed to eat both the plants and most other species - disregarding cases where one animal could not physically eat another animal, such as a frog eating a giraffe. In short, the food web is now a food loop. Any animal can eat either plants or animals of another species. Can this ecosystem sustain itself? I know that in a normal food web, there are fewer predators than prey, but that equilibrium seems to be broken here, because all animals are predators and all animals are prey. I would guess that eventually eating habits would change to reach an equilibrium state where some species are higher up on the chain than others, but I don’t know for sure. Essentially, can every animal eat most other animals? Or are the scientists in trouble? 

Mathematics Let’s have a set $C$ of three cities, $(c_1(x_1,y_1),c_2(x_2,y_2),c_3(x_3,y_3))$. We choose to find the segments connecting $c_1$ and $c_2$ ($\bar{s_{12}}$) and $c_2$ and $c_3$ ($\bar{s_{13}}$). Given that the $\bar{s_{ij}}$ is the set of points equidistant to both $c_i$ and $c_j$, we can set $$\sqrt{(x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2}=\sqrt{(x-x_j)^2+(y-y_j)^2}\tag{1}$$ Simplifying eventually yields the equation $$y=\frac{x_j-x_i}{y_i-y_j}x+\frac{x_i^2+y_i^2-x_j^2-y_j^2}{2(y_i-y_j)}\tag{2}$$ Clearly, this blows up if $y_i=y_j$, but if that’s the case, then the border simply has the equation $$x=\frac{1}{2}(x_j-x_i)$$ which is simple enough. We do the above for all three sets of points. To find the vertex, we simply find the point where all three lines intersect, which is simple, as we can do it for any two of the lines. Code I wrote a program to do this in Python 3. To simplify things a bit, I’ve assumed that no two cities have the same $y$-coordinate, as that produces a line with infinite slope in $\text{(2)}$. If, for some reason, your setup includes a case like that, simply rotate the coordinate system a little so that all three points have different $y$-coordinates. Here’s an example, with $c_1=(2,1)$, $c_2=(9,5)$ and $c_3=(4,7)$: 

I'll go with a sad yes here. It does depend on how far away from each of the stars the planet is, but I think that, given how large the stars are, that the output of radiation will be pretty huge. The Sun has a luminosity of 3.826 $\times$ 1024 Watts. Adding together the probable luminosities of these three stars, we get 518 solar luminosities (a red giant, e.g. Aldebaran) + 1 solar luminosity (a Sun-like star) + 91,000 solar luminosities (a blue star, e.g. Zeta Ophiuchi) $=$ 91,519 solar luminosities. That's pretty bright. It also means a lot of UV radiation, meaning that unless there's a thick ozone layer on the planet, these people are going to be pretty unhappy. 

Try thermosynthesis. Thermosynthesis is a hypothetical mechanism, usually applied to the RNA world theory for the rise of life on Earth. In a nutshell, it states that an organism could function as a heat engine, where thermal energy is gained from a heat reservoir - in this case, a volcano. Thermosynthesis allows you to synthesize molecules via anabolic pathways; it's not too far a conceptual leap to imagine that this organism could store chemical energy through thermosynthesis in the form of sugars, and from there, use a mechanism similar to respiration to unlock the energy from those sugars. More specific details can be found in an answer by Dubukay. Would it be evolutionary feasible? Well, that's another question entirely. From an evolutionary perspective, it would be unlikely that thermosynthesis would be selected as an animal's method of energy generation, because a primarily thermosynthetic organism would need to stay close to the source of heat. Thus, it doesn't make sense for the creature to be mobile. So you'd probably see something less complicated - like, say, a fungus - evolve first. Perhaps an animal of sorts would arise to use thermosynthesis, but only on a world where most other forms of energy generation are impractical or impossible. It has been suggested that thermosynthesis could be handy on a world that's cold, where the creature would take advantage of the temperature difference between the atmosphere and frozen ground. This is sort of the reverse scenario; the ground is hot and the air is comparatively cold. I think thermosynthesis is the closest you can get to what you're looking for. The odds are against such a creature, but it's not impossible at all. 

Yes. You can calculate it. Set the gravitational force equal to the centripetal force: $$F_g=F_c$$ $$G \frac{Mm}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$ $$v^2=\frac{GM}{r}$$ $$v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$ That's the velocity in meters per second. You can then find the period (in seconds) by $$T=\frac{2 \pi r}{v}$$ Use SI units for everything. 

In short, the conditions in most parts of the envelope are non-relativistic and are similar to those inside a large star. Polytropic models for stars are quite well represented using $n=3$. A polytrope is an object that obeys the equation of state $$P=K\rho^{(n+1)/n}\tag{1}$$ where $P$ and $\rho$ are density and pressure, $K$ is a constant, and $n$ is the polytropic index. The quasi-star can be assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, meaning that pressure (dominated by radiation flowing outward) balances the force of gravity: $$\frac{dP}{dr}=\frac{\rho GM}{r^2}$$ where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass contained within $r$, and $r$ is the radial coordinate. By inserting the polytropic equation of state in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, we eventually arrive at the Lane-Emden equation: $$\frac{1}{\xi^2}\frac{d}{d\xi}\left(\xi^2\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}\right)=-\theta^n\tag{2}$$ where $\theta$ is a specific function relating to the main thermodynamic variables (density, pressure, and temperature) and $\xi$ is a dimensionless radius. Analytical solutions only exist for three values of $n$: $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=5$. Unfortunately, the case we’re interested in is for $n=3$, applicable to most main sequence stars as well as quasi-star envelopes. Therefore, we have to use numerical methods. We can make the Lane-Emden equation easier to solve by casting it in the form of a pair of coupled differential equations: $$\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}=\phi,\quad\frac{d\phi}{d\xi}=-\theta^n-\frac{2}{\xi}\phi\tag{3}$$ The normal practice is to solve these via a Runge-Kutta method, typically of fourth order (denoted RK4). In general, RK4 is superior to most lower-order methods. However, for some cases, it’s not necessary. I’ve found that for small enough step sizes for each method, the Euler method works nearly as well, and is simpler to write - and computationally a bit cheaper. I’ll end up using it here. To hopefully convince you of this, I’ve implemented both methods in Python for an $n=3$ polytrope. I used a step size of $h=\Delta\xi=10^{-4}$, and I got excellent results: 

Apparently, this was investigated by NASA in the early 2000s in what became known as The Caves of Mars Project. Its goal was to find possible places for humans to live over extended periods of time, safe from the weather and radiation. Boston et al. (2004) wrote a summary of the results: 

PhilFrost brought up an interesting point - going to a Near-Earth asteroid. There are a bunch of issues with that: 

The material alone would be a treasure trove in itself, but another part that stands out is Newton's style of writing. I haven't read a whole lot of the Principia, but I know that the way Newton presents concepts is fantastic. He emphasizes how he applies the scientific method - which is necessary if we need to train new generations of scientists - and starts from basic principles. This book doesn't just teach classical mechanics; it teaches you how to do science. That is priceless. 2. Classical Electrodynamics, by John David Jackson This one has been used for over 50 years as a graduate text on electrodynamics. It's a bit tricky to get through, yes, but it works. Jackson expects some familiarity with the concepts already, but that's fine. Physics is full of conclusions that are not intuitive or easy to see. These scientists, through these books, have lights to guide them along the way. Things will be much simpler for them than they were for, say, Gauss or Faraday or Maxwell. The exercises from the book that I've seen are good - tough, but good. As with the rest of the text, the author expects you to work. It's not meant to be easy. Having exercises - which are, of course, absent from the Principia - will train the readers to get ready for the third book. Introduction to Electrodynamics by D. W. Griffiths comes in a close second here. For undergraduates, it's top by a mile. It's clear and concise. But I do want the book to be a bit challenging, and I do want it to go into detail. So I'll choose Jackson over Griffiths because of how detailed it is. 3. Gravitation, by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler This book is, I belief, considered one of the best tracts on gneeral relativity. It may be intimidating, but if you're looking for a sort of bible on modern physics, this might be one your best bets. I've picked this book because, like the Principia, it has value far beyond the mere information it contains. Gravitation is an inspiration, a reason for scientists to explore beyond the realms of immediate practicality and applicability. They need something to look to that will tell them to go for knowledge for knowledge's sake; it well nourish their curiosity. Yes, it will take them a long time to understand it, but Gravitation isn't too inaccessible, once you get past its length. The book is old - going on four decades now - but a newer edition could be more helpful. Recent experimental developments in general relativity - for instance, gravitational waves - would not be included, obviously, but they might be unnecessary. The essence here is that one of the two pillars of modern physics - general relativity - is encapulsated quite well in a single tome.
