As explained by Marty, the above should apply more generally to simply connected Chevalley groups. Let $\Phi$ be a reduced irreducible root system, $R$ be a commutative ring, and let $G = G(\Phi, R)$ be the simply connected Chevalley group of type $\Phi$ over $R$. Let $E(\Phi, R)$ be the elementary subgroup of $G$.

For small radii r, perhaps r less than 1/5, something like the following should work. I use symmetry to restrict my attention to circles in the first quadrant. Use a checkerboard coloring and color the origin and circles with coordinates of like parity the same color, e.g silver. It should be clear that any silver circle with coordinate (0,n) or (1,n) is reachable by using n-1 reflections, and that at least 120 degrees of arc on that circle is reachable. Now one can cover larger x coordinates by reflecting the ray off (0,n) and going up. Although the ray does not emanate from the center of (0,n), it should be clear that there is enough of the or spectrum of angles to choose from that one can use an additional reflection to hit, say, (2,n) after leaving (0,n). This should generalize to an arbitrary silver circle, and each such has at least 120 degrees of arc as an available target. Once all the silver circles are shown to be reachable, construct a path to an arbitrary circle (m,n) by traversing to (0,n) or (0,n+1), which ever is silver, go up to a silver circle past but near (m,n), and reflect off a silver circle to the desired target.

First some indication that it really is a difficult problem: Both Vistoli and Gillet in their classics on intersection theory on stacks remark that their should be a Riemann-Roch theorem for proper representable morphisms, but that they are not able to prove it. I think thats more than enough evidence. The two existing proofs by Toen and Joshua both involve using not the naive Chow ring, but a modified version. This makes both proofs quite heavy on K-Theory, and I don't really get them. So what makes the proof using the naive Chow-Ring so difficult? If I remember correctly from reading Fulton-Langs "Riemann-Roch Algebra", the basic technique is to factor a morphism as a regular imedding followed by a projection. The cases of a regular imbeddings and projections are treated by a hands-on methods. Here are some reasons I can think of why this might not work for stacks: 

The following seems to be implied by most of the direct comments to OP's question, but I prefer to voice it, loud and clear: 

[1] "Elementary divisors and modules", I. Kaplansky, 1949 [2] "On the structure of the $GL_2$ of a ring", P. M. Cohn, 1966. [3] "On the structure of principal ideal rings", T. W. Hungerford, 1968. [4] "Serre's problem on projective modules", T. Y. Lam, 2006. 

In [1], the class $\mathcal{MN}$ is identified with the class of groups with zero recalcitrance (the recalcitrance of a finitely generated group, if finite, is an integer that measures how well the group complies to the generalized Andrews-Curtis conjecture). So, the class of $r$-recalcitrance groups with $r > 0$ naturally generalizes $\mathcal{MN}$. 

There's a problem with identifying the Chow-Ring of a stack with the K-Group equipped with the gamma-filtration. 

Its only a reference, and I don't feel competent to give a summary. I think the answer to question 1 can be found in $URL$ . At least it mentions the analogy to the Duflo isomorphism, which is similiar to what you are asking about. It also takes a map of vector spaces, does some magic and it ends up being a map of algebras. 

Here's a simple geometric example for a homotopy pushout. This is stolen from the Dwyer-Spalinski paper on model categories. We first look at the following diagram: pt <-- S^1 --> pt. The pushout of this diamgram is just a point. Now look at D^2 <-- S^1 --> D^2 where the maps are the inclusion at the boundary. The pushout of this diagram is S^2. What one notices is that the point and D^2 have the same homotopy type, but the pushout of the two diagrams have different homotopy types! So ordinary pushouts don't go well with homotopy theory. The right thing to do is to always replace the maps by cofibrations before computing pushouts. This is precisely what the homotopy pushout does. Replacing maps by cofibrations before computing pushouts is not just philosophy but actually a theorem. If you want to do things correctly you should put a model category strutcure on the diagram category such that the constant functor preserves fibrations and trivial fibrations and then take the derived colimit functor. Since you have a model category structure on the diagram category you replace diagrams cofibrantly! If you work out all the details you get replacing a diagram means exactly to replace the maps by cofibrations before taking the pushout. 

For $0 \leq k \lt 2^j$ , let $\sigma(k+2^j)=(2k+1)/2^{j+1}$ . Let A be a subset of integers such that $\sigma\mid_A$ is monotonic. Then $a_{n+1} - a_n$ is greater than $a_n/4$ infinitely often, which cannot hold if $a_n$ is $O(n^d)$ for any positive integer $d$. Gerhard "Can't Make It Much Simpler" Paseman, 2013.04.22 

To clarify Aaron's observations: since the original post asked for something to be true in every interval (of consecutive integers) of length P_n, the residue classes are indeed a red herring. The Chinese Remainder Theorem says that there will be a number common to all those residue classes, and therefore the problem will look the same whether the classes are nonzero residues or not, since we are dealing with finitely many primes. This now turns into a problem of Jacobsthal's function on numbers of the form (P_N/P_n), where P_N is the product of all primes less than P_n, which in turn is the product of all primes less than n. Jacobsthal's function asks for the length j(m) of the smallest interval of integers which guarantees at least one integer coprime to m, i.e. lies outside the desired residue classes. Aaron is right when he requests that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes involved should be greater than 1. My computation suggests this starts to happen when n=5, p_n= 11, P_n = 2310, and there are roughly 340 (+ or - 20) primes involved in the product (P_N/P_n). I am trying to refine estimates to decide if j(P_N/P_n) is less than or equal to or greater than 2310. My instinct tells me greater, and that this will hold true for n> 4. I will update this later with the computations. In the meantime, you can try to use the upper bound estimates in the recent answer I posted to my Westzynthius question on MathOverflow.

In the symplectic topology view on Gromov-Witten-Invariants some authors use what they call a Kuranishi structure on the moduli of stable maps. These were introduced by Fukaya and Ono and are also used in their big book on Fukaya categories.They are also used a lot in recent papers by Joyce. The key feature of the Kuranishi structure is that there locally exists a homeomorphism or a diffeomorphism, depending on whether you follow Fukaya or Joyce, to a zero set of a section of the "obstruction bundle". On the algebraic geometry side there also is something involving the term obstruction, namely the perfect obstruction theory on the moduli space of maps. This is a morphism [E-1 -> E0] -> LX, where L is the cotangent complex. Here's my question: To what does the obstruction bundle on the symplectic topology side correspond on the algebraic side? There are three candidates I can think of: 

If $\mathbb{Z}1_R \simeq \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ for some $n > 1$, then the condition $\text{gdc}(k, n) = \text{gdc}(k^2, n)$, or equivalently $\text{gcd}(k, \frac{n}{\text{gcd}(n, k)}) = 1$, implies $kR = k^2R$. This is certainly a necessary condition when $R = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$. YCor outlined the fact that every module over $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$ is projective. He further extends this remark by mentioning below that every module over a commutative ring $R$ with identity is projective if and only if $R$ is the direct product of finitely many fields, see this MO post for references and a more general statement. 

If X is an algebraic scheme, K_0(X) has a filtration by taking the subgroups generated by coherent sheaves whose support as at most dimension k. The associated graded groups are the quotients, and there exists a natural map from the k-th Chow group A_k(X) to the k-th graded part Gr_k K_0(X), just by mapping [V] to [O_V]. This is example 15.1.5 in Fulton's book. This even becomes an isomorphism after tensoring with Q! That's Corollary 18.3.2 in Fulton's book. All of the definitions surely make sense for DM-stacks. We've got Chow-groups and K_0 can be graded in the same way. I'm not sure whether the natural map above actually passes to rational equivalence, but I'll just assume this to be true. Here's the question: Is the map still an isomorphism? 

Humbled by Dietrich Burde's example, here is my motivation for saying that there won't be many such. Consider $\sigma(n)/n$. This is bounded above by a number I will call $P(n)$ and define as $P(n) = \prod_{0 \lt i \leq \omega(n)} \frac{p_i}{p_i - 1}$, which involves the smallest primes $p_i$. Note that when $\omega(n) \gt 4, P(n) \lt \omega(n).$ So any hope of the first equation having a solution implies that $n$ has at most 4 distinct prime factors. The case when $\omega(n)=2$ nicely captures the even perfect numbers, so let us move on to $\omega(n)=4$. Using the finer inequality $\sigma(n)/n \lt \prod_{p |n, p \text{ prime}}\frac{p}{p-1}$ gives $n = 2^a3^b5^cp^d$ for some prime p and positive integers $a,b,c$ and $d$, and further $15p/4(p-1) \gt 4$, so $p \lt 16$. Now that we have a limit on p, we can use Zsigmondy's theorem and multiplicativity of $\sigma(p^k) = \frac{p^{k+1} - 1}{p - 1}$ to limit the exponents $a,b,c$ and $d$ to at most $6$. So there will be at most finitely many cases to check. More on the finitely many cases later. For $\omega(n)=3$, a similar analysis implies $n=2^a3^bp^c$, although there seem to be more primes $p$ to check. However, appealing to Zsigmondy again gives bounds on the exponents, and again there will be finitely many cases. Having exhausted myself before the exhaustive search, I will report back later with additional findings. EDIT 2013.05.16 So I was right, but in a somewhat surprising fashion. There are finitely many cases to check, it can be done by hand, Zsigmondy's theorem can help, and there are examples, two for $\omega(n)=3,$ and one for $\omega(n)=4$. In the 4 case, as noted above $p$ is one of $7, 11,$ or $13$, and then one computes $\sigma(p^d)$ and notes those whose prime factors fall in the set of primes at most 5. Zsigmondy's theorem says we can restrict our attention to $d \lt 5$. This leaves $p^d$ being one of $7, 11,$ or $343$. Then one computes $\sigma(q^k)$ for $q=2,3,5$ to ensure its prime power factors do not lie outside of $2^x,3^y,5^z,$ or one of the three choices for $p^d$. Zsigmondy tells us we can stop bumping up $k$ once we've seen all the small primes as factors for each $q$, which is at most 9 when $q=2$, and smaller for the other choices of $q$. After doing this, we rule out 11 as a candidate for $p^d$, and find that $3^b=3^3$ and $5^c=5^1$, leaving $2^a$ to determine. Since $p=7$, this leads quickly to $a=5$ and $d=1$, so $30240$ is the unique example with 4 distinct prime factors. In the 3 case, Zsigmondy tells us that if $\sigma(2^a3^bp^c) =2^a3^bp^c3 $ for some prime p, then $c$ is at most 2. This is because $\sigma(p^c)$ will be divisible by some prime larger than $3$ when $p$ is a prime larger than 3 and $c$ is larger than 2. But $\sigma(p^2)= p^2+p+1$ is odd and congruent to 3 mod 9, and cannot be of the form $2^x3^y$ for large enough $x$ and $y$. So as a result, $c=1$, and we now must have $\sigma(2^a)$ being a power of 3 or $\sigma(3^b)$ being a power of 2, each of which relates to a simple case of the Catalan conjecture (or use Zsigmondy yet again to bound either $a$ or $b$). It develops that $b=1$ and then $p \lt 9$ and one quickly finds the examples 120 and 672. END EDIT 2013.05.16 Gerhard "Off To Find More Coffee" Paseman, 2013.05.14 

I'm absolutely new to this stuff I'm asking about, so I hope this is not nonsense. If X is a smooth scheme over a perfect field k, I can study its motivic cohomology in the sense of Voevodsky and Morel. More precisely, to $\mathbb{Z}$ there is associated an Eilenberg-MacLane T-Spectrum. I'll write $H^{p,q}(X,\mathbb{Z})$ for the motivic cohomology of $X$ defined by Hom into this Spectrum. One fact for smooth $X$ now is that $$ H^{2p,p}(X,\mathbb{Z}) = CH^p(X). $$ Now I've got two questions: 1) Can I feed something singular into this Voevodsky-Morel machine? 2)If the answer to 1 is yes, are there some maps from $ H^{2p,p}(X,\mathbb{Z})$ to $CH^p(X)$? Maybe defined by some spectral sequence? I'm really interested just in some maps, no isomorphisms.
