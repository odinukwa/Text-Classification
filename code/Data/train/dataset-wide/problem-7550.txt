If I understand the setup of the question correctly, the answer is yes. Using non separated schemes makes no difference. This is explained here. In brief, whether you do the Grothendieck ring of "integral, finite type, separated" or "finite type" or even "finite type algebraic spaces" it's the same. When you pass to stacks it's a whole other mess of course. 

I hope this is well known, I just could not work it out myself. Say I have a variety X (smooth and projective over C is my usual setup) with a smooth subvariety Z. Let f: BL_Z(X) --> X be the blowup of X with centre Z and let E be the exceptional. 

This is somewhat sad, but I think (part of) what we've learned from the whole triangulated-vs-dg story is the following pseudo-statement: the bare category of functors Fun(D(X),D(Y)) is the wrong thing to take -- it should be replaced the category D(X x Y). There is a nice example, due to the usual Bondal-Orlov-Bridgeland people (Example 6.5 in Caldararu's notes), which illustrates this perfectly. Thus, if you find something weird happening in Fun(D(X),D(Y)) you shouldn't be discouraged -- it's not your fault. Of course, there are big names in the field (Canonaco and Stellari to name two) who might disagree with my initial pseudo-statement. It really depends on what you care about. 

Think of $SU(n)$ as the space of orthonormed bases in $C^n$ with the additional property of the determinant being equal to $1$ out of all the unit length complex numbers. Then fixing one of the vectors restricts the others to the orthogonal hyperplane and the additional requirement remains intact for some parametrization of said hyperplane. In the coordinate system defined by such a base, all the others with the same first vector differ only by a matrix of the form $1 \oplus A$ with some $A \in SU(n-1)$. It does sound too much like a homework question to me though. 

The expected connectivity cannot be higher than the expected minimal degree, which jumps to roughly $pn$ after getting into the range $p>>\frac{\log n}{n}$. On the other hand, sloppily counting potential clusters of size $m < n/2$ that have boundaries of less than $k$ vertices gives a probability of $\binom{n}{m}\binom{n-m}{k}(1-p)^{m(n-m-k)}$, which is for $k < < n$ decreasing in $m$ up to $m\approx \frac{n-k}{2}$ and increasing after that value, so we can get an estimate by considering only $m=1$ (checking for vertices with at most $k$ neighbours) and $m=\frac{n}{2}$: $$ \binom{n}{n/2}\binom{n/2}{k}(1-p)^{n(n-2k)/4} < exp(n \log 2+k \log n - pn(n-2k)/4) < $$ $$ < exp(n \log 2 - pn(\frac{n}{4}-\frac{k}{2}-\log n)) < exp(-\frac{n \log n}{4} + n \log 2 +2(\log n)^2), $$ this latter number tending to $0$ fast enough to ignore it. So, the expected connectivity is the expected minimal degree and is roughly $pn$ once $p$ exceeds $\log n/n$. Do you need the behaviour of expected connectivity specifically in this region? 

Maybe Asher Auel's thesis? But maybe it's still schemes, not sure! (but that thesis is still awesome) $URL$ 

X and Y are proper and irreducible. As a double cover does not crush X to a point, it must be surjective. The fibres are then finite sets which implies that it is a finite morphism. Finite morphisms are affine. Affine morphisms do not have higher direct image (this is just the relative version of the theorem which says that affine schemes do not have higher cohomology with coefficients in quasi-coherent sheaves). 

I cannot seem to find stated the following fact, which is surely well known to experts. Let (S,L) be a polarized K3 surface. Then $M = L^{\otimes 3}$ is very ample and we can consider the embedding in the corresponding projective space $S \to P^N$. Question: is the image of $S$ in $P^N$ a complete intersection? I suspect the answer is no but I haven't seen it stated explicitly. (by the way, I am certainly allowing $S = H_1 \cap ... \cap H_k \cap D_1 \cap D_2$, where the $H_i$ are hyperplanes and $D_1, D_2$ or more interesting divisors. (information about other embeddings of S which are complete intersections, or statements about when one can know if S is a complete interesction would be highly appreciated as well) 

The easy way of comparing those is to check that they both satisfy the axioms and then use the unicity of the characteristic classes. The splitting lemma (every vector bundle can be pulled back from a sum of line bundles with a map that induces an injective map in cohomology) makes unicity trivial. As to the second question, vector bundles' total spaces are homotopically equivalent to their bases. Maybe you meant Thom spaces? In this latter case, you get $G_{n-1}$ from $\gamma_n$, and this is one of the ways to calculate the cohomology ring of $G_n$. 

I'll assume you're talking about principal G-bundles. These are classified by maps into $BG$, the base of the universal $G$-bundle, so if we have bundles classified by $f:E \to BG$ and $g:F \to BG$, you are looking for a bordism between $f$ and $g$ - whether there exists a $h : W \to BG$ connecting these classifying maps. So there is a bundle cobordism between the two bundles iff the bordism classes of $f$ and $g$ in $\mathfrak{N}n(BG)$ coincide, and if they do coincide, then the choice of $W$ is parametrized by the bordism group $\mathfrak{N}_{n+1}(BG)$. I don't know an algorithmic way to obtain the class $[f]$ from $E$, but there is a splitting $\mathfrak{N}_n(BG) = \oplus H_j(BG) \otimes \mathfrak{N}_{n-j}$ which can help identify some bundles' classes. 

The question might be a bit vague. Certainly there are excellent references online on stability conditions. The first which comes to mind is the most elementary and is by Arend Bayer. If you are already familiar with all of that, these notes by Daniel Huybrechts go deeper into the subject. These are notes from a lecture series delivered in Cambridge, which was recorded on video. Also, I find the original paper by Bridgeland quite readable. 

presumably the reason there is an equality in 3.25 instead of an isomorphism is that you don't want $V_K$ to be abstractly isomorphic to $W$, but you want them to be equivalent subschemes of $X_K$ (ie isomorphic in the category of pairs (scheme, embedding)). At least that's how I would interpret it, but I might be wrong. Also, take $X = P^N$. Saying that $W \subset X_K$ is defined over $k$ means precisely that you can find equations cutting out $X_K$ with coefficients in at most $k$. 

I'm looking for a reference for the following fact (which I believe to be true and should be easy for people who understand how spectral sequences arise from filtrations). 

Another way to look at the "official" solution is to notice that for statistical purposes it does not matter which couple gets the next child. You "request" children from the couples in whatever manner you want, you always get a 1:1 expected ratio in boys and girls, regardless of the pattern in which you choose the next couple to produce another child. 

$E \oplus det E$ is orientable (its structure group $O(n)$ is represented in $SO(n+1)$), so its $w_1$ vanishes; and $w_1(E \oplus det E) = w_1(E) + w_1(det E)$. 

Reportedly R. Norwood, G. Poole, M. Laidacker: The Worm Problem of Leo Moser, Discrete & Computational Geometry 7 (1992), 153-162. has an example of area $\sqrt{3}/12+\pi/24$ (a 60 degree sector of a circle with two triangular "wings"), and this was the best known in 1999. 

If you have 2 standard Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^n$, their inner product is the sum of $n$ i.i.d. variables, with their common distribution fixed (and having finite moments), so you will get convergence to the appropriate Gaussian distribution in line with the central limit theorem, with exponential bounds coming from Hoeffding's inequality, say. Do you need tight bounds or asymptotics is enough? 

I don't know of a uniform way to prove it for all curves. For elliptic curves it follows from Hodge theory and for the rest it's a consequence of the Bondal-Orlov theorem. It's all explained in Huybrechts's excellent book on Fourier-Mukai transforms. 

I am trying to understand Remark 11.3 in Huybrechts's amazing book on derived categories (FM transforms in AG). He starts with smooth projective varieties $j\colon Y \subset X$ and aims to describe the local ext groups $\underline{Ext}^i(j_*O_Y,j_*O_Y)$ in terms of $\wedge^i N$ where $N$ is the normal bundle of $Y$ in $X$. To describe this, he mentions a morphism $\wedge^k \underline{Ext}^1(j_*O_Y,j_*O_Y) \to \underline{Ext}^k(j_* O_Y, j_* O_Y)$ which he calls cup product (or composition). 

Is there a structure theorem for such varieties? If X is a smooth and proper/projective variety whose canonical bundle $\omega_X$ has finite order in the Picard group, do we know anything about X? EDIT: As was pointed out in the comments, if $\omega_X^n = O_X$ then one can find a cycling covering of order n, $Y \to X$, with $\omega_Y = O_Y$. So the problem reduces to understanding varieties with trivial canonical bundle. I'll leave the question as is for a few days more, in case someone else wants to contribute. If nothing happens I will delete it.
