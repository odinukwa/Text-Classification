Some of the mathematical advances that influenced people's life in XX century are: Fast Fourier Transform (applications to signal processing, in particular, image processing. Without it modern computer revolution would be impossible). Radon transform (which makes computer tomography possible). Progress in probability theory (all insurance industry is based on it. And "financial math" as well. Trading in derivatives is a relatively recent innovation. Based on non-trivial math, stochastic differential equations). Progress in control theory (automatic control devices are literally everywhere). Remarkable progress in coding theory in the end of XX century. 

This can be expressed in terms of elementary functions, if $p/2$ is an integer. Suppose, for example that it is a positive integer. Then your sum is $$S:=\sum_{m=p/2+1}^\infty\frac{1}{m^2+c}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{|m|>p/2}\frac{1}{m^2+c},\quad c=q-p^2/4,$$ where summation in the last sum is over positive and negative integers. The sum in the right hand side differs by finitely many summands from the sum $$\sum_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{1}{m^2+c},$$ which you know how to compute. The simplest way to do this, by the way, is by the residue theorem: integrate $$\frac{\pi\cot\pi z}{z^2+c}$$ over appropriate expanding contours. The answer will be slightly different, depending on whether $\sqrt{-c}$ is an integer or not. Thus you obtain a closed form answer in elementary functions. The case when $p/2$ is a negative integer it treated similarly, by first dropping finitely many terms of your sum, and then adding them back. If $p/2$ is not an integer, I afraid that you have to use Gamma function, as suggested in the comments, and there is no way around this. 

If the word "represents" in the question means "isomorphic to", one can take the hypergeometric equation: $w''+Qw=0$ with $$Q(z)=\frac{1}{4z^2}+\frac{1}{4(z-1)^2}-\frac{1}{4z(z-1)}.$$ See Hurwitz-Courant, Ch7, or (with much more detail) Caratheodory, vol. II. The ratio $f=w_1/w_2$ of two linearly independent solutions of this equation maps the upper half-plane onto a triangle with all angles $0$. One can normalize (choose particular solutions $w_1,w_2$) so that this triangle is inscribed in the unit disk. Then the well-known picture (see any course of complex variable) shows that $f$ is the inverse to the universal covering of $C\backslash\{0,1\}$ by the unit disk. Which implies that the monodromy group is the fundamental group of $C\backslash\{0,1\}$. EDIT. Written in the standard hypergometric form, the equation is $$z(z-1)y''+(1-2z)w'-w/4=0.$$ 

The answer depends on the class you consider. If $F^k=C^k$, the class of all functions with your properties, then $D(F^k)=C^{k-1}$, and $C^k$ is a proper subset of $D(F^k)$. If $F^k$ is the class of all polynomials, then $D(F^k)=F^k$. If $F^k$ is the class of polynomials of degree at most $d$, then $D(F^k)$ is a proper subset of $F^k$. 

Modules theory over the rings of principal ideals is the main tool of control theory. Linear control theory mainly deals with matrices whose entries are polynomials. Polynomials is the ring of principal ideals. Matrices over this ring require modules theory. This fact is usually hidden in the books of control theory written for engineers, because modules (unfortunately) are not a part of the standard engineering math curriculum. These textbooks (on my opinion) only obscure the matter. 

There is a calculus textbook which does this: Bamberg and Sternberg A course in mathematics for students in physics, vol. II, Chap. 22, "Thermodynamics". 

"Everything you read" has it wrong: this map is not necessarily injective. For example, there exists a Schwarz equation whose solution is a ratio of two solutions of a Gauss equation, and the solution is $z^{10}$, which is not injective in the upper half-plane. The "triangle" in question has angles $10\pi,\pi,10\pi$. It is indeed a "triangle" in some sense, and you can even make a paper model. But it does not fit into the plane. The correct result is the following. Suppose that you have an (honest) circular triangle in the plane. That is the sides are arcs of circles, and the angles are at most $2\pi$. Then (by the Riemann mapping theorem) there exists a conformal (injective) map of the upper half-plane onto this triangle. This map satisfies a Schwarz equation. All other solutions of this Schwarz equation also map the upper half-plane injectively onto triangles (obtained by a fractional-linear transformation of the original one). But not all Schwarz equations occur in this way. Parameters of the Schwarz equations have to satisfy certain (simple) conditions for the solution to be injective in the upper half-plane. There is one Complex Analysis textbook (in English) where this question is treated in great detail: C. Caratheodory, vol. II. For those who read German or Russian, also Hurwitz-Courant. 

There is no "justice" in the world of arbitrary metric spaces:-) Let your first space $M$ be the ordinary circle with its ordinary metric, and the second space $N$ be homeomorphic to a cylinder with two border circles. Let the metric be usual on the border circles, but very rough (bumpy) on the middle part of the cylinder. You can certainly make it so rough that intermediate curves between the border circles will simply have infinite length... And of course you can make this example compact. 

I agree with what Rodrigo says: you don't have to include a paper which you do not like in your CV. In general, people are usually evaluated by their best papers not by the worst. From my own experience, I can conclude that my own opinion about my papers does not always coincide with the public opinion. There were several papers I hesitated to publish, but they are more appreciated than some papers I am proud with. There were also results I did not publish, considering them too light-weight, and later had regrets. And finally "toxic subject" is on my opinion a nonsense. 

The answer is no. The reason is that a subharmonic function does not have to be continuous. For example, there is a subharmonic function $u$ in the unit disk, $u(0)=1$ and $u(z_k)=0$ for a sequence $z_k\to 0$. It is not difficult to make it proper. Now evidently there is no harmonic support function at $0$ because harmonic functions are continuous. To construct $u$ take $$v(z)=1+\sum a_k\log|1-z/z_k|,$$ where $z_k\to 0$ and $a_k>0$ are so small that the sum converges and $v(0)=1$. To make it positive, take $v_1=\max\{ v,0\}$. To make it proper take $u(z)=\max\{ u,\log|z|+M\},$ where $M$ is very large. EDIT. Requiring that $u$ is continuous or smooth will not help, as seen from the following argument. Let $u_n\geq u$ be a decreasing sequence of smooth subharmonic functions, $u_n(z)\to u(z)$ pointwise. Such a sequence can be constructed by taking convolutions of $u$ with smooth positive "hat" functions. Suppose that we have harmonic functions $v_n\leq u_n$ with $v_n(0)=u_n(0)$. As our $u_n$ are uniformly bounded from avove, $v_n$ are also uniformly bounded from above. So you can find a subsequence on which $v_n$ converge uniformly on compact subsets. Then the limit function $v$ will be harmonic, $v(0)=u(0)$ and $v\leq u$. Contradiction. EDIT 2. I don't know why you need this, but there is a theorem that can perhaps substitute: Consider functions of the form $\log|f|$ where $f$ is analytic. Then allow linear combinations with positive coefficients and taking pointwise $\max$, and limits of decreasing sequences. Then you obtain all subharmonic functions. This is due to Harnack. 

Do there exist Jordan analytic curves $J$ in the complex plane $C$, other than circles, with the following property: There exists a harmonic function $u$ in the unbounded component of $C\backslash J$, $u(z)=0$ and $|\mathrm{grad}\, u(z)|=1$ for $z\in J$. If we impose mild restrictions on $u$ near $\infty$, for example that $u$ is bounded from below or from above, then such things do not exist. 

You cannot recover them completely: if you simultaneously conjugate all matrices by some invertible matrix, the traces will not change. But up to this conjugacy, at lest for $SL(2)$ matrices, the traces determine the conjugacy class: MR0314993 Horowitz, Robert D. Characters of free groups represented in the two-dimensional special linear group. Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 25 (1972), 635–649, without the condition that they are Hermitean. 

One of the popular modern topics in discrete-time dynamics is Iterated Function Systems (IFS). They have a lot of applications both in mathematics and outside, including the image processing. The literature is enormous. Look under the keywords IFS, Fractals. 

In general, the function describing the boundary is only Lipschitz (and differentiable almost everywhere). For all these facts, you may consult a nice book Hormander, Notions of convexity, Chap II. On your other questions. Of course, there is no reason to consider Hausdorff measure of a convex set: it is ordinary Lebesgue measure in the linear span of this set. I guess the paper you mention considers Hausdorff measure on the BOUNDARY of a convex set. As I said in 1, it has integer dimension. But so what? It is not a smooth surface. What other measure you propose to consider on it? 

I do not know of any survey books of this sort (perhaps it is impossible to write because "engineering" is too large and diverse) but I have two outstanding mathematical problems arising from engineering (more precisely, control theory) on my web site: $URL$ Problems under the title "POLYNOMIAL MATRICES". 

Yes, it is monotonic for positive $x$. $N$ is irrelevant for monotonicity. Set $$P_i(x)=\sum_n\alpha_{i,n}x^n, \quad P=\prod_iP_i.$$ By assumption, these are polynomials with positive coefficients. For such polynomials $xP'(x)/P(x)$ is increasing. This is a simple consequence of the Hadamard Three circles Theorem. One only has to notice that $$M(r):=\max_{|z|\leq r}|P(z)|=P(r)$$ for polynomials with positive coefficients. Hadamard's theorem says that for every entire function $rM'(r)/M(r)$ is increasing; strictly increasing unless the function is a monomial. Now it remains to notice that $$\Gamma(x)=xP'(x)/P(x)=x\sum_i(\log P(x))'.$$ 

Your second series equals $$-(1/2)e^{x/4}\frac{d^2}{dz^2}θ_2(z,e^{−x})|_{z=0},$$ where $θ_2$ is the second theta function, see Whittaker, Watson, vol. 2, 21.11. Probably the other 3 series can be also expressed in terms of theta functions. 

The answer is known for all smooth surfaces: M. S. Berger, Riemannian structure of prescribed Gaussian curvature for compact 2-manifolds, J. Differential Geom. 5 (1971), 325-332. J. Kazdan and F. Warner, Curvature functions for compact 2-manifolds, Ann. of Math. 99 (1974), 14-47. (This deals with the case of torus). All these results were generalized by Troyanov, Prescribing curvature on compact surfaces with conical singularities. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 324 (1991), no. 2, 793–821, who deals with surfaces with singularities, and in another paper, with open surfaces. 

If this is true, I would like to know something about $\delta$ as a function of $\epsilon$. This is easy to prove when $n=2$ with $\delta\approx\epsilon$. It is also easy to prove for formal power series that if the Wronskian is small in "p-adic norm", then there is a linear combination that is small in "p-adic norm". I can also prove the converse statement for every $n$: if the functions are almost linearly dependent, then their Wronskian is small. EDIT. I would be glad to see any other statement meaning that "if the Wronskian is small, then there is a linear combination which is small". 

We begin with a lemma. Let $F$ be an increasing function tending to infty as $x\to\infty$. Then $F'(x)\leq F^2(x)$, for $x\not\in E$, where $E$ is a set of finite measure. Proof. Let $E$ be the set where $F'(x)\geq F^2(x)$. Then $$|E|\leq\int_{E\cap[1,\infty)}\frac{F'}{F^2}dx<\int_1^\infty\frac{F'}{F^2}dx<\infty,$$ by the change of the variable $y=F(x)$. Now your conditions imply that $g(x)\to\infty$; $g$ and $g'$ are increasing. Suppose first that $g'(x)\to\infty$. Your relation between $g$ and $f$ means that $g^{\prime\prime}=f$. Applying the lemma first to $g$, and then to $g'$, we obtain the result $\log f(x)=O(\log g(x))$. The case when $g'$ is bounded I leave as an exercise. 

Picard discusses differential equations with fixed singularities in the end of Chapter V (pp. 291-300). The special case of Painleve VI that he discovered is written in the end on p. 299. Example of a second order equation whose solutions have movable essential singularities is given on p. 291. He does not care to write the equation explicitly but only writes its solution. On the next page he gives a 3-d order equation, which he correctly credits to Jacobi; it has much worse, non-isolated movable singularities. It is not a big deal to construct an example with a movable essential singularity, anyone can construct such examples: $$(yy''-(y')^2)^2+4(y')^3y=0$$ has a family of solutions $\exp(1/(z-c))$ with essential singularities at $c$. Whole Chapter V in Picard discusses singularities of differential equations, but this is a difficult reading for a modern mathematician, and the main reason is not the French. Remarks. 1. Modern terminology is somewhat different from Picard's: in his example, the function is not single-valued, and in the modern times one usually applies the word "essential singularity" only to single-valued functions. (My example above is single-valued). 

Yes, there are such functions. Take a very narrow region $D$ containing the positive ray, with nice boundary and such that $D$ intersects every any horizontal other than the real line by a bounded interval. Let $g$ be a conformal map of $D'$ onto the right half-plane, where $D'\subset D$ is another similar region. Then with appropriate choice of $D$ and $D'$ $$f(z)=\int_{\partial D} \frac{e^{g(\zeta)}}{\zeta-z}d\zeta$$ will converge for $z$ outside $D$ and the function $f$ will be bounded outside $D$ and extend to an entire function (by a deformation of the contour). For the details, see for example MR2753600 or MR0545054. EDIT. The method is very flexible of course. Taking $D$ to be a half-strip and $g(z)=e^z$ one obtains a Mittag-Leffler functiuon. Replacing it by $f(z+4i)$ you obtain a function that is bounded on every line from the origin. But to obtain a function as you ask, a half-strip $D$ will not work, so the function is less elementary. 

EDIT. Push forward is $$\nu(w)|dw|=\sum_{z:f(z)=w}\mu(z)|dz|,$$ or $$\nu(w)=\sum_{z:f(z)=w}\frac{\mu(z)}{|f'(z)|}.$$ The density of the pull back $f^*\nu$ is $$\nu(f(z))|f'(z)|=\sum_{\zeta:f(\zeta)=f(z)}\frac{\mu(\zeta)}{|f'(\zeta)|}|f'(z)|.$$ Dropping all positive summands except one we obtain the required inequality $f^*\nu\geq\mu$. 

Derivative on polynomials can be characterized as a linear map which satisfies Leibniz rule, zero on constants and $1$ on the identity function. This extends it uniquely to rational functions. Now in any space where rational functions are dense, such an operator, if continuous, must be the derivative. 

This is an extended comment. What exactly you are trying to minimize? First version: given an algebraic curve with equation $F(x,y)=0$, and two points on this curve $M,N$, find the polynomials $p,q$ of degree at most $d$ such that $(p(0),q(0))=M$, $(p(1),q(1))=N$, and $$\max_{t\in[0,1]}|F(p(t),q(t))|$$ is minimal. Some condition about two points is necessary here, otherwise you will have a trivial constant solution $(p(t),q(t))=X$ where $X$ is any point on your curve. But of course you may consider various conditions at the ends. Second version. Given two functions $x(t),y(t)$ on $[0,1]$, to minimize $$\max_{t\in[0,1]}(|p(t)-x(t)|^2+|q(t)-y(t)|^2).$$ These are two completely different problems. The solution for the circle you refer to seems to be related to the first problem. If this is what you ask, there are several possible generalizations to higher dimension, using any norm. For example, if the curve is given by two polynomials $F$ and $G$ of three variables, you may want to minimize $\max\{|P(p,q,r)|,|Q(p,q,r)|\}$. But again some additional condition is necessary to avoid the trivial constant solution. EDIT. However, there are additional difficulties with the First formulation. An algebraic curve $F(x,y)=0$ may consist of several pieces, and if we really want to approximate it, one has an additional requirement that the two points $M,N$ are on one piece. Moreover, there can be several ways along the curve $F(x,y)$ from $M$ to $N$ (always more than one way!) and this is not reflected in the precise formulation. So it is possible to have $F(p(t),q(t))$ uniformly small on $[0,1]$ but the curve $(p(t),q(t))$ does not approximate $F(x,y)$ in any reasonable way: the curve $F(x,y)=0$ may have a loop between $M$ and $N$, while the curve $(p(t),q(t))$ cheat and skip this loop. All this shows that there is no meaningful precise statement of the problem yet. 

Speaking of compact orientable survaces, this is very simple, indeed: hyperelliptic curves in $CP^2$ given by equations $w^2=P_n(z)$, where $P$ is a rational function with $2n$ zeros and poles, all zeros and poles distinct. of degree $n$, are smooth embedded surfaces with Euler characteristic $4-2n$. EDIT. A gap in the previous argument was pointed in the comment of BS: only for genera of the form $g=(d-1)(d-2)/2$ a smooth curve exist in $P^2$, and hyperelliptic curves usually have singular points. But they can be embedded to other spaces. EDIT 2. Here is a way to construct a smooth compact orientable algebraic surface in $R^3$ of any genus. $(x,y,t)$ are the coordinates in $R^3$. $$t^2=(R^2-x^2-y^2)\prod_{j=1}^n((x-x_j)^2+(y-y_j)^2-r^2),$$ where $R$ is large and the discs $(x-x_j)^2+(y-y_j)^2<r^2$ are disjoint and contained in the disc of radius $R$ centered at the origin. 

Consider two operators $L_1w=-w''+U(x)w$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ and $L_2w=-w''+V(x)w$ with eigenvalues $\mu_k$. If $U\geq V$ then $\lambda_k\geq \mu_k$. To prove this consider the Rayleigh ratio: $$R_j(w)=\frac{\int \overline{w}L_jw}{\int |w|^2}.$$ The smallest eigenvalue is the minimum of the Rayleigh ratio. (Higher eigenvalues are obtained from a Maximin problem for the Rayleigh ratio, so they also increase when the potential increases). To prove that the eigenvalues tend to infinity when $\epsilon\to\infty$, compare with the operator $-w''+\epsilon|x|w$. Let $\lambda_0(\epsilon)$ be the smallest eigenvalue, and $w$ the corresponding eigenfunction: $$-w''+\epsilon|x|w=\lambda_0(\epsilon)w.$$ Set $t=\epsilon^{1/3}x,$ $w(x)=y(\epsilon^{1/3}x).$ Then $$-y''+|t|y=\lambda_0(\epsilon)\epsilon^{-2/3}y.$$ Therefore $\lambda_0(\epsilon)=\epsilon^{2/3}\lambda_0(1).$ This tends to $\infty$ when $\epsilon\to\infty$.
