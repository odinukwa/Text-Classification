I have a complicated 3rd-order ODE of the form $P(y, y', y'', y''') = 0$, where $P$ is a complicated polynomial (5th-order with 24 terms) and coefficients that are (unknown) functions of a parameter $\lambda$, say $$ P(z_0, z_1, z_2, z_3) = \sum c_{j_0 j_1 j_2 j_3}(\lambda) z_0^{j_0} z_1^{j_1} z_2^{j_2} z_3^{j_3}. $$ What I want to know is: Suppose that there exists a non-constant solution $y(x)$ that is independent of $\lambda$. What conditions does this force the coefficient functions $c_{j_0 j_1 j_2 j_3}(\lambda)$ to satisfy? (An easy analog would be something like: a 1st-order ODE of the form $$y' + c_0(\lambda) y = 0 $$ has nonconstant parameter-independent solutions if and only if $c_0(\lambda)$ is a constant function.) I'm sure that the specific conditions I'm looking for depend on the precise form of the ODE, which is pretty daunting in this case. I'm just wondering if there's a reasonable algorithm I could apply to find them. 

Here is a partial answer. The answer to the main question is negative given the continuum hypothesis (or more generally the non-existence of a real valued measurable cardinal less than or equal to $\mathfrak c$). An extension $\mu$ of $P$ to all sets with property $H$ (even without any invariance properties) gives rise to an atomless probability measure $\nu$ on all subsets of $2^\omega$, the existence of which was shown to contradict the CH by Banach and Kuratowski. Here's how we get $\nu$. Given any subset $A$ of $2^\omega$, let $A^* = (\{ 0 \} \times A) \cup (\{ 1 \}\times (2^\omega\backslash A))$. This has property $H$. Thus, $\{ 0 \} \times A = A^* \cap (\{ 0 \} \times 2^\omega)$ is $\mu$-measurable, and so we can define $\nu(A) = 2\mu(A \cap (\{ 0 \} \times 2^\omega))$, which will be a probability measure on $\mathcal P {2^\omega}$, and it will be atomless because $P$ is. (This uses Alex Kruckman's simple construction of sets satisfying $H$.) Given ZFC alone, one can give a negative answer to one of my follow-ups. Specifically, there is no extension of the product measure to all sets with property $H$ that is invariant under permutations of $\omega$, even if we just ask for finite additivity in the extension. For if $\mu$ is a finitely additive extension of $P$ to all sets with $H$, then $\nu$ (defined as above) will be a finitely additive probability measure on $\mathcal P {2^\omega}$ invariant under permutations. A contradiction follows from the fact that $F_2$ is a subgroup of $S_\omega$. More precisely: Let $\langle Q_n \rangle_{n\in\omega}$ be a partition of $\omega$ into countably infinite subsets. Let $\phi_n$ be a bijection of $\omega$ with $Q_n$, and let $X$ be the subset of $2^\omega$ consisting of functions $f:\omega\to \{0,1\}$ such that $f\circ \phi_n \ne f\circ \phi_m$ if $n\ne m$. Then $P(X)=1$ (the probability of a repeat in a countable sequence of uniform i.i.d. random variables is zero). Now for any permutation $\pi$ of $\omega$, let $\pi^*$ be the permutation such that $\pi^*(\phi_n(m))=\pi^*(\phi_{\pi(n)}(m))$ for all $n$ and $m$. Note that $\pi^*[X]=X$. The permutations of the form $\pi^*$ form a subgroup $G$ of $S_\omega$ isomorphic to the full group, and $G$ has no non-trivial fixed points on $X$. Since $S_\omega$ contains a free group of rank 2, there is no finitely additive $G$-invariant probability measure on $X$ (here we use AC), which contradicts the fact that $\nu$ is such a measure. I still don't know: Can one prove a negative answer to the main question in ZFC alone? Can one prove a negative answer to the main question with $\rho_n$-invariance in ZFC alone? 

"Without loss of generality" is a standard in the mathematical lexicon, and I am writing to ask if anyone knows where the expression was popularized. (The idea has been around since antiquity, I'm sure, but the expression itself might not be that old.) 

Written about mathematicians, by mathematicians, and certainly for mathematicians, the self-published "choose your own adventure," Mathematics Odyssey, certainly deserves mention. 

"The Geometry of Moduli Spaces of Sheaves" by Huybrechts and Lehn. Thankfully, it seems that an updated edition is in the works. 

The idea being to somehow use that$-E$ is nef on $E$. EDIT: the exceptional fibres of $\pi$ are one-dimensional and $R^{\bullet} \pi_*O_V = O_W$ EDIT 2: we may assume that the support of $F$ is one-dimensional 

Let X be a smooth projective variety over the complex numbers. Recall that a Cohen-Macaulay curve is a one-dimensional closed subscheme without embedded or isolated points (fat components are allowed). 

I think your conjecture is correct (assuming that "regular" means "smooth"), with one possible caveat that I'll mention below. Since curvature is independent of parametrization, without loss of generality you can assume that $$ \alpha(t) = (t, F(t)) $$ for some function $F$. Then $$ \alpha'(t) = (1, f(t)) $$ where $f(t) = F'(t)$, and your hypothesis says that $f(t_0) = 1$ and $f(t) \neq 1$ for $t \in ]t_0 - r, t_0[$. Here's the caveat: Suppose that the function $g(t) = f(t) - 1$ vanishes to finite order at $t_0$. Then we can write $$ f(t) = 1 + (t-t_0)^n h(t) $$ for some integer $n \geq 1$ and some smooth function $h$ with $h(t_0) \neq 0$. Then $$ \frac{\det(\alpha'(t), \alpha''(t))}{\|\alpha'(t)||^3} = \frac{f'(t)}{(1 - f(t)^2)^{3/2}} = \frac{O((t-t_0)^{n-1})}{O((t-t_0)^{3n/2})} = O((t-t_0)^{-n/2-1}) $$ as $t \to t_0$, so the limit is indeed infinite. I suspect that the result is still true even if $g(t)$ vanishes to infinite order at $t_0$; e.g., it works if $g(t) = e^{-1/(t-t_0)^2}$. But I'm not sure sure how to give a rigorous proof in that case. 

The answer is positive, given Choice. It turns out that whenever $G$ is an abelian group acting on a set $X$, then there is a $G$-invariant preorder $\le$ on $2^X$ such that if $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, then $A<B$. The proof uses the fact that $G$-invariant partial orders on $\Omega$ extend to $G$-invariant linear orders, provided that $G$ is abelian and no element of $G$ has a finite orbit of length greater than one. While $2^X$ in general won't satisfy the orbit condition, one can instead take $\Omega$ to be a quotient of $2^X$ by the relation $A\sim B$ iff there is a $g\in G$ and $n\in\mathbb N$ such that $gB=A$ and $g^nB=B$. A writeup is here. 

Sorry! It was rather easy, so perhaps it should be closed. The second question clearly gets a negative. Let $\mu$ be a finitely additive measure on $\mathbb Z^+$ that assigns zero to all finite subsets. Let $n=1$. Let $f(k)=1/k$. Then $\int_{\mathbb Z^+} fd\mu =0$, but $0$ is not in the convex hull of the range. The first question gets a positive. It's clear for $n=1$. Suppose $n>1$ and it's true for smaller dimensions. Let $e=\int_\Omega fd\mu$. Let $C$ be the convex hull of the range of $f$. If $e\notin C$, there is a hyperplane $H$ through $e$ such that $C$ lies to one side of it. Let $p$ be a normal of $H$ such that $p\cdot f(x) \le p\cdot e$ for all $x\in\Omega$. Then $\int_\Omega (p\cdot f) d\mu = p\cdot e$ but $p\cdot f(x) \le p\cdot e$ for all $x$, so $p\cdot f = p\cdot e$ almost everywhere. We can modify $f$ without changing its range so as to ensure $p\cdot f = p\cdot e$ everywhere. But then the range of $f$ lies in the $(n-1)$-dimensional hyperplane $H$, and so by the $(n-1)$-dimensional case we have $e$ in the convex hull of the range of $f$. 

(Apologies if this question is too basic!) I have explicit 5-dimensional real representations of $\mathfrak{so}(3)$ and $\mathfrak{so}(2,1)$, and I want to know whether it's necessarily true that the Lie groups generated by exponentiating these particular Lie subalgebras of $\mathfrak{gl}(5)$ are, in fact, embedded copies of $SO(3)$ and $SO(2,1)$, respectively, in $GL(5)$. These particular subalgebras are contained in the standard representations of $SO(5)$ and $SO(3,2)$, respectively, but I don't know whether that's sufficient to answer the question. 

It's not 2-dimensional because, as you observed, the solution contains two arbitrary functions of 1 variable. This means that the solution space has infinite dimension, but the right way to think about "counting" solutions is that the general solution contains a certain number of functions involving a certain number of independent variables. So for the example above, we say that the space of solutions "is parametrized by 2 arbitrary functions of 1 variable." Intuitively, this means that in order to determine a unique solution, you have to specify initial data along some curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ consisting of two functions along the curve. For your example above, typical initial data would take the form $$ u(y,0) = g(y), \qquad u_x(y,0) = f(y). $$ Then the corresponding solution would be $$ u(x,y) = x f(y) + g(y). $$ For a general PDE, the story is a little more complicated - for instance, there may or may not exist global solutions for a given initial value problem, and even for local solutions the question of how an initial value problem should be posed (e.g., along which curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$ might it be appropriate to specify initial data?) depends on the PDE---mainly on the configuration of its characteristic curves. But most of the time (and certainly in the linear case) the space of local solutions to a single nondegenerate second-order PDE in a neighborhood of some point $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ will be parametrized by 2 arbitrary functions of 1 variable. 

The question is in the title. I am trying to apply the Mitchell (Freyd-Mitchell?) embedding theorem, which states that for every small abelian category $A$, there exists a ring $R$ such that A embeds into the category $R$-mod. The derived category is not abelian, of course, but I have a particular subcategory that is abelian, and life would be easiest if the derived category was smal, so that the subcategory was small and abelian. 

Without going over all of the details before I eat breakfast, I will go out on a limb and say the following: for $a$, $b$ close to 1, you will get an identical moduli space for the reason that stability is an open condition. In other words, you can change a GIT stability condition a little without changing which sheaves are stable. In general, this kind of change to the stability condition goes under the heading of a "variation of GIT quotient." I think the relevant paper to look at is: Geometric Invariant Theory and Flips by Michael Thaddeus
