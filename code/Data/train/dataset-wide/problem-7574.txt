Let $G$ be any group scheme over $S$. Let $I\subset\mathcal{O}_G$ be the augmentation ideal defining the identity section of $G$ over $S$. Then, by definition, the first infinitesimal neighborhood of the identity in $G$ is the closed sub-scheme of $G$ defined by the ideal $I^2$. Moreover, $I/I^2$ is a coherent sheaf on $S$: it is nothing but the sheaf of invariant differentials on $G$, namely $\Omega_{G}$. In the book 'Neron Models', for example, you will find in Proposition 4.2.1 that there is a canonical isomorphism from $e^*\Omega_{G/S}$ to $\Omega_G$; here, $\Omega_{G/S}$ is the full sheaf of differentials on $G$ and $e:S\to G$ is the identity section. Now, $\Omega_{G/S}$ is the ideal of the diagonal embedding of $G$ in its first order neighborhood $G^{(1)}\subset G\times_S G$. Pull everything back by the map $g\mapsto (e,g)$ from $G$ to $G\times G$. Then the diagonal embedding pulls back to the identity section and its first order neighborhood pulls back to the first order neighborhood of $e$ in $G$. So we see that $e^*\Omega_{G/S}=I/I^2$. So $\mathcal{O}_{G}/I^2$ is non-canonically isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_S\oplus\epsilon\Omega_G$, where $\epsilon^2=0$. This is because we have a sequence of maps $$\mathcal{O}_S\to \mathcal{O}_G/I^2\to \mathcal{O}_G/I=\mathcal{O}_S$$ of sheaves of rings supported on the identity section. In particular, the short exact sequence $$0\to \Omega_G\to\mathcal{O}_G/I^2\to\mathcal{O}_S\to 0$$ admits a section. Which means that we can write $\mathcal{O}_G/I^2$ as a direct sum $\mathcal{O}_{S}\oplus\Omega_G$, with the multiplication given by $$(f,\omega)\cdot(g,\omega')=(fg,f\omega'+g\omega).$$ Writing it as $\mathcal{O}_S\oplus\epsilon\Omega_G$ is just a compressed way to indicate this. That this pull-back is a deformation of the trivial sheaf follows from the fact that the restriction of the Poincare bundle to $G\times 0$ is canonically trivialized. 

Let us assume that $X=Spec A$ for $A$ a strictly henselian ring. Since $Y$ has codimension at least $2$ and $X$ is normal, the restriction $H^0(X,\mathbb{G}_m)\rightarrow H^0(X\setminus Y,\mathbb{G}_m)$ is an isomorphism (it is always an embedding, without any restriction on the codimension of $Y$). This implies the vanishing of $H^0$ and $H^1$ with support in $Y$. To see that $H^2$ vanishes (without condition on codimension), it is enough to know that $H^1(U,\mathbb{G}_m)=0$ (where $U=X\setminus Y$). If $Y$ has codimension $1$, this is clear, since $U$ is then affine (This is wrong. See Moret-Bailly's comment below). Otherwise, the restriction functor from the category of line bundles over $X$ to that over $U$ is an equivalence of categories; see SGA 2, XI.3. 

For your question 2, note that the fiber product $U_0\times_XU_0$ can be non-trivial (unlike the case of an open sub-set $U_0\subset X$, where it would be $U_0$ again) with two different projections $p_1$ and $p_2$ onto $U_0$ giving two different structures to it as a $U_0$-scheme. The isomorphism $\alpha_{0,0}$ is an isomorphism between these two different $U_0$-structures on $Y\times_XU_0\times_XU_0$ and is also a non-trivial piece of information As an example, if $X=Spec\;k$ and $U_0=Spec\;K$ where $K/k$ is a Galois extension with Galois group $G$, then we get an isomorphism $G\times U_0\rightarrow U_0\times_XU_0$ using the group action. The two structures of $G\times U_0$ as a $U_0$-scheme correspond to the two maps $(g,u)\mapsto u$ and $(g,u)\mapsto gu$. The isomorphism $\alpha_{0,0}$ satisfying the co-cycle condition now equates precisely to giving an action of $G$ on $Y'$ compatible with its action on $U_0$. This is Galois descent. See Serre's Local fields, for example. EDIT: It occurs to me that I didn't directly talk about twisted objects. The idea is the same. Let us start with an object $Y'$ over $U_0$ equipped with an isomorphism $f_0:Y'\rightarrow Y\times_XU_0$. This isomorphism has to satisfy the co-cycle condition, which means the following: We have two projections $p_1,p_2:U_0\times_XU_0\rightarrow U_0$. So we have two different ways to pull-back $Y'$ to over $U_0\times_XU_0$, giving us $p_1^*Y'$ and $p_2^*Y'$. The two pull-backs of $Y\times_XU_0$ under these projections are canonically isomorphic, since the two projections $p_1,p_2$, when composed with the map $U_0\rightarrow X$ agree with the structure map for $U_0\times_XU_0\rightarrow X$. So pulling back $f_0$ gives us isomorphisms $$p_1^*Y'\rightarrow Y\times_X(U_0\times_XU_0)\rightarrow p_2^*Y'.$$ This is your $\alpha_{0,0}$; if it satisfies the co-cycle condition--this amounts to the required compatibility between the pull-backs of $\alpha_{0,0}$ to $U_0\times_{X}U_0\times_{X}U_0$ under the three different projections to $U_0\times_XU_0$--then it gives you descent data for $Y'$. In the Galois setting, if you use $f_0$ to identify $Y'$ with $Y\times_XU_0$, then $\alpha_{0,0}$ is giving you a `twisted' action of $G$ on $Y\times_XU_0$. This data is not always effective. I would highly recommend the chapter on descent in Bosch-Lutkebohmmert-Raynaud's `Neron Models' for an explanation of all these things. 

What you are looking for is the correspondence between algebraic Hecke characters over a number field $F$ and compatible families of $l$-adic characters of the absolute Galois group of $F$. This is laid out beautifully in the first section of Laurent Fargues's notes here. EDIT: In more detail, as Kevin notes in the comments above, an automorphic representation of $GL(1)$ over $F$ is nothing but a Hecke character; that is, a continuous character $$\chi:F^\times\setminus\mathbb{A}_F^\times\to\mathbb{C}^\times$$ of the idele class group of $F$. You can associate $L$-functions to these things: they admit analytic continuation and satisfy a functional equation. This is the automorphic side of global Langlands for $GL(1)$. How to go from here to the Galois side? Well, let's start with the local story. Fix some prime $v$ of $F$; then the automorphic side is concerned with characters $$\chi_v:F_v^\times\to\mathbb{C}^\times$$ Local class field theory gives you the reciprocity isomorphism $$rec_v:W_{F_v}\to F_v^\times,$$ where $W_{F_v}$ is the Weil group of $F_v$. Then $\chi_v\circ rec_v$ gives you a character of $W_{F_v}$. This is local Langlands for $GL(1)$. The matching up local $L$-functions and $\epsilon$-factors is basically tautological. We return to our global Hecke character $\chi$. Recall that global class field theory can be interpreted as giving a map (the Artin reciprocity map) $$Art_F:F^\times\setminus\mathbb{A}_F^\times\to Gal(F^{ab}/F),$$ where $F^{ab}$ is the maximal abelian extension of $F$. Local-global compatibility here means that, for each prime $v$ of $F$, the restriction $Art_F\vert_{F_v^\times}$ agrees with the inverse of the local reciprocity map $rec_v$. Since $Art_F$ is not an isomorphism, we do not expect every Hecke character to be associated with a Galois representation. What is true is that $Art_F$ induces an isomorphism from the group of connected components of the idele class group to $Gal(F^{ab}/F)$. In particular, any Hecke character with finite image will factor through the reciprocity map, and so will give rise to a character of $Gal(F^{ab}/F)$. This is global Langlands for Dirichlet characters (or abelian Artin motives). But we can say more, supposing that we have a certain algebraicity (or arithmeticity) condition on our Hecke character $\chi$ at infinity. The notes of Fargues referenced above have a precise definition of this condition; I believe the original idea is due to Weil. The basic idea is that the obstruction to $\chi$ factoring through the group of connected components of the idele class group (and hence through the abelianized Galois group) lies entirely at infinity. The algebraicity condition lets us "move" this persnickety infinite part over to the $l$-primary ideles (for some prime $l$), at the cost of replacing our field of coefficients $\mathbb{C}$ by some finite extension $E_\lambda$ of $\mathbb{Q}_l$. This produces a character $$\chi_l:F^\times\setminus\mathbb{A}_F^\times\to E_\lambda^\times$$ that shares its local factors away from $l$ and $\infty$ with $\chi$, but now factors through $Art_F$. Varying over $l$ gives us a compatible family of $l$-adic characters associated with our automorphic representation $\chi$ of $GL(1)$. The $L$-functions match up since their local factors do. 

Beilinson has recently discovered a new proof of the de Rham comparison isomorphism. You can find a write-up here: $URL$ Here, he shows that $B_{dR}$ naturally shows up when you consider the p-adic completion (in a suitable sense) of the derived de Rham cohomology of $\mathcal{O}_{\bar{K}}$ over $\mathcal{O}_K$. Also, $A_{cris}$ naturally shows up as (more or less) the global sections of the structure sheaf over the crystalline site for $\mathcal{O}_{\bar{K}}$ over $W(k)$ ($k$ is the residue field of $K$). There is a very nice explanation of this in R. S. Lodh's thesis: $URL$ 

(Note: There is no new content in this answer; it is simply an explanation of parts of user's excellent response. I'm writing it as an answer, because that seems less perverse than splitting it across many comments.) The key result that is being used here is the following consequence of Zariski's Main Theorem + Hensel's lemma: Suppose that $f:A\to B$ is a map of finite type (between noetherian rings), with $A$ local henselian. Suppose that $\mathfrak{n}\subset B$ is a prime above $\mathfrak{m}$ such that the localization $B_{\mathfrak{n}}$ is quasi-finite over $A$ at the closed point (i.e. $B_{\mathfrak{n}}/\mathfrak{m}B_{\mathfrak{n}}$ is finite over the field $A/\mathfrak{m}$). Then $B_{\mathfrak{n}}$ is finite over $A$, and is in particular itself henselian local. Here, Zariski's Main Theorem is (or can be) used in the following incarnation (see Raynaud, 'Anneaux locaux henseliens', p. 42): Let $f:A\to B$ be as in our hypotheses in the first paragraph (but don't assume that $A$ is henselian). Let $B'$ be the integral closure of $A$ in $B$ (note that $B'$ is automatically finite over $A$); then there exists $f\in B'$, $f\notin \mathfrak{n}$ such that $B'_f=B_f$. In other words, $\text{Spec }B\to\text{Spec }B'$ is an open immersion in a neighborhood of $\mathfrak{n}$. Therefore, there exists a prime $\mathfrak{n}'\subset B'$ such that $B'_{\mathfrak{n}'}=B_{\mathfrak{n}}$. So, replacing $B,\mathfrak{n}$ by $B',\mathfrak{n}'$, we can assume that $B$ is finite over $A$. If we now assume that $A$ is in addition henselian, then Hensel's lemma implies that $B$ is a product $B=\prod_{i=1}^rB_{\mathfrak{n}_i}$, where $\mathfrak{n}_i$ ranges over all the primes of $B$ that lie over $\mathfrak{m}$; see for example p. 2 of Raynaud's book. This immediately implies that $B_{\mathfrak{n}}$ is finite over $A$. Let's see why this implies Hironaka's claim. As in user's answer, let $S/I$ be the quotient of $S$ that acts faithfully on the $R$-module $A$. As observed already in the answer, the map $R\to S/I$ is quasi-finite at the closed point; also, $S/I$ is the henselization of the localization of an $R$-algebra $B$ of finite type at a prime $\mathfrak{n}\subset B$ (this is the point where you use the fact that $I$ is finitely generated; $B$ is what user denotes as $S'/I'$). Now, we can apply the result from the first paragraph to conclude that $B_{\mathfrak{n}}$ is finite over $R$ and is therefore itself henselian. This implies that $S/I=B_{\mathfrak{n}}$, which shows that $S/I$ (and hence $A$) is finite over $R$. 

It is sufficient that $f$ be faithfully flat. This is a local question (I'm assuming everything is Noetherian). If you have a flat map of local rings $(R,\mathfrak{m})\to (S,\mathfrak{n})$, then we have $dim~S=dim~R+dim~S/\mathfrak{m}S$ and $depth~S=depth~R+depth~S/\mathfrak{m}S$. Since depth is bounded by dimension, this implies that $S$ is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if both $R$ and $S/\mathfrak{m}S$ are Cohen-Macaulay; cf. Bruns-Herzog, 2.1.7. 

If you allow tensor powers of duals of $X$, then all the things you are talking about are just elements of certain vector spaces ($X\to X$ is just an element of $X^∗\otimes X$, for example). And any Galois invariant element of $V\otimes L$ is an element of $V$ (where $V$ is a vector space over $K$). 

This is not exactly what you wanted, but in algebraic geometry it is often easier to prove something for a particular object by considering the moduli space parametrizing such objects. The example I have in mind is the following: Suppose you picked some random elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ and were wondering if it has a rational point of order $11$. It is possible to answer this for any particular curve with some computational facility, but we don't have to. We have Mazur's Theorem, which says that the answer is `no, it doesn't.' Mazur does this essentially by showing that the corresponding moduli space of elliptic curves with a choice of $11$-torsion point (which is a nice modular curve) has no rational points: so you can never have an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ with an $11$-torsion point. 

The theory can be summarized as follows: First, to every $p$-divisible group $G$ over a scheme $S$ in characteristic $p$, you can attach a Dieudonne crystal $\mathbb{D}(G)$ over $S$. What this means is that, for any $S$-scheme $U$, and any divided power thickening of $U$--that is, a closed immersion of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-schemes $U\hookrightarrow T$ such that $U$ is cut out in $T$ by a nilpotent ideal equipped with divided powers (note that this is usually an additional structure)--we have a vector bundle $\mathbb{D}(G)\vert_T$ over $T$. Of course, you need all these vector bundles to patch together in a nice way. It in fact has the structure of an $F$-crystal, but we don't need that here. There are many constructions of this crystal: First, using Grothendieck's idea of universal vector extensions, Messing (and then Mazur-Messing) built a crystal, which, however, is only defined on a smaller site, the so-called nilpotent crystalline site. The general construction is due to Berthelot-Breen-Messing. When $S$ is smooth and admits a smooth lift $\widetilde{S}$ over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, giving such a crystal is equivalent to giving a vector bundle over $\widetilde{S}$ equipped with a (topologically quasi-nilpotent integrable) connection. The point is that the connection tells you how to differentiate sections of the vector bundle along vector fields, and hence lets you use Taylor series to identify the evaluations of the vector bundle along 'infinitesimally close' points of $\widetilde{S}$. To make sense of such a series, you need divided powers, and the 'topologically quasi-nilpotent' condition ensures that this series is always truncated at a finite level. In general, one has to work locally, and with divided power envelopes, but there exists a similar such description. See Theorem 6.6 of Berthelot-Ogus, 'Notes on crystalline cohomology'. Once you have the crystal $\mathbb{D}(G)$, Messing showed that you can use it linearize the deformation theory of $p$-divisible groups. Namely, the restriction of $\mathbb{D}(G)$ to the Zariski site of $S$ has a natural (Hodge) filtration, given, as you point out, by the Lie algebra of the universal vector extension of $G$. Then, for any nilpotent divided power thickening (we need not just the ideal sheaf, but also the divided powers on it to be nilpotent) $U\hookrightarrow T$ in the crystalline site of $S$ over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, lifting $G\vert U$ over $T$ is equivalent to deforming the Hodge filtration on $\mathbb{D}(G)\vert_{U\hookrightarrow U}$ to a direct summand of $\mathbb{D}(G)\vert_{U\hookrightarrow T}$. This specializes to the case you refer to in your question, by taking $S$ to be $\text{Spec }\mathbb{F}_p$ and $T$ to be $\text{Spec }\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ (it is known (see 2.4.4 of de Jong's 'Crystalline Dieudonne theory...') that giving a $p$-divisible group over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is equivalent to giving a compatible system of $p$-divisible groups over $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ as $n$ varies). The divided powers are the canonical ones: $p\mapsto\frac{p^n}{n!}$. Unfortunately, there is a hitch when $p=2$: these divided powers are not nilpotent, so Grothendieck-Messing theory is very delicate then. In fact, the statement as you have it is no longer true in this situation (one has to restrict to connected $p$-divisible groups). 

Question 1: In the answers to a previous question of yours, I think it was explained that one way to view a connection is as infinitesimal descent data. It might be more useful, however, to look at some specific examples: when $G=GL_n$, then a $G$-bundle with flat connection is just a vector bundle of rank $n$ with a flat connection; when $G=SL_n$, it's a vector bundle $V$ of rank $n$ equipped with a flat connection $\nabla$ such that $\det(V)$ admits a $\nabla$-parallel generating section; when $G=SO_n$, it's just a $SL_n$-bundle with flat connection $\nabla$ equipped also with a $\nabla$-parallel non-degenerate quadratic form.... Question 2: In any of the above explicit settings, giving a reduction to a Borel $B$ simply amounts to giving an appropriate full flag of sub-bundles for $V$ (for example, if $G=SO_n$, you will require some isotropicity condition for the flag). A connection will preserve the reduction $\mathfrak{F}_B$ if it preserves the flag it corresponds to (in the sense that every derivation preserves the flag). If $\nabla$ and $\nabla'$ are two flat connections (of $G$-bundles), then their difference is an element of $End(V)\otimes\Omega^1$. Of course, their difference will kill any structures on $V$ that are parallel with respect to both $\nabla$ and $\nabla'$ : so, if $G=SL_n$, then it will be of trace $0$; if $G=SO_n$, then it will be of trace $0$ and preserve the quadratic form. This sub-space, which is a twist of $\mathfrak{g}=Lie(G)$ (viewed as a representation of $G$) by the $G$-torsor $\mathfrak{F}$, is what is being referred to as $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathfrak{F}_G}$. So we find that $\nabla-\nabla'$ is an element of $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathfrak{F}_G}\otimes\Omega^1$. EDIT: I was trying to give an idea of what preserving $\mathfrak{F}_B$ meant, but the notion of $\nabla$ preserving $\mathfrak{F}_B$ is simple in general: we have an identification of $G$-torsors: $$\mathfrak{F}_G=G\times^B\mathfrak{F}_B.$$ We now simply require the connection $\nabla$ to arise from a connection on $\mathfrak{F}_B$ via this identification. Question 3: Here, I think they're only asking for a local trivialization of $\mathfrak{F}_B$. A trivialization of $\mathfrak{F}_B$ gives an isomorphism of $B$-torsors from $B\times X$ to $\mathfrak{F}_B$. The former has a tautological connection over $X$, since it's a constant $X$-scheme. EDIT: The local trivialization gives a local tautological connection! Question 4: No idea. EDIT: In general, if you have a $G$-torsor $P$ over $X$, and a representation $V$ of $G$, you can define the twist $V_P$ as a vector bundle over $X$: this is the contraction product $$V\times^G P=(V\times P)/G,$$ where $G$ is acting diagonally. If you look at 1.2.4 in Frenkel's book ('Langlands correspondence...'), then you'll find that giving a connection on $P$ is equivalent to giving compatible flat connections on the twists $V_P$ of all algebraic $G$-representations $V$. Essentially, if you have infinitesimal descent data for $P$, then you clearly have corresponding data for the twists $V_P$; the converse is trickier and uses some Tannakian theory. When $G$ has a faithful representation $V$ (like in our examples), it is enough to do this for the one twist $V_P$ (again, by the Tannakian machine).
