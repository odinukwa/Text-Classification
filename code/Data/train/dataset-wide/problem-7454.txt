Here is a counterexample: $A=k[x]/x^2$, $B=k$, $M=N=A$ as an $(A,A)$-bimodule. Then $\dim_k M\otimes_A M = \dim_k M = 2$, but $\dim_k N\otimes_B N = 4$, so $N\otimes_B N$ cannot possibly embed into $M\otimes_A M$. And of course there are also examples where the natural map $N\otimes_B N\longrightarrow M\otimes_A M$ is not surjective. 

I assume you are referring to page 78 here. I think the author is only implying that you may drop the condition of $A$ being an integral domain (in favor of it being a ring without nilpotent elements). You should still assume that $A$ is noetherian and local with maximal ideal $I$ (since in the formulation of the corollary left to the reader, the author still refers to the field $k=A/I$, which would be ambiguous otherwise; also there are conditions on $A$ and $I$ in place throughout the entire section which prohibit you from working with an arbitrary ring). So you can apply the criterion for flatness given in Corollary 4.4 to the $A/{\mathfrak p}$-module $M/{\mathfrak p} M$ for each minimal prime $\mathfrak p$ of $A$ (since $A/\mathfrak p$ will be an integral domain again). What you want to show then is that $M$ is flat as an $A$-module if and only if $M/{\mathfrak p}M$ is flat as an $A/{\mathfrak p}$-module for each minimal prime $\mathfrak p$. By the foregoing Corollary 4.3, this is the same as showing that $M$ is free if and only if $M/\mathfrak p M$ is free for any minimal prime $\mathfrak p$ (however, the "and only if"-part is trivial). Here is how I think the proof goes: Since $A$ is local, we may lift a $k$-basis of $k\otimes M$ to a minimal $A$-generating set of $M$ (by Nakayama's lemma). We get an exact sequence $$ A^i \stackrel{\varphi}{\longrightarrow} A^{dim_k k\otimes M} \longrightarrow M \longrightarrow 0 $$ for some $i\in\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}$ and some $\varphi\in A^{dim_kk\otimes M \times i}$. If $\varphi$ is zero then $M$ is free. So assume $\varphi$ is not zero and $x$ is some non-zero entry of the matrix. Because $A$ has no nilpotent elements there is some minimal prime $\mathfrak p$ such that $x \notin \mathfrak p$. Now, by tensoring $$ (A/\mathfrak p)^i \stackrel{\varphi}{\longrightarrow} (A/\mathfrak p)^{dim_k k\otimes M} \longrightarrow M/\mathfrak p M \longrightarrow 0 $$ with the fraction field $K$ of $A/\mathfrak p$, we see that $dim_K K\otimes (M/\mathfrak p M) < dim_k k \otimes M= dim_k k\otimes (M/\mathfrak p M)$, i.e. $M/\mathfrak p M$ is not flat/free/projective by Corollary 4.4 (i.e., we have shown: $M$ not free $\Longrightarrow$ $M/\mathfrak p M$ not free for some minimal prime $\mathfrak p$). 

I understand why homology commutes with arbitrary direct sums when the direct sum of a collection of monics is a monic (i.e the direct sum functor is exact) but I was under the impression that there were abelian categories where the direct sum functor is not exact. After a bit of thought, I realised that I don't know an example of an abelian category in which the coproduct functor is not exact. Sheaves of abelian groups on a fixed topological space give an example of an abelian category in which the product functor is not exact. 

Let $M$ be a manifold and $\pi : E \to M$ a rank $n$ vector bundle on $M$. We can define a connection on $E$ in two ways: 

Proving that a category is Noetherian is tricky. Historically, there are two main ways of doing this: Realize your ring as the quotient of something noetherian or realize your ring as the (Ore) localization of something Noetherian. Both of these can be captured under the following slogan: Sometimes, Noetherianity can be transferred along a left adjoint. This is made precise in a note I wrote with Phil Tosteson. Obviously, this is not the only way to prove that a category is Noetherian. As John pointed out, if you have monomials and divisibility is a WQO, then you get Noetherianity. Nagpal, Sam and Snowden and have used the theory of twisted commutative algebras to prove that the category of finite sets with injections and a perfect matching on the complement is Noetherian. See here and here. Currently, it is not known if you can use Grobner methods to prove this result. Also, in FI-modules over Noetherian rings, Church, Ellenberg, Farb and Nagpal proved that FI is Noetherian over any Noetherian ring. They do not use twisted commutative algebras or Grobner methods. If you are only interested in the Noetherianity of FI over a field, then you can use Grobner theory or TCAs to prove that FI is Noetherian. 

I believe the answer to your question is yes. The Reynolds operator $$ R: k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n] \longrightarrow k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n} $$ is $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n}$-equivariant, and therefore in particular $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n\times S_n}$-equivariant. Also, $R$ is a projection, and therefore the image of $R$ is a direct summand of of its domain of definition. It follows therefore that the $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n\times S_n}$-module $ k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n}$ is a direct summand of the free $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n\times S_n}$-module $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]$. Now since the action of $S_n\times S_n$ is generated by reflections, its invariant ring is a polynomial ring, and therefore any direct summand of a free module over this ring is again free (this is the Quillen–Suslin theorem). 

There really isn't any need for character theory over non-algebraically closed fields. The Grothendieck group of $KG$ embeds into the Grothendieck group of $\bar K G$ (i.e. of the group ring over the algebraic closure). Therefore all information about a $KG$-module $M$ you could possibly hope to recover from any type of "character of $M$" is already contained in the Brauer character of the $\bar K G$-module $\bar K \otimes M$. Also, the values of the Brauer character of $M$ will lie in the ring of Witt-vectors over $K$. 

Actually the answer seems to be in the paper of Wildon you linked. Right after Lemma 1.3.7. he shows that $Br_P$ coincides with the Green correspondence on indecomposable direct summands of $1\uparrow _P^G$ (which are exactly your modules $M_i$). Since Green corrensondence establishes a bijection between isomorphism classes of $kG$-modules with vertex $P$ and isomorphism classes of $kN_G(P)$-modules with vertex $P$, injectivity of $Br_P$ follows (surjectivity doesn't follow immediately from this argument, because we restricted the domain of definition of the Green correspondence to trivial source modules). 

Regarding the part of your question about involutions. I don't think it's always possible to find a maximal order stable under a given involution. For instance, take $F=\mathbb Q$, $A = \mathbb Q^{2\times 2}$ and the involution $$ \sigma: A \longrightarrow A: X \mapsto M\cdot X^\top \cdot M^{-1} $$ with $$ M=\left(\begin{array}{cc} 2&0\newline 0&1\end{array}\right) $$ Now any maximal order $\Theta$ in $A$ is conjugate to $\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$, and therefore all $\Theta$-lattices in $\mathbb Q^{1\times 2}$ are of the form $n\cdot L$ for dome $n\in \mathbb Q$ and some fixed full $\mathbb Z$-lattice L in $\mathbb Q^{1\times 2}$. Note that the determinant of a basis matrix for $n\cdot L$ is well-defined up to sign (since two basis matrices differ only by an element of ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb Z)$), and $\det(n\cdot L) = \pm n^2\cdot \det(L)$. In what follows assume $\Theta$ is a maximal order such that $\sigma(\Theta) \subseteq \Theta$. This will lead to a contradiction. For any $S\in{\rm GL}(2,\mathbb Q)$ we can replace $M$ by $M' = S M S^{\top}$, $\Theta$ by $\Theta'=S\Theta S^{-1}$ and $\sigma$ by $$ \sigma': A \longrightarrow A: X \mapsto M'\cdot X^\top \cdot M'^{-1} $$ So assume that $\Theta'=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$, $L'=\mathbb Z^{1\times 2}$ and $\sigma'(\Theta') \subseteq \Theta'$. Note that the determinant of $M'$ will be $2\cdot \det S^2$, which is not a square in $\mathbb Q$. Now here's the problem: $L'\cdot M'$ is not of the form $n\cdot L'$, since $\det M'$ is not a square in $\mathbb Q$. Therefore $L'\cdot M'$ cannot be stable under the action of $\Theta'^\top = \Theta'$. Hence $$ L' \cdot M' \cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \neq L'\cdot M' $$ which implies $$ L' \cdot M' \cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \cdot M'^{-1} \neq L' $$ which tells you that $$ \sigma'(\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}) = M'\cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \cdot M'^{-1} \nsubseteq {\rm End}_{\mathbb Z}(L')=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2} $$ which is a contradiction (as $\Theta'=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$ was assumed to be stable under $\sigma'$). 

Lets continue assuming that $ b_p^2 > b_q^1 $. Write $ S$ for the homogeneous coordinate ring of $ \mathbb{P}^n$. Then we have a map $ (F_{ij}) : \oplus S \to \oplus S $. Suppose that we run Schreyer's Algorithm as explained on page 338 of Eisenbud's book. This gives us a matrix $(G_{ij}) : \oplus S \to \oplus S $ such that $$ \oplus S \xrightarrow{(G_{ij})} \oplus S \xrightarrow{(F_{ij})} \oplus S $$ Is exact. 

Hi Mathoverflow. This question is about building intuition for the Proj construction. When I first started learning about schemes, I found the construction of the structure sheaves on Spec and Proj very confusing. However, after enough time had passed I began to understand the construction for Spec: It is sort of an algebraic partition of unity argument. The construction of the structure sheaf on Proj is still very mysterious to me. For completeness it goes something like this: 

On the wikipedia page for Calabi–Yau manifolds there is a picture. I want to learn how to make pictures like this. They claim that it is a hyperplane section of a quintic three-fold but whenever I use computer software to visualize the real points of such a hyperplane section it always looks really boring. 

I was just reading the Ehresmann connection wikipedia page and noticed that it defines an Ehresmann connection to be complete if a curve in the base can be horizontally lifted over its entire domain. I was under the impression that this was always true! It is always true for the frame bundle of a vector bundle. In this case, Gronwall's Inequality tells you that the paralell transport of a vector cannot blow up in finite time. 

Let $X$ be an affine variety and $A$ its coordinate ring. Then a $ \mathbb{Z} $ grading on $A$ is the same thing as a $ \mathbb{G}_m = k^{\times} $ action on $X$. If $Y$ is a closed subvariety cut out by the ideal $I$, then $I$ is graded if and only if $Y$ is invariant under the torus action. This should give you some intuition for graded ideals: they are exactly those which cut out torus invariant subvarieties. 

$URL$ (page 13) In the above paper by Danny Calegari he says that the result $\text{scl}(g) \geq 1/2$ (i.e. a stable commutator length $\text{scl}(g) := \displaystyle{\lim_n}\ cl(g^n) / n$, where $\text{cl}(g)$ is the smallest $k$ such that $g$ is a product of $k$ commutators) follows (apart from the Howie-Duncan result) from the paper by Comerford-Edmunds. "Products of commutators and products of squares in a free group" by Leo P. Comerford , Jr. , Charles C. Edmunds, 1994. Although I am familiar with that paper, I do not immediately see how that result follows from the description of solutions of quadratic equations described in Comerford&Edmunds. Here is a reference to the paper: $URL$ Could anyone clarify the link between the two results? thanks! 

Hello, Does anyone know if there is a result that relates a quantity such as an average degree to the fact the a (simple and connected graph) has no cut vertices? e.g. if a graph has a Hamiltoninan cycle then it has not cut vertex. By Ore's theorem, if deg(v) >= n/2 for each vertex v (n is the number of vertices of a graph), then the graph is Hamiltoninan. Hence deg(v) >= n/2 implies no cut vertices (non-separable). I am looking for a result similar to Ore's theorem, but w.r.t. non-separability e.g. something like if the deg(v) >= f(n) for each v (or some statement about the average degree), then the number of cut vertices is zero. Thank you. 

Let $F$ be a free group of finite rank, and $p, b \in F$, where $b$ is a root element (i.e. not a proper power). I have a case where $p^{n_k} = V_{n_k}^{-1}b^{-1} V_{n_k} \cdot U_{n_k}^{-1}b U_{n_k}$, for some $n_k \in \mathbb{Z}$ ...i.e. some powers of $p$ are products of two conjugates of $b$ and $b^{-1}$. What can be said about $p$ and $b$ ? Some immediate implications: By Karras-Magnus-Solitair, since $b$ is root, one-relator group $ < F \ | \ b >$ is torsion-free, so if a proper power of $p$ is in $ncl(b)$ then $p\in ncl(b)$. Also, by going to an abelianization of $F$, it is clear that $p\in \[ F, F \]$. I was hoping that $p$ is conjugate to $b$...by Magnus, if we can show that $b$ is also in the the normal closure of $p$ then that would be the case. I also have a somewhat related general question. Say, if we have $b$ as normal root of $p$ i.e. $p \in ncl(b)$, so that $p = \displaystyle{\prod_{i=1}^{n}} T_i^{-1} b^{\epsilon _i} T_i$, where $\epsilon _i = \pm 1$. Clearly the above product is not unique. Is there a notion of associating to $p$ a minimal integer $n_p \geq 1$ so that $p$ can be decomposed to the product $p = \displaystyle{\prod_{i=1}^{n_p}} T_i^{-1} b^{\epsilon _i} T_i$? For example if $n_p=1$ then $p$ and $b$ are conjugate. Apologies if I missed something obvious or the question(s) doesn't make sense. Thanks! 

The answer is no in general as explained by the above answers. Since this problem is tagged algebraic topology, I guess that you care about function spaces because you care about homotopy theory. Here is how I think about function spaces when I am doing homotopy theory: The space of functions from $X$ to $Y$ is the space representing the contravariant functor $$ Z \mapsto {\rm maps}(X \times Z,Y) $$ this object might not exist in the category of topological spaces, but this does not really matter from the perspective of homotopy theory: you can just work inside a different category! EDIT: I just want to add my opinion on Lennart's comment. Suppose that we "enlarge" the category of spaces to include the representing object ${\rm maps}(X,Y) $. We can extract a lot of information about the object ${\rm maps}(X,Y) $. Its points are just morphisms $ * \to {\rm maps}(X,Y)$ which we can identify with the set of maps from $X$ to $Y$. We also have a great description of maps from other spaces into ${\rm maps}(X,Y) $. I can't imagine that you can extract much more from the compact open topology (but I could be wrong here) 

I know very little about how computers work, so please excuse my ignorance! I think of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler as a program that eats up extensional type theory and spits out a program which can be run on my computer. 

It is very well known that if $\alpha : \mathscr{F} \to \mathscr{G}$ is a morphism of sheaves, then it induces homomorphisms on the stalks. I have been wondering for a while if given a collection of homomorphisms between the stalks of two sheaves and some suitable patching condition, can we construct a homomorphism of sheaves? I have been thinking about this problem a little bit lately, but I have not been able to come up with a "canonical" solution. In other words I have found ways of producing sheaf morphisms from stalk morphisms but they have always felt very unnatural. Let me phrase the question a little bit more formally. Let $X$ be a topological space and $\mathscr{F}, \mathscr{G}$ sheaves on $X$. Let $\alpha_p : \mathscr{F}_p \to \mathscr{G}_p$ be a homomorphism for each $p \in X$. Is there a suitable condition on the $\alpha_p$s such that there exists a sheaf morphism $\alpha : \mathscr{F} \to \mathscr{G}$ whose induced maps on the stalks are exactly the $\alpha_p$s?
