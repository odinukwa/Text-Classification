The question was already answered by ThiKu and YCor. I am adding this just to make a conceptual remark. The OP asks about groups which are QI, but not in an "elementary fashion". As YCor pointed out in his answer, if $G$ acts properly and cocompactly on a geodesic metric space $X$ then it could be seen as a cocompact lattice in the (locally compact group) of isometries of $X$. It thus makes sense to extend our notion of "elementary-ness" as follows: Definition: Two groups are elementary equivalent if they are in the relation (E) which is the transitive closure of the relation "being cocompact lattices in the same locally compact group". Finding groups which are QI but not E will answer the OP question. Still, the relation E is defined in a non explicit way. It makes sense to extend it. That is, to find a courser equivalence relation that contains it, and is easier to handle. A good example is the following: Definition: Two groups are Measure Equivalent (ME) if they act on an infinite measure space, preserving the measure, the actions commute and each has a finite fundamental domain. The exact relationship between QI and ME is tricky. Both contain the relation E defined above, but none include the other. However, it is not hard to see that property (T) is an ME invariant (this is Corollary 1.4 in Furman's paper), while it is possible for a (T) group to be QI to a non-(T) group. For an example, see (1) in YCor's answer. This example thus addresses all OP's challenges. The relation ME admits various refinements called ME$^p$, where $1\leq p\leq \infty$ refers to some inegrability property of an associated function (the norm of the rearrangement cocycle). Again, these are all natural equivalence relation containing E. In Theorem 1.1 of Das-Tessera's paper it is shown that the groups given by ThiKu in his answer are not ME$^p$. Again, it follows that they are not E. 

A subset $A\subset X'$ is called total if it is not contained in any proper closed subspace. Note that $A$ is total in $X'$ iff its anihilator in $X$ is trivial. Your space $X$ is a separable Hilbert space, thus closed bounded sets are compact and metrizable for the weak topology. In particular, every bounded sequence has a weakly converging subsequence. The following could be therefore proven easily by a sub-sub-sequence argument: Assume $\{u_m\}$ is bounded in $X$ and $A$ total in $X'$. Then $u_m\to u$ weakly is equivalent to $(*)$ $\langle u_m,v\rangle \to \langle u,v\rangle$ for every $v\in A$. Note that if $A$ is not total in $X'$ then the condition $(*)$ does not guarantee weak convergence (for example, take $u_m=0$ for all $m$ and $u$ a nontrivial vector in the annihilator of $A$). Now, back to our specific question. The set of constant functions is a proper closed subspace of $X'$, hence not total. Therefore the answer is "no". What you are really seem to be asking is: what are good examples of total subsets of $X'$ that I can use? Given a total subset $B\subset V$, each of the sets $$ \{ \chi_{[a,b]}\cdot v\mid 0<a<b<1,~ v\in B\} $$ and $$ \{ f\cdot v\mid f\in C([0,1)),~v\in B\} $$ is total in $X'$ and might be suitable for your purposes. The proof is an exercise. 

One should take care here. While when considering algebraic group actions typically orbits are locally closed, in general this is not the case. Consider for example the multiplication action of $H=\mathbb{Q}^*$ on $N=\mathbb{R}$ and form the corresponding semidirect product $G=H\ltimes N$. Topologize it by taking the standard topology on $N$ and the discrete topology on $H$. Then you have an $H$ invariant measure on each $H$-orbit in $N$ (the counting measure), but it doesn't have much to do with the Haar measure of $N$. The quotient topology on $N/H$ will be trivial, taking out one closed point corresponding to $0$. Another example you should carry in mind is $H=\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ acting on $H=\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}^2$. Again take $G=H\ltimes N$. Now the quotient topology on $N/H$ has countable dense subset of closed points corresponding to rational points of $H$. Taking it out you are left again with the trivial topology. Here too, one cannot make any reasonable relation between measures on this space and the Haar measure of $N$. Note that in this example the Haar measure on $N$ is $H$ invariant, while in the first example it was not. You could not tell this by just looking on $N/H$. 

Consider the vector $(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_m)$ as the $\mathbf{F}_q$-linear transformation $T:(\mathbf{F}_q)^m\to \mathbf{F}_{q^n}$ given by $$ (\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_m) \mapsto \sum \beta_i\alpha_i. $$ Then $\ker(M)$ is the $\mathbf{F}_{q^n}$-span of $\ker(T)$ in $(\mathbf{F}_{q^n})^m$. To see this, note that $\ker(T)<\ker(M)$ and compare dimensions. 

This is not answer, rather a summarize of some remarks. Let $G$ be the hypercube group. A first step towards classifying all norms with isometry group $G$ is to classify all norms with isometry group which contains $G$. This is what we discuss below. Let $D$ be the set of all seminorms on $\mathbb{R}^d$ for which the average value on the standard basis vector is 1 (this is a natural normalization). Observe that $D$ is a convex set, compact wrt the pointwise convergence topology. Observe that $G$ acts naturally on $D$ and let $P:D\to D$ be the associated averaging operator $N(\cdot)\mapsto \frac{1}{|G|}\Sigma_g N(g^{-1}\cdot)$. Denoting by $C$ the set of $G$ invariant seminorms (in fact: norms, as $G$ acts irreducibly on $\mathbb{R}^d$) in $D$, $P$ is a projection on $C$. The $P$-preimage of an extreme point in $C$ is a face in $D$, hence contains an extreme point of $D$. By this observation, it appears that our task is reduced to classifying the set $E$ consisting of all extreme points in $D$. Given a non-zero linear functional $\theta\in (\mathbb{R}^d)^*$, up to a suitable normalization we have $|\theta(\cdot)|\in D$ and it is easy to see that this is an extreme point. Let us denote by $F\subset E$ the space of extreme points coming from functionals as above. Guillaume Aubrun made in his answer the following observation: Observation: A norm in $N\in D$ is in the closed convex hull of $F$ iff $(\mathbb{R}^d,N)$ is embedable in $L^1$. Proof: There exists a probability measure $\mu\in \text{Prob}(F)$ s.t for all $x\in \mathbb{R}^d$, $N(x)=\int |\theta(x)|d\mu(\theta)$ $\Leftrightarrow$ There exists a linear map $\mathbb{R}^d\to L^1(\mu)$, $x\mapsto \theta(x)$. It then follows that for $d=2$ indeed $E=F$, as every norm on $\mathbb{R}^2$ is embedable in $L^1$ (right? reference?). However, for $d>2$ there are norms which are not embedable in $L^1$, e.g $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ (also $\|\cdot\|_p$, $p>2$ - correct?), thus $F\subsetneq E$. What are the other extreme points of $D$? 

This answer does not regard the specific questions asked, but the motivation behind: finding a framework where the choices in the classical construction of a root system of a semi-simple Lie algebra are not needed. 

A simple way to come up with non-complete topologies on $\text{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ is by embedding $$ \text{SO}(3,\mathbb{R}) \to \text{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})\to \text{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$$ and then using a discontinuous automorphism of $\mathbb{C}$ to produce a discontinuous automorphism of $\text{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$. Knowing all the (not so many) closed subgroups of $\text{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$, it is easy to deduce that the image of $\text{SO}(3,\mathbb{R})$ under such an automorphism is not closed, hence the induced topology not complete. Another nice way to finish the argument is by making an identification of $\mathbb{C}$ with another algebraically closed field of the same cardinality, carrying a different topological structure. For this one can use the "$p$-adic complex field", $\mathbb{C}_p$. One gets the embedding $$ \text{SO}(3,\mathbb{R}) \to \text{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})\to \text{SL}(3,\mathbb{C}) \to \text{SL}(3,\mathbb{C}_p).$$ Finally, to cope with Andreas' remark, note that $\text{SL}(3,\mathbb{C}_p)$ has a countable permutation action. Indeed, this Polish group has an open subgroup, namely $\text{SL}(3,\mathcal{O})$, where $\mathcal{O}<\mathbb{C}_p$ is the ring of integers. 

Here is a counter example: take $G=\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ and $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0,0\}$. It is easy to check that the action is distal, and that there is no non-trivial factor carrying an invariant metric (the only proper factor is $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{R})$). 

The following post is an edit of a previous one which was not accurate. It provides a partial answer to the question. As a compromise I decided to include also a bit of a generalization. Thanks to Cameron Zwarich for spotting a gap in my previous post. Thanks to Nik Weaver for suggesting a way around it using a stronger assumption and to Cameron Zwarich for identifying this assumption with the established property of having a "strongly unique predual". That was very helpful. Recall that the Banach space $X$ is called a unique predual if for every isometric isomorphism $\phi:X^*\simeq Y^*$ there exists an isometric isomorphism $\phi_*:Y\simeq X$. The Banach space $X$ is called a strongly unique predual if moreover there exists such $\phi_*$ satisfying $\phi=(\phi_*)^*$. The latter notion seems more natural. Note that the existence of a Banach space which is unique predual but not strongly unique predual seems to be an open problem - at least it was in 1989 - see X.2 in "Existence and uniqueness of isometric preduals: a survey" by Godefroy (Contemp. Math, 131-193, 85, 1989). In particular, it seems that the spaces $\text{Lip}(Y)$ which motivated Nik's question are known (by him) to be strongly unique preduals, thus my answer below, though partial, does help in proving that for a bounded metric space $X$ the space $\text{Lip}_0(X)$ has a strongly unique predual. This is mentioned as an open problem in Nik's book "Lipschitz Algebras" (p. 40). Theorem: Assume $E$ has a strongly unique predual and $E_0<E$ is a weak*-closed subspace such that $E/E_0$ is reflexive. Then also $E_0$ has a strongly unique predual. The following is a compactness criterion for preduality, due to Dixmier, which I learned from the answer by Cameron Zwarich. For a proof see also Proposition VIII.1 in the above mentioned Godefroy's survey. Dixmier's Compactness Criterion (DCC): For a Banach space $X$ and a subspace $Z<X^*$, the closed unit ball of $X$ is Hausdorff compact with respect to the weak topology generated by $Z$ iff the restriction map $X^{**}\to Z^*$ restricts to an isometric isomorphism $X\simeq Z^*$ on $X<X^{**}$. Lemma: If $X$ is a strongly unique predual and $Z<X^{**}$ is a subspace such that the closed unit ball of $X^*$ is Hausdorff compact with respect to the weak topology generated by $Z$ then $Z$ coincides with the canonical image of $X$ in $X^{**}$. Proof of the lemma: By DCC the map $\phi$ given by the composition $X^*\hookrightarrow X^{***}\to Z^*$ is an isometric isomorphism. Since $X$ is a strongly unique predual, we can find $\phi_*:Z\simeq X$ such that $\phi=(\phi_*)^*$. $\phi^*:Z^{**}\to X^{**}$ restricted to $Z<Z^{**}$ gives the inclusion. Its image coincides with the image of $X$, by the commutativity of the diagram $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} Z @>\phi_*>> X\\ @V V V @VV V\\ Z^{**} @>\phi^*>> X^{**} \end{CD} Proof of the theorem: Let $E_*$ be the unique predual of $E$. Let $E_0<E$ be a weak*-closed subspace and assume $E/E_0$ is reflexive. Let $L=E_0^\perp<E^*$. By the weak* closedness assumption on $E_0$, upon identifying $E_*$ with its embedding in $E^*$, $L<E_*$. We identify $L$ with $(E/E_0)^*$ and, by reflexivity, we identify $E/E_0$ with $L^*$. We identify $E_0$ with $(E_*/L)^*$ and argue to show that $E_*/L$ is a strongly unique predual of $E_0$. Assume having an isometric isomorphism $\phi:E_0 \simeq F^*$. Let $\phi_*$ be the isometry $F \to F^{**} \simeq E_0^*$ and let $\pi$ be the restriction map $E^*\to E^*/L\simeq E_0^*$. By Banach-Alaoglu the closed unit ball of $E_0$ is Hausdorff compact under the weak topology generated by $\phi_*(F)$. It follows that the intersection of the closed unit ball of $E$ with $E_0$ is Hausdorff compact under the weak topology on $E$ generated by $\pi^{-1}(\phi_*(F))$. We claim that also the closed unit ball of $E$ itself is Hausdorff compact under the topology generated by $\pi^{-1}(\phi_*(F))$. To see this we establish a converging subnet for each net $x_\alpha$ in this ball. Denoting by $\bar{x}_\alpha$ its image in $E/E_0$, using the fact that $L<\pi^{-1}(\phi(F))$ generates a Haudorff compact topology on the closed unit ball of $E/E_0$ by reflexivity, we may and do pass to a subnet and assume that $\bar{x}_\alpha$ converges to $\bar{y}\in E/E_0$ for some $y\in E$. By the Open Mapping Theorem there is a net $z_\alpha\in E_0$ with $\|(x_\alpha-y)-z_\alpha\|\to 0$. By the already established compactness of the closed unit ball in $E_0$, we may and do pass to a subnet and assume that $z_\alpha$ converges to $z\in E_0$. It follows that $x_\alpha$ converges to $y+z$. This proves the claim. Applying the lemma with $X=E_*$ and $Z=\pi^{-1}(\phi_*(F))<E^*$ we conclude that $\pi^{-1}(\phi_*(F))=E_*$ inside $E^*$. Thus, $\phi_*(F)=\pi(\pi^{-1}(\phi_*(F)))=E_*/L$, and by the definition of $\phi_*$ we get that $\phi=(\phi_*)^*$.
