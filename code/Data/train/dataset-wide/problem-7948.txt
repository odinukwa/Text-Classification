This thread has been dormant for some time, and the class which motivated it is probably by now over, but I've just stumbled across it and can't help but mention an interesting and surprising example of elementary group theory making an appearance in anthropology. This comes from an appendix, "On the Algebraic Study of Certain Types of Marriage," that Andre Weil wrote for a book of Claude Levi-Strass.(!) (In turn, my knowledge of it stems from a mention of it in the book "Algebra" by T.T. Moh.) I can't find a good summary online, so: Anthropological Part The following kinship system (the "Murngin system") is found apparently often in primitive societies: (1) Every member of the society is assigned a type, with marriage only permissible for couples of the same type (2) A person's type is a determined solely by their gender and the type of their parents; in the opposite direction, the type of a person's parents can be determined by their gender and type. (3) Blood relations only determine whether or not two people have the same type. (So if there is one instance of a father and son having the same type, all fathers and sons have the same type -- if this is opaque, it will be rephrased more transparently using group theoretic language below.) (4) The type of brothers and sisters is always different. (5) It is always possible for some descendants of any two people to get married. An anthropologist might observe that first cousins whose mothers are sisters never marry, or that when there less than 4 types of people in a tribe a marriage between first cousins whose parents are oppositely gendered siblings is permissible, and wonder whether these are separate empirical observations, or already implied by observations made above. Some elementary group theory gives the answer. Group Theoretic Part (1)&(2) rephrased: If we let the types of people be $1, 2, ..., n$, then by (2) we can define the type of the son of a couple of type $i$ to be $s(i)$, and the type of a daughter to be $d(i)$. The second part of (2) is just the statement that $s$ and $d$ are group actions on the set of types. (3) rephrased: If $H$ is the subgroup of $S_n$ generated by $s$ and $d$, we can rewrite (3) as the statement that for any element $g$ of $H$, if $g(i) = i$ for some $i$, then $g(i) = i$ for all $i$ (in other words $g=e$). (4) rephrased: $s(i) \neq d(i)$, or equivalently $d^{-1}s(i) \neq i$, for all $i$. (5) rephrased: The orbit of any number $i$ under $H$ is the entire set of types $\{1,2,...,n\}$. We can see right away then that if cousins share mothers who are sisters, they cannot marry, as if the type of the male is $i$, the type of the female is $ddd^{-1}s^{-1}(i) = ds^{-1}(i) \neq i$. This of course is not hard to see without group theory, but we can do more. Plainly if the tribe is going to perpetuate itself there must be more than 1 type. If there are 2 types, then $s$ must be $(12)$ (it cannot be $e$), and likewise for $d$, a contradiction. In the case of 3 types, then it is a matter of running through possibilities to show $s = d^{-1} = (123)$ up to permutation of type. In the case of 4 types, a similar but more lengthy computation yields that up to permutation of type, there are the following four possibilities: 

I like a proof due to Ingham, found at $URL$ (may require a university subscription to access, the title of the article is "A Note on Reimann's $\zeta$ function and Dirichlet's L-functions"). Ingham uses Landau's theorem and a slight generalization of Ramanujan's famous identity $\sum d(n) n^{-s} = \zeta^4(s)/\zeta(2s)$ as follows: For completely multiplicative functions $a(n)$ and $b(n)$ which take on values of modulus only $0$ or $1$, if $g_a(s)$, $g_b(s)$, and $g_{ab}(s)$ are the Dirichlet series with coefficients $a(n), b(n),$ and $a(n)b(n)$, then $$\frac{\zeta(s)g_a(s)g_b(s)g_{ab}(s)}{g_{ab}(2s)} = \sum\frac{1}{n^s}\left(\sum_{d|n}a(d)\right)\left(\sum_{\delta|n}b(\delta)\right),$$ where $\Re(s) >1$. One then specializes to the case that $a(n) = \chi(n)n^{-it}$, and $b(n)$ is the conjugate of $a(n)$. I can't help but mention that one can generalize this identity even further, to the statement that where the sums converge absolutely, $$\sum\frac{1}{n^s}\left(\sum_{d|n}a(d)\right)\left(\sum_{\delta|n}b(\delta)\right) = \zeta(s)\sum_{j,k=1}^\infty \frac{a(j)b(k)}{[j,k]^s},$$ (where $[j,k]$ is the least common multiple of $j$ and $k$) even when $a$ and $b$ are not completely multiplicative and can have any modulus. It is a fun exercise to derive this formula and then use it to derive Ingham's or Ramanujans. 

What is known about the order of $\zeta(1+it)$? Iwaniec-Kowalski gives (pp. 226 citing a result of Vinogradov-Korobov) $|\zeta(1+it)| \lesssim (\log t)^{2/3},$ and oppositely Titchmarsh gives (pp. 188 citing Bohr-Landau) $|\zeta(1+it)| \gtrsim \log \log t$ for infinitely many values of $t$. Is this the limit of our knowledge? Is it conditionally known (or even expected) unconditionally known that $|\zeta(1+it)| = e^{o(\log \log t)}$? [As David points out below, on RH the result in Titchmarsh's book is optimal.] 

We are also interested in the behavior of $F_\alpha(c)$ when $\alpha > 1$ (we really understand matters completely only when $\alpha$ is a positive integer), and any information relevant would be interesting, but the question above is the one that is really pressing. Below are some approximate graphs (generated from $M_{n,\alpha,\alpha}$ with $n=45$) of $F_\alpha(c)$ for $\alpha = .01, .1, .3, .5,$ and $.7$. The graph for $\alpha = .01$ is at the top and $\alpha = .7$ is on the bottom. $c$ of course is the horizontal axis. 

I'll admit from the outset that this question is slightly vague. The actual question appears at the end of the post. The explicit formula of Guinand and Weil can be written in the following way: For 'nice' g (i.e. in $C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$) $$ \sum_\gamma \hat{g}(\gamma/2\pi) - \int_\mathbb{R} \frac{\Omega(\xi)}{2\pi}\hat{g}(\xi/2\pi) d\xi = \int_\mathbb{R} [g(x)+g(-x)] e^{-x/2}d(e^x-\psi(e^x)), $$ (1) where the sum is over those $\gamma$ such that $1/2+i\gamma$ a non-trivial zero of the Riemann Zeta function, $\psi(x) = \sum_{n\leq x} \Lambda(n)$ is the Chebyshev prime counting function, and $$\Omega(\xi) = \tfrac{1}{2}\tfrac{\Gamma'}{\Gamma}(1/4+i\xi/2) + \tfrac{1}{2}\tfrac{\Gamma'}{\Gamma}(1/4-i\xi/2) - \log \pi. $$ Here $\gamma$ can possibly be complex. It is usually proven using a contour integral to capture the zeroes of the Zeta function, then evaluating the integral a different way, making use of the reflection formula along with the arithmetical meaning of $\zeta(s)$ for $\Re s > 1$. (See for instance Montgomery and Vaughan, Multiplicative Number Theory.) $\Omega(\xi)/2\pi \sim \log \xi /2\pi$, and is the mean density for the number of zeroes to occur in the critical strip with real part $\xi$. On the assumption of the Riemann hypothesis, the left hand side takes the nice form: $$ \int_\mathbb{R}\hat{g}(\xi/2\pi)\bigg(\sum_\gamma \delta(\xi-\gamma) - \frac{\Omega(\xi)}{2\pi}\bigg) d\xi. $$ The explicit formula therefore expresses a Fourier duality between the error term in the Chebyshev prime counting function and the error term in the zero counting function. The structural reason why this duality arises is not really apparent to me from the contour integral proof above, and is what I'm really getting at with this question. That said, left at this the question is a little imprecise, and there is something of a lie here because the form of the explicit formula where this becomes apparent involves assuming the Riemann hypothesis. Therefore: Question: Is there a way not making use of entire function theory proper to show that there exist numbers $\gamma$ with $|\Im \gamma| \leq 1/2$, so that (1) is true? A proof using harmonic analysis over the adeles would get bonus points. One reason to be interested in a question like this beyond what I've elaborated above is to ask to what extent explicit formulas like (1) can be replicated for the 'Beurling primes.'
