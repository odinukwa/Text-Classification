I would suggest you Ray, D. Development Economics. It received an endorsement by no less a person than Amyrta Sen, Nobel Prize Winner 1996. 

Yes, he is referring to a movement along the demand line. If the individual purchases less than $Q_0$, than the demand line would be higher than the price for quantities for $Q_0$, this means that the individual values consumption more than its cost (its price). Graphically, you just need to show that for a quantity less than $Q_0$, the demand line is higher than the price, i.e. the individual values consumption more than its cost. 

If you are running a regression analysis I would say you should look first at p-values to check if the explanatory variables you added make sense. I mean if you have a hypothesis about a relationship among two variables and you find the explanatory one not significant (large p-value) I would check for possible mistakes or alternative explanations. It makes sense to have a look at $R^2$ if you are comparing two different specification, it does not really make sense looking at it alone. I have seen many papers, have a look at Nunn, Wantcheckon, (2011) as an example, which have been published on top journals (AER in this case) even with $R^2$ around 16%, not really an high value. 

I intend this as only a comment - it is just too long for the comment section: As it stands, I think you answer your own question. Lucas quantifies the impact of recessionary cycles by calculating how much an agent with a smooth consumption path would need to be compensated in terms of average consumption to instead endure a more volatile consumption path. He expressed the result as a percentage of average annual consumption. Remember, in economics more volatility usually implies more risk. And so what Lucas really did was create a function involving an agent's level of risk aversion that answered the question "how much do I need to compensate this risk averse person to endure 'this much' more risk?". As for your ending bit - you're correct. The idea you're getting at is called stochastic discounting. Essentially - I will pay more to ensure myself against a negative outcome whenever I believe that negative outcome will occur with a high probability relative to when I believe it will occur with a low probability. 

I am a bit confused about the concept of natural real interest rate. I've read that it is the level of real interest rate consistent with the output being at its potential or natural level and with the inflation being static. Is that true? Furthermore, I do not understand how natural real interest rate is able to affect output and natural level of output (then, the output gap) in the usual New Keynesian framework. I mean the dynamic is curve is defined as \begin{gather} x_t=E_t\{x_{t+1}\}-\frac{1}{\sigma}\{i_t-E_t\{\pi_{t+1}\}-r^n_{t}\} \end{gather} where $x_t=y_t-y^n_t$, i.e. the output gap and $r^n_{t}$ is the natural real interest rate. ($\frac{1}{\sigma}$ comes from a CRRA household utility with elasticity $\sigma$). Thus it seems that an increase in the natural real interest rate leads to an increase in current output gap, but how is this true? Does it mean that natural level of output increases more than output? 

There is no trick in that Euler equation. In the New Keynesian model, the Euler equation for consumption is derived from the first order condition for $B_t$, the bond holding. You have to pay attention to the fact that bonds appear in the budget constraint at two moments in time $t$ and $t+1$. Thus you have to compute the foc as \begin{gather} B_t:\beta^t\lambda_tQ_t-\beta^{t+1}\lambda_{t+1}=0 \end{gather} Then substituting $\lambda$ using the foc for $C_t$ and simplifying the betas, you obtain \begin{gather} Q_t=\beta E_t\{\frac{U_{c_{t+1}}}{U_{c_t}}\frac{P_t}{P_{t+1}}\}=0 \end{gather} EDIT: In the NK model, household maximizes its utility function choosing $C_t$, $N_t$ and $B_t$. Thus, you have to compute the FOC for these three variables, i.e. \begin{align} B_t:&\beta^t\lambda_tQ_t-\beta^{t+1}E_t\{\lambda_{t+1}\}=0 \\ C_t:&\beta^tU_{c,t}-\lambda_tP_t=0 \\ N_t:&\beta^tU_{n,t}-\lambda_tW_t=0 \end{align} In order to compute the consumption Euler equation, you need to substitute $\lambda_t$ from the $C_t$ foc into the $B_t$ foc. Then rearranging and simplifying $\beta$ as $\beta^{t+1}/\beta^t=\beta$ you get the equation you wrote above. You get only one $\beta$ because it is constant over time, it is not index by $t$ as the other variables, it is a constant. Thus whatever time is $C$, you will have the same $\beta$. I think it is well explained in Gali too. 

When a country, or perhaps a country's central bank, prints money it is increasing the money supply. When the amount of money available in an economy increases, the value of the currency will decrease. So think about the capital flight from the Euro to the Kroner that is causing the value of that currency to spike. Printing money can basically cause a 'reversal' of sorts. That is, it places downward pressure on the value of the currency. So Denmark's banking authority might have some large stash of Kroner to meet the current demand. It can sell Kroner to counter-balance the new fluctuation in demand to keep its currency's value from spiking. Denmark might make this decision to avoid making its exports more expensive etc. However, it certainly does not have an unlimited supply of money. If it was willing to print an unending amount of money, Denmark's banking authority would actually be manufacturing hyperinflation. I've written this in a non-techinical fashion. Please let me know if you want more details. 

I am working in a New Keynesian context so that the Phillips curve is usually specified as follows \begin{gather} \pi_t=\beta E_t\pi_{t+1}+\kappa x_t \end{gather} where $\beta$ is the discount factor, $\kappa$ is the slope of the curve depending negatively on the degree of price stickiness in the economy and $x_t=y_t-y^N_t$, with $y^N_t$ is the natural (potential) level of output What is driving me crazy is if this curve, specified as above, still make sense when we assume prices are fully flexible. I would say no, because in a flexible price context, the output gap would be zero and the firms would optimize in a static fashion (no need of taking into account expectations of future inflation). But, I have no idea about how to "transform" the model in this direction. 

Mere googling leads me to find a bunch of references about elasticity of marginal utility. Here Professor Acemoglu defines the elasticity of marginal utility as the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (pagg. 17-18). Here you can find a question analogous to yours together with an answer explained in an easier way than Acemoglu's lecture. If you are interested in something more empirical, have a look here: it is a paper by David Evans about the empirical estimation of elasticity of marginal utility in OECD countries. Hope this is enough. If you have other questions, please ask 

I think one thing you can think of is this: Assuming such a thing is possible (Fama may cry never here), one might first define a productive investment as an investment in an asset that is undervalued by the market relative to its fundamental value. The distinction then between this type of investment and a bubble investment is that bubble investments stray far above the fundamental value of an asset. Bubbles are usually made worse than they might have become otherwise whenever trend investors attempt to play bubbles for profit. And it is generally the realization of this fact (that bubbles have pushed securities beyond fundamental valuations)by market participants that crashes the bubble. This paper on the topic is nice. 

The easiest way to frame the issue is by thinking of corporate taxes as a significant cost faced by firms operating in a market. Lowering corporate taxes will attract more corporations to a market. These corporations enter the market because doing so reduces costs, thereby increasing profits (all other things equal). The outcome is that by collecting a little bit less tax revenue from each corporation, a market can retain enough existing participants and attract enough new participants so that the slightly lower tax rate generates more tax revenue than the higher tax rate. That is, governments lower corporate taxes because they believe doing so can actually net them a larger amount of corporate tax revenue. This is a very simplistic answer and there are obviously other ways to frame the question. For example, a government might lower corporate taxes for a specific sector, knowing they will lose out on tax revenues, in an effort to attract more market participants and increase the rate of innovation in that market. 

I have been trying to work this out for quite a while now, but I can't seem to understand how to solve these kind of questions. Any help (or hint) would be highly appreciated. Professor Goodheart's colleague Dr. Kremepu gives 3 midterm exams. He drops the lowest and gives each student her average score on the other two exams. Polly Sigh is taking his course and has a 60 on her first exam. Let $x_2$ be her score on the second exam and $x_3$ be her score on the third exam. If we draw her indifference curves for scores on the second and third exams with $x_2$ represented by the horizontal axis and $x_3$ represented by the vertical axis, then her indifference curve through the point ($x_2; x_3$) = (50; 70) is: 

I'm trying to derive the utility possibility frontier of a economy whose consumption contract curve is $$y_A = \frac {y} {x} x_A$$ and $$y_B = \frac {y} {x} x_B$$where $x_A + x_B = x$ and $y_A + y_B= y$. $$U_i = \sqrt {x_iy_i}$$ While deriving the UPF. they have added up $U_A$ and $U_B$, and I don't understand why. Why do we add up utilities while deriving UPF? (I gave all the details of the question because I'm not sure if they added the utilities only because of the peculiarities of the question or if its an algorithm. ) 

A share or stock is part of an individual company. Unit (Trusts) are a collection of different (and usually related) shares. For example, I am currently investing in a Singapore Equity Fund. And this is known as a Unit Trust. And within the Singapore Equity Fund, my investment is made up of different company shares, e.g. the local bank shares, telecommunication company and some other companies. And these Unit Trusts are usually managed by a Fund Manager who belong to a Fund Management Company (or known as Fund House). And there are many different Fund Management Companies in Singapore with their own expertise and knowledge. Source: here 

In a New Keynesian model, under the assumption of sticky prices, we need to express the monetary policy through an equation in order to close the model made of New-Keynesian Phillips curve and dynamic IS curve. I've read that an easy choice is to use the so called Taylor rule, which express the interest rate as a function of inflation (and possibly a random component). But, I've read that it is a suboptimal choice because it is something exogenous, whereas if we endogenously compute the optimal monetary policy we can reach a better result. My question is why using a Taylor rule when we know it is not optimal to do that?
