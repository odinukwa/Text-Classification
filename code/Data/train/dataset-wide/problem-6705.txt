Those of you who deal with phonetics and phonology of English, and perhaps other languages as well, will surely have read John C. Wells’s article “Syllabification and allophony”, which you can find here: $URL$ There are some things that he discusses in the article that I do not understand. Perhaps you can help me sort them out. For example, the syllabification of words district and extra. He states that district is /ˈdɪs.trɪkt/ and extra /ˈeks.trə/. I understand that district cannot be */ˈdɪst.rɪkt/, because a syllable-final /t/ would be tappable and “glottallable”. However, it doesn’t brake any phonotactic constraints, does it? There are monosyllabic words that can both start and end the way both of those two syllables in this incorrectly syllabified district do. So why does he state that rule (4) is the reason such a syllabification is wrong? On the other hand, if /tr/ is indivisible*, why is district not */ˈdɪstr.ɪkt/? That would be the result of rule (2), correct? Is it because /t/ of /tr/ is aspirated, thus it must begin a syllable, and not end it? Since district comes from Latin dis- and stringō, stringere, from which of these two ⟨s⟩ is /s/ a remnant of and should that have any implications on Wellsean syllabification, i.e. could one posit a possible */ˈdɪ.strɪkt/? If /dr, tr/ are indivisible, why, then, do we have Woodrow as /ˈwʊd.rəʊ/, woodruff as /ˈwʊd.rʌf/, or midriff as /ˈmɪd.rɪf/, but he allows for bedroom to be /ˈbedr.ʊm/ (it can also be /ˈbedr.uːm/, /ˈbed.ruːm/, /ˈbed.rʊm/, according to his Longman Pronunciation Dictionary)? Why hasn’t he allowed for the possibility of /ˈwʊdr.əʊ/, /ˈwʊdr.ʌf/, and /ˈmɪdr.ɪf/ in those entries respectively? I was also wondering why *extra is /ˈeks.trə/ (and where exactly has the syllabification of this word been widely discussed)? If /tr/ is indivisible and a stronger syllables glues onto itself as many phonemes as it can without breaking phonotactic constraints, and petrol is /ˈpetr.əl/, why is extra /ˈeks.trə/ and not */ˈekstr.ə/? Aspiration? Etymology? Both? Something else? Another example is the word monstrous /ˈmɒns.trəs/. If this was ever **/ˈmɒnst‿ər.əs/, and if a stronger syllables attracts onto it as many phonemes as it can without breaking the phonotactic constraints, why does he syllabify it as /ˈmɒns.trəs/? In the end, regarding /dr, tr/, what are those two? Are the phonemes, which I think they’re not, or something else? What is the succinct way that defines them? Are they consonantal clusters that sometimes coalesce into an affricate, making them an allophone not of a single phoneme, but of two when the two meet? Of course, Wellsean syllabification has exceptions, which, I believe, are often a result of how Wells himself feels a word is syllabified. The only one that comes to mind right now is the name Sade, as in – the singer Sade, which is /ˈʃɑː.deɪ/, but there are many more. 

What is the difference between a phonetician and a phonologist? I've seen these two terms somewhere on this site but can't figure out the difference. 

What do you call a pair of words which specifically are either written our sounded out either the same or very similarly across two different languages and have different meanings (perhaps even different technologies) in such languages? 

Wikipedia has a lot of information about sign languages spoken around the world and references them as being spoken by deaf people. What I don't understand is, why wouldn't such languages also be used by mute people (people who are unable to produce verbal sounded speech)? (if such were the case, Wikipedia would clearly state such languages would be also spoken by mute people, so what am I missing?) 

Is there any standard system of romanization for the Thai alphabet (including consonants, vowels, tones, numbers, and their combinations), or is any such romanization system quite arbitrary? Can someone please apply the complete list? Also, are the names of (eg. chicken for the first consonant) etc... given next to the sound of each letter combination pretty standard as part of the way the Thai alphabet is taught? Thank you for your explanation, and sorry if I'm just a day zero beginner. 

Where can I find a set of IPA symbols for Thai language pronunciation and its rules? I know IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) was mainly created to represent the differences in sounds of words spoken in European and other English-speaking countries, but was wondering whether seeing wan IPA chat our something similar for Thai pronunciation could prove useful when learning Thai, and where to find such information.Thanks. Finally, I'm looking for a page where I can actually hear the sound of these symbols so that I can hear and not just read them. Thanks. 

I have found the following partial hiragana chart on t he internet. I was wondering, in IPA, how does ji (じ) differ from dji and zu (ず) differ from dzu? Technically, how are these pronounced? Thanks. Also, with a Japanese input keyboard for Android, how do I enter the latter characters (those prefixed with a 'd' in the picture)? 

These are so called hybrid words. And indeed, in English the majority of such words is of mixed Greek-Latin origin, so there exists a separate term for members of such subset - a Classical compound. 

In Armenian diminutive for personal names are formed by adding 'o' for some short part of the name (I'm intentionally not calling this short form "root" cause it's not necessarily a root), so some examples would be: 

In both Romance and Slavic languages it was borrowed indirectly from Hebrew - in both cases through ancient Greek σάββατον which, in turn, was borrowed to medieval Latin (ecclesiastical Latin, to be more precise) as . 

Yes, this is true and yes, in most cases indefinite articles indeed developed from numerals, as @MGN already said. Not only there's no evidence of articles in PIE, the lack of articles is a more common phenomena than it can be expected to be from the Standard Average European point of view. Here's an interesting quote: 

And so on. My question would be: regarding the fact that these two-languages co-existed for centuries in the same geographical area, which one influenced which one on this aspect. Or, may be, it's just a coincidence? 

No, as far as we know to this moment it is not. The word "один" is related to this PIE root (*h₁ey), and the word "идти" - to this one, which also is transliterated like (*h₁ey), but this is a coincidence. Personally I never've heard such assumption. 

In French, Italian there is a particle ba(h) which is used for exclamation of contempt, excitement, surprise etc. There's pretty similar particle բա in Armenian which is used for expressing amusent as well as for strengthening of affirmation - like in phrase "Ba vontc" ("that's for sure"). On the other hand in Proto-Slavic languages there was a particle "bo" - because - which is used as a compound in many words in Russian, Ukrainian, Polish and other Eastern and Western Slavic languages - abo, libo, lub, ibo. Also in Polish, for example, word "bo" is still used by itself. Moreover, in Lithuanian there's a word "arba" - "or", which is actually exact equivalent of Slavic "або". Are "exclamation" ba and "conjuction" ba related? If yes, what is the etymology of this particle. In book "Indo-European and its closest relatives" it is claimed that the roots of this word can be found as mush as on pre-PIE level. How valid is this claim fron the point of view of modern linguistics?
