This goes back to Jimbo I think. A reference is: "A q-difference analogue of $U(\mathfrak g)$, Hecke algebra and the Yang-Baxter equation'', Lett. Math. Phys. 11 (1986). It has been much studied though, so there are lots of subsequent papers, some of which might be closer to what you are looking for? For example this paper studies an analogue of Schur-Weyl duality for "walled Brauer algebras", and this paper studies a two-parameter version. 

The isn't true: there's a theorem of Stafford which says that any left ideal in the Weyl algebra is generated by two elements so if your claim was true, then the singular support would have to have dimension at least 2n-2 always, which of course isn't the case if n>2. 

The Green function $Q_T(u)$ is the value of the Deligne-Lusztig character $R_T^\theta$ at $u$ (a unipotent element), which turns out not to depend on $\theta$, hence the notation. Conjugacy classes of rational tori in $GL_n$ are parametrized by conjugacy classes in the symmetric group, so this means you have one Green's function for each partition of $n$. For $GL_n$ they are (I assume) what Macdonald calls Green functions (I don't have a copy of the book to hand), but regardless they can be made combinatorially explicit in various ways. To relate to Macdonald's book/Green's paper, you can use the orthogonality formulas for the $R_T^1$s to show that taking appropriate linear combinations of them according to character values of the symmetric group, you get an orthonormal set of class functions. You can then check that these are irreducible characters, and in fact they are just the representations of $GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ which you get as constituents of $\text{Ind}_B^G(1)$, where $B$ is the set of upper triangular matrices, the so-called unipotent representations. Thus the change of basis matrix for class functions on the unipotents between Green functions and irreducible unipotent characters is just given by the character table of $S_n$. I think this is worked out in the book by Digne and Michel in one of the later chapters on examples, if you need a reference. 

I would like to find some notes (or book), that explains on a very basic level what is a line bundle on a complex projective manifold. Maybe even, what is a line bundle on $\mathbb CP^n$. It seems to me that in a "usual" algebro-geometric approach line bundles come quite late, only after one defines what is a sheaf, ect. I wonder if this can be explained in "quicker" way? 

I am aware that the following result is a classical one (by now). But I am not able to understand who proved it. What should be a proper reference to this statement? Theorem. Let $M^4$ be a compact symplectic manifold with $\pi_1\ne 0$ and let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be two symplectic spheres embedded in it with $S_1^2=S_2^2=0$. Then $S_1$ and $S_2$ are symplectically isotopic in $M^4$. In other words, is there an article/book (say pre 2000) claiming that any two symplectic spheres with zero self-intersection in an irrational ruled (non-minimal) surface are symplectically isotopic? 

Let $M$ be a compact connected manifold with an $S^1$-action. Suppose that $S^1$ has a fixed point in $M$. Is it true that $\pi_1(M)=\pi_1(M/S^1)$? I is there some reference or a short proof of this fact? PS. I am sorry for amending the question. In reality I only want to know that the kernel of the map $\pi_1(M)\to \pi_1(M/S^1)$ is finite. Is at least this fact true? 

On a summer school for undergraduate and graduate students Okounkov gave the following exercise (without hints): Prove that the Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb C^2$ is smooth. Only a definition of the scheme was given. I don't really understand how to solve this exercise. I remember Beauville was saying in his course on a school at Lac de Garde (while he was commenting page 14 here: $URL$ that he is not aware of an elementary proof of the fact that the Hilbert scheme of points on a smooth surface is smooth (a standard proof uses $Ext$ groups). So I would like to know, who is right, Okounkov or Beauville? (or maybe both?...) 

As you remark, Sturmian words (encoding horizontal and vertical steps when approaching optimally from below a line of given slope by a discrete path (with steps $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$) of $\mathbb Z^2$) solve the problem if either $p_{00}$ or $p_{11}$ is zero. In the general case, I have the impression that one can combine two Sturmian words as follows: Suppose $p_{00}\geq p_{11}$. We construct first a Sturmian sequence with the correct relative proportions $p_{00}/(1-p_{11})$ and $p_{01}/(1-p_{11})$ of subwords $00$ and $01$ (or $10$). We now replace the isolated $1'$s by $1^a$ and $1^{a+1}$ using a suitable Sturmian word in order to get the correct amount of $11$'s (the correct relative frequencies should be $p_{01}/(1-p_{00})$ and $p_{11}/(1-p_{00})$, I guess). Since this does not alter the relative proportion of subwords $00$ and $01$, this should do the job and the final word has recurrent properties. 

Suppose $A$ and $B=A^{-1}$ have all coefficients in $\mathbb N$. Then the same is true for the symmetric matrix $AA^t$ and its inverse $B^t B$. Since these matrices are of the form $AA^t=I+a$ and $B^tB=I+b$ with $a$ and $b$ having coefficients in $\mathbb N$ and $I$ denoting the identity matrix, we get $a=b=0$ by considering the product $(I+a)(I+b)=I+a+b+ab$. The matrix $A$ is thus an orthogonal matrix with coefficients in $\mathbb N$, which implies that it is a permutation matrix. 

Denoting by $A$ the $n\times n$ adjaceny matrix (with loops contributing $1$ on the diagonal) of a finite graph $\Gamma$ with $n$ vertices, a necessary condition for $A$ to be weighted-regular is the fact that the all $1$ vector $I_n=(1,1,\dots,1)$ of dimension $n$ is in the image of $A$. This is the case if and only if $I_n$ is orthogonal to the kernel $\ker(A)$ of $A$. If this necessary condition holds, the vector $I_n$ can be written uniquely as $$I_n=\sum_{\lambda\in{\mathrm Spec}(A)\setminus\{0\}}v_\lambda$$ where the sum is over all distinct non-zero eigenvalues of $A$ with $v_\lambda$ denoting the orthogonal projection of $I_n$ onto the eigenspace of eigenvalue $\lambda$. The graph $\Gamma$ is now weighted-regular if and only if the affine subspace $\sum_{\lambda}\frac{1}{\lambda}v_\lambda+\ker(A)$ (corresponding to the set of preimages of $I_n$) intersects the open cone $({\mathbb R}_{>0})^n$ of vectors having only strictly positive coordinates. This last condition can be checked by linear programming by optimizing an arbitrary linear functional (eg. the coordinate sum) on $\ker(A)$ subject to the condition that all coefficients of the solution are strictly greater than the corresponding coefficients of $I_n-\sum_{\lambda}\frac{1}{\lambda}v_\lambda$. In particular, a graph $\Gamma$ with invertible adjacency matrix $A$ is weighted-regular if and only if all coordinates of the vector $\sum_\lambda \frac{1}{\lambda}v_\lambda$ are strictly positive and these coordinates give the unique set of weights (up to multiplication by a positive constant) turning $\Gamma$ into a weighted-regular graph. This is of course nothing else than Kristall Cantwell's remark, fleshed out. 

I believe that the following questions are very basic, but I don't know how to get a reference. Consider a curve in the plane $C\in \mathbb C^2$ with a singularity at $0$ and suppose it is unibranch at zero (i.e. analytically irreducible). Then I guess one should be able to define "arithmetic genus defect" of the curve at $0$. Namely if one smooths analytically $C$, its geometric genus will grow by a positive number (in case of the cusp $x^2=y^3$ it will grow by one), and let us call this number the defect. Question 1. Is this defect well defined (independent of a smoothing)? How is it called and how one should calculate it (say it terms of the local ring of $C$ at $0$)? Question 2. Suppose we have an explicit local parametrisation of $C$ at $0$, say by two holomorphic functions $f(t), g(t)$ (polynomials if you wish). Is it possible to find this "defect" as a certain invariant of this pair of functions at $t=0$? Question 1 is settled in the answer of unknown and Question 2 in comments to it by Roy and Vivek 

This questions if related to a cute article of Beauville where he proves in particular the following theorem: $URL$ Theorem.− A smooth complex projective hypersurface of dimension $\ge 2$ and degree $\ge 3$ admits no endomorphism of degree $>1$. Here "endomorphism" means a holomorphic self-map and the proof of the theorem uses algebraic geometry bien sure:) . But the following question is not mentioned in the article: Question. What are smooth complex projective hypersufaces in $\mathbb CP^n$ that admit topological self-maps of degree $>1$? I wonder if this question is trivial and completely answered for $n>2$? Added. The comment of algori settles this question (apperently). But still I wonder for example how one can construct a self-map of a quintic in $\mathbb CP^3$ of degree $>1$. 

A couple of things: Springer theory does not give a bijection between orbits of the nilpotent cone and irreducible representations of the Weyl group outside of type A: in general, there is an injective map from the irreducible representations of the Weyl group to the set of equivariant irreducible local systems on nilpotent orbits (but it is not necessarily surjective). For the action on other representations, there is a paper by Misha Grinberg called "A generalization of Springer theory using nearby cycles" which generalizes Springer theory to a class of polar representations V, which behave sufficiently like case of the adjoint representation. From this point of view, you do not need the resolutions. In fact in a sense his results show that sometimes there cannot be a resolution: he proves that the Fourier transform of the nearby cycles sheaf is an intersection cohomology sheaf, and this is the analogue of the sheaf you get from the Grothendieck resolution in the ordinary Springer theory. However, in the case of symmetric spaces, he also computes the monodromy action on the local system determining the intersection cohomology sheaf, and shows that it does not have to be semisimple. A consequence of this is that the local system cannot arise from a finite cover, and thus does not come from some sort of resolution. A similar phenomenon was notice by Grojnowski in his thesis on character sheaves on symmetric spaces. 

Another way of saying essentially the same thing as Kevin has is the following: when do you call a map of algebraic groups a quotient? Considering just the maps $x \mapsto x^n$ from the multiplicative $\mathbb G_m$ to itself. The quotient group functor isn't representable, because if it was, then we would have $$R^\times/(R^\times)^n \to S^\times/(S^\times)^n$$ corresponding to $Hom(A,R) \to Hom(A,S)$ and this latter is clearly injective if $R \to S$ is, while the former isn't (just take $R,S$ fields and $S$ algebraically closed say, e.g. $\mathbb R$, and $\mathbb C$ with $n=2$). So to stay in the land of algebraic group functors, you probably want to declare $x \mapsto x^n$ a quotient map. One solution to this is to say $G\to H$ is onto if the associated pullback on functions is an injection (as it certainly is for the power maps). Then you can translate this into the context of group functors by showing that this is the same as requiring that the group functors are "surjective" after a finitely generated faithfully flat extension, i.e. given $h \in H(R)$ the quotient, I can find such an extension $S$ of $R$ and a $g \in G(S)$ mapping to the image of $h$ in $H(S)$. 

Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two smooth curves of degrees $m$ and $n$ in $\mathbb CP^2$. By Bezout's theorem the maximal number of their intersections is $mn$. I wonder if the minimal possible number is known for all pairs $(m,n)$? In particular for which pairs $(m,n)$ there can be exactly one point of intersection? 

A Log del Pezzo surface is a normal complex surface with ample anti-canonical bundle and at worst quotient singularities. It is known that such surfaces are rational. This is proven, for example, here (Lemma 1.3): $URL$ I would like to know if there is some place with a short and clean exposition of this result, or maybe you can explain an idea of a proof? Note, that it is not hard to see that a Log del Pezzo has Kodaira dimension $-\infty$, so to prove that it is rational it is enough to prove that it has a trivial fundamental group. 

Suppose that $(M,\omega)$ is a (connected compact) symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action given by Hamiltonian $H$. I would like to find a reference for the fact that every level set of $H$ is connected. I tried to find this statement in McDuff Salamon, but could not. 

Take $\mathbb C^2$ with coordinates $(z,w)$. Suppose that $J$ is a $C^{\infty}$ almost complex structure on $\mathbb C^2$ such that the line $w=0$ is $J$-holomorphic and $J(0,0)$ is given by $(z,w)\to (iz,iw)$. Suppose that there is a smooth function $f(z):\mathbb D\to \mathbb C$ defined on a unit disk $\mathbb D$ such that the graph $(z,f(z))\subset \mathbb C^2$ is a $J$-holomorphic subvariety of $(\mathbb C^2, J)$ (we don't assume that $z\to (z,f(z))$ is a $J$-holomorphic map). Question. Is it true that there is $n$ and a constant $c\in(0,1)$ such that $c|z^n|<|f(z)|<\frac{1}{c} |z^n|$ for sufficiently small $z$? Remark. The statement is trivial in the case when $J$ coincides with the standard complex structure on $\mathbb C^2$. This question is a follow up to Two smooth tangent almost complex curves in a $4$-manifold 

I'm not sure if this is really an answer, or more a response to David's, since I've not thought about this before. The idea to look for a Beilinson-Bernstein type theorem seems right, but there is an elegant paper of Kashiwara and Lauritzen which shows that $D$-affinity fails for $SL_5$ in all positive characteristics by studying the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(2,5)$, and considering the local cohomology of the subvariety of planes which intersect a given plane nontrivially. This variety has nontrivial local cohomology in dimension 3. Perhaps a derived Beilinson-Bernstein theorem is the thing to seek then? On the other hand Lauritzen, Pedersen and Thomsen show that $D$-modules on the flag variety are more straight-forward than you expect from characteristic $0$: they show that the local cohomology sheaves $\mathcal H_Y^c(X)$ (where $Y$ is a Schubert variety in the flag variety $X$ and $c$ is the codimension of the $Y$ in $X$) are simple, and the corresponding local cohomology of Schubert cells (which are the Vermas in the characteristic zero theory) are multiplicity free. In other words "Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials" in this theory would all be of the form $q^k$. 

The basis $\dot{B}$ is usually hard to compute, in the same way the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis for the Hecke algebra is. On the other hand, at least for type A, there is another way to get at this basis via what you might call "quantum Schur-Weyl duality": there's a geometric construction of finite dimensional quotients of the quantum group of type sl_n due to Beilinson-Lusztig-MacPherson, each of which has a canonical basis. More recent work of Lusztig, Ginzburg and Schiffmann-Vasserot showed that these finite dimensional quotients could be put into a compatible family, from which you can recover the whole modified quantum group, and it's canonical basis. How much more explicit this realization is probably depends on what sort of question you're interested in I imagine. With regard to the crystal structure, there's a paper of Kashiwara "Crystal bases of modified quantized enveloping algebras" in Duke which studies this. He shows that the crystal structure reflects the $B\times X\times B$ parametrization you mention, and investigates a crystal basis of a "dual algebra" (a kind of quantum coordinate algebra) for which the crystal structure is a kind of Peter-Weyl theorem (at least for the finite type case). Lusztig investigates something similar in his book. 

Given a non-integral real $\alpha$, is there an entire (see $URL$ function $h(x)$ such that $x^{-\alpha}h(x)\longrightarrow 1$ for $x\rightarrow+\infty$ (with $x$ real non-negative)? Clearly, such a function if it exists is not unique since $h(x)+e^{-x}$ and similar functions work also. 

André Henriques answer for a closed set $C$ can easily be improved to $C^\infty$ by considering $e^{1/(\alpha-x)+1/(x-\beta)}$ if $x\not\in C$ where $\alpha$ is the supremum of all elements $< x$ in $C$ (and $\alpha=-\infty$ if $C$ contains no elements which are $< x$) and where similarly $\beta$ is the infimum of all elements $> x$ in $C$ (respectively $\beta=\infty$ if $C$ contains no elements $> x$). 

An unelegant solution (to the described problem) which works in principle: Transform everything in algebraic equations, eg. by setting $A=(-1,0),B=(1,0),C=(x_C,y_C),M=(x_M,y_M),\dots$, $x_C^2+y_C-1=0,x_M=1/2(1+x_C),\dots$ and compute a Groebner basis. Doing a few numerical examples proves then that there is at least a large enough set of real solutions. This is of course ugly but has the advantage that you can give the heavy work to a machine. 

The lattice polytop $[0,n_1]\times[0,n_2]\times\dots\times[0,n_{d-1}]\times[0,1]$ contains $(n_1+1)(n_2+1)\cdots(n_{d-1}+1)2$ integral points on the boundary and no integral points in its interior. Its number of vertices, $2^d$, is however bounded by a function depending only on its dimension $d$. Does there exist a sequence of convex $d-$dimensional lattice-polytops without interior lattice points and more and more vertices? Remarks: (1) The answer is no in dimension $2$. (2) This question is motivated by a result of Lagarias-Ziegler who showed that the volume (and thus the number of vertices) of a convex $d-$dimensional lattice polytop is bounded if it contains exactly $k>0$ interior lattice points. If no sequence as above exist, then the condition on the existence of $k$ interior lattice points can perhaps be modified into a condition on the number of integral vertices (which has to be sufficiently large) and integral boundary points.
