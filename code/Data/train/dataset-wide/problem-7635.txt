Recall the product lemma from Easton's famous paper, which tells us something about when we have a forcing notion (which may be a proper class) that splits as a product with one factor $\lambda^+$-cc and the other factor $\lambda$-closed. The proof that in the resulting model the powerset of $\lambda$ can be calculated using the $\lambda^+$-cc forcing alone uses Replacement in Easton's paper, and in Jech's formalism (at the above link) he states it as being about functions from $\lambda$ to the base model $M$. Is there a published proof that doesn't use either Replacement or the trick of talking about functions to the universe, that is, a direct proof of the result about the powerset of $\lambda$? If not, can someone supply one? 

OK, here's a first attempt, with a small gap. The ind-scheme $\mathbb{P}^\infty$ is the quotient of the ind-scheme $\mathbb{A}^\infty \setminus\lbrace 0\rbrace = \lim_{n\to \infty}\mathbb{A}^n\setminus\lbrace0\rbrace$ by the free action of $\mathbb{G}_m$, so here is a weak equivalence of simplicial presheaves $N(\mathbb{G}_m \curvearrowright\mathbb{A}^\infty \setminus\lbrace 0\rbrace) \to \mathbb{P}^\infty$, where the source is the nerve of the action groupoid and the target is the constant simplicial presheaf. I say 'weak equivalence', but more properly this is I guess a weak equivalence in the local projective model structure on simplicial presheaves, where 'local means whatever topology the $\mathbb{G}_m$ bundle over $\mathbb{P}^\infty$ is trivial in (I'm guessing étale, or possibly even Zariski). Next, there is a map of simplicial sheaves $N(\mathbb{G}_m \curvearrowright\mathbb{A}^\infty \setminus\lbrace 0\rbrace) \to B\mathbb{G}_m$, which I conjecture is a weak equivalence in the $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy sense. This should be true as long as $\mathbb{A}^\infty \setminus\lbrace 0\rbrace \to \ast$ is a $\mathbb{A}^1$-weak equivalence. This last statement is the one that I feel is a gap, in that I have no clue how to prove this, only argue by analogy with the differential geometric or topological case. The span $$ \mathbb{P}^\infty \leftarrow N(\mathbb{G}_m \curvearrowright\mathbb{A}^\infty \setminus\lbrace 0\rbrace) \to B\mathbb{G}_m, $$ assuming that one can fill in the gap, should represent an $\mathbb{A}^1$-weak equivalence, and my guess, based on the assumption that the $\mathbb{G}_m$ bundle over $\mathbb{P}^\infty$ trivialises in the étale (resp. Zariski) topology, is that this construction uses the étale (resp. Zariski) site. 

However, I would be surprised if the notion wasn't some kind of folklore. What other sources apart from those I've cited mention $\Pi_2(X)$? Bénabou doesn't mention bigroupoids in his paper introducing bicategories, so a subsidiary question is: when were bigroupoids were first mentioned? 

One property that $Top_{cgwh}$ has (if we let $Top_{cgwh}$ be the full subcategory of $Top$ consisting of compactly generated, weakly Hausdorff spaces) that $Grp$ doesn't is cartesian closedness: the hom-set $Grp(G,H)$ is not a group. Another property that $Top$ has that $Grp$ doesn't is an initial object distinct from its final object, but these are just off the top of my head. But thinking of these functors as being intrinsic to $Top$ is a small mistake, because $Top$ is just a presentation of the $(\infty,1)$-category of homotopy types, and these functors are really giving invariants of homotopy types. This doesn't really answer your question, but I hope it indicates that the sort of functor you are looking for won't be anything like cohomology or homotopy. 

This destroys the inequality $\kappa < 2^{cf(\kappa)}$ resulting from König's theorem (I like to call this inequality König's corollary), for the notion of cofinality in the original question. 

Assembling comments of Neil Strickland and Allen Knutson, we have that $\varepsilon_3$ is just the standard generator $\iota_3\colon S^3 \stackrel{\sim}{\to} SU(2)$, since the inclusion $SU(2) \to SU(4)$ induces an isomorphism on $\pi_3$. This is shown using the long exact sequence in homotopy groups, and the fact $S^5\times S^7$ is 3-connected. 

This may be a little tangential to the original question, but it avoids Choice, and 'works with all choices at once'. In Makkai's theory of anafunctors, one recognizes that 'the' functor $C^J \to C$ giving a limit of a (small) diagram $J \to C$ is only really defined via universal properties, and so requires Choice. However, there is a unique anafunctor $C^J$ ⇸ $C$ - which is a span $C^J \leftarrow D \to C$ where the left-pointing leg is fully faithful and surjective on objects - expressing the limit. The category $D$ is defined to consist of limit cones and maps between them. The functor to $C^J$ forgets the vertex of the cone, and the functor to $C$ forgets the diagram and keeps the vertex. The universal properties take care of functoriality, and if one can choose a limit for each diagram, or there are canonical constructions of limits, then this can be converted into an ordinary functor. The cost of working with anafunctors rather than functors is that one gets a bona fide bicategory of categories, rather than a 2-category, but otherwise the whole theory of categories goes through. 

EDIT: I'm bumping this, because I'm still curious, and because I have a relative consistency result over the theory of a well-pointed topos with NNO, and I am wondering how much baggage I save by not assuming AC in the base model (I'm not using AC in the proof either). Gödel's well-known proof of the implication $Con(ZF) \Rightarrow Con(ZFC)$ used the construction of the inner model $L$ in $ZF$ to get a model of $ZFC$ (and in fact much more). However such a construction is not (immediately) available in a category-theoretic approach to set theory. In particular, given a well-pointed topos with NNO, which is the set theory ETCS minus the axiom of choice, I wonder whether there is any way to construct a model of ETCS. On the face of it, it doesn't seem likely, as objects of the given topos are quite amorphous. The only thing I can think of (admittedly I haven't tried very hard) is by passing to a model of ZF via pure sets, constructing $L$, and then taking the category of sets of $L$. But this is somewhat unsatisfactory, as it leaves the comfy realm of categories and heads out into material set theory. So: 

There is a version of the Eilenberg-Watts theorem for $C^\ast$-algebras, where functors between appropriate module categories correspond to what are called 'correspondences' of $C^\ast$-algebras. These are one-sided Hilbert modules for one of the $C^\ast$-categories together with an action on this module by the other $C^\ast$-algebra. In the literature one finds a (weak) (2,1)-category where the objects are $C^\ast$-algebras, 1-arrows are correspondences, and 2-arrows are unitary intertwiners. However, clearly if one thinks of the categories of representations, the appropriate functors between such categories, and the natural transformations between these functors, then one could have non-invertible 2-arrows. 

Well, one would just add a just strong enough instance of replacement, or the consequence one actually needs, to the assumptions of the theorem one was proving. For instance, one could take the existence of $\aleph_\omega$ as an assumption (like a large cardinal) rather than proving it exists. There are models of ETCS in which this exists and in which it doesn't. In this instance, one is just lowering the level at which one considers a cardinal 'large'. I'm reminded of McLarty's recent work on weak set theories, and doing algebraic geometry in them. One can prove strong results about cohomology, but can't prove the existence of an uncountable ring like $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. He says you can just simply posit the existence of such a thing on top of the weak set theory, and then all the theorems go through. Of course, in set theory there are a whole stack of results that rely on the strength of ZFC beyond ETCS, and it would entail a whole lot of reverse mathematical effort to find out what is actually necessary for swathes of theory, that many would say it is easier to just assume what ZFC gives you. But it isn't strictly necessary, just a lot easier. 

Set depends on your background choice of set theory (if that is how you are doing things). Your question has been answered, but I hope this will clear up a few loose ends. Given two models $M_1$, $M_2$ of ZF(C), you get two categories $Set_1$ and $Set_2$. Now both of these are cartesian closed, so that the hom-objects of $Set_i$ are objects of $Set_i$. 

(Edit: I was being a bit free and easy below. Dold-Kan is rigorous for $\infty$-groupoids = Kan complexes, but I'm only guessing when I say I can sweep details aka weak complicial sets under the carpet. I'll leave the answer as is, in case anyone else can fill in details) If we take 'strict linear $\infty$-categories to mean '$\infty$-categories internal to $Ab$', and we take '$\infty$-category' to mean simplicial set (I'm sweeping some details under the carpet, but really you'd want to consider (weak) complicial sets to make this rigorous), then this is nothing but the Dold-Kan correspondence: simplicial abelian groups are the same thing as non-negatively graded chain complexes. Note that the simplicial set underlying a simplicial abelian group is automatically a Kan complex, so really this reduces to talking about $\infty$-groupoids. If you want $\infty$-categories enriched in something linear, rather than internal categories, then you'd want some sort of weak enrichment in simplicial abelian groups. It sound like you might want some sort of $E_\infty$-category, but this is certainly not equivalent to chain complexes. 

The short answer is, because I don't have time to write a full answer, is that the fundamental group is composed of equivalence classes of formal composites of paths and elements of the arrow space of the corresponding groupoid. If $p\to[0,1]$ is a cover by closed intervals only overlapping on boundaries (i.e. a partition), then such a formal composite is a functor $p\to G$. Geometric realisation makes this an element of your definition. Moerdijk and Mrcun (see e.g. this) do it this way, as does Hellen Colman (and so do I, see chapter 2). I gather the idea goes back to Haefliger. Really orbifolds are objects of a bicategory (see Lerman's paper on this), and this bicategory can be described using anafunctors, and anafunctors from $[0,1]$ to an orbifold are equivalent to what I described above. EDIT: To answer the second part of question 1, the geometric realisation of the groupoid associated to the open cover of a manifold is (at least) homeomorphic to the manifold, hence the fundamental group computed the two different ways are isomorphic. To see this via the description I give, one has to know that the 2-functor $\pi_1\colon OrbifoldGpd_* \to Grp$ factors through the bicategory of pointed orbifolds as constructed by e.g. Lerman (and many many others), i.e. sends Morita/weak equivalences to isomorphisms of groups. The open cover groupoid is weakly equivalent to the manifold thought of as a groupoid, and the description of the fundamental groupoid I give, in the case of a manifold (or space) is naturally isomorphic to the usual description. To give a pointer for question 3, Moerdijk and Mrcun cover this in their chapter in this book, although possibly using sheaves instead of covering spaces. I claim (in answer to the first part of question 1) that this (the definition given in the question) is a reasonable definition precisely because of its relation to the definition I give. I should probably discuss things like the homotopy type of topological stacks (see work by Noohi) and the relation between topological groupoids and topological stacks, various methods for computing with these and so on. But if the first paragraph is incomprehensible, then perhaps the long version will be as well :-) 

David C answered the question pretty thoroughly, but let me add a few more details. You mention that you want to restrict to etale groupoids. This is an important distinction. Without some sort of condition on the source and target maps you do not have the connection to topological stacks. And given this condition, it is important that this is compatible with the pretopology $J$ that you are using, in the sense that given a topological groupoid $X$ of the kind you are interested in (etale, or Hurewicz, or proper, or...) and a $J$-cover $U\to X_0$, the induced groupoid with objects $U$ and arrows $U^2\times_{X_0^2} X_1$ needs to also be of the kind you are interested in. For conditions like properness (i.e. $(s,t)$ is a proper map) this is automatic. Otherwise there is a subtle interplay between the sort of maps the source and target are, and the pretopology. In terms of 4), given a finitely complete site with a subcanonical singleton pretopology, the category of groupoids in it where the source and target maps are covers, forms a category of fibrant objects. The fibrations are the functors $f\colon E\to B$ for which the canonical map $$ E_1 \to E_0 \times_{f,B_0,s} B_1 $$ is a cover. Then every object is fibrant, because this reduces to the defining condition on the groupoids you are considering. In the case you mention, you are dealing with $Top$ with the pretopology of etale surjections. (This is another reason to restrict to a full sub-2-category of the 2-category of all topological groupoids). Acyclic fibrations are then fully faithful functors where the object component is a cover, and this recovers your characterisation of Morita equivalences in terms of the category of fibrant objects structure. [Aside: This generalises a result by Everaert, Kieboom and van der Linden, where they show that given certain conditions on the ambient category, one gets a Quillen model structure on the category of internal groupoids (this extends earlier work by Joyal and Tierney, I believe). Isomorphism in the homotopy category is the same as being equivalent in the weak 2-category of anafunctors. That anafunctors work in the absence of all finite limits is one motivation for me to consider them. ] Notice you can weaken the condition that the map $t\circ pr_1$ is an etale surjection in David C's definition and still get the same result. It can be a map from any subcanonical singleton pretopology in which open covers are cofinal. Essentially you need to have local sections of $t\circ pr_1$, and you pick the right sort of maps for the application at hand. I should mention there is a newer version of my paper available from my nlab page, which I hope will soon be finished being rewritten and then updated on the arXiv. 

From the point of view of algebraic geometry, the Stacks Project goes to great lengths to make sure everything is a set. In particular the proof of the Reflection principle is unwound (or reverse engineered) to show how instances of it apply in all the cases of interest for categorical constructions involving schemes. Note that the Reflection principle applies involves the sets $V_\alpha$ for limit $\alpha$, hence weak universes. The trick is to write down an explicit (super)exponential function $Bound$ in cardinals (like $\kappa^\kappa$ or $\kappa^{2^\kappa}$) that bounds the growth of the cardinality of the sets necessary to build the various scheme-theoretic constructions on wants, and then use this to show the (small!) category $Sch_\alpha := Sch_{V_\alpha}$ is closed under said constructions (see eg Tag 000R). So for example, one can get existence of pullbacks and $\leq\lambda$-sized colimits (for a regular cardinal $\lambda$ - the notes prove the case of $\lambda = \aleph_0$; a simple modification of the bounding function allows for larger but fixed $\lambda$). Also treated are sites, which of course need to be small to make sheaf categories locally small. All of the above would be in vain, but for the fact that all the constructions one wants to show are in your small category of schemes are in fact performed in the large category $Sch$ of all schemes, and then the theorem shows that these are actually in the (essential) image of $Sch_\alpha \hookrightarrow Sch$, for some appropriate $\alpha$. Given any concrete problem at hand (for instance, discussing the geometry of the compactified moduli stack of $n$-pointed genus-$g$ curves) one only ever starts with a set's worth of data, and so there exists some limit ordinal $\alpha$ such that no consideration of anything other than $Sch_\alpha$ is necessary. In particular, not even full universes are needed in this instance, although using universes might make the book-keeping of the proofs simpler.
