The level of the basic income would have to be set at a level that the majority of the population is still willing to work to get more money than the basic amount, so that required work is still done. (The robots are not going to be taking over all the jobs for some time). From the proposals I have seen, it would be near the poverty level in the developed countries. At that level, I believe there have been enough experiments to validate that most people would want to work to earn more than the minimum. There is a lot of studies showing that many people want to contribute, rather than sit around. The problem may be effect on tax system. This other question on menial tasks seems to be related to your question. If there is no increased taxation to match the increased transfers, inflation would be quite high, given the size of the program. (This is discussed in my answer on the linked question in more detail.) 

The description given implies to me that you want to net the debt holdings between governments only. For example, we would subtract the Chinese government's holdings of U.S. Treasury securities from Chinese debt (and so forth). I am unaware of any such statistics. For the developed countries, the amount of cross-governmental debt holdings is minimal (excluding the ambiguous situation of the European Central Bank). Therefore, such an adjustment would only matter for some developed countries. (The ratio of governmental debt to reserves - which are holdings of developed country debt - is probably looked at by ratings agencies and analysts of developing countries.) A more usual statistic is the net international position, which compares national holdings of foreign assets versus foreign holding of domestic assets. However, this mixes all form of financial assets (debt and equity) and includes both the private sector. The IMF has a standard for reporting the international investment position - link to page The usefulness of such statistics enters the realm of opinion. The main usage of the net international position seems to be the assessment of the odds of a currency crisis; I am unaware of the literature on that subject. As for debt statistics, things like the debt-to-GDP ratio have been greatly discussed. However, I am in the camp that argues that the main "use" of debt statistics has been to generate incorrect forecasts (such as the sustainability of Japanese debt). In general, the link between debt levels and bond yields for the developed countries is questionable, which indicates that bond investors are not greatly impressed by the importance of debt statistics. 

I will note that I am outsider with an interest in macroeconomics, and so this attempt at an answer only applies to the situation in macroecomics as I see it. There are effectively three questions here. 

Declaring bankruptcy is a way to prevent creditors from seizing assets and pursuing lawsuits to recover what they are owed in a piecemeal fashion. It forces all parties to wait for a judgement that determines in what fashion various classes of creditors will be repaid. In the United States, there are two main ways a private firm goes bankrupt - known as Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 (chapters of the bankruptcy act). In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the firm aims to reorganise its debts. The typical outcome is that the original equity holders lose almost all control of the firm as subordinated debtors have their claims converted into equity claims. Other debtors may get paid only a percentage of their claim, or they are given new debt. What happens is determined by negotiation among the major creditors and firm management, overseen by the bankruptcy judge. By lowering the debt burden of the firm (and possibly eliminating pension obligations that cannot be sustained), the firm is hoped to then be profitable, and able to pay back the remaining debts. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a liquididation. All assets are sold, and then the proceeds are used to pay off debtors. However, the liquidation value of most assets is far below their carrying cost on the balance sheet, and so the recovery values are extremely low. The exceptions might be things like real estate, which another firm might be able to use in a more profitable fashion. From the prospective of creditors, the recovery value is typically much lower in a liquidation (barring special cases) - look at the prices for clothing in liquidation sales versus normal retail price. Industrial equipment is specialised, and the buyers know that this is a liquidation, and so they will only bid if prices are extremely cheap versus new equipment. However, if a firm tried Chapter 11 and fails to recover, it is more likely to give up and liquidate the next time. 

We have a portfolio of two assets, with prices $P_1(0), P_2(0)$ at $t=1$. In the next period, their prices are $P_1(1), P_2(1)$. The portfolio market value at $t=0$ is $V(0) = W_1 P_1(0) + W_2 P_2(0)$. The portfolio weights $\omega_i$ (for $i =1,2$) are: $$ \omega_i = \frac{W_i P_i(0)}{W_1 P_1(0) + W_2 P_2(0)}. $$ (We can easily see that $\omega_1 + \omega_2 = 1$.) The return for an asset $R_i$ is given by: $$ R_i = \frac{P_i(1)}{P_i(0)} - 1. $$ The market value of the portfolio $V(1)$ is equal to: $$ V(1) = W_1 P_1(0)(1+R_1) + W_2 P_2(0) (1+R_2). $$ Then, $$ V(1) = (W_1 P_1(0) + W_2P_2(0))(1 + \frac{W_1P_1(0)R_1}{W_1 P_1(0) + W_2P_2(0)} + \frac{W_2P_2(0)R_2}{W_1 P_1(0) + W_2P_2(0)}), $$ $$ V(1) = V(0) (1 + \omega_1 R_1 + \omega_2 R_2). $$ If we define the portfolio return $R$ as $\omega_1 R_1 + \omega_2 R_2$, then $$ V(1) = V(0) (1 + R). $$ This is easier to see if we normalise prices. 

Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is one school of thought (part of post-Keynesian economics) that examines the details of government funding. The argument is that all government spending is effectively "paid for" by issuing money. However, MMT theory also argues that "taxes drive money." In order for government-issued money to have non-zero value in exchange, it is necessary to have taxes, which can only be paid using the government-issued currency. If taxes were abolished, the currency would have zero value (or the prices of goods expressed in the currency unit "go to infinity," which is effectively a hyper-inflation. MMT is popular on the internet; you can easily find a lot of information via a search engine. One academic site is fairly central: $URL$ Of course, not everyone agrees with MMT. But the online debates would cover the issues that this question discusses. As for a consensus view, the argument that taxes are needed for the currency to have value is probably close to consensus, although the wording would be different. The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level is a theory that the expectations of future taxation (primary surpluses) is what drives the value of the currency. If only money were issued, interest rates would have to be 0% forever, and that allegedly gives rise to unstable equilibrium (with prices expected to shoot off to infinity). There is lot of related discussion with regards to the "governmental budget constraint" and "Ricardian/non-Ricardian" policies. Schools of thought that rely on the quantity theory of money would view the rapid creation of money as being a direct cause of hyperinflation.
