In the case the integrals are polynomial in momenta, a generic metric does not poses those (except trivial integrals such as the energy and polynomial functions of the energy). This is a local statement. The formal theorem, which also explains the notion ``generic'' in this case, could be formulated here as following. We call a metric $k$-rigid if it does not admit an nontrivial integral which is polynomial in momenta of degree $k$. Theorem. Any ($C^\infty$) metric can be locally $C^\infty$ perturbed, arbitrary small, such that the obtained metric has a small neigborhood in $C^\infty$ topology such that all metrics in this neighborhood are $k$-rigid. I did not see this theorem or its proof in the literature, may be because its proof is both relatively long and still obvious to experts. It follows from the observation that the system of PDE on the coefficients of the polynomial integral that corresponds to the condition that there exists an integral of degree $k$ is overdetermined and of finite type. Edited a year after the initial answer was posted: Together with Boris Kruglikov, I wrote the proof of the statement above, see $URL$ . In fact, we used slightly different trick from the one explained above and also from the one in the comments/answer of Robert Bryant, which allowed to prove absence of a nontrivial integral of a generic in the $C^2$ (and not $C^\infty$ as in the answer above) topology metric. Actually, a request to write the proof came from Gabriel Paternain, who need the result for his paper $URL$ (joint with H. Zhou). 

Consider a hamiltonian toric acion on a connected real symplectic manifold of dimension 2n. The dimension of the torus, which we denote by $k$, may be less than $n$. The generators of the action will be denoted by $F_1,...,F_k$, they Poisson commute and their differentials are linearly independent at one point, and, therefore, at almost every point of the manifold. The Hamiltonian flow of each of these functions is periodic with period $1$. Then, for any function $H$ of $k$ variables the Hamiltonian flow generated by $H(F_1,..., F_k)$ is Liouville integrable. More precisely, the following statement holds: Theorem. One can find functions $F_{k+1}, ... , F_{n}$ such that all the functions $F_1,..., F_n$ Poisson commute and their differentials are linearly independent at almost every point of the manifold. Question. Do you know a reference where the Theorem above is proved or at least formulated. Background. In the case $k=0$ Theorem is reduced to the following statement: on each symplectic manifold there exists a Liouville-integrable system. This statement is proposition 3.3. of the book "Symplectic geometry" of Fomenko (english version; in the russian version of the book the statement is Proposition 1 in ยง5.1). And in fact the proof of Fomenko can be generalizeed for all $k$, after some work. 

Strassen's factoring algorithm shows that $\text{FACTORING} \in \text{DTIME}(N^{\frac{1}{4}+o(1)})$, but if I'm not mistaken in my analysis it also uses a similar amount of space. By making a trade-off I think it is possible to show $\text{FACTORING} \in \text{DTISP}(N^{k+o(1)}, N^{\frac{1}{2}-k+o(1)})$ for $\frac{1}{4} \leq k \leq \frac{1}{2}$. On the other hand, trial division up to $\sqrt{N}$ demonstrates $\text{FACTORING} \in \text{DTISP}(N^{\frac{1}{2}+o(1)}, \log(N)^{O(1)})$. The only extra space we need is to keep a counter and perform the divisibility test. Is there any deterministic factoring algorithm known to be in $\text{DTISP}(N^{k + o(1)}, N^{o(1)})$ for $k \lt \frac{1}{2}$? I know that there is an $N^{\frac{1}{3}+o(1)}$-time algorithm due to Michael Rubinstein but I can't tell what the space usage would be. This would qualify as an example if the space can be made subexponential. Otherwise, is trial division the best we can do in $N^{o(1)}$ space? We won't be able to prove $\text{FACTORING} \notin \text{DTISP}(\log(N)^{O(1)}, O(\log(N))) = \text{L}$, since that would imply $\text{NP} \neq \text{L}$, an open problem. 

A square-free number with about $n$ bits that we can compute in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time is $n\#$, the primorial. Maybe it can be done in $O(n)$ but that's going to depend even more on the model. We can guess one and almost certainly be right with $\tilde{O}(1)$ time complexity ($O(1)$ if in this model we can check for divisibility by a constant in constant time). But to verify it the best I can think of is subexponential expected time by factoring it with GNFS. Apparently not as of 2011 (see page 3). 

P(A) = It is White's move and White has not yet won in position A. R(A, B) = Position B legally follows in one move from position A. Q(A, 0) = P(A) Q(A, t) = for all B: (R(A, B) -> there exists C: R(B, C) -> Q(C, t - 1)) S(A) = Q(A, 0) and (for all t: Q(A, t) -> Q(A, t + 1)) 

It is an open problem whether or not every polynomial time algorithm can be made $O(\log(n))$-space. Note that every $O(\log(n))$-space algorithm is simultaneously polynomial time because it has $2^{O(\log(n))} = n^{O(1)}$ states. This problem is usually referred to as $\text{P} = \text{L}$. Amazingly, $\text{NP} = \text{L}$ is also open! If we want to talk about particular algorithms and polynomial exponents, we'll also want to get specific about the model of computation. For example, consider the class of models of computation related to a Turing machine by time translations satisfying $T_b \in T_a \cdot S_a^{O(1)}$ and space translations satisfying $S_b \in O(S_a)$. This includes single-tape and multi-tape Turing machines and variations of $\text{RAM}$. We can't say much, since an algorithm with $T_a = S_a$ in one model can have $T_b = S_b^{O(1)}$ in the other, that is, by changing the model an algorithm can be made arbitrarily more space-efficient relative to the time it takes. I posed a related problem recently over on cstheory.SE. 

My example comes from algebraic geometry, specifically in the theory of $\lambda$-rings, which are used in K-theory and representation theory (and possibly other places of which I am unaware). If you look in Lecture Notes in Mathematics 308 $\lambda$-rings and the Reprsentation Theory of the Symmetric Group by Donald Knutson, on pp 27, there is a theorem which is called--quite appropriately--the "Verification Principle", and it is used to do exactly the kind of thing you're asking about. The statement is: If $\mu$ is a $\lambda$-ring operation, then $\mu$ is uniquely a polynomial in the $\lambda$-operations and for any particular polynomial $f(\lambda^1,\lambda^2,\ldots , \lambda^n,\ldots)$ it is sufficient to check that $\mu = f$, operating on a sum $\xi_1+\ldots + \xi_r$ of elements of degree 1, for all $r>0$. If you read the first part of the book (i.e. up to page 27 where you read this) you learn that this is a very handy thing indeed, especially given the generating function polynomials that show up in the study of these objects and how much easier it is to check for things which are polynomials in the $\lambda$-operations (as they are called). It is this that so nicely ties this kind of ring in with the representation theory of the symmetric group, in particular the elementary symmetric functions, as Knutson mentions on p. 10 of the same publication. Another useful technique is one that comes up in algebra, when you check something for general elements by checking on a basis. Eg. testing something for all the elements of your tensor or exterior algebra by testing it on the "pure" or "completely decomposable" tensors which form a generating set. 

Fix an algebraic closure, $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ for the rationals and consider the set, $B_p$, of all places of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ over a fixed (possibly infinite) prime, $p$, of $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $G_\mathbb{Q}=\text{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$. 1: Let $G_\mathbb{Q}$ act on $B_p$ in the natural way. Then what is the structure of the stabilizer, $H_v$ of $v$, for $v|p$ an element of $B_v$? Infinite primes are just embeddings of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ into $\mathbb{C}$, so the case $p=\infty$ is really asking for the stabilizer of the action of left multiplication in $G_\mathbb{Q}$, and for finite $p$ it should be the inverse limit--over finite, Galois extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$--of the decomposition groups of primes $\mathfrak{p}|p$. However, actually getting ones hands on the structure of the stabilizers in question seems to be a hard question, at least no one I've talked to so far seems to know much more than the obvious things stated here. 2: Is is perhaps easier to describe the cosets $G/H_v$? If so, what should they look like? 

Just take $R^4=C^2$ with complex coordinates $z_1=x_1+ i y_1, z_2= x_2 + i y_2$ and the flat metric $-dz_1 d\bar z_1 + dz_2 d \bar z_2$. It has signature (2,2). As the group of isometries take the group of $x_1 $-translations, it preserves the canonic symplectic form $dx_1\wedge dy_1 + dx_2 \wedge dy_2$, and actually is generated by the function $y_1$. The symplectic reduction gives you a positively definite metric $dz_2d\bar z_2$. 

Most (in the natural sense) connections have the same holonomies, namely the maximal one. Most affine connections have the same holonomy, namely the whole $GL_+(n)$. Most Levi-Civita connections have the same holonomy, namely $SO(n)$. Usually if the holonomy group is not the maximal one then there exists an object parallel with respect to the connection (as the parallelity of the metric with respect of the Levi-Civita connection implies that the group of holonomy is $ SO$ and not $GL_+$). One can sometimes reconstruct the nature of the object, say if the holonomy of a Levi-Civita connection is $U(n/2)\subset SO(n)$ then there exists a parallel complex structure, but in most cases one can not say anything more. Well, sometimes one can say more, say if the holonomy of a Levi-Civita connection is as of irreducible symmetric space then the connection is the Levi-Civita connection of this symmetric space, but this is rather an exception than a rule. Added after Oliver reformulated his question: The fiber of $H$ can be quite wierd. It is inifinitely-dimensional. To see this observe that if we change the connections in the interior of cells, we do not change parallel transport along the edges. There is also other freedom since one can change the connection along the first half arbitrary of an edge and conpensate the change in the second half. If the structure group has complicated topology, one can also have some topological effects (which make the moduli space not connected), since a connection gives an imbedding of the 2g-polygon into the Lie group and two such imbedding could be not isotop. 

Well it seems to me the Cauchy-Riemann equations say quite a lot. After all once you know the real and imaginary parts are harmonic, then you know their derivatives are as well, and $$f'(z)=u_x(z)+iv_x(z)$$ so you can do it again. I don't think this is boot-strapping it, but if anyone greater on the complex food-chain cares to disagree, I'm likely retreat quickly at their word. 

The definitions of a divisible group that I have seen all seem to assume abelian is an a priori property of the group. My question is as to whether or not it is known that--given a non-torsion element $\tau\in\mathbf{G}$* and $n\in\mathbb{N}$, do we know if $\exists \tau'\in\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\tau=\tau'^n$? The motivation is that--if this never happens--then the fields $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}^\tau$ should be sort of "maximal" subfields of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ since fixing by the generator would be equivalent to fixed by any power of it. Edit: anon has noted that quotients of divisible groups are divisible, so we can lay to rest that $\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ is not divisible. Can we tell if the opposite is true? I.e. the answer to "can I find such a $\tau '$ given $n$" is "no", but how about the somewhat interesting and related question: If I have a cyclic subgroup of the absolute Galois group, $C=\langle\tau\rangle$ can we find a maximal (with respect to inclusion), cyclic group containing $C$? Of course this is equivalent to a minimal field in a chain, so it seems like if that is so something interesting must be going on. The other related question which deals with the original spirit of the problem is: are there $\tau$ such that $\langle \tau^n\rangle$ fixes $k\subseteq\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ then $\langle\tau\rangle$ fixes $k$? i.e. is $k=\overline{\mathbb{Q}}^\tau$ equivalent to $k=\overline{\mathbb{Q}}^{\tau^n}$ possible for some $\tau$ non-torsion? If so can such elements be characterized? The immediate observation is that, by the FTGT, if we identify $\langle\tau\rangle\cong\mathbb{Z}$ and write $[n]$ for the index $n$ subgroup, that--in the topology of $\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$--necessarily $\overline{[n]}=\overline{[1]}$. I.e. the monothetic group $\overline{[1]}$ has every element is a generator. If $\overline{[1]}$ were connected, of course this would be trivial to check since the set of generators has Haar measure 1 in this case, and a finite index subgroup has positive Haar measure, and so contains a generator, but the topology here is totally disconnected so it is not easy to see one way or the other. *My TeX was not rendering properly when I wrote $\mathbf{G}_\mathbb{Q}$ here, so I just included it as a sidenote rather than have it look like a mess. 

The Collatz conjecture can be expressed in terms of a ruleset in the language $\{x,+,1,\rightarrow,;\}$: 

I'll write $\longrightarrow$ for some standard iterations and $\implies$ for some possibly non-standard iterations. The relaxed Collatz conjecture is that for all $x$, $x \implies 1$. I'll call counterexamples to the conjecture escapees. First of all, since it's a good example of the notation, a lemma: for all $a$, $4 a \implies 9 a + 1$. Proof: $4a \implies 12 a + 1 \longrightarrow 36a + 4 \longrightarrow 18a + 2 \longrightarrow 9 a + 1$. $\square$ Now here is what I will try to show: Theorem: If $x$ is the smallest escapee, then $4x \implies 1$. Proof: By elementary considerations, $x \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. If $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$, then $\frac{2 x - 1}{3} \longrightarrow 2 x \longrightarrow x$. So in this case, $2 x$ can't be an escapee, and neither can $4 x$. The next case is $x \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$. Write $x = 12k+3$. Using the lemma, $4x \implies 27k+7$. Observe that $x > 9k+2 \rightarrow 27k+7$ if $k$ is odd. Now if $x \equiv 15 \pmod{24}$, we also have that $4x \implies 1$. It's also possible that $x \equiv 3 \pmod{24}$. In that case, we have $x = 24 j + 3$ and $x \longrightarrow 27j+4$. This means $j$ cannot be even. So we drill down again, with $x = 48i + 27 \longrightarrow 81i+49$. This means $i$ cannot be odd. But also, $4x = 4(48i+27) \implies 81i + 92$, so if $i$ is even, the next step brings us under $x$. This covers all the $x \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ cases. So far, our result is that if $x \implies 4x$, then $x \equiv 7 \pmod{12}$. Now I'll handle that case. Suppose $x \implies 4x$ and $x = 24k + 7$. Then we have: $4x = 4(24k+7) \implies 9(24k+7)+1 = 216k+64 \longrightarrow 108k+32 \longrightarrow 54k+16$. But also, $18k+5 \longrightarrow 54k+16$. This means $18k+5$ is an escapee too, but it can't be, since it's less than $x$. So the hypothesis is false and we have $x = 24k + 19$ instead. Now, consider: $4x = 4(24k+19) \implies 216k + 172 \longrightarrow 108k + 86 \longrightarrow 54k + 43 \longrightarrow 162k + 130 \longrightarrow 81k+65$. By similar reasoning, $k \neq 3 \pmod{4}$, or else we can continue the chain two more steps to get an escapee less than $x$. Finally, $x = 24k+19 \longrightarrow 72k+58 \longrightarrow 36k + 29 \longrightarrow 108k + 88 \longrightarrow 54k + 44 \longrightarrow 27k + 22$. shows that $k$ can't be even, and substituting $k = 4 j + 1$: $27k + 22 = 108j + 49 \longrightarrow 324j + 148 \longrightarrow 162j + 74 \longrightarrow 81j + 37 < x$ completes the proof, since that's all the cases. $\square$ Corollary: if the Collatz conjecture is false and the smallest counterexample leads back to itself then that number is not a counterexample to the relaxed Collatz conjecture. In other words, if $y$ is the smallest number satisfying $\neg(y \longrightarrow 1)$, then $y \longrightarrow y$ implies $y \implies 1$. This is a weaker version of what I originally thought I had proved. Corollary: If $4x$ is an escapee, then there is an escapee smaller than $x$. This suggests to me a recursive descent strategy where we attempt to show $z \implies 4k < 4x$. But it's not clear if number-crunching will get us anywhere further.
