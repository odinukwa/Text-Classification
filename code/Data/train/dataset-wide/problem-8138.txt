I think this may be an example: Consider the map from $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^2$ given by the linear map $f_\theta: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ that takes the basis vectors $e_1, e_2$ to $e_1, e_2^\theta$, where $e_2^\theta$ is $e_2$ rotated by $\theta$. This should be a map of bundles over $S^1$, but the kernel isn't a subbundle as it has no trivializing neighborhood around, say, $\theta =\pi/2$. 

Let $\pi$ be the fundamental group of $B$ and $R$ be whatever ring of coefficients you'd like. Suppose $B$ admits a universal cover $\tilde{B}$. Then there is a spectral sequence $\text{Ext}^{*,*}_{R[\pi]}(H_*(\tilde{B}), H^*(F))\Rightarrow H^*(B; \underline{H^*(F)})$. With field coefficients, say $k$, you can rephrase this as saying that the derived tensor product $H^*(\tilde{B}) \otimes^{\mathbb{L}}_{k[\pi]} H^*(F)$ serves as an upper bound for the cohomology $H^*(B; \underline{H^*(F)})$. Now, there is certainly a map from $H^*(B) \otimes^{\mathbb{L}}_{k[\pi]} H^*(F)$. If the order of $\pi$ is finite and invertible in $k$ then we even get a map from $H^*(B) \otimes_{k[\pi]} H^*(F) = H^*(B) \otimes (H^*(F)/\pi)$ to $H^*(B; \underline{H^*(F)})$. Unfortunately, even in this case I see no reason for that map to be surjective in general. 

Here a "strict" application means that the statement of the problem can be formulated without using any algebro-geometric language (stick to rings and modules and complexes, etc.) but a solution either requires or is very naturally obtained by using algebro-geometric language. I don't know examples of this phenomenon off the top of my head, but here are two examples from algebraic topology: 

Dan Dugger has wonderful mostly-finished notes on this here: $URL$ It's written for topologists, very clearly, and he does a great job of giving both physical and "mathematical" explanations/intuitions. Really well done. 

In order for this to even start making sense there would have to be some sense in which an analog of Fubini's theorem works for twisted products. I'd also need the Pfaffian to satisfy the identity that I want it to satisfy in this case (which I think follows from the fact that if we have a direct sum of matrices, $A \oplus B$, then $Pf(A \oplus B) = Pf(A)Pf(B)$.) So: is there any way to actually make this argument stand? (I think that it would work for a trivial fibration, but that's no fun.) So far I only know how to prove this product formula using a spectral sequence, so it'd be cool if this were a legitimate way of visualizing it in this special case. Updates: First of all, it turns out that there is a Fubini's theorem for local products (see Generlized Curvature by Jean-Marie Morvan). Instead of Step 2 I think what we want is to put a metric on $M$, and then put metrics $h_x$ on $F_x$ (the fiber over $x$) that somehow 'varies smoothly with $x$' (hopefully that's possible) and then define a metric on $\widetilde{M}$ by breaking every vector into its horizontal and vertical pieces and applying the metric on $M$ and $F$ separately. Pretty much by definition this should make $\Omega_{\widetilde{M}}$ be the matrix $\Omega_M \oplus \Omega_F$ (I think?) and then the result should follow. So I still have details to work out- and I'll keep thinking about it, but in the meantime if any of you have seen this before, then a reference would be really helpful! I'm afraid I've done something silly, or I'm assuming something I can't... 

I apologize for asking a big list question, I've tried to avoid doing so for a while. I'll give my justification in a moment. The question is as follows: 

As requested, here's a little more detail in the form of an answer. Disclaimer: Let me start by saying that it'll be easier for me to talk about stable homotopy groups instead of homotopy groups, just because that's all I know about. By that I mean, I'm not gonna define, say, $\pi_{1/2}S^3$ but rather $\pi_{N+1/2}S^{3+N}$ when $N$ is really big. Throughout I will be lazy and write $\pi_kX$ for what should really be the stable value of $\pi_{k+N}\Sigma^NX$. Feel free to ignore this. Someone who knows more about this than I do can come around and fill in how to translate this back into something about ordinary homotopy groups. Also, unless I say otherwise, my prime is odd. (Contrary to normal practice here at Northwestern.) Motivation and (pseudo-)History Here is a 'just-so' story about how you could have invented $p$-adically interpolated homotopy groups. I think it's pretty close to the actual history, but I wasn't in Mike Hopkins's head at the time so I don't know. (But I really wish I had been... what a great sequel to Being John Malkovich that would be). As usual, it starts with $K$ theory. Except I said we're gonna $p$-adically interpolate, so we actually want $p$-complete $K$ theory, $K_p$. The nice thing about $p$-adic $K$-theory is that, for any number $m$ coprime to $p$, there's a natural transformation of (multiplicative) cohomology theories, called the Adams operations, $\psi^m: K_p \rightarrow K_p$. This is supposed to act like a linearization of taking exterior powers of vector bundles, and here's all you need to know about it: 

I know very little about the Pfaffian or how it works, and I'm new at Riemannian geometry in general. But I was wondering if there is some way to make this "intuitive" argument for the fact that a fiber bundle satisfies $\chi(\text{bundle}) = \chi(\text{fiber})\chi(\text{base})$ rigorous. 

I have a monad $T: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ on a (Grothendieck) abelian category which preserves filtered colimits and direct sums (but is not exact). There is a finite collection $G$ of compact, projective objects which generate $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that every object $X$ is presented as a cokernel $R_1 \to R_0\to X\to 0$ of objects $R_1$ and $R_0$ which are (possibly infinite) direct sums of objects in $G$. I know that $T$ is idempotent on $G$: Can I conclude that $T$ is idempotent on $\mathcal{C}$? If the answer is 'no': what sorts of extra conditions do I need to check? In my case, I have access to the category of algebras for this monad as well, and what I really want to know is that the forgetful functor is fully faithful. Any ideas would be appreciated. 

Shaferavich-Parshin. Let $B$ be a smooth, proper curve over a field and fix an integer $g \ge 2$. Then there are only finitely many non-isotrivial (i.e. general points in base have non-isomorphic fibers) families of curves $X \rightarrow B$ which are smooth and proper and have fibers of genus $g$. Given $g\ge 0$, then every curve of genus $g$ has a non-constant map to $\mathbb{P}^1$ of degree at most $d$ whenever $2d - 2 \ge g$. There are finitely many curves of a given genus over a finite field. The solution to the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture uses deformations of Galois reps. 

Let me try to turn my comments into an answer (I think it's also essentially what Vladimir was saying). Suppose you have some diagram $F: K \to \mathcal{C}$. To compute the limit of $F$ is the same as computing the right Kan extension $\epsilon_*F$ along the map $\epsilon: K \to \bullet$. The process you're describing is to compute this Kan extension by factoring the map $\epsilon$ into a bunch of maps $K=K_0 \to K_1 \to K_2 \to \cdots \to \bullet$ and Kan extending one at a time. That's perfectly allowed. You'd like to keep track of the values of your diagram as you Kan extend. In general, for a functor $p: K \to L$, the value of the right Kan extension $p_*F$ at a point $x \in L$ is given by the limit over the category $K_{x/}$, i.e. the category whose objects are pairs $(k, x \to p(k))$ and whose morphisms are morphisms in $K$ making the appropriate diagram commute. In general one might ask: when is a limit of a functor $G$ over some diagram $D$ given by just one of the values $G(d)$? A sufficient condition for this to occur is that $d \in D$ be initial. Putting these two facts together we learn that: 

Take your favorite $\infty$-category (quasi-category) presentation, and straighten it to a simplicial category. (But no one wants to do this... it doesn't sound like fun.) Take the category of chain complexes and view at as a category enriched over itself via the internal hom. Now truncate the Hom-complexes and use Dold-Kan to get a (fibrant) simplicial set. This makes a fibrant simplicial category, which is equivalent to all the other things you might want. (For example, the homotopy category is correct, and the corresponding $\infty$-category is equivalent to one you might make from the dg-category of chain complexes, both of which agree with the $\infty$-category underlying the model category of chain complexes for a Grothendieck abelian category when this makes sense. All of your dreams come true!) 

Motivation Thanks to work of (insert all the usual suspects here), we now have a very strong theory of spectral algebraic geometry, i.e. algebraic geometry done with commutative ring spectra as opposed to commutative rings. While I don't know of any (hence this question), I am positive there exist strict applications of algebraic geometry to ring theory. It would be very neat if we could transplant these into strict applications of spectral algebraic geometry to the theory of ring spectra. Obviously I don't expect this to be straightforward, or literally possible, but I maintain that answers to this question would provide a useful insight in how to think about the relationship between non-affine and affine phenomena. 

EDIT: The stable module category for a ring $R$ has $R$-modules for objects and maps "modulo projectives" for morphisms. That is, we put an equivalence relation on $Hom_{R}(M,N)$ by declaring $f \sim 0$ if $f$ factors through a projective module. For certain rings (e.g. group rings), this category is tensor triangulated (which is why I'm interested). 

Actually I couldn't quite figure out how to do a Ken Brown sort of argument, but here's an argument that works: Let $L$ denote the usual sheafification functor, a la Grothendieck and Verdier etc. Then I claim it's enough to show $L$ sends local epimorphisms to epimorphisms and local monomorphisms to monomorphisms. Indeed, if this is the case then $L$ takes local isomorphisms to epi-monomorphisms, and such things are isomorphisms in toposes. Since $L$ preserves finite limits, we need only check that $L$ takes local epis to epis (since $A \to B$ is a local mono iff $A \to A\times_BA$ is a local epi). But that's not so bad: If $A \to B$ is a local epimorphism then the map $im(A \to B) \to B$ is a local epimorphism and a monomorphism, and hence a monic, local isomorphism. But $L$ preserves images (since they're computed as colimits and L preserves those) and takes monic, local isomorphisms to isomorphisms. Thus $LA \to LB$ has the property that $im(LA \to LB) \to LB$ is an isomorphism (NB: that image is computed in the category of sheaves), and so the map is epi in the category of sheaves, which is what we wanted. 

Let me go into a bit more detail about comparing with, say, the formula for the smash product one finds for orthogonal spectra. I claim that it is a particular model-categorical presentation of precisely the formula (1). To justify that, I'm going to compare the two formulae directly. So I'll need to review a bit about orthogonal spectra. Recall that an orthogonal spectrum consists of a sequence of pointed spaces $X_n$ equipped with $O(n)$-actions together with compatible, $O(n)\times O(m)$-equivariant, based maps $X_n \wedge S^m \to X_{n+m}$. Given an orthogonal spectrum, one would like to know how to describe the corresponding object in $\mathsf{Sp}$ and how to understand smash products. We'll take the $\infty$-category $\mathsf{Spaces}$ as 'understood' and the functor $\Sigma^{\infty}$ as also understood. Then an orthogonal spectrum $(X_k)$ presents an object of $\mathsf{Sp}$ by the formula $$X = \underset{\mathbb{N}}{\mathrm{hocolim}}\, \Sigma^{-k}\Sigma^{\infty}X_k$$ Of course, we ignored the orthogonal group action. Luckily, here's a fun fact: Fun fact. Let $\mathsf{Orth}$ denote the $\infty$-category of real inner product spaces and isometric embeddings. Then the inclusion $\mathbb{N} \to \mathsf{Orth}$ is homotopy final. It follows that we may compute the homotopy colimit either over $\mathsf{Orth}$ or over $\mathbb{N}$. That's important, because the formula for the smash product of orthogonal spectra is really trying to be a formula for a homotopy colimit over $\mathsf{Orth} \times \mathsf{Orth}$. I won't bother typesetting the formula here (see page 5 of Schwede's book, for example) but unless I'm mistaken one arrives at this formula as follows: 

1, 2, and 3 are stolen from Osserman's really great note: $URL$ I really like the theme of 'show there are finitely many gadgets by parameterizing these gadgets by a moduli space with some sort of finite type assumption, then showing no point admits nontrivial deformations.' Any examples of this sort would be doubly appreciated. (I guess Kovács and Lieblich have an annals paper where they do something along these lines for the higher-dimensional version of the Shaferavich conjecture, but since they end up counting deformation types of things instead of things, it doesn't quite fit the criteria in my question... but it's still neat!) Galois representations are definitely a huge thing, and I'd be grateful for any application of their deformation theory that's more elementary than, say... the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. So yeah, that's it. Proselytize, laud, wax poetic- make Pat Benatar proud. 

You may as well look at what happens on maximal tori, since Chern classes are seen there. Let $T$ be the maximal torus of $PU(n)$ and $D$ the maximal torus of the unitary group. Let's write the cohomology rings of their classifying spaces as $\mathbb{Z}[t_i-t_j]/~$ and $Z[x_{i,j}]$ resp. Here the quotient is by the evident linear relations on the generators (you get a polynomial ring in $n-1$ generators I just wanted to avoid choosing a basis). It's not hard to check that the induced map on cohomology sends $x_{i,j}$ to $t_i-t_j$. (In particular the diagonal guys go to zero). So the effect on Chern classes is the effect on symmetric polynomials- you're asking when those go to zero in the target. You've observed that the top polynomial vanishes, which here follows from the fact that the top symmetric polynomial has a factor of, say, $x_{1,1}$ in it. Unless I'm mistaken- none of the other terms vanish. You can see this by noting that the total Chern class is given by coefficients of the polynomial in $z$, $\prod (z-t_i - t_j)$. Substitute $t_1=1$ and $t_i=0$ otherwise. The resulting polynomial is like $z(z-1)^k$ which has vanishing constant term but non vanishing coefficients otherwise (binomial coefficients). 

(It's helpful to draw pictures here. One should view $\mathrm{max}(a,b)$ as the 'actual' composite, and a 2-simplex as a 2-morphism from $c$ to the composite. Hopefully I've gotten my arrows in the right direction...) Anyway, a map from $\Lambda^3_1$ is described by the same data of a 3-simplex except we don't necessarily require $c \le \mathrm{max}(b_{12}, a_{3})$. It can fill to a 3-simplex if and only if this condition happens to be satsfied, in which case it fills uniquely. Of course, said this way, it's clear that we should be able to find un-fillable horns. As an explicit example, take $P= [1]$, and consider the horn specified by $a_2 = a_3 = b_{12} = b_{23} = 0$, $a_1 = c= 1$. 

Proof: I claim that there is a filtration $\{F_k\mathrm{Ind}_{\mathbb{E}_0}^{\mathbb{E}_k}M\}$ of the induced algebra such that 

(Edited later: The answer is probably no in general given the discussion and references in the comments...) Here is a reduction to a more basic question... First note it suffices to show that the subcategory of cofibrant objects is accessible. Indeed, if we have this then we can prove your result by forming the homotopy pullback of accessible categories and accessible functors: $$W \times_{\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{C}^{[1]}\times_{\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{C}_{X/}\times_{\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{C}^{cof}$$ This is the category you're interested in, and replacing $W$ by $F \cap W$ we get the other possible category where objects are $(X, Y \rightarrow X$) with the morphism a trivial fibration. So we just need that the category of cofibrant objects is accessible... and I don't actually see how to prove this at the moment! 

If I'm not mistaken, there is a pushforward map $\text{Nm}:\text{Pic}(X) \rightarrow \text{Pic}(Y)$ which I think is defined like this: let $\tau$ be the map on $X$ that switches sheets, and $\mathcal{L}$ a line bundle on $X$. Then define $\text{Nm}(\mathcal{L}) = (\pi_*(\mathcal{L} \otimes \tau^* \mathcal{L}))^{\tau}$ where the superscript indicates fixed points. On the other hand, we can also define a pushforward in ordinary cohomology $H^*(-, \mathbb{Z})$ as follows: Let $t: Y \rightarrow X^{\times 2}/C_2$ be defined by $t(y) = \pi^{-1}(y)$ counted with multiplicity. We then get a map on chains: $C_*(Y) \rightarrow C_*(X^{\times 2}/C_2) \rightarrow C_*(X)^{\oplus 2}/C_2 \rightarrow C_*(X)$ where the last map is addition. The dual gives a map on cochains and hence on cohomology. 

A couple people mentioned the Steenrod algebra briefly, but you can do a few more topologically-related things: 

To show that an object S has property P, first show that the collection of all objects satisfying P is closed under a bunch of operations, prove that certain very simple objects have property P, and show that S can be "decomposed" or "filtered" or somehow unscrewed into these simple objects using the operations mentioned above. This is a sort of induction, and it is used all the time to turn annoying verifications into verifying that something is true for like... a point. Maybe a shorthand for this "slick method" would be "think like Grothendieck." For lots of examples of this see any proof in Higher Topos Theory or Higher Algebra by Lurie.
