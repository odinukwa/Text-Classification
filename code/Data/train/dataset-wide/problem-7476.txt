Voronin´s Universality Theorem (for the Riemann zeta-Function) according to Wikipedia: Let $U$ be a compact subset of the "critical half-strip" $\{s\in\mathbb{C}:\frac{1}{2}<Re(s)<1\}$ with connected complement. Let $f:U \rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ be continuous and non-vanishing on $U$ and holomorphic on $U^{int}$. Then $\forall\varepsilon >0$ $\exists t=t(\varepsilon)$ $\forall s\in U: |\zeta(s+it)-f(s)|<\varepsilon $. (Q1) Is this the accurate statement of Voronin´s Universality Theorem? If so, are there any (recent) generalisations of this statement with respect to, say, shape of $U$ or conditions on $f$ ? (If I am not mistaken, the theorem dates back to 1975.) (Q2) Historically, were the Riemann zeta-function and Dirichlet L-functions the first examples for functions on the complex plane with such "universality"? Are there any examples for functions (on the complex plane) with such properties beyond the theory of zeta- and L-functions? (Q3) Is there any known general argument why such functions (on $\mathbb{C}$) "must" exist, i.e. in the sense of a non-constructive proof of existence? (with Riemann zeta-function being considered as a proof of existence by construction). (Q4) Is anything known about the structure of the class of functions with such universality property, say, on some given strip in the complex plane? (Q5) Are there similar examples when dealing with $C^r$-functions from some open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$ ? Thanks in advance and Happy New Year! 

Your construction is a special case of semimetric spaces with relaxed triangle inequality: $URL$ This type of metric is sometimes also called non-Archimedian metric. There is a classical paper of W.A.Wilson "On semi-metric spaces", Amer. J. Math. 53 (1931) 361–373, on the subject. Also, I have seen this type of construction mostly used in fixed-point theory, so this would be an additional keyword to look for. EDIT: To answer your second question about whether Banach fixed-point theorem would be applicable to semimetric spaces: In general one needs $(X,d)$ to be bounded, otherwise there are counter-examples. Consider $X=\mathbb{N}$, $d(n,m):=\frac{|n-m|}{2^{\min(n,m)}}$ and $f(n):=n+1$. Then $(X,d)$ is $d$-Cauchy complete semimetric space (!), but $f$ has no fixed points, even though it is a contraction w.r.t. $d$ with contraction constant $1/2$. This example is taken from the paper "Nonlinear Contractions on Semimetric Spaces" by J. Jachymski, J. Matkowski, T. Swiatkowski, Journal of Applied Analysis Vol. 1, No. 2 (1995), pp. 125–134, where you can also find the proof of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem for bounded semimetric spaces and some more related results. 

If you don´t mind skew fields, have a look at quaternionic analysis. Interestingly, many of the facts of complex analysis don´t hold there at all! (In fact, all you need to do analysis, is a Banach algebra or a complete ring with non-trivial unitary group.) 

I think a nice and interesting topic that seems doable with basic calculus and linear algebra would be some kind of introduction in the theory of knots and surfaces. In particular, I have in mind the book "Knots and Surfaces. A guide to discovering mathematics" by Gilbert and Porter, Oxford Univ. Press, 1995. I think it would not be too sophisticated for you, it will introduce you to and get you thinking about various important objects in mathematics, and it may inspire you for your later studies. Have a look at it. If it turns out to be not that well doable for you, you could always take a second look at it in a year or so. 

For general topology, one of my favorites is James Dugundji´s General Topology from 1966. It covers pretty much every topic from general topology, it is thorough, dry and has well optimized proofs (the shortest and 'nicest'), no distracting "bla-bla". 

Let $K\subset L$ be a field extension and let $K\subset F_1,F_2,...,F_n\subset L$ be proper intermediate fields. Consider the "mixed" affine space $\mathbb{A}_{(F_i)}:=\prod_{i=1}^n F_i$ instead of $\mathbb{A}_K^n$ (or $\mathbb{A}_L^n$ for that matter) and consider zero sets of polynomials $f\in K[X_1,X_2,...,X_n]$ in $\mathbb{A}_{(F_i)}$. From the perspective of classic algebraic geometry, it only seems natural to look for such a generalization. Has this specific type of problems been studied/discussed in more detail anywhere and, if yes, under what wording? A reference will be most appreciated. I am mostly interested in the case of algebraic number fields, but other examples are most welcome as well. 

My question is motivated by the previous discussion 'Why is a topology made of open sets?'. While the axioms for arbitrary unions and finite intersections are without doubt essential to the concept of a topological space, the 1st axiom (the set itself and the empty set are open) seems rather technical. So, do we really need these conditions in order to build most (if not all) of the point-set-topology without significant changes? In other words, if we leave out the 1st axiom, can point-set-topology stil remain as useful and powerful in terms of what we actually need to do analysis and geometry? EDIT: Expanded the topic name in accordance with my question. 

I think Fürstenberg´s proof of the infinitude of primes, taken for itself, could be considered in the spirit of the original question, even though its mathematical value is questionable. 

Disclaimer: There are many topologists here and they may not like the philosophical flavour of my answer :-) I think it all starts with the end... actually with the notion of "end". Take an open interval (a,b). It is bounded, yet you cannot reach its ends! At first this may look weird, but then one realizes this weirdness is to be attributed to the mathematically exact observation of this object (mathematicians can distinguish between so many things like point, set of points, boundedness, boundary etc.). Encountering such "weirdness" only shows the strong need for an exact and abstract formulation of "having no end". The lack of ends we then call "openness". If we are looking for the best generalization of this concept, the first approach would be of course a set-theoretical one. And in fact, in the case of intervals it turns out that the property "having no ends" is inhereted into arbitrary unions and finite intersections. Any attemps to expand this lead either to contradictions to our basic example or to unjustified reduction in generality. 

It depends on what one would count as "number theory". Even if one´s interest ultimately lies "only" in algebraic number subfields of the reals, one could argue that there are objects attached to these structures (e.g. L- and Zeta-functions) that are number-theoretical and are of interest for themselves, that is, they are more than just a way prove other things. I think a nice example here is Artin´s conjecture on the holomorphy of the Artin´s L-function -> $URL$ To elaborate a little bit on this, there is absolutely no reason why an arbitrary ordinary Dirichlet series should admit meromorphic continuation, let alone being entire. Assuming that the purely algebraic and real-analytic approach turns out to suffice for almost all number-theorerical purposes, objects like the complex-valued L-functions may indeed not contribute so much more to our mathematical understanding, but they certainly do so to our "philosphical" (or if you want "meta-mathematical") understanding. Moreover, in the end one of the things that matter are the interconnections between various fields of mathematics. In that case one a priori has to deal with structures even "higher" than the complex numbers, e.g. automorphic forms -> $URL$ 

1) Horn angles and variations thereof appear to be well studied in conformal geometry, see e.g. the papers by Ladue, Mary Elizabeth "Conformal geometry of horn angles of higher order", Amer. J. Math. 65, (1943), 455–476, and "Trihornometry: A New Chapter of Conformal Geometry" by Edward Kasner, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 23, No. 6 (Jun. 15, 1937), pp. 337-341 2) You can find more about the theory of horn angles in the paper "The recent theory of the horn angle" by E. Kasner, Scripta Math. 11, (1945). 263–267, 53.0X. The paper is from 1945, but it should give you some idea about the directions of study in that area. 3) Your intuition is right as horn angles can be measured within the model of superreal numbers (in the sense of D. O. Tall), see the paper by J. Bair and V. Henry "Angles corniculaires et nombres superréels" (French) ("Horn angles and superreal numbers), Bull. Belg. Math. Soc. Simon Stevin 15 (2008), no. 1, 77–86. 

There is a discussion of the concept of "transcendental Galois extensions" in the paper "On the transcendental Galois extensions" by Feng-Wen An: $URL$ In the terminology of this paper, an arbitrary field extension $L/K$ is said to be Galois over $K$ iff $L^{\operatorname{Aut}(L/K)}=K$. A field extension $L/K$ is called absolute Galois over $K$ iff for every subextension $L\supseteq F\supseteq K$ the extension $L/F$ is Galois over $F$. The latter corresponds to your definition of Galois extension for arbitrary fields. According to this paper, the answer to your second question appears to be negative: the "absolute Galois" field extension $\mathbb{C}(t)/\mathbb{C}$ is a counter-example as $\mathbb{C}(t)$ is neither algebraically closed, nor algebraic over $\mathbb{C}$. 

Let $F(s)=\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{a_n}{n^s}$ be a Dirichlet series with (finite) abscissa of absolute convergence $\sigma_a$. It can be shown that $\forall \sigma >\sigma_a:$ $$\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{2T}\int_{-T}^{T}F(\sigma+ it)n^{it}\mathrm{d}t=\frac{a_n}{n^{\sigma}}.$$ The natural question arises, given some function $F$ holomorphic in some half-plane, under what conditions does it have a representation as a Dirichlet series. I believe this is a very broad question, so I would actually like to make things a bit more specific. For fixed $c\geq 0$ let $H:=H_c:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:\Re(z)>c\}$ be some half-plane and let $f\in\mathcal{O}(H)$. For $\sigma> c$ define the linear functional $$\Phi_{n,\sigma}: f\mapsto\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{2T}\int_{-T}^{T}f(\sigma + it)n^{it}\mathrm{d}t$$ I have intentionally left out the actual domain of $\Phi_{n,\sigma}$ in $\mathcal{O}(H)$ (since it is rather part of the general question than a known fact). It can be easily seen though that $\Phi_{n,\sigma}$ is not well-defined on the whole $\mathcal{O}(H)$. Let $\sigma_0>c$ be fixed real number. (Q1) Provided $\{\Phi_{n,\sigma_0}(f)\} _{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ exists, does it follow that $\{ \Phi_{n,\sigma}(f)\} _{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ exists for all $\sigma>\sigma_0$? (Q2) Provided $\{\Phi_{n,\sigma_0}(f)\} _{n\in I}$ exists, where $I\subset\mathbb{N}$ is some infinite subset, does it follow that $\Phi_{n,\sigma_0}(f)$ exists for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$? How about sufficiently large finite subset $I\subset\mathbb{C}$? (Q3) Provided that $n^{\sigma_0}\Phi_{n,\sigma_0}(f)=:a_n$ exists for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Does it follow that the Dirichlet series $\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{a_n}{n^s}$ is absolute(?) convergent in some half-plane? If it is convergent, does it represent $f$ in that half-plane? (Q4) And the more general question: Are there any known conditions when an analytic function admits expansion as an ordinary Dirichlet series? I am also aware of the existence of a series of papers of A.F. Leont'ev on the representations of analytic functions as Dirichlet series, e.g. "On the representation of analytic functions by Dirichlet series", A. F. Leont'ev 1969 Math. USSR Sb. 9 111 and "On conditions of expandibility of analytic functions in Dirichlet series", A. F. Leont'ev 1972 Math. USSR Izv. 6 1265, etc. English translations as well as some of the original are available at iopsciences. Unfortunately for me, I don´t have institutional access to those :-( However, while Leontev´s papers appear to be fundamental for the subject, they all date back to the period 1969-1975. So I was hoping that there might be some good serveys or other types of good references summarizing the recent developments, respectively the most general results in the subject so far and that would be also "easier to have" than the aforementioned papers. Also, per Andrey Rekalo´s comment it seems that Leont'ev´s work is not really applicable to the more specific case of representation by ordinary Dirichlet series. Thank you in advance for any input! 

Let $(a_{mn})_{m,n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $(b_m)$ be sequences of complex numbers.We say that $(a_{mn})$ and $(b_m)$ constitute an infinite system of linear equations in infinitely many variables if we seek a sequence $(x_n)$ of complex numbers such that $\forall m\in\mathbb{N}:$ $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{mn}x_n=b_m$. Note that in general the order of summation matters. I am sort of a undergraduate student with focus on number theory and have some background in functional analysis (2 semesters functional analysis, 1 semester non-linear functional analysis, 1 semester operator algebras, 2 semesters PDEs), so I am sort of a becoming number-theorist with bias for functional analysis :-) That is also why I am fascinated by the above defined object as a sort of natural extension of a practical problem from linear algebra. We have never dealt with this type of objects and I wasn´t able to find much on google that I could start something with, maybe partly because I have searched in the wrong way. That is why I have a request if you could recommend some introductory literature focused on such infinite systems of linear equations in infinitely many unknowns over $\mathbb{C}$. Thanks in advance!
