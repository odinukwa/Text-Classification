The degree map gives a short exact sequence $$ 0 \to J(C) \to Pic(C) \to \mathbb{Z} \to 0,$$ where $J(C)$ denotes the Jacobian of $C$. This is an abelian variety of dimension $g$, where $g$ is the genus of $C$. In particular, $Pic(C)$ is always finitely generated when $C \cong \mathbb{P}^1$. To deal with the case of higher genus, you might as well ask: for which fields $k$ do abelian varieties over $k$ of positive dimension have finitely generated groups of rational points? Clearly this holds for finite fields, and the Mordell-Weil theorem also says that this holds for number fields. More generally, this is known to hold for fields which are finitely generated over their prime field. 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. To any del Pezzo surface $S$ over $k$ we may associate its graph of lines, which has one vertex for each line and an edge (with multiplicity if required) between two vertices if and only if the corresponding lines insect. For me a "line" means a $(-1)$-curve. It is well-known that the graph only depends on the degree of the del Pezzo surface, so we obtain a series of graphs $G_d$ for $d \leq 8$. For $d \geq 3$ these graphs are all well-studied by graph theorists for their own sake, for example they have their own wikipedia pages. We have 

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a field $k$. It is well-known that the sum of an ample divisor and an effective divisor is big (in fact this can be taken to be the definition of a big divisor). I'm looking for a weakening of this. 

Note that there is some small ambiguity here, as to talk about the reduction of $X/\mathbb{Q}$ modulo a prime $p$, one needs to choose a model $X$. i.e., a scheme $\mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{Z}$ whose generic fibre is isomorphic to $X$. Anyway, if $X/\mathbb{Q}$ is geometrically integral, then the same holds over $\mathbb{F}_p$ for all but finitely many primes $p$. This follows from fact that being geometrically integral is a constructible property (see Section 9 of EGAIV). One applies this to the morphism $\mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{Z}$. Precise references: Definition of a constructible property: EGAIV Définition (9.2.1) Proof that being geometrically integral is a constructible property: EGAIV Théorème (9.7.7). You can also find a nice treatment of this in Chapter 10 of the book Ulrich Görtz, Torsten Wedhorn - Algebraic Geometry: Part I: Schemes. With Examples and Exercises By 

Yes. It was a conjecture of Witt, proved by Springer, that a quadric hypersurface, over a field of characteristic not equal to $2$, has a rational point if and only if it has a point over a field extension of odd degree. This was proved in: Springer, Tonny Albert - Sur les formes quadratiques d'indice zéro. (French) C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 234, (1952). 1517–1519. It is not too difficult to see that this implies the result you want, when the field does not have characteristic $2$, see for instance: Swan, Richard G. - Zero cycles on quadric hypersurfaces. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 107 (1989), no. 1, 43–46. I don't know what happens over fields of characteristic $2$. 

Im not sure if this counts as a full answer, but it is a nice example which will hopefully shed light on some of your questions. The canonical bundle $\omega_X$ of an Enriques surface $X$ satisfies $\omega_X \otimes \omega_X=\mathcal{O}_X$, but $\omega_X\neq \mathcal{O}_X$ in the Picard group. It follows that $\omega_X$ is not the restriction of any line bundle in $\mathbb{P}^n$, as these can't be non-zero torsion. 

There are various conditions on $X$ if one wants such an inequality hold. For example, $S$ cannot be the spectrum of a local ring, and $X/S$ cannot admit a section for the Zariski topology. 

For the cases which you are interested in there appears to be only partial results available in the literature. Namely, as special cases of more general results. For quartic threefolds and cubic fivefolds one knows that a generic Torelli theorem holds. This is a special case of a generic Torelli theorem for certain hypersurfaces, due to Donagi [1]. I don't know of an analogue of Donagi's work for complete intersections, but here Flenner [2] has shown an infinitesimal Torelli theorem in certain cases. This in particular applies to the case of an intersection of a quadric and cubic. Also, I believe that the Torelli theorem for intersections of two quadrics of odd dimension is actually due to Donagi [3], not Reid (at least I can't find this statement in Miles Reid's PhD thesis). Good luck with this problem if you are working on it! If you make any progress, or know more than I do, please do contact me as I would be most interested. References: [1] - Donagi.

If it helps, I'm primarily interested in the case $n=3$. Obviously I'm aware of standard lattice point counting techniques, but these usually give an error term of the shape $O(\text{boundary of the region/first successive minima})$, and I don't know how to control this in my case. So I'm just looking for uniform upper bounds where this term doesn't appear. [1] Heath-Brown - Diophantine approximation with Square-free numbers 

The set $$\{ \mathbf{a} =(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^n : ||\mathbf{a}|| \leq B, \Delta(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \text{ is a square} \}$$ is a so-called thin set in the sense of Serre. Serre studies these in detail in the book "Lectures on the Mordell-Weil theorem". He uses the large sieve in Section 13 to show that for any thin set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ we have $$\# \{ \mathbf{a} \in \Omega : ||\mathbf{a}|| \leq B \} \ll B^{n-1/2}(\log B)^\gamma,$$ for some $\gamma < 1$. Modulo the logarithm, this gives the bound you want. Possibly you can remove the logarithm in your special case by carefully going through the proof and see if it can saved somewhere. More results about thin sets and their relationship with Galois groups can be found in Serre's book "Topics in Galois theory". 

One of the main subtleties in trying to classify surfaces over non-algebraically closed fields is that there are minimal surfaces which become non-minimal over the algebraic closure. As an example I will focus on the case that I know best, that of (geometrically) rational surfaces. Over an algebraically closed field, it is well-known that the only such minimal surfaces are $\mathbb{P}^2$ and the rational ruled surfaces $\mathbb{F}_n$ for $n \geq 0$. If the field is not algebraically closed, then things are a lot more complicated. It is a theorem of Iskovskikh that a minimal rational surface over a perfect field is one of the following types: 

Any such matrix $M$ would give rise to an automorphism of the cubic surfaces $$a^3 + b^3 = c^3 \pm d^3 \quad \subset \mathbb{P}^3.$$ These are both just different ways of writing the Fermat cubic surface $$x_0^3 + x_1^3 + x_2^3 + x_3^3 = 0 \quad \subset \mathbb{P}^3.$$ It is well-known that the automorphism group of the Fermat cubic surface over $\mathbb{C}$ is generated by the "obvious automorphisms", namely by permuting coordinates and multiplying coordinates by a third root of unity (See Table 9.6 of "Dolgachev - Classical algebraic geometry" for this claim). Hence, as you are interested with matrices with integer entries, we see that the only such $M$ are the 6 permutation matrices which permute $a,b,c$, with also possibly multiplying some variable by $-1$ to fix the signs. For example \begin{bmatrix}0&1&0 \\ 1&0&0 \\ 0&0&1\end{bmatrix} is an example of such a matrix. The other matrices can be written down analogously. 

This question is slightly vague; so let me give you an example of the kind of thing I want, but which unfortunately does not work. Namely, the only natural construction which I can think of here is the fibre product. But $B(A_1) \times B(A_2)$ is not isomorphic to $B(A_1 \otimes_k A_2)$ for two obvious reasons: 

Thanks to the hint from Ulrich, I think I am now able to answer the question. The set $\mathrm{H}^1(k, \mathrm{Aut}(X_{\bar k},L_{\bar k}))$ classifes the following objects: $k$-Isomorphism classes of pairs $(Y,E)$, where $Y$ is a projective variety over $k$ and $E \in \mathrm{Pic}_{Y/k}(k)$, which become isomorphic to $(X,L)$ after a finite separable field extension. Here $\mathrm{Pic}_{Y/k}$ denotes the Picard scheme of $Y$. Note that we have $$\mathrm{Pic}_{Y/k}(k) = \mathrm{Pic}(\bar Y)^{\mathrm{Gal}(\bar k/ k)}.$$ 

I understand the problem well in other, similar looking, situations (i.e. for different choices of $A$). For example: 

The heuristic fails for precisely the reason you state; there is a parametric family of solutions which makes it fail. People often use heuristic arguments to predict the number of integral/rational solutions of bounded height to diophantine equations. These heuristics are often true, provided one allows a small margin of error given by ignoring possible parametric families of solutions which make things go wrong (often called "special subvarieties"). This is exactly what is happening here. This philosophy is present in many conjectures and research problems in the modern study of diophantine equations, such as Manin's conjecture, the Bombieri-Lang conjecture, the André–Oort conjecture,..... The prediction from the circle method comes here from the major arc analysis. One hopes in general that the minor arcs are smaller than the major arcs, however this is sometimes not true and in such cases it is expected that there are special subvarieties which contribute to the minor arcs and make things go wrong. I expect this is what is happening in your case. Another example close to my heart where this happens (and closely related to your case), is the case of cubic surfaces. Take for example the Fermat cubic surface. $$x_0^3 + x_1^3 = x_2^3 + x_3^3.$$ Here the circle method predicts that there are around $N(\log N)^3$ primitive integral solutions of bounded height. However this is wrong, as there is a parametric family of "trivial" solutions $$x_0=x_2, \quad x_1=x_3,$$ which yields around $N^2$ solutions of bounded height. However, once one removes these trivial solutions, plus other obvious ones, it is expected that the circle method prediction should be right. This is a special case of the Manin conjecture. Unfortunately one does not know this for the Fermat cubic surface, but a lower bound of the correct order of magnitude in this case is a recent nice result of Sofos. 

Here is a method which should give you what you want, but I leave the details to you as I don't have time to work them out now. Without loss of generality we may work over an algebraically closed field. Each singular fibre consists of a union of two $(-1)$-curves meeting at a single point. Contracting a choice of $(-1)$-curve in each single fibre, we obtain a ruled surface over $\mathbb{P}^1$. There is a formula for the canonical divisor of a ruled surface, which when combined with the formula for the canonical divisor of a blow-up, should give you what you want (all these tools can be found in Ch. V of Hartshorne). Note that a useful check is given by Noether's formula, which implies that $$(K_X)^2 = 8 - \mbox{number singular of fibres}.$$ 

Given that this is Grothendieck we are talking about, I imagine if he knew how to prove the result over schemes he would have done so, in particular I'm willing to believe that the answer is "no". However I don't know any explicit counter-examples. I have a specific application in mind where my scheme $S$ is not too badly behaved, for example I can assume that $S$ is Noetherian, affine, regular with $\mathrm{Pic}(S)=0.$ If anyone knows any positive results in such special cases, I would also be very interested. 

Yes, this follows from the fact that the degrees of $\mathbb{K}$ and $\mathbb{L}$ are coprime. The result follows from a simple application of Bezout's identity and the fact that, for an extension $k$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ of degree $n$ and $x \in \mathbb{Q}$, we have $N_k(x) = x^n$. 

Yes. This follows from the fact that BSD is invariant under Weil restriction and isogeny (the Weil restriction of $E/K$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ is isogenous to the product of $E$ with its quadratic twist). Note that you don't need to assume here that $K$ is imaginary nor anything about the rank of $E/K$. 

You again need to be careful with the phrasing of this question, as it is not clear what you mean, since it is not possible to compare unitary groups over different fields. However, over a given local field $F_v$, there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of unitary groups of given dimension. This follows from the fact that there are only finitely many quadratic extensions of a given local field. This is nothing special about unitary groups, since, more generally, over any local field $F_v$ there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of reductive algebraic groups of given dimension (this can be proved using the classification of reductive algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields combined with the fact that $F_v$ admits only finitely many field extensions of given degree). 

The reason I ask is that when $k$ is non-algebraically closed, it seems quite possible that we may need to take a quadratic twist of $(*)$. However the only "canonical" twists are either $(*)$ itself or the multiplication by $-1$. So my guess is that $J(X)$ should be isomorphic to the Jacobian of $$\pm y^2 = \mathrm{det}(xQ_1 + Q_2),$$ however I don't know which sign to take, and it seems quite possible that the choice of sign could even depend on $n$. Edit: As pointed out by Sasha, I should have explained which definition of the intermediate Jacobian I'm using. Firstly, in Deligne - Les intersections complètes de niveau de Hodge un. Deligne showed how to construct the intermediate Jacobian for complete intersections of Hodge level $1$ over fields of characteristic $0$, using a clever trick coming from certain universal properties (in particular, it is not explicit). In the special case of complete intersections of two quadrics $X$ as above, I believe that one can define $J(X)$ to be the albanese variety of the Fano variety of $(n-1)$-planes inside $X$. This construction should work over fields of characteristic not equal to $2$, and moreover recover Deligne's construction when $\mathrm{char}(k)=0$, though unfortunately I know neither a proof nor a reference for this fact. I would be happy with an answer which uses either definition, restricting to characteristic $0$ if necessary. 

When $p = 0$, this is an easy consequence of Kodaira vanishing and the exponential sequence, together various comparison theorems for étale cohomology. So my question is really about what happens in positive characteristic. For Fano varieties which lift to characteristic zero this is also probably quite easy. In fact, a positive answer to the following weaker version might be sufficient for my purposes. 

An explicit simple counter-example is the following: just take the quaternion algebra $(x,y)$ over $k(x,y)$, where $k$ is a field with $\mathrm{char}(k) \neq 2$. This is non-zero on any open subset of the affine plane (it is well defined on the complement of the coordinate axes). One can see that it is non-zero as its residue along the coordinate axis $x=0$ is given by $y \in k(y)^{*}/k(y)^{*2}$, which is non-zero. 

I appreciate that this question is slightly vague, but I hope the reader understands what I am after. For example all the above mentioned graphs are implemented in sage. Are $G_1$ and $G_2$ also implemented in sage, or perhaps another computer algebra package? Alternatively, is there a way to construct $G_2$ and $G_1$ from the $E_7$ and $E_8$ root systems? If necessary I am willing to consider the corresponding graphs obtained by removing the multiple edges. 

I've been reading some papers on Igusa zeta functions, and they seem to be implicitly using a "quantitative version" of Hensel's Lemma, which also asserts the number of lifts of a $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$-point to a $\mathbb{Z}/p^k\mathbb{Z}$-point. I'm looking for something like the following: 

Let $X$ be a smooth irreducible threefold over $\mathbb{C}$ with a morphism $\pi:X \to B$ to a smooth rational surface $B$ such that every fibre is a (possibly degenerate) conic. Then, then there exists a reduced normal crossings divisor (the "discriminant curve") $\Delta \subset B$ such that for any $b \in B$ we have: (a) $\pi^{-1}(b) \cong \mathbb{P}^1$, if $b \not \in \Delta$ (b) $\pi^{-1}(b)$ is two intersecting lines if $b \in \Delta \backslash Sing (\Delta) $ (c) $\pi^{-1}(b)$ is a non-reduced line if $b \in Sing(\Delta) $ (d) In particular, there are only finitely many non-reduced fibres. 

Any non-singular complex variety $V$ of dimension $n$ (in either affine space or projective space) can be endowed with the structure of a complex manifold of dimension $n$. Moreover as a submanifold of a Kahler manifold, it will also be Kahler. The passage to a real manifold can be slightly subtle, as there are two approaches you can take. Firstly, you can simply consider the complex manifold as a real manifold of dimension $2n$, with a complex structure. Alternatively, if the variety is defined over $\mathbb{R}$ (that is, it has equations with real coefficients), then you can look at the set of real points $V(\mathbb{R})$, which you can also endow with the struture of a real manifold. As a submanifold of a Riemannian manifold it is also a Riemannian manifold. I should note that some funny things can happen though, for example even if $V$ is connected then $V(\mathbb{R})$ may not be. If your variety has singularities, these always occur on a closed subset so you can just remove them to get a non-singular variety. Alternatively you can resolve them as Ariyan suggests.
