Take $\mathbb C^2$ with coordinates $(z,w)$. Suppose that $J$ is a $C^{\infty}$ almost complex structure on $\mathbb C^2$ such that the line $w=0$ is $J$-holomorphic and $J(0,0)$ is given by $(z,w)\to (iz,iw)$. Suppose that there is a smooth function $f(z):\mathbb D\to \mathbb C$ defined on a unit disk $\mathbb D$ such that the graph $(z,f(z))\subset \mathbb C^2$ is a $J$-holomorphic subvariety of $(\mathbb C^2, J)$ (we don't assume that $z\to (z,f(z))$ is a $J$-holomorphic map). Question. Is it true that there is $n$ and a constant $c\in(0,1)$ such that $c|z^n|<|f(z)|<\frac{1}{c} |z^n|$ for sufficiently small $z$? Remark. The statement is trivial in the case when $J$ coincides with the standard complex structure on $\mathbb C^2$. This question is a follow up to Two smooth tangent almost complex curves in a $4$-manifold 

Let $f(z)$ be a holomorphic function defined on the disk $|z|\le 2$. Suppose $|f(z)|<1$ for $|z|\le 2$. It looks like there is a constant $c>0$ such that $|f(z)'|<c$ on the disk $|z|\le 1$ (for example, $c=1$?). I wonder if this is true. If yes, is an optimal such constant can be found? 

By Morse lemma for any $C^{\infty}$ function $f$ on $\mathbb R^2$ with Taylor series $(0,0)$ starting with $x^2+y^2$ one can find local $C^{\infty}$ coordinates $(x',y')$ such that locally $f(x',y')=x'^2+y'^2$. Question. Suppose now we consider functions $f$ with Taylor series starting with $(x^2+y^2)^n$. For which $n>1$ one can always find coordinates $(x',y')$ so that $f(x',y')=(x'^2+y'^2)^n$? 

I've just come across this paper by Coleman and Edixhoven called "On the semi-simplicity of the $U_p$ operator on modular forms", where (as the title says) they show that the $U_p$ operator is semi-simple on the spaces of cusp forms (Theorem 4.2) under some conditions on the level and $p$. I was wondering if there is a similar result for Hilbert modular forms or even for quaternionic modular forms? By similar I mean a result saying that the $U_p$ operator acting in the spaces of cuspidal HMFs or on Quaternionic modular forms is semi-simple given some conditions on the weight, level and $p$. Thank you 

I've been reading a preprint by David Hansen (with appendix by James Newton) called Universal eigenvarieties, trianguline Galois representations and p-adic Langlands functoriality. In it he talks about using overconvergent cohomology to construct eigenvarieties. Now I was wondering if I could get a reference/ explanation as to why these eigenvarieties will be related to the ones one make coming from overconvergent modular forms (as in Kevin Buzzard's- Eigenvarieties) I don't quite see the relation between this OC cohomology and OC modular forms. I have a feeling it has something to do (as I think Hansen says on p42) with the classical Eichler--Shimura and Theorem 3.2.5 on the above paper, which is a generalization of Stevens control theorem. But it's not clear to me what the relation is. Thank you. 

It is said that this identity amounts, in the Riemmanian geometry sense, to the saying that, loosely, "the boundary of the bounday is null". So my questions are Question 1: What would be a more rigorous statement of "the boundary of the boundary is null" and how does the above identity is equivalent ot it? Question 2: Is there an analog to this geometrical intuition in general relativity? I assume both questions might be answered with a reference, which is even better. 

My question: Are you familiar with a multivariate-calculus version and proof of this theorem? I searched most of the textbooks mentioned here and here, but still no luck. Any ideas? I believe it is not usually covered in graduate curses of advanced multivariate analysis, and so it is pretty difficult to find it in the textbooks. (This is cross posted from math.se, since a week has passed and it recieved little-to-no-answer. Also, this is not to be confused with the Leibniz rule $(fg)'=f'g +fg'$, as in this post. 

Consider $X = \mathbb{R}$ , and for every $a \in [-\infty , \infty ] $ , $(a,\infty )$ is an open set. It is a topology because any finite intersection yields an open "ray" of the largest starting point, and any union yields an open "ray" with the minimal starting point, which might be $-\infty $. It is worth noticing that if we'd choose $[a, \infty )$ as our topology base, we'd result in open rays as well (consider $\cup_j [1/j, \infty)$ for example. Well, now take the sequence $x_j = 2+ 1/j$. We now show it converges $\forall b\leq 2$. For such $b$ and an arbitrary open set $b \in U$, it has the form of $U = (c, \infty ), c < b <2 < x_j , \forall j$, therefore $x_j$ converges to all $b \leq 2$ This examples relays heavily on the fact that every neighborhood of $b$ is also a neighborhood of $2$ , and therefore you can only say of a sequence what it's minimal neighborhood, but not a point of convergence. 

Is it possible to construct a smooth action of $S^1\times S^1$ on $S^{2n+1}$ ($n\ge 2$) such that no point on $S^{2n+1}$ has an infinite stabilizer? Note that if such an action exists, it can not be linear. 

This questions if related to a cute article of Beauville where he proves in particular the following theorem: $URL$ Theorem.âˆ’ A smooth complex projective hypersurface of dimension $\ge 2$ and degree $\ge 3$ admits no endomorphism of degree $>1$. Here "endomorphism" means a holomorphic self-map and the proof of the theorem uses algebraic geometry bien sure:) . But the following question is not mentioned in the article: Question. What are smooth complex projective hypersufaces in $\mathbb CP^n$ that admit topological self-maps of degree $>1$? I wonder if this question is trivial and completely answered for $n>2$? Added. The comment of algori settles this question (apperently). But still I wonder for example how one can construct a self-map of a quintic in $\mathbb CP^3$ of degree $>1$. 

Let $X$ be a smooth complex projective variety and $V$ be a holomorphic bundle on $X$. Suppose we have an algebraic $\mathbb C^*$-action on $X$. Is it true that the bundle $V$ can always be deformed to a holomorphic bundle $V'$ so that the $\mathbb C^*$-action can be lifted to an action on $V'$? UPD. It is not quite clear to me now if there is no some type of topological obstruction for such a lift, i.e., that the $\mathbb C^*$-action can not be lifted even to an action on $V$ as a topological complex vector bundle. I would of course be interested to see such an example if it exists, but then would be definitely interested to know what happen in the situation when the action can be lifted topologically. 

I'm looking to learn about integral structures (or models?) on classical algebraic groups. To begin with I have been learning about algebraic groups, quadratic forms and lattices. And also looking at this paper by Jonathan Hanke called "Algorithms for computing maximal lattices in bilinear (and quadratic) spaces over number fields" available here $URL$ The thing is I want to learn about these integral structures but can't seem to find a good place to learn about them. Thanks 

I'm trying to relate the slope decomposition of a product of linear operators to the slope decompositions with regard to each of the operators in the product. First I'll give some background, for which I'm following section 2.3 of Urban's Eigenvarietes for reductive groups. If $L/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a finite extension. say a polynomial $P(X)$ of degree $d$ has slope $\leq h$ if $P(0)$ is a unit in the ring of integers of $L$ and the roots of $P^*(X)=X^dP(1/X)$ in $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_p$ have $p$-adic valuation less than $h$. Then if $M$ is a vector space over $L$ and $U$ is a continuous linear operator $M$, we say that $M$ has a slope $\leq h$ decomposition with respect to $U$, if we can write $M:=M_1 \oplus M_2$, where both $M_1,M_2$ are stable under the action of $U$ and we have: (1) $M_1$ is finite dimensional over $L$. (2) The polynomial $\det(1-X\cdot U)|M_1$ is of slope $\leq h$. (3) For any polynomial $P$ of slope $\leq h$, the restriction of $P^*(U)$ to $M_2$ is an invertible endomorphism of $M_2$. Now my question is that if I have $U=\prod_{i=1}^{n} U_i$, where $U,U_i$ are all linear operators on $M$. Then if I take an element that has slope $\leq h$ with respect to $U$, does it follow that it will have slope $\leq h$ with respect to all the $U_i$. Or more generally is there a relation between the slope decomposition of with respect to $U$ and the slope decomposition with respect to the $U_i$. Note: For the case I'm looking at I can actually take the operators to be compact operators, and my $M$ will be spaces of modular forms. But I don't know how much this helps. 

I would like to know if there exists any kind of classification of finite dimensional (possibly non-associative) algebras $A$ over $\mathbb R$ that satisfy the following condition: There exists a norm on $A$ such that for any $a\in A$ $|a*a|=|a||a|$ (the norm on $A$ is Euclidean). Of course, complex numbers, quaternions and octonians provide examples of such algebras. But there are further examples of dimension $2^n$ that are given by Cayley-Dickson construction (pages 8-10 in $URL$ Is there a classification of such algebras, at least in small dimensions (over $\mathbb R$)? What are possible dimensions of such algebras? 

As far as I understand it follows from the work of M. Freedman that there exist locally flat embeddings of two dimensional surfaces in $\mathbb R^4$ that can not be smoothed in the class of locally flat embedding. (For definition of locally flat see $URL$ I am curious if one can draw a realistic picture of such a surface. At least is it possible to draw an intersection of such a surface with a (linear) hyperplane in $\mathbb R^4$? Is the Hausdorff dimension of such an intersection equals $1$? 

Let $M$ be a compact connected manifold with an $S^1$-action. Suppose that $S^1$ has a fixed point in $M$. Is it true that $\pi_1(M)=\pi_1(M/S^1)$? I is there some reference or a short proof of this fact? PS. I am sorry for amending the question. In reality I only want to know that the kernel of the map $\pi_1(M)\to \pi_1(M/S^1)$ is finite. Is at least this fact true? 

This might be a little, soft, but I'll try Consider the interval $I=[-1,1]$. We will define a chaotic function $f:\mathbb{R}_+ \times I \to \mathbb{C}$ in the following traditional way: For every $M>0$ and $\delta >0$ there exsist two points $x,y \in I$ with $|x- y | < \delta$, and a time $T>0$ such that $|f(T,x) - f(T,y)| >M$. We would also like to demand smoothness in $I$, so that at least for some $[0,T) \subseteq \mathbb{R}_+$ we have that $f$ is analytic in $[0,T)\times I$. My question is what is the traditional way, or the most adequate way, to define smooth chaotic function? Can $f$ be analytic? a limit of analytic functions? Can we demand that for every $t\in \mathbb{R}_+$, $f(t,\cdot)\in C^{\infty}(I)$? 

I have been hearing a lot about a theory of interpolation using rational function, parallel to that of polynomial interpolation. I'm looking for a book chapter, or even short lecture notes, that will give me the basic results and tools of this field. 

The Burger's equation $$y_t (t,x) + y\cdot y_x - y_{xx} =0 \, \, ,$$ can be obtained as a limit of the one-dimensional cubic Nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) $$ i\psi _t (t,x) + \psi _{xx} +|\psi|^2\psi =0 \, \, ,$$ but can also be obtained as an approximation of the Kardar-Parizi-Zhang (KPZ) equation $$h_t (t,x) = h_{xx} + (h_x)^2 +\eta (t,x) \, \, ,$$ where $\eta $ is a Gaussian noise term. Question: I don't know any of the details of both approximations/transformations, nor what kind of results can you deduce from it. Do you know any good references for that? The Burger's equation Wiki page offers some information, but not enough (for me) to get the full picture. There are a lot of papers which are somehow related to it, but none that I found were good as an introductory text. Thanks! Edit: I don't want to change the OP, but as noted, the transformation is to a linear Schrodinger equation with a potential, not the NLS. The NLS itself can be obtained as the PDE for the slowly-varying envelope of small perturbations in the KdV and Klein-Gordon equation, see e.g., (Ablowitz, Mark J. Nonlinear dispersive waves: asymptotic analysis and solitons. Vol. 47. Cambridge University Press, 2011). 

I'm wondering if someone can shed some light onto the following, which most likely is just a silly coincidence, but I would be interested to know if there is more to it. I found myself needing to compute some dimensions of spaces of Hilbert modular cusp forms over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$ of parallel weight $[2k,2k]$ and level $\Gamma_0(\mathfrak{p}_{11})$ where $\mathfrak{p}_{11} $ is a prime ideal dividing $11$. Now I started by doing the naive thing of simply going to MAGMA and asking for Dimension(HilbertModularCuspForms(...)). Now this is not a good idea since it will become very slow very quickly. But still, if you wait a bit you find that the sequence [Dimension, weight] is $[ 1, 4 ],[ 5, 6 ] ,[ 9, 8 ] ,[ 17, 10 ] ,[ 25, 12 ] ,[ 33, 14 ] ,[ 45, 16 ] ,[ 57, 18 ] ,[ 73, 20 ] ,[ 89, 22 ] ,[ 105, 24 ] ,[ 125, 26 ] ,[ 145, 28 ] ,[ 169, 30 ]$ Now I looked at the sequence of dimensions and wondered if there was a pattern, so I did the usual trick of typing OEIS into google and then putting in the dimensions. It turns out the dimensions match up (as far as I've computed) with the number of (integer) solutions of $w+2x+5y=0$ for $x,y,w \in [-k \dots k]$. So my question is: Is this nothing more than a coincidence? or is there any connection here? The dimension formulas for Hilbert modular forms seem to usually be a bit messy so I can't really see how the two things are connected (but this likely just because I haven't looked at them carefully yet). My hope was to eventually have a quick way of computing these dimensions and having such a description would make computations much easier. Full disclosure: The sequence on OEIS actually starts $1,1,5,9,17,$.. and the first "1" would correspond to the dimension in weight $[2,2]$, which is actually zero, so the sequences don't match up in the first term. But if you look at the corresponding space on the quarternionic side (via the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence), then in weight $[2,2]$ one needs to quotient out the space by the stuff factoring through the reduced norm map, which in this case is 1-dimensional, so this might be the where the "1" is. Thank you. 

Consider A Gaussian Procces $X(t):\mathbb{R}\times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ with $\Omega$ a probability space and $\mathbb{E} \left[ X_t \right] = 0$ for all $t\in \mathbb{R}$. Consider also its KL expansion $X(t) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} Z_k e_k (t)$, with $Z_k$ being pairwise uncorrelated Gaussian random variables. I'm interested in what is known about the convergence rate of the finite expansion $\sum\limits_{k=0}^N Z_k e_k (t)$. Mainly 

Given two probability density functions (PDF) $f$ and $g$, both defined over the same set $X$, there are many ways to describe/measure the distance between them, e.g., KL divergence and Hellinger distance, to name a few. What I'm looking for is a distance function $d(f,g)$ that gives an order of magnitude difference. To be concrete, if at some area $f\sim 2\times 10^4$, $f_1 \sim 10^4$, and $f_2 \sim 10^2$, I want that $d(f,f_1) \ll d(f,f_2)$. Is there a known, statistically or probabilistically meaningful way, to do that? I know that this question is a bit vague, but if I knew how to define such a distance function, I wouldn't be asking this question. Note that, as in the examples above, $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ doesn't have to be a metric. Thanks Edit: This has been cross-posted in Cross.Validated
