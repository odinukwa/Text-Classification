As is always the case in physics, there is no proof. But if your scenario were true, it would have to be rather fine-tuned in order to create the observed expansion of the Universe. First of all, the expansion is observed to be highly isotropic, i.e. the expansion rate is the same in all directions. Hence, your lumps couldn't really look like your drawing, but would have to lie in a shell around our Universe. Second, the matter farthest from us would achieve a larger acceleration since it were closer your surrounding matter. In fact the opposite is observed; in the "local" Universe, the expansion accelerates, whereas in the distant Universe (which due to the finite speed of light also means the early Universe), the expansion actually decelerated. Third, we would have to be located near the center of the Universe which, while not impossible, would be regarded as a highly improbable coincidence. Fourth, preferably you would have to come up with some mechanism that could result in such a configuration of matter. Dark energy, at least in the form of the cosmological constant which is usually assumed, is so far (!) the simplest explanation for the observed fact that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, and that the geometry of space seems to be flat. But several other models that fit the observations exist, and although I personally think dark energy makes the most sense — partly because this is so far from my field that I'll have to rely on what I read — I think most cosmologists are rather open to the possibility that we may one day have to severely reshape or even reject this model. 

Above the locus, cooling is effective, and the cloud can collapse. The tilted dashed lines are lines of constant gas mass. Now you see that even for Solar metallicity (the $Z = Z_\odot$ line), clouds of gas masses larger that $\sim10^{13}\,M_\odot$ are unable to cool. This is the fundamental difference between a galaxy and a cluster. They are both overdensities that resisted the expansion, but the gas in the cluster is not able to cool and form stars. Voids When people talk about "voids", the ususally refer not to the ICM, which is the hot and dilute gas between the galaxies of a cluster, but to the immense regions of even more dilute gas which are… well, void of galaxies. Take a look at this image (from here). Here, I marked clusters with green and voids with purple. I also marked some filaments with cyan. 

In the plot above, the locus traces the color of the Universe as a function of temperature (thin numbers), and age of the Universe in kiloyears (kyr; bold numbers). That is, the Universe started out as bluish (when $T\gtrsim10^4\,\mathrm{K}$), became whitish at an age of around 200,000 years (when $T\sim5\verb+-+6000\,\mathrm{K}$), and then gradually went over orange and red at $t\sim1\,\mathrm{Myr}$ before fading into the infrared. This evolution is completely analogous to the colors of stars of a given temperature. The ages have been calculated with Python's , which I think is not very accurate at such small ages, but it does give the approximate age. Also, whether or not the CMB was visible to the naked eye — i.e. without a telescope to enlarge the light-collecting area — depends on the intensity at a given point. 

Advantages over supernovae A huge advantage of quasars over SNe is that they don't disappear after a few weeks, meaning that if e.g. we want to refine some measurement, we can go back and observe it again at any time. Another advantage is that quasars, being so luminonous, can be detected out to much larger distances (roughly to $z\simeq4$) than SNe (which are only observed ut to $z\simeq2$). Reverberation mapping Since quasars are so far away, the BLR, being less than a parsec in size, cannot be resolved. But luckily, a technique call "reverberation mapping" allows us to determine the size: The spectrum of the quasar consists of a continuum with spectral lines. Quasars vary in luminosity on rather short timescales. If we measure a quasar's luminosity regularly over some period of time, we get a so-called "lightcurve". But since the lines are created at a distance from the source, a given "bump" in the lightcurve (i.e. a temporary increase in luminosity) does't show up in the continuum and the lines at the same time. Instead, there is a delay, corresponding to the extra distance that the light had to travel from the quasar to the cloud reflecting$^3$ it. In the figure below, blue shows the continuum, while red shows the lines. The lines are seen to lag behind the continuum, since they first had to travel from the quasar (black) to the clouds (magenta). 

Dark matter attracts baryons not only by a "kind of gravity", but simply by gravity. Everything that has mass (even if it's only relativistic mass like light) attracts everything else by gravity, and thus baryons also attract dark matter. The reason dark matter "organizes" galaxies is just that there is much more of it, roughly 7 times more, to be specific. So, on large scales, the dynamics of galaxies are dominated by dark matter. But because baryons can dissipate energy, it may collapse in clumps — such as molecular clouds — which are hence dominated by baryons. 

Unless the stars comes so close that they actually collide, two stars will not be able to catch each other gravitationally. The reason is energy conservation: As they approach each other, their potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, increasing their velocities. When they are closest, their velocities are at their highest, but since there's nothing to take out energy from the system, their kinetic energy will be converted back to potential energy, propelling them far apart again. If a third star is present, however, this may be able to extract energy from the system, so that one star is slung out while the other two start orbiting each other. Note however that the probability of two stars encountering each other extremely small, and that of three stars is close to zero. In the above, I have ignored the presence of planets. In principle, a large planet could help, but since their masses are much smaller than the stars', their effect is quite small. 

No. In fact the opposite is the case. (See the last paragraph for an intuitive explanation.) It is a common misbelief that galaxies receding faster than the speed of light are not visible to us. This is not the case; we easily see galaxies moving at superluminal velocities. This does not — as I think most people would think — contradict the theory of relativity, which says that nothing can travel through space faster than $c$. Galaxies do not travel through space (except with small velocities of 100-1000 km/s); rather, space itself is expanding, causing distances between the galaxies to increase. We see "super-luminal" galaxies The recession velocity $v_\mathrm{rec}$ of a galaxy is given by Hubble's Law: $$ v_\mathrm{rec} = H_0 \, d, $$ where $H_0 \simeq 67.8\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ is the Hubble constant (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016). This law implies that galaxies farther away than $$ r_\mathrm{HS} \equiv \frac{c}{H_0} \simeq 4400\,\mathrm{Mpc} \simeq 14.4 \, \mathrm{Gly}\,\,\mathrm{("\!\!Giga\mbox{-}lightyears\!\!")} $$ recede faster than $c$. Here, the subscript "HS" is chosen because the ragion within which galaxies recede slower than $c$ is called the "Hubble sphere". Objects at a distance of $r_\mathrm{HS}$ have a redshift of $z\simeq1.6$. Consider a photon emitted from a distant galaxy (say, GN-z11 at redshift $z=11.1$) in the past, in the direction of the Milky Way (MW). What special relativity tells us is that locally, the photon always travels through space at $v=c$. Initially, the photon thus increases it distance from GN-z11 at velocity $c$. However, even though the photon travels toward us, its distance to MW increases, due to the expansion of the Universe. As the photon increases its distance to GN-z11, the same expansion causes it to recede from GN-z11 at an ever-increasing velocity. Moreover, as it travels toward MW, it will slowly "overcome" the expansion until it reaches the point where $v_\mathrm{rec} = c$. For an infinitesimally small period, it will stand will wrt. MW, after which it will begin to travel faster and faster as measured from MW. Eventually, its velocity — still in MW's reference frame — will reach $c$, at which point it will have reached MW. Thus, even though GN-z11 and MW recede from each other at $v_\mathrm{rec} = 2.2c$, we are still able to see it. What is perhaps even more counterintuitive is that when GN-z11 emitted the light we see today, it receded even faster, at $v_\mathrm{rec} \sim 4c$. We see more and more distant galaxies There is, however, a limit to how fast a galaxy visible to us can recede, given by the distance $r_\mathrm{PH}$ that light has had the time to travel since the Universe was created. Light comes to us from all directions, so we're situated in the center of a sphere of radius $r_\mathrm{PH}$. This sphere is called "the observable Universe", and its surface (which is not a physical thing) is called the particle horizon (hence the subscript "PH"). Galaxies at the particle horizon are receding at $v_\mathrm{rec}\simeq3.3c$. As time goes by, light from ever-more-distant galaxies$^\dagger$ will reach us; that is $r_\mathrm{PH}$ increases. In other words, the observable Universe always increases in size, and no galaxy visible today will ever leave the observable Universe, no matter its speed. However, since future observable galaxies will be more and more redshifted, their light will eventually shift out of the visible range and into longer and longer radiowaves. Furthermore, the time between each detected photon will increase, so they will be dimmer and dimmer, and thus in practice, they will disappear. Intuitive explanation A good analogy for better understanding why light can reach us from a galaxy that recedes faster than light, is the "worm on a rubber band": Attach an (infinite stretchable) rubber band (of length, say, 10 cm) to a wall and walk away at any constant speed you choose, e.g. 1 m/s. Before you start, put your pet worm at the end near the wall. It wants to get back to you, and starts crawling at 1 cm/s, i.e. 100× slower than you. Will it ever reach you? If you look at it from the perspective of the wall, both you and the worm move away, but whereas you recede at a constant speed, the worm, although slower in the beginning, accelerates because it moves on the rubber band, but the part of the rubber band between the worm and the wall increases in size. The rest of the rubber band of course also increases in size, but that doesn't matter — as long as you have a constant speed, and the worm accelerates, it will reach you (although in this example, it will take the worm $10^{26}$ billion years, at which point it may have lost its patience. But if you walk at only 10 cm/s, it will take just 6 hours). In this analogy, you're the MW, the wall is GN-z11, and the worm is a photon. Now if you don't walk at a constant speed, but also accelerate (this is an analogy of the effect of dark energy), the worm may or may not reach you, depending on your speeds. Just like there is a limit to how distant galaxies we will ever be able to see. 

Since these processes don't cover equally the full temperature range, the gas will tend to reach certain "plateaus" in temperatures, i.e. it will tend to occupy certain specific temperatures. When gas cools, it contracts. From the ideal gas law, we know that the pressure $P$ is proportional to the product of the density $n$ and the temperature $T$. If there's pressure equilibrium in the ISM (which there isn't always, but in many cases is a good assumption), then $nT$ is constant, and thus if a parcel of hot ionized gas cools from $10^7\,\mathrm{K}$ to $10^4\,\mathrm{K}$, it must contract to increases its density by a factor $10^3$. Thus, cooler clouds are smaller and denser, and in this way the ISM is divided up in its various phases. So, to conclude, interstellar space is not as cold as you may think. However, being extremely dilute, it is difficult to transfer heat, so if you leave your spaceship, you will radiate away energy faster than you can absorb it from the gas. 

The apparent magnitudes of Sirius and the Sun are $m_\mathrm{Sir} =$ –1.46 and $m_\odot =$ –26.74, respectively. That means that the Sun is brighter than Sirius by a factor of $$ f = \frac{F_\odot}{F_\mathrm{Sir}} = 10^{-(m_\odot-m_\mathrm{Sir}) / 2.5} = 1.3\times10^{10}. $$ The area of your telescope should be larger than your 5" glass lens by the same factor to receive an equal amount of light. Thus, your telescope should have an aperture of $5\!\!" \times \sqrt{f} = 14.5\,\mathrm{km}$. Extrapolating (linearly in lin-log space) the evolution of telescopes from Galileo's 1620 telescope, the figure demonstrates that Roger H. will have his telescope ready by the year 2555, May 21 9:53 pm$^\dagger$. 

"…if one were to map every star visible to telescopes, there would be thousands." Even inside the Milky Way, 'thousands' is a severe understatement. Canis Minor spans an area of 183 deg$^2$. Although this is one of the smallest constellations, it still corresponds to roughly 0.5% of the sky. And although the direction to Canis Minor is more or less away from the center of the Milky Way, with 100 billion stars in the Milky Way this is still millions of stars. But why stop in the Milky Way? If you continue your sightline, roughly $10^{20}$ stars lie within the observable Universe, of probably infinitely (!) many more outside. The region, and hence the area, of Canis Minor and any other constellation is exactly defined by its coordinates on the sky, as shown by Aabaakawad's first figure. His second figure is from Johann Bode's Uranographia from 1801, at which time the boundaries weren't well-defined, but in 1930 the Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte devised the modern boundaries (which at that time were along vertical and horizontal lines of right ascension and declination, but due to Earth's precession are becoming more and more skewed).
