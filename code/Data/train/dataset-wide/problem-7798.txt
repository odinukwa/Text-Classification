Recently I have come across the books Combinatorial Commutative Algebra by Miller and Sturmfels along with Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra by Stanley. I will soon own a copy of each. I also purchased a used copy of Multiplicities and Chern Classes in Local Algebra by Roberts. My question is about the edge of research in commutative algebra. Which books (such as the above?) represent the edge of current research? By that I mean complete comprehension of such a book would prepare one to tackle a valuable (but doable) open problem for graduate research. Perhaps this edge is better represented by articles and papers. Are there a lot of these being published and how has this varied over time? I'm trying to get at the current state of the area of commutative algebra by considering the more concrete topic of current literature on the topic, especially the literature that is spawning new open problems. 

This was surprising because before that point I had considered the two sides of a coproduct to be reversible, but they can no longer be considered so if the first set is designated as the collection of "normal" outputs and the second set is designated as paramaterizing an "exceptional" result. My question: are there other places where an function/arrow to a coproduct is viewed as an alternative between a normal/regular outcome on one side and an exceptional/irregular outcome on the other? Though I can't think of many right now, I'm guessing there must be computations (etc) where coproducts have an asymmetric normal vs irregular interpretation. 

Does such a book exist? Perhaps a second volume such as "Topics in Smooth Manifolds" by John M. Lee would do. Alternatives to consider: 

First, some background: recently in learning more about functional programming I saw one use for coproducts that surprised me a little bit: A function $f: A \rightarrow B \coprod C$ may result when considering a computation that starts with an $a \in A$ and results with an element of $B$ unless "something exceptional happens" in which case it results in an element in $C$ that describes / paramaterizes some sort of 

Is there a single suitable reference to study for the smooth manifold (geometry) half of a typical Topology/Geometry PhD preliminary exam at an average AMS group I school? (Note: I know details about the presentation of these prelim tests varies, but at many schools there is a single Topology/Geometry exam, half of which is roughly smooth manifolds "Geometry" and the other half algebraic topology "Topology") Being a bibliophile, I've invested some time looking around at various qualifying exam syllabi until something stuck out: for Topology, relatively fewer books are listed. It seems quite often a book like Algebraic Topology by Hatcher is listed along with one or two others (seemingly to cover certain small gaps). Also, for Algebra, a few books often suffice... the books by Lang, Jacobson, and Dummit & Foote are often listed. One or two of these together with an outlier often suffice. Compare that to the situation with smooth manifolds. One site (which I lost track of... UCR?) I saw listed as many as 8 books as references for the topic! Many universities seem to use Guillemin & Pollack despite teaching manifolds abstractly, rather than as submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is understandable, but somewhat pedagogically suspect and in my own experience as a student, confusing. It appears that the topic of smooth manifolds needs an expository text that fills the same role for Geometry as does Algebraic Topology (Hatcher) does for Topology. Some sensible criteria: 

By the hypercube I mean the lattice formed by all n-bit strings ordered by pointwise inequality. For example, $000 \leq 110$, $010 \leq 110$, $110$ and $001$ are not comparable. Further we have the meet and join operations $\wedge$ and $\vee$ that take the pointwise max and min. For example $010 \wedge 110 = 010$ and $001 \vee 100 = 101$. A submodular measure $\mu$ is a function from the hypercube to nonnegative reals satisfying $\mu(x) + \mu(y) \geq \mu(x \wedge y) + \mu(x \vee y)$ for all $x$ and $y$. My question is, what is a minimal set of $(x,y)$ such that if the inequality above holds for these $(x,y)$ then it holds for all $(x,y)$ (and hence $\mu$ is submodular)? The question comes out of mere curiousity (I want to understand submodularity in a more intuitive way) - I first guessed it suffices to check all pairs of elements of same rank. I'm still not sure whether that's true. If $x$ and $y$ are comparable, then the inequality is vacuous by itself. 

I'm looking for nice explanations of these two facts. EDIT: by the topology inherited from projective space I do not mean the Zariski topology, but the classical topology (given by balls in the Euclidean metric on the affine space from which we construct projective space, say). Since I have no intuition for the Zariski topology in this embedding, I'm not even sure I've got the statement correct: one place where it occurs is on page 147 in Fulton's Young tableaux book. EDIT 2: I have gotten it wrong; Fulton claims only that the Zariski closures of the open cells equal their classical closures. But he also calls it a general fact. I guess the proper version of my first question should be: why are the Zariski closures of the open schubert cells equal to their classical closures in the Pluecker embedding, and is there a general fact from which this follows? 

There are two statements about the grassmannian (of complex k-planes in n-space embedded via Plucker coordinates) that I have encountered in several places never accompanied with a proof or reference. 

When I say "Markov chain" I think of a directed positively weighted (finite) graph, such that the sum of all edges going out of a vertex equals 1. Also I assume that it is aperiodic and irreducible. If the Markov chain happens to be equivalent to an "undirected Markov chain", i.e. for each directed arc (u,v) with weight w there is an arc (v,u) with same weight w, then it is easy to characterize the stationary distribution directly in terms of the graph; the stationary distribution at a vertex v is proportional to the out-degree (which in this case is half the total degree) of v. However I know of no such direct description of the stationary distribution in terms of the graph of a Markov chain that does not come from an undirected graph (except possibly for time-reversible chains, but this is a very special special case). My question is: are there any such descriptions? This is of course a bit vague(since the stationary distribution clearly depends only on the graph) but I hope it is not too vague. I would not expect an as easy description as in the undirected case (where it suffices to look in a neighbourhood of radius 1 to find the probability of any vertex), but it seems reasonable that there could be a description involving, say, all trees rooted at the vertex. This seems not to be treated in standard texts on Markov chains (correct me if wrong), where usually most effort is spent on proving existence, estimating speed of convergence, and the underlying graph is considered as 'auxilliary'.
