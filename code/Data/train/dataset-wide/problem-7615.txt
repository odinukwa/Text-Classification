Yes. Let $f:S^{1}\rightarrow S^{1}$ be continuous and injective. Then by compactness of $S^{1}$, the image $f[S^{1}]$ is homeomorphic to $S^{1}$. In particular, $f[S^{1}]$ is a compact connected subset of $S^{1}$, so $f[S^{1}]$ is either an interval or $S^{1}$ and $f[S^{1}]$ is not an interval since $f[S^{1}]$ is homeomorphic to $S^{1}$. Therefore $f[S^{1}]=S^{1}$. 

Suppose that $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}$ are ultrafilters on sets. Recall that $\mathcal{U}\leq_{RK}\mathcal{V}$ (here we say $\mathcal{U}$ is Rudin-Keisler less than or equal to $\mathcal{V}$) iff for each first order structure $\mathcal{A}$, the ultrapower $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{U}}$ is elementarily embeddable in $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{V}}$, and $\mathcal{U}=_{RK}\mathcal{V}$ (here we say $\mathcal{U}$ is Rudin-Keisler equivalent to $\mathcal{V}$) iff $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{U}}$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{V}}$ for each first order structure $\mathcal{A}$. If $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}$ are ultrafilters, then there is a unique up-to Rudin-Keisler equivalence ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}\cdot\mathcal{V}$ such that $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{U}\cdot\mathcal{V}}$ is isomorphic to $(\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{U}})^{\mathcal{V}}$ for all first order structures $\mathcal{A}$. I have a few questions about the product operation on ultrafilters. 

The fact that $\mathrm{crit}((x*x)*y)\leq\mathrm{crit}(x*y)$ is almost trivial when one assumes strong large cardinal hypotheses, but the fact that $\mathrm{crit}((x*x)*y)\leq\mathrm{crit}(x*y)$ has no known proof in ZFC. 

One can generate other examples of operations of higher arity, but these are rarely fundamental operations in algebraic structures. For example, discriminator terms and Mal'cev terms are usually not the fundamental operations of algebraic structures (the pattern algebras are an exception to this rule) and neither are operations such as the determinant. I should mention that the few ternary structures that do appear in the above three categories are usually obtained by “forgetting” the unit or origin or sense of direction in the original structure and when one adds the unit or least element back in, one obtains the original structure. In these structures, the ternary operation amounts to having two variables to replace the binary operation and a third variable to denote the missing origin. One should therefore be cautious in referring to these structures as true ternary structures. For example, in affine spaces and heaps, one forgets the unit of a group or a vector space. However, when one adds the unit to the heap or affine space, one ends up with groups or vector spaces. Likewise, median algebras can be obtained from bounded distributive lattices by forgetting which direction is up. However, a median algebra can be easily turned into a nearly distributive semilattice simply by declaring a certain element to be the least element. This phenomenon of obtaining ternary algebras by forgetting the origin of the algebraic structure also appears with some relational structures. For example, total cyclic orders are ternary relational structures which are obtained from totally ordered sets by forgetting the ordering of the ordered set but remembering the notion of orientation. The original linear ordering can be obtained from the cyclic ordering by applying a Dedekind cut to the cyclic ordering and this Dedekind cut plays the role of the origin or identity element in the previous examples. 

While some portions of the space $C$ appear to be just vertical or diagonal lines, if there exists a rank-into-rank cardinal, then every open subset of $C$ looks like a fractal (if you look very closely, then you will see some tiny branches coming out of the vertical and diagonal lines). Does there exist a connected (path-connected) open subset $U$ of $C$? Does there exist a component (path-component) of $C$ with a non-empty interior? Does there exist a single element component (path-component) of $C$? I suspect that the answer to these questions is no, but if the answer to these questions is no, then I also suspect that one will need large cardinal hypotheses to form a proof. 

Topological spaces where each point has a totally ordered local basis are known as $\textit{well-based}$ spaces. The notion of a well-based space is a generalization of the notion of a first countable space since the first countable spaces are the spaces where every point has a countable totally ordered local basis. A radial space is a topological space where $x\in\overline{A}$ iff there is some regular cardinal $\kappa$ and sequence $(a_{\alpha})_{\alpha<\kappa}$ of elements in $A$ where $(a_{\alpha})_{\alpha<\kappa}\rightarrow x$. Every well-based space is radial, and every radial space is the quotient of a well-based space. The papers 3,4 mention well-based spaces, but I have not found any other mathematical literature that mentions well-based spaces and calls these spaces well-based. Every first countable space is clearly well-based. Furthermore, if $X$ is a totally ordered set, then $X$ is well based in the order topology and in the lower limit topology. $\textbf{When the sets $\mathscr{O}_{x}$ have the same cofinality $\kappa$}$ The well-based spaces where each $\mathscr{O}_{x}$ has the same cofinality seem to have a special importance among all the well-based spaces. Suppose that $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal. Then define a $\kappa$-well based space to be a well based space where each $\mathscr{O}_{x}$ has a cofinal chain of cofinality $\kappa$. Even though the notion of a $\kappa$-well based space seems like a natural notion to study, I have not found any papers that mention $\kappa$-well based spaces. The notion of a $\kappa$-well based space is the correct generalization of the notion of a separable space to $\kappa$-complete spaces. Suppose that $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal. Then we say that a space $X$ is $\kappa$-complete if whenever $|I|<\kappa$ and $O_{i}$ is open for each $i\in I$, then $\bigcap_{i\in I}O_{i}$ is also open. Completely regular $\kappa$-complete spaces are also called $P_{\kappa}$-spaces. If $X$ is a topological space and $x\in X$, then define the character $\chi(X,x)$ of $X$ at $x$ to be the smallest cardinality of a subset $R\subseteq\mathscr{O}_{x}$ that generates $\mathscr{O}_{x}$. Clearly a topological space $X$ is $\kappa$-well based iff $X$ is a $\kappa$-complete space where either $x$ is isolated or $\chi(X,x)=\kappa$ for each $x\in X$. For example, the first countable spaces are precisely the $\kappa$-well based spaces. For example, the spaces where each $\mathscr{O}_{x}$ is generated by a chain of cofinality $\aleph_{0}$ are precisely the first countable spaces. It turns out that the $\kappa$-complete spaces $X$ where each $\mathscr{O}_{x}$ is generated by a chain of cofinality $\kappa$ behave very similar to the first countable spaces. In fact, the basic theory of $\kappa$-complete spaces is very similar to the basic theory of topological spaces since basic results about topological spaces often generalize the results about $\kappa$-complete spaces, ad the notion of a $\kappa$-well based space is the correct way to generalize the notion of a first countable space to $\kappa$-complete spaces. The papers 1,2 develop some of the basic theory of $\kappa$-complete spaces and generalize some facts about topological spaces to $\kappa$-complete spaces. $\kappa$-complete spaces can easily be generated by topological spaces. Suppose that $X$ is a topological space and $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal. Then define $(X)_{\kappa}$ to be the topological space with the same underlying set as $X$ but where $(X)_{\kappa}$ is generated by the basis consisting of sets of the form $\bigcap_{i\in I}U_{i}$ where each $U_{i}$ is open in $X$ and where $|I|<\kappa$. Then $(X)_{\kappa}$ is always a $\kappa$-complete space. The following results are a rather straightforward generalizations of results about first countable spaces, but they illustrate that the notion of a $\kappa$-well based space is the correct generalization of the notion of a first countable space. $\mathbf{Theorem}$ Suppose that $X$ is a $\kappa$-well based space. If $A\subseteq X$, then $x\in\overline{A}$ if and only if there is some sequence $(a_{\alpha})_{\alpha<\kappa}$ with $a_{\alpha}\in A$ for each $\alpha<\kappa$ converging to $x$. $\mathbf{Theorem}$ Suppose that $X$ is a $\kappa$-well based space. Let $Y$ be a topological space and let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a function. Then the following are equivalent. 

From the above result, we conclude that if $D$ is a discrete space, then $\beta D$ is an $F$-space. The following result can be found in [2] 

The order topology provides many examples of compact connected ordered sets which are totally path disconnected. A totally ordered set is said to be complete if it complete as a lattice. A totally ordered set $X$ is said to be dense if whenever $x<y$ then there is some $z$ with $x<z<y$. One can get a totally ordered set that is both complete and dense by taking the Dedekind-MacNielle completion of a dense totally ordered set. A totally ordered set is compact in the order topology if and only if it is complete, and a totally ordered set is connected in the order topology if and only if it is dense and every bounded nonempty subset has a least upper bound. Therefore the dense complete total orders are precisely the compact connected total orders. On the other hand, except for the trivial cases, a compact totally ordered set need not have any paths. To be more precise, if $X$ is a compact connected totally ordered set, then there is a path from a point $x$ to a point $y$ with $y>x$ if and only if the interval $[x,y]$ is order isomorphic to the unit interval in the real numbers. 

The notion that you are describing is somewhat related to the notion of the order dimension of a poset, a notion that has been studied in many papers. The order dimension of a poset $(X,\leq)$ is the smallest (in many cases) cardinal $\mu$ such that there exists a set $I$ with $|I|=\mu$ and a family of linear orders $(\preceq_{i})_{i\in I}$ such that $\leq$ is equal to $\bigcap_{i\in I}\preceq_{i}$. Equivalently, the order dimension of a poset $(X,\leq)$ is the smallest cardinal $\mu$ such that there is some set $I$ with $|I|=\mu$ and linear orders $(X_{i})_{i\in I}$ such that $(X,\leq)$ is isomorphic to a subposet of $\prod_{i\in I}(X_{i},\leq)$ with the pointwise ordering. 

Define the Fibonacci terms $t_{n}$ for all $n\geq 1$ by letting $t_{1}(x,y)=y,t_{2}(x,y)=x$, and $t_{n+2}(x,y)=t_{n+1}(x,y)*t_{n}(x,y)$ for all $n$. The Fibonacci terms are used in order to approximate the composition operation on an algebra of elementary embeddings with application. Let $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ denote the set of all elementary embeddings $j:V_{\lambda}\rightarrow V_{\lambda}$, and let $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}^{+}$ denote the set of all non-identity elementary embeddings from $V_{\lambda}$ to $V_{\lambda}$. Recall that $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ is endowed with a self-distributive operation $*$ called application defined by $j*k=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}j(k|_{V_{\alpha}})$. Let $\equiv^{\gamma}$ denote the congruence on $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ where $j\equiv^{\gamma}k$ precisely when $j(x)\cap V_{\gamma}=k(x)\cap V_{\gamma}$ for all $x\in V_{\gamma}$. Suppose that $j,k\in\mathcal{E}^{+}_{\lambda}$ and $\mathrm{crit}(k)\geq\mathrm{crit}(j)$. Then what are some lower bounds of the necessarily finite cardinality $$|\langle j,k\rangle\equiv^{\mathrm{crit}(t_{2n+1}(j,k))}|?$$ What are some lower bounds of the necessarily finite cardinality $$|\{\mathrm{crit}(l)|l\in\langle j,k\rangle,\mathrm{crit}(l)\leq\mathrm{crit}(t_{2n+1}(j,k))\}|?$$ 

Let $A_{n}=(\{1,\dots,2^{n}\},*_{n})$ be the $n$-th classical Laver table. Then $*_{n}$ is the unique operation on $\{1,\dots,2^{n}\}$ where $x*_{n}(y*_{n}z)=(x*_{n}y)*_{n}(x*_{n}z)$ and $x*_{n}1=x+1\mod 2^{n}$ whenever $x,y,z\in A_{n}$. Let $L_{n}:\{0,\dots,2^{n}-1\}\rightarrow\{0,\dots,2^{n}-1\}$ be the mapping that reverses the ordering of the digits in the binary expansion of the number in $\{0,\dots,2^{n}-1\}$. More explicitly, $$L_{n}(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}2^{k}a_{k})=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}2^{n-1-k}a_{k}$$ whenever $a_{0},\dots,a_{n-1}\in\{0,1\}$. Let $L_{n}^{\sharp}:\{1,\dots,2^{n}\}\rightarrow\{1,\dots,2^{n}\}$ be the mapping where $L_{n}^{\sharp}(x)=L_{n}(x-1)+1$. Define a binary operation $\#_{n}$ on $\{1,...,2^{n}\}$ by $$x\#_{n}y=L_{n}^{\sharp}(L_{n}^{\sharp}(x)*_{n}L_{n}^{\sharp}(y)).$$ Let $$C_{n}=\{(2^{-n}\cdot x,2^{-n}\cdot(x\#_{n}y))\mid x,y\in\{1,\dots,2^{n}\}\}.$$ Then $C_{n}\subseteq[0,1]\times[0,1]$ for all $n$. Furthermore, if we give the hyperspace $H([0,1]^{2})$ (where $H(X)$ is the collection of all closed subsets of $X$) the Hausdorff distance metric, then $C_{n}\rightarrow C$ for some compact space $C$. The following 512x512 image is an image of the compact space $C$. 

For this question, we say that a zero-dimensional space $X$ is $\omega$-pseudocompact if every partition of $X$ into clopen sets is finite. In other words, a zero-dimensional space $X$ is $\omega$-pseudocompact if and only if every continuous mapping $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ is bounded. One can easily show that a zero-dimensional space $X$ is $\omega$-pseudocompact if and only if every countable clopen cover of $X$ has a finite subcover. For zero-dimensional spaces, is $\omega$-pseudocompactness equivalent to pseudocompactness? For strongly zero-dimensional spaces, these properties are equivalent and I give a proof right here. Recall that a completely regular space $X$ is strongly zero-dimensional if the Stone-Cech compactification $\beta X$ is zero-dimensional. It is well known that a space $X$ is strongly zero-dimensional if and only if whenever $Z_{1},Z_{2}$ are disjoint zero-sets, then there is a clopen set containing $Z_{1}$ and disjoint from $Z_{2}$. If $X$ is strongly zero-dimensional and $f:X\rightarrow[0,\infty)$ is an unbounded continuous mapping, then since $f^{-1}[0,n],f^{-1}[n+1,\infty)$ are disjoint zero-sets, there is a clopen set $A_{n}$ containing $f^{-1}[0,n]$ but disjoint from $f^{-1}[n+1,\infty)$. The clopen cover $\{A_{n}|n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ has no finite subcover since $A_{0}\cup...\cup A_{n}$ does not intersect $f^{-1}[n+1,\infty]$ for all $n$. Therefore every strongly zero-dimensional space that is not pseudocompact is not $\omega$-pseudocompact, and clearly every pseudocompact space is $\omega$-pseudocompact.
