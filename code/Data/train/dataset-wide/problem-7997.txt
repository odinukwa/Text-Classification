What this boils down to is: if $\mathcal{K}$ is cofibrantly-generated model category which permits the small object argument and $\mathcal{D}$ is a small category, then when does $\mathcal{K}^\mathcal{D}$ permit the small object argument? This might be trivial depending on what exactly it means to "permit the small object argument". Since this is really a question about Quillen's small object argument, allow me to frame it in a minimal way. Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a cocomplete category and let $I$ be a set of morphisms in $\mathcal K$. Recall that the small object argument says: 

So $D$ and $D'$ differ by tensoring by the $\otimes$-invertible object $[D,D']$. And of course, since tensoring with a $\otimes$-invertible object is an equivalence of categories, the action map $L \mapsto L \otimes D$ is fully faithful; we've just seen it's essentially surjective, so it's an equivalence of groupoids. 

Algebraic $K$-theory of a symmetric monoidal category $C$ is defined in two steps: first take geometric realization, then group complete: $K(C) = \Omega B |C|$. In HAK II, Grayson (following Quillen) lifts the group completion step to the categorical level, defining a symmetric monoidal category $C^{-1} C$ such that $K(C) = |C^{-1} C|$. So $C^{-1} C$ is a "pre group completion" in the sense that it realizes to group completion. But what is the significance of $C^{-1}C$ qua symmetric monoidal category, before geometric realization? It's not the group completion at the categorical level. Although every object $c \in C$ has an "inverse" $c^{-1}$, and although there is an obvious map $I \to c \otimes c^{-1}$ (where $I$ is the monoidal unit), this map is not an isomorphism. In fact, there need not be a map in the other direction $c\otimes c^{-1} \to I$. Only upon geometric realization does the map $I \to c \otimes c^{-1}$ become invertible. So there remains the Question: What is the universal property of $C^{-1} C$ as a symmetric monoidal category? EDIT What is the relationship between the construction $C \mapsto C^{-1} C$ and group completion at the level of categories? Note that the nonexistence of a morphism $c \otimes c^{-1} \to I$ rules out something else: the free symmetric monoidal category with duals for objects on $C$ would also realize to $K(C)$, but that category would have both unit and counit maps, whereas $C^{-1}C$ has only unit maps. It's probably worth recalling the construction. An object of $C^{-1} C$ (by which I really mean $Iso(C)^{-1} C$ in Grayson/Quillen's notation) is a pair of objects of $C$, which we may write $c_1^{-1} \otimes c_2$. A morphism $c_1^{-1} \otimes c_2 \to d_1^{-1} \otimes d_2$ is an equivalence class of triples $(c,f_1,f_2)$ where $c \in C$, $f_1: c_1 \otimes c \to d_1$ is an isomorphism in $C$, and $f_2: c_2 \otimes c \to d_2$ is a morphism in $C$; these are modded out by the diagonal action of $Aut_C(c)$. Defining composition can be done by following your nose. Grayson/Quillen's construction actually applies more generally to any symmetric monoidal category $S$ acting on a category $C$, producing a category $S^{-1}C$, but I'd be happy with understanding the case $S = Iso(C)$, and perhaps even with the restriction that $C$ be a groupoid. 

The symmetry on $L$ is given by $\sigma_{L,L} = \frac 1 {\dim L} 1_{L \otimes L}$. $(\dim L)^2 = 1$. In particular, if $End_{\mathcal C}(I)$ is a domain, then $\dim L = \pm 1$. 

Take the colimit of the underlying (simplicial) graphs. Apply the free functor. Mod out by all relations that existed in the (simplicial) categories you're taking the colimit of. 

Point (1), in particular, leads me to want to view bundles as a "relative version of manifolds" (although vector bundles in particular happen to have a much smaller structure group). I suppose all of this could be considered in other types of geometry, too -- e.g. the same sort of analogy holds between schemes and certain kinds of sheaves over schemes. But I'd like to be able to state this in some precise way. I'd also like to understand whether the analogy stops there, or whether there's a whole hierarchy of notions of which these are just 0th-order and 1st-order notions. 

A map $p: E \to B$ is a fiber bundle iff it is locally in $(\mathsf{Top}, \mathsf{Triv})$ where $\mathsf{Triv}_U$ is the category of projections $F \times U \to U$ and homeomorphisms between them. A map $p: E \to B$ is a fiber bundle with structure group $G$ iff it is locally in $(\mathsf{Top}, \mathsf{Triv}_G)$ where $(\mathsf{Triv}_G)_U$ consists of projection maps $F \times U \to U$ where $F$ is one among a specific list of $G$-spaces, and $G$-equivariant maps. [Hurewicz and Huebsch] (Key example!) If $B$ is paracompact, a map $p: E \to B$ is a fibration iff it is locally a fibration, i.e. locally in the class $(\mathsf{Top}, \mathsf{Fib})$, where $\mathsf{Fib}_U$ is the class of all fibrations over $U$, and homeomorphisms between them. (Less important) A smooth manifold is an identity map $B = B$ which is locally modeled on $\mathcal{U}$ being open subsets of Euclidean space and smooth maps, and $\mathcal{F}_U$ consisting of identity maps. 

A "nice" category $\mathcal{C}$ should be (for the purposes of this question) locally presentable at a minimum, and maybe a bit more. One might require $\mathcal{C}$ to be (in roughly order of increasing restrictiveness) 

One sense in which the category $\mathbf{Fld}$ of fields is algebraic is that it forms what Adámek and Rosický call a generalized variety, more systematically called a $\mathbb{D}$-accessible category for the doctrine $\mathbf{D}$ of finite products. Generalized varieties are to algebraic categories as accessible categories are to locally presentable categories: for one thing, they are the "non-cocomplete" version. This seems to capture the fact that fields can be defined with operations that are total, along with some conditions that are not total. $\mathbf{Fld}$ is sketchable by a (finite, product, finite coproduct) sketch (example 4.3 of the first link above). In principle, this means that the theory of fields can be interpreted in any category with finite products and finite coproducts, although this doesn't necessarily yield the "right" notion: for example, if we define a topological field this way, then the identity element has to be disconnected from the rest of the field. For comparison, algebraic categories can be sketched by finite products alone; locally presentable categories can be sketched by finite limits, and arbitrary finitely accessible categories can require finite limits as well as aribtrary colimits. So categorical algebra does provide some sense in which fields are a bit more algebraic than an arbitrary first-order theory, even if it's not a fantastically compelling sense. 

We can also conclude that if $X$ has a simplification $X \to X^s$, then it factors through the plus construction $X \to X^+ \to X^s$, and $X^s$ is also the simplification of $X^+$. So in asking which spaces $X$ admit a simplification, we can reduce to the case where $\pi_1(X)$ is solvable (at least under suitable finiteness assumptions). Warning: From here on, this discussion grows increasingly aimless. Because Eilenberg-MacLane spaces are simple, a simplification is a (co)homology isomorphism. Assume $X^s$ exists, and write $G = \pi_1(X), G^s = \pi_1(X^s)$. If $G \to G^s$ is not surjective, then it lifts to some cover $\overline{X^s}$ of $X^s$. On homology, $X^s$ is a retract of $\overline{X^s}$, but both spaces have abelian fundamental group so it's also a retract on $\pi_1$. But the map on $\pi_1$ is injective, so it is an isomorphism. Hence $G \to G^s$ is surjective after all, and is precisely the quotient by the commutator subgroup, i.e. we have $G^s = G^{ab}$. So the cofiber of $X \to X^s$ is acyclic and is also simply-connected, so is contractible. Since the 1-truncation functor preserves cofiber sequences, the map $BG \to BG^{ab}$ likewise has trivial cofiber. So $BG \to BG^{ab}$ is a homology isomorphism. I'm not sure where to go from there, so instead, let's pick off a special case. Assume that $G$ is abelian, so $G = G^{ab}= G^s$. Then by comparing fiber sequences $\tilde X \to X \to BG$ and $\tilde X^s \to X^s \to BG$ (where tilde's denote universal covers), we see that $H_\ast(\tilde X^s) = H_\ast(\tilde X)_G$ and in addition, the map $H_\ast(\tilde X) \to H_\ast(\tilde X)_G$ is an equivalence on $G$-homology, for any constant coefficients. So for example, if $G$ is a finitely-generated torsion-free abelian group and $H_\ast(X)$ is finitely-generated in each degree over $G$, then I think we can conclude that $X$ was already at least weakly simple (i.e. has trivial $\pi_1$-action on $H_\ast$). 

Let me explain why the question, raised in the comments, of what the morphisms of $M$ are, sheds a lot of light on this question. If $T$ is a first-order theory I will use $\mathrm{Mod}(T)$ to denote its category of models with elementary embeddings as morphisms, and $\mathrm{Hom}(T)$ to denote its category of models with homomorphisms as morphisms. Observation: Let $M$ be a category and $U: M \to \mathsf{Set}$ a functor, and suppose that $U$ factors through the non-full subcategory $\mathsf{Set}_\mathrm{inj}$ of sets and injective maps. Suppose also that $U$ has a left adjoint. Then: 

Public Service Announcement! It's very confusing -- I'd daresay incorrect -- to say "directed limit" to mean "limit indexed by a cofiltered diagram". Actually, historically the term "directed limit" has been used to mean "colimit indexed by a filtered diagram" or even just "colimit"-- this usage predates the introduction of the terms "limit" and "colimit", I believe. The term you're looking for is "inverse limit", or if you want to be 100% clear, say "cofiltered limit" (because "inverse limit" has sometimes been used to just mean "limit"). Answer to Question: Now to your question. As mentioned in the comments, if $C$ is a symmetric monoidal category then the Day convolution is a universal way to turn $C$ into a cocomplete category with a symmetric monoidal product that preserves colimits in each variable. It's straightforward to check that the Day convolution restricts to a symmetric monoidal structure on the Ind-completion of $C$, denoted $Ind(C)$, with $\otimes$ preserving filtered colimits in each variable. Here $Ind(C) \subset [C^\mathrm{op},\mathsf{Set}]$ is the full subcategory of presheaves which are filtered colimits of representables. It is the universal category with filtered colimits generated by $C$, and so the Day convolution makes it the universal way to turn $C$ into a symmetric monoidal category with filtered colimits preserved in each variable by $\otimes$. To get a similar universal construction for cofiltered limits, just dualize everything. The dual Day convolution is a symmetric monoidal structure on $[C,\mathsf{Set}]^\mathrm{op}$ preserving limits in each variable, and restricts to a symmetric monoidal structure the Pro-completion of $C$, $Pro(C) = Ind(C^\mathrm{op})^\mathrm{op} \subset [C,\mathsf{Set}]^\mathrm{op}$, which preserves cofiltered limits in each variable. $Pro(C)$ is the universal category with cofiltered limits on $C$, and it consists of those copresheaves on $C$ which are filtered colimits of representables -- with morphisms being natural transformations in the opposite direction. Caveat emptor: The $Ind$ and $Pro$ completions really are universal. In particular, the inclusion $C \to Ind(C)$ does not preserve filtered colimits that might happen to exist in $C$ / dually the inclusion $C \to Pro(C)$ does not preserve cofiltered limits that might happen to exist in $C$. So if you are interested in the cofiltered limits that already exist in $C$, then $Pro(C)$ will be unsatisfactory for you because the Pro construction simply ignores all existing cofiltered limits and freely adds in new ones. (This is just like how if $G$ is a group, then the free group $F(G)$ on the underlying set of $G$ will completely ignore the existing multiplication on $G$.) However, if $C$ already has cofiltered limits, then the inclusion $C \to Pro(C)$ will have a right adjoint which takes an object of $Pro(C)$, which you can think of as a formal cofiltered limit, and evaluates that limit in $C$ (in the group analogy, if $G$ is a group then there is a canonical group homomorphism $F(G) \to G$ which multiplies together formal words in the group language over $G$). Then you can start asking questions like how this functor interacts with the Day convolution. Of course, if you don't care about cofiltered limits that might happen to be present in $C$, then $Pro(C)$ is probably exactly what you want. It's nice to know, though, that $C \to Ind(C)$ does preserve finite colimits / $C \to Pro(C)$ does preserve finite limits. Supplementary note: If you're not familiar with the $Ind$ and $Pro$ completions, I should probably tell you that $Ind(C)$ can alternately be described as follows. An object consists of a filtered category $I$ and a diagram $X: I \to C$. The homsets are $Hom_{Ind(C)}(X: I \to C, Y: J \to C) = \varprojlim_{i \in I} \varinjlim_{j \in J} Hom_C(X_i,Y_j)$. Dually, an object in $Pro(C)$ consists of a cofiltered category $P$ and a diagram $Z: P \to C$. The homsets are $Hom_{Pro(C)}(Z: P \to C, W: Q \to C) = \varprojlim_{q \in Q} \varinjlim_{p \in P} Hom_C(Z_p, W_q)$. This is a quite explicit sense in which $Ind(C)$ consists of "formal filtered colimits" / $Pro(C)$ consists of "formal cofiltered limits" -- the objects literally are the diagrams you want to take the (co)limit of! 

In a Kan extension $\mathrm{Lan}_F G$, $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} A @>G>> C\\ @VFVV \nearrow \mathrm{Lan}_F G \\ B \end{CD} If $F$ is fully faithful and the extension is pointwise, then the comparison 2-cell is an isomorphism. This is because, if the extension is pointwise, we have $C(\mathrm{Lan}_G F(Fa),c) \cong [A^\mathrm{op},\mathsf{Set}]( B(F-,Fa),C(G-,c))$ $\qquad \qquad \qquad \, \cong [A^\mathrm{op},\mathsf{Set}]( A(-,a),C(G-,c))$ $\qquad \qquad \qquad \, \cong C(Ga,c)$ and we can take $c = Fa'$. In order to get an example of a fully faithful $F$ such that $\mathrm{Lan}_F G$ does not have an isomorphism for a comparison cell, we need to move beyond monoids, because a fully faithful functor between monoids is an isomorphism. So the simplest sort of fully faithful functor which is not an equivalence would be the inclusion $F: \mathbf{B}M \to \mathbf{B}M_+$ of a monoid into the category which freely adjoins either an initial or terminal object to it. If we adjoin a terminal object, then left Kan extensions will all be pointwise (with the terminal object being sent to the colimit of the original diagram), so we adjoin an initial object instead. And we might as well take $M$ to be the simplest possible monoid $\mathbb{N}$: $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} \mathbf{B}\mathbb{N} @>G>> C\\ @VFVV \nearrow L \\ \mathbf{B}\mathbb{N}_+ \end{CD} It turns out there is a "minimal" $C$ admitting such a left Kan extension $L$, which looks like this: $G\bullet \overset{(\eta_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}}{\overset{\to}{\to}} L\bullet \overset{L!}{\leftarrow} L\emptyset$ Here $G\bullet$ is the fully faithful image of $G$ (so it's a copy of $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{N}$), and $L\emptyset \overset{L!}{\to} L\bullet$ is the fully faithful image of $L$ (so it's a copy of $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{N}_+$ where $L\emptyset$ is the initial object). $C(G\bullet, L\bullet)$ is generated by an arrow $\eta = \eta_0$ under the equation $\eta_n = \eta \circ Gn = Ln \circ \eta$. So $\eta$ constitutes a comparison natural transformation $G \implies LF$. An exhaustive analysis of the functors $H: \mathbf{B}\mathbb{N}_+ \to C$ (there are 5 families of them, depending on where the objects are sent) reveals that the only one which admits a natural transformation $G \implies HF$ or $L \implies H$ is $L$ itself, and this diagram is in fact a left Kan extension $L = \mathrm{Lan}_F G$ with $F$ fully faithful, but the comparison 2-cell $\eta$ is not invertible. 

An observation that's too long for a comment: Categories are monads in the bicategory $\mathsf{Span}$ of spans. Monoids are monads in the one-object bicategory associated to the monoidal category $(\mathsf{Set},\times)$. Posets are monads in the bicategory $\mathsf{Rel}$ of relations. The correct notion of morphism can in each case be recovered by beefing up the bicategory to a proarrow equipment. So another version of the question would be whether there's a construction that takes a bicategory and a monoidal category and gives you another bicategory, which sends $(\mathsf{Rel},\mathsf{Set})$ to $\mathsf{Span}$. I'm not sure this is any more promising, but it moves the complexity around a bit. 

At the end I'll give you a reference to a counterexample in the paper of Meier and Ozornova. But before that, I want to talk in the other direction: besides the 3-arrow calculus that Charles Rezk mentions, there's another sense in which $W$ "almost" admits a calulus of fractions. It's a result in the same paper. Recall the functor $\mathrm{Ex}: \mathsf{sSet} \to \mathsf{sSet}$, which is right adjoint to barycentric subdivision. There is a canonical natural transformation $1 \Rightarrow \mathrm{Ex}$, allowing to define maps $\mathrm{Ex}^n \to \mathrm{Ex}^{n+1}$ for every $n$, and most famously the colimit $\mathrm{Ex}^\infty$ was shown by Kan to be a fibrant replacement functor for the Kan-Quillen model structure on $\mathsf{sSet}$; in particular $\mathrm{Ex}^\infty X$ is a Kan complex for every simplicial set $X$ (I don't know if this extends further -- is $\mathrm{Ex}^\infty f$ a Kan fibration for every simplicial map $f$? Is $\mathrm{Ex}F$ injective-fibrant for every diagram $F$?). But moreover, a functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ between categories is fibrant in the Thomason model structure on $\mathsf{Cat}$ iff $\mathrm{Ex}^2 F$ is a Kan fibration (where we identify a category with its nerve). All of this is just to motivate looking at $\mathrm{Ex}^2 \mathcal{C}$ for a category $\mathcal{C}$. Meier and Ozornova show that if $W$ is the category of weak equivalences in a model category (actually, only a substantially weaker structure called a "partial model category" is necessary), then $\mathrm{Ex}^2 W$ is a Kan complex (i.e. $W$ is Thomason-fibrant). Why am I telling you this? Well, Meier and Ozornova also show something surprisingly (to me) clean:
