To prevent eye damage, a filter covering the objective (full aperture, energy rejection, safety film, etc.) is mandatory. An eyepiece filter also needs an objective filter to protect against overheating. Sunspots are visible without an expensive narrowband filter. A filter for the hydrogen-alpha (H$\alpha$) line or the calcium line you linked to can show more detail within the solar disk or prominences around the edge. Sky & Telescope has several articles about observing the Sun. 

Backer and Sramek 1999 observed that relative to more distant radio sources, the galactic center Sgr A* had a heliocentric proper motion of about -6 milliarcseconds per year in galactic longitude. Reid et al. 1999 reported a similar result. Looking from NGP to SGP, galactic longitude increases counterclockwise, a decrease in longitude is a clockwise motion, and the Sun revolves clockwise around the galactic center. 

Image source: Wikimedia Commons Joseph-Nicolas Delisle in 1760 reasoned that observers at different geographic longitudes would see the transit begin or end at different times. His method did not require anyone to see the entire transit but did require accurate absolute timekeeping. In practice, the black drop effect introduced significant timing errors which limited the precision of the distance measurement. However, after another transit in 1769, the astronomical community managed to determine the astronomical unit within a few percent of the presently accepted value.

The images in the question show a progression from severely out of focus (large disc with shadow of secondary mirror) to nearly in focus (six-way diffraction pattern). There are a few things you can try: 

For a small region not far from the equator, an equirectangular projection will do. If you want celestial north to be up, declination should increase from bottom to top, and right ascension should increase from right to left. To correct the aspect ratio, scale the RA axis by cos(dec). Then the sun and moon are circles of the respective angular radii, without the RA scale factor. In the equation for $z$, $\Delta$ is the declination of the sun, $\delta$ is the declination of the moon, and $a$ is the difference in their right ascensions. 

Only if it happens to be 206 kpc away, i.e. 1/4 of the distance from here to the Andromeda galaxy. A parsec is the distance at which 1 AU makes an angle of 1 arcsecond. If the nebula is 100 parsecs away and has an angular diameter of 250 arcseconds, then its diameter is $$100 \ \mathrm{pc} \times 250 \ \mathrm{as} = 25000 \ \mathrm{AU} = 0.12\,\mathrm{pc}$$ 

Here is the IAU Minor Planet Center's list of known observations of 2016 HO3. The Pan-STARRS people located observations from 2011-2015 in their archive. The 2004 observation occurred in an SDSS survey image (DR3?). It may be possible to retrieve an old SDSS image showing the asteroid. 

Tehran (35.7$^\circ$ N) has 23 fewer minutes of daylight than Rafsanjan (30.4$^\circ$ N) on Nov 26 because the Sun is 21$^\circ$ south of the celestial equator and Tehran is 5.3$^\circ$ farther north than Rafsanjan. For the same reason, the north pole has 24-hour night and the south pole has 24-hour daylight at this time of year. On May 26, when the Sun's declination is 21$^\circ$ north, Tehran has 25 more minutes of daylight than Rafsanjan does, and the north pole has 24 more hours of daylight than the south pole does. 

Your reasoning is correct: if Mercury orbited in the same plane as Earth, we'd see it transit the Sun every 4 months or so. In fact these orbital planes are inclined 7 degrees to each other, and the other major planets' orbits are inclined 1 to 3 degrees relative to Earth's. The planets perturb each other's orbits slightly, so no planet's orbit is perfectly planar. However, the Solar system average plane of all orbits and rotations is invariable, and most individual planets' orbits will remain near it for millions of years. 

Not in general, but sometimes there is a dominant direction. When the Earth passes through a stream of debris from a comet or asteroid, a meteor shower occurs, and those meteors appear to come from a point in the sky called the radiant. Since the parent bodies have different orbits, different shower radiants appear in different parts of the sky. For example, the Geminid radiant culminates earlier in the night than most, and the Perseid radiant is well north of the Ecliptic. As the Earth can encounter meteors from any direction at any time, there are usually a few sporadic meteors unrelated to any active radiant. Meteor observers have identified some not quite random directions for these. 

Understanding how things work out in space is only half the fun; the other half is seeing them with your own eyes. Field guides by Pasachoff and others can help bring the two together. Magazines like Sky & Telescope offer information about temporarily observable objects like comets and cover science news at level between mass media and academic journals. Hands-on observing experience can motivate programming projects in ways that textbooks can't. Given the free availability of such good software as Stellarium and JPL HORIZONS, and libraries like Astropy, it's wise not to spend much time reinventing wheels. On the other hand, implementing a few things yourself will expose you to various astronomy, math, algorithm, and data structure issues. You can always check your work against off-the-shelf tools, or better yet, against the real sky. 

= 0 and = 0 place the vernal equinox at the zenith, so most points on the ecliptic should have azimuth either degrees north of east or degrees south of west. Try other values for or and see if the resulting azimuths make sense. 

Yes, see graph. At the March equinox, the Sun's ecliptic longitude $\lambda_\odot$ is zero, and the Sun's declination $\delta_\odot$ is zero and increasing. At the June solstice, $\lambda_\odot$ is 90$^\circ$ and $\delta_\odot$ is at a maximum, 23.5$^\circ$ north of the equator. At the September equinox, $\lambda_\odot$ is 180$^\circ$ and $\delta_\odot$ is zero and decreasing. At the December solstice, $\lambda_\odot$ is 270$^\circ$ and $\delta_\odot$ is at a minimum of -23.5$^\circ$. 

IRNSS is intended to serve an area spanning 100 degrees in longitude by 80 degrees in latitude. Anywhere in that service area, at any time, a receiver needs to compare distances to four of the satellites. To determine latitude, the satellites can't all be above the equator, so some of the orbits are inclined 29$^\circ$. Those satellites oscillate north-south in pairs. Polar orbits aren't needed; global systems serve the poles with orbits inclined only 55$^\circ$. 

The constellations are artifacts of visual pattern recognition, many dating back to antiquity. As the stars are distributed unevenly, naturally some constellations are larger than others. Ptolemy catalogued 48 of them around 150 CE. The other 40 were added between 1596 and 1763, either to cover the far southern sky or to fill gaps between the older figures. Ian Ridpath gives a comprehensive history in Star Tales. The modern constellation boundaries were standardized in the 1920s by an IAU committee led by Eug√®ne Delporte. Their goals were to assign each square degree of sky unambiguously to one constellation, to be consistent with scientific literature already published, and to preserve the traditional figures where possible. Equal size wasn't on the agenda. The boundaries align with the equatorial grid as of 1875: 

Double star expert Bruce MacEvoy explains orbital elements in maybe enough detail to help you work out some state vectors. My search also turned up a book chapter by Andreas Alzner. 

In our moving Earth-based point of view, retrograde apparent motion means a planet's geocentric ecliptic longitude is temporarily decreasing instead of increasing as usual. The word "apparent" avoids confusion with a retrograde orbit. All major planets' orbits are prograde, with heliocentric longitude increasing at all times1. Most retrograde-orbiting Solar system objects are comets. As seen from Earth, the apparent angular separation between two planets near the ecliptic is approximately2 the difference between their geocentric longitudes at that point in time, regardless of their rates of change in longitude. Even if you plot this value versus time, your calculation need not break apparent motion down into positive and negative cases. 

According to Cropper and Katz 2011 part 2.2, the RVS working group considered other bands, but the ~850 nm band is relatively unaffected by absorption in the Earth's atmosphere, facilitating ground-based preparation and follow-up. In addition to the strong Ca II triplet, this band is rich in lines enabling study of astrophysical quantities other than radial velocity, adding to the science return on the spectrometer investment. For type B and hotter stars, a small minority of the population, they hope to get radial velocity from the Paschen hydrogen series, which accounts for the wide troughs at 854.3, 859.6, and 866.3 nm in the top of Munari 2001 figure 2. 

I don't know of a standard term for that quantity, but I'd call it the ecliptic latitude of the zenith. With north positive and south negative, this would reach a minimum at 6:00 and a maximum at 18:00 local sidereal time. These correspond to local solar noon or midnight at the solstices and occur 2 hours earlier per month. The vectors perpendicular to the ecliptic are called the ecliptic poles. The zenith only coincides with one of these on the Arctic or Antarctic circle, at sunrise (winter-spring) or sunset (summer-fall). 

The AAVSO eclipsing binary section is a good place to start reading. Their how-to articles address eclipsing binary specific issues such as predicting times of minimum. To get a list of observable Algol-type stars, try their observation planner tool with variable type . When you've selected a target, you can use their variable star plotter to make finder and comparison charts. Finally their guide to CCD photometry has technical advice on image capture and analysis. 

The set of reference frames which IAU adopted in 2000 and implemented in 2003 was motivated by the extreme precision requirements of very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI). The difference between the old and new expressions for GMST is zero on 2003-01-01 and negligible within a century of that date unless you are doing VLBI yourself. The results you previously got for 2003-10-17 could be due to inverting an addition or subtraction somewhere, maybe in normalizing to [0, 360]. If you try again, it may come out right as it did for 1987-04-10. 

A 10x25 or similar monocular should be able to project a usable image for a modest cost. Its theoretical angular resolution in yellow light would be 6 arcseconds, significantly smaller than Mercury at inferior conjunction. Focused on a screen 50cm away, the Sun image would be 45mm wide and 30% as bright as direct sunlight. I recommend surrounding the monocular with a sheet of cardboard to shade the screen. Until the next transit in November 2019, it would probably show sunspots too. 

The ATNF Pulsar Catalogue's galactic longitude and latitude are heliocentric, but the origin of their rectangular coordinates is near the center of our galaxy. The catalogue documentation, section 6. Distances, says: 

The beam profile of a radio telescope characterizes its sensitivity to signals as a function of angle off axis. This is usually divided into a main beam in the target direction and sidelobes in other directions. As this figure from Hill et al. 2009 shows, the WMAP main beams and near sidelobes were rather complex: 

SDSS DR12 Catalog Data looks like a good starting point, apparently pretty open to those willing and able to figure it out. Their SciServer Compute site hosts Jupyter notebooks to query CasJobs in SQL. The Large Scale Structure galaxy catalog under BOSS value added catalogs may also be relevant. 

Most lunar craters are too small to resolve with the naked eye; I would measure a published photograph. A crater near the limb appears as an ellipse whose minor axis is foreshortened but whose major axis measures about the same as if the crater were centrally located. Surface curvature has little effect on this measurement because most craters are small compared to the lunar radius. 

Assuming that you have a phaser array sufficiently powerful to pulverize the NEO into a harmless meteor storm, I read this as a question of when an object with those geocentric orbital elements arrives at perigee. However, I get a different value for $r$ if I treat that $\nu$ value as a true anomaly; it could be a mean anomaly or hyperbolic anomaly instead. I suppose your textbook covers this stuff in detail, but for other readers these lecture notes by M. Peet at ASU, using $f$ instead of $\nu$, may help. 

The Minor Planet Center inconspicuously puts this under "Distant Artificial Satellites Observation." DASO Circulars 561-566 have observations of the roadster 2018-017A. It's also on the short list of artificial objects for which MPC can generate ephemerides. 

The angle between the observer's zenith, any given celestial object, and the north celestial pole is the object's parallactic angle. This angle $q$ depends on the object's hour angle $H$ and declination $\delta$, and the observer's geographic latitude $\varphi$: $$ \tan q = {{\sin H} \over {\tan \varphi \cos \delta - \sin \delta \cos H}} $$ At local apparent solar noon, $H_\odot$ = 0 and $q_\odot$ = 0 as you expect. The Sun's declination is roughly $$ \delta_\odot \approx \varepsilon \sin \left({2\pi {D - 79 \over 365.25}}\right)$$ where $D$ is the day of the year and $\varepsilon$ is the 23.44$^\circ$ tilt of the Earth's axis. The position angle $P$ of the Sun's north pole relative to the north celestial pole depends on both $\varepsilon$ and the Sun's 7.25$^\circ$ axial tilt relative to the ecliptic plane. These two components combine somewhat out of phase, roughly $$ P \approx -26.3^\circ \sin \left(2\pi {{D - 5} \over 365.25}\right) $$ Meeus's Astronomical Algorithms gives more precise formulas for the above in terms of the Sun's ecliptic longitude $\lambda_\odot$, taking the Earth's orbital eccentricity and other factors into account. The angle of the Sun's equator with respect to the observer's horizon is the same as the angle of the Sun's north pole with respect to the observer's zenith, $P - q_\odot$. 

Relative to the Sun, stars, and Earth's shadow, the Moon always appears to move from west to east. How this looks relative to the horizon depends on your latitude and time of day. If a solar eclipse occurs in the middle of the day, the Moon appears to move from right to left if you're in a northern latitude, or from left to right if you're in a southern latitude. If you're in a tropical latitude, the Moon appears to move downward if the eclipse occurs in the morning or upward if in the afternoon. 

Stellarium 0.14 or later has a checkbox under Configuration, Tools, Planetarium options: Include nutation. If I uncheck it, the RA and Dec of date for those stars on 2016/1/1 match yours within 0.2 arcsecond. Some libraries distinguish between astrometric and apparent positions, aberration making up to 20 arcseconds difference. 

Total and annular solar eclipses occur where the Sun-Earth-Moon angle is 0$^\circ$. Where that angle is smaller than 0.5$^\circ$ but not 0$^\circ$, there is a partial solar eclipse. The Sun-Moon-Earth angle at those times is 180$^\circ$. Due to the Moon's orbital inclination, most new moons miss eclipse alignment, some by as much as 5$^\circ$. 

Phase functions are nonlinear in general, but Pluto presents such a small range of phases to Earth that a linear approximation will do: about 0.03 mag/deg for Pluto and 0.08 mag/deg for Charon, or 0.04 mag/deg for the two together. The Stern and Tholen book summarizes the estimates up to 1997. A search for Pluto phase coefficient yields some of the papers behind those and more recent estimates. 

Sources: F. Espenak, JPL HORIZONS From a Moon-centric point of view, the umbra of a solar eclipse moves straight along the ecliptic, but several factors shape its path on the Earth's surface. The terrestrial longitude of a path is directly related to the time of day (UT). A path's terrestrial latitude is very sensitive to the Moon's ecliptic latitude and is also affected by the Sun's declination. Due to the tilt of the Earth's axis, an eclipse path slants southwest-northeast near the March equinox, bends southward near the June solstice, slants northwest-southeast near the September equinox, or bends northward near the December solstice. The Moon's motion in ecliptic latitude also contributes a slight slant, northward at ascending node or southward at descending node, as the umbra passes west to east. Both the 2017-2024 and 2027-2034 eclipse pairs occur near opposite equinoxes and at similar times of day, so their paths naturally have opposite slants and similar ranges of longitude. The 2030 and 2037 eclipse paths have similar ranges of latitude but barely cross because they occur 4 hours apart in the day. Eclipses in the same saros series, if not widely separated in longitude, occur at the same time of year and have nearly parallel paths with few opportunities to cross.
