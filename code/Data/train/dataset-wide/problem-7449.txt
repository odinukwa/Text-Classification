Yes. The boundary even has a locally finite Haudsorff $(m-1)$-measure. No. A convex function of 1 variable has increasing derivative, but this derivative can have a dense set of jumps. 

Oh yes! Establishing a connection between some class of natural phenomena and a well known field of mathematics can make you famous. And you do not have to prove new theorems. The most striking recent example is Benoit Mandelbrot. According to the Google Scholar he is THE MOST cited mathematician of all. And all his activity was exactly as you describe. Even before fractals, he was looking for new connections between "well known" fields of mathematics and real world. For example he was looking for "stable probability distributions" everywhere, "power laws" etc. But his greatest success was "fractals". The relevant mathematics was known for about 50 years. Well known to a very narrow circle of specialists, as it happens to most areas of pure mathematics. He invented a catchy word "fractal" and then showed by examples that "fractals are everywhere". I don't know a single new theorem that Mandelbrot proved. But his influence on mathematics and science was really enormous. On a smaller scale we have "Kramers Kronig" relations (see wikipedia). Which is nothing else but the "well known" Sokhotskii-Plemelj formula. It is not important that Kramers and Kronig discovered these known relations independently. What is important is that they proposed a physical interpretation. And there are thousands of examples like this. You can even receive a Nobel prize by establishing a new relation to the real world of some well known mathematics. 

No, it is not complete. Completion of this space is called $H^2(D)$. It consists of all analytic functions for which $$\| f\|^2:=\sup_r\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}|f(re^{i\theta})|^2d\theta$$ is finite, or alternatively $$f(z)=\sum_0^\infty a_nz^n,\quad \sum_0^\infty|a_n|^2<\infty,$$ or alternatively, all those function in $L_2(-\pi,\pi)$ whose negative Fourier coefficients vanish. For an example of a function which is in $H^2$ but not continuous in the closed disk, take $$\exp\left(\frac{z+1}{z-1}\right)$$ which is bounded in the unit disk, therefore belongs to $H^2$ but is not continuous because the boundary values have absolute value $1$ except at $z=1$ where the radial limit is $0$. 

I do not know about any connection with Weil's conjectures, and this should be considered an extended comment rather than an answer. Actually Ruelle was wrong when he said that this result "remains isolated" in mathematics. A new proof which fits very well into "manstream" mathematics was given in 1981 in MR0623156 (83c:82008) Lieb, Elliott H.; Sokal, Alan D. A general Lee-Yang theorem for one-component and multicomponent ferromagnets. Comm. Math. Phys. 80 (1981), no. 2, 153â€“179. It uses a result of Takagi (early 20-s century) on the distribution of zeros of polynomials, which does not seem to be related to physics. Subsequent papers of A. Sokal further explore this idea. 

There is a necessary and sufficient condition for a function $f$ of the real variable to be "band-limited". It is called the Wiener-Paley theorem. $f$ must be a restriction on the real line of an entire function of exponential type. Of course, here one implicitly assumes that $f$ belongs to an appropriate space which permits to interpret it as a "signal". For example, $L^2$ (finite energy), or $L^\infty$ (bounded amplitude), or Schwarz temperate distribution etc. P.S. This is a mathematical website, and the engineering terminology of the problem may sound strange to some mathematicians. So let me try to translate: We are taking about a function of a real variable for which Fourier transform is defined in some sense. Band limited means that Fourier transform has bounded support, and "time-limited" means that the function itself has bounded support. Of course the function cannot be simultaneously time- and band- limited, unless it is zero. This is a (very crude) form of the "indeterminacy principle", and also follows from the Wiener-Paley theorem. 

and again you can see from Mathscinet that people are using this. EDIT: A brief inspection of the most cited (and thus most used) books on Mathscinet shows that a very large proportion of the most cited books are 30-40 years old. Which is easy to explain, by the way. Thus on my opinion, such books do not qualify for this list (unless we want to make it infinite). EDIT2: Today I accidentally found that 3 of the 4 copies of 

Subharmonicity of this modification is true and easy to prove just from the definition of a subharmonic function. Condition $C^2$ is redundant. Of course the modification will not be in $C^2$. Now what is $H(\Omega)$ ? 

Your function $g$ in $C_0^\infty$, if not identicaly equal to zero, certainly fails to be real analytic at some point. Because a real analytic function cannot be in $C_0^\infty$. Your convolution is irrelevant for this conclusion. Edit: your comment indicates that you are really asking about the relation of the singular sets of $f$ and $g$. The singular set $S(f)$ (singular support) is the set where the function is not analytic. The general fact here is that $S(f)$ is contained in $(S(g)+1)\cup (S(g)-1)$, the union of shifts of $S(g)$ by one unit left and right. Perhaps this answers your question. This can be found in the second volume of Hormander's Analysis of linear differential operators, sect 16.3, together with a discussion when the equality happens. 

In addition to the above list let me add Comptes rendus, Proceeding of the National Academy, Electonic research announcements, Bulletin of the London Math. Soc. In addition to this there are various conference proceedings. EDIT. Before you edited the question I thought that your problem is with publishing a short paper. But now I see that your problem is opposite :-) Of the journals mentioned in the answers, Math Notes and Bull LMS do not publish announcements without proofs. A 70-100 pages paper indeed causes problem, not speaking of the paper with 100 lemmas and propositions. I think that a paper with 100 lemmas is a book, and there are very few journals which wuld consider this. To convince your employer that you were not idle, post this enormous paper on the arxiv. Now I do not understand your concern about the country where you work: I think Comptes rendus and other journals mentioned, including Russian DAN, and Funk Analiz, publish papers from all countries. 

In my example, the similarity did not require a hard proof but it was not seen for many years for the reasons which I would call "social". In 1928 Weil (and simultaneously Siegel) defined and studied heights in algebraic number theory. In 1933 Henry Cartan introduced the Nevanlinna characteristic of a holomorphic curve in projective space. From certain view point these two things are the same:-) Only in 1987, Paul Vojta pursued this analogy quite far. This became famous as "Vojta's analogy", and many new results were proved inspired by this observation. S. Lang, was very much excited and widely popularized this discovery. Since then, Vojta's analogy led to substantial progress in both areas. The story is described in Lang's book Introduction to Complex hyperbolic spaces, on page 185. Why I called the reasons of this almost 60 years gap social? Because on my opinion the reason is that complex analysts and algebraic geometers do not communicate sufficiently with each other. Actually I noticed the analogy in 1982 (I am sure that I was not alone) and I told about my observation to a famous algebraic geometer in. He was not excited. But when the news of the Vojta's analogy reached him few years later, he run into my office, and said: "Alex, can you quickly tell me what's Nevanlinna theory about?" 

See the recent preprints of Andre Voros on the arXiv. He proposed an iterative algorithm, and Artur Avila recently proved convergence. The literature on this problem is enormous; it usually goes under the title "anharmonic oscillator" or "quartic oscillator". The rate of convergence of Voros algorithm is geometric. 

If I understand correctly what a "harmonic function on the cone" is, there is no difference between the cone and the disc for the Dirichlet problem. This cone is a surface equipped with a Riemannian metric (induced from $R^3$) with one singularity (at the vertex). The metric defines a conformal structure turning the cone minus vertex into a Riemann surface. It is easy to see that this Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to the punctured disc. To write this conformal map explicitly, we first cut the cone along the segment which projects to $x\leq 0$, then "unwrap" onto the sector $|z|<R$, $|\arg z|<\alpha$, where $\alpha\in(0,\pi)$ is the total angle at the vertex, as seen on the surface of the cone, and then compose this with the conformal map $z\mapsto z^{\pi/\alpha}$, (principal branch) in the sector. The map evidently extends through the cut to the conformal map of the whole cone onto the whole $|z|<R^{\pi/\alpha}$, conformal except at the vertex, of course. For the cone in the question, $R=\sqrt{2}$, and $\alpha=2\pi/\sqrt{2}$. Now it is easy to solve the Dirichlet problem on the punctured disc (with data on the circle): the solution is the same as for the usual disc; it extends to the puncture by contnuity (removable singularity theorem for harmonic functions). Thus there is no difference between this cone and the disc for the Dirichlet problem. Concerning the Green formula, it also holds, but notation in the question seems strange: what is $dxdy$ and $dS$ ? One has to take the gradient with respect to the metric on the cone, and write the area element on the cone instead of $dxdy$. When all this is corrected, there will be a constant multiple in the inequality, depending on $\alpha$, the opening of the cone. 

I don't understand why you "approve the usual conventions and write more or less sketchy proofs myself in order to keep the paper short", unless the journal you want to submit to has a size limitation. Indeed, it was a custom in the past to write a very short note with a sketch of the proof (or without a proof at all), and publish it as a "research announcement". There were special journals for such short announcements (Comptes rendus in France, similar thing in Russia, and many more). I think the reason for this practice was to secure priority. Publication (and writing) of the full text could take a lot of time. Then usually several such short notes were followed by a large, long paper. On my opinion, this practice is obsolete. Today you can post an arbitrarily long paper on the arXiv to secure priority, and the only reason to publish "sketch proofs" in a journal could be the journal policy of length limitation. On my opinion, the author should do everything to make his/her paper easier to read, is s/he really wants the paper to be read by the others. 

I suppose that you have an extra $\pi$ somewhere: {$\sin \pi nx$} is a Riesz basis on $(0,1)$, not $(0,\pi)$. After you correct your question, this is not a Riesz basis when $a>0$ is sufficiently large. This follows from characterization of Riesz bases by Pavlov, Sov. Math. Dokl. 20:4, 1979, 655â€“659, or Semmler, Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn. Math. 35 (2010), no. 1, 23â€“46. 

This deep fact is essentially the same as the uniformization theorem. The problem is how to construct at least one holomorphic or meromorphic form with prescribed singularity. All known proofs use some Analysis, and none of them is simple. Once you have Uniformization, it is easy to construct holomorphic forms. A good modern proof (in full generality) is contained in the book of J. Hubbard, Teichmuller Theory. The complexity of the proof depends on how exactly you define a Riemann surface. A Riemann surface is a 1-dimensional complex manifold. A 1-dimensional complex manifold is separable (has a countable base). This fact is a part of the modern statement of the Uniformization theorem. However, if you include this separability to the DEFINITION of a Riemann surface, the proof substantially simplifies. Especially simple proof (assuming separabiity) can be found in Goluzin's book Geometric theory of functions of a complex variable. All Riemann surfaces arising in real life are easily seen to be separable (give me an example if I am wrong), so there is no real harm if we include this in the definition:-) But with or without this separability condition, all proofs of existence of holomorphic forms or of the uniformization use Analysis. Complex or real, I don't see a sharp distinction between these two. 

The terms "constructive" and "non-constructive" proofs have much wider application than discrete mathematics and algorithms for finite sets. And they can have have several meanings. A non-constructive proof proves that something exists but gives no way to construct the object. For example, one can prove existence of transcendentasl numbers by a simple countability argument. This proof does not give you a single example, it is non-constructive. And such proofs are actually abundant in mathematics. See, for example MR1852188 M. Kontsevich, D. Zagier, Periods. Liouville's proof of existence of transcendental numbers is constructive. Some results do not have any constructive proof at all, I mean the things related to Hahn-Banach. For example, every vector space has a basis. But you cannot really give an example of a basis of the vector space R over Q. By giving an example, I mean you define the set in the sense that for every number you can tell whether it is in the set or not. Another example, of different sort. There are famous theorems in number theory which say that certain inequalities or equations have finitely many solutions. But sometimes the proof does not tell in principle how to obtain ANY upper estimate. These are non-constructive proofs. Then people spend a lot of efforts to give an explicit estimate. Here constructive proofs sometimes exist, sometimes not. In Analysis, we all know that every continuous function on a compact set has a maximum. But there are plenty of interesting continuous functions on interesting compact sets, for which we know nothing else (how many maxima? Is the absolute maximum less than 10 or not, and don't know how to answer these questions). Here existence of a maximum is a typical non-constructive proof. In the beginning of XX century some mathematicians did not recognize non-constructive proofs as valid. In particular, they did not accept unlimited application of the axiom of choice. Some did not accept uncountable sets at all. This gave the origin to a kind of mathematics which in known under the names Constructive mathematics in USSR and Intuitionism elsewhere. Roughly speaking in Intuitionism only those existence proofs are recognized which give an algorithm to construct them. For example, in Intuitionist mathematics it is not always true that a bounded increasing sequence has a limit. If you are interested, there is a nice little book MR0075147 Heyting, A. Intuitionism. An introduction. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam, 1956. viii+133 pp. which gives a very readable introduction. When I was a student in 1970-s, some ordinary mathematicians (I mean non-logicians) in some places were still concerned with these issues.
