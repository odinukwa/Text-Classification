The (weak) Nullstellansatz: If $A$ is a finitely generated $\mathbb{C}$-algebra, then $A$ is the zero ring if and only if $\mathrm{Hom}(A, \mathbb{C})$ is empty. More generally, if $A$ and $B$ are finitely generated $\mathbb{C}$-algebras without nilpotents, then a map $A \to B$ is determined by the map $\mathrm{Hom}(B, \mathbb{C}) \to \mathrm{Hom}(A, \mathbb{C})$ that it induces. 

Then $P(t) = 3+3t$ and $P(t)^n$ has its largest coefficient at $t^{n/2}$, while $Q(t) = 2+t$ and has its largest coefficient at $t^{n/3}$. So, choosing $i$ between $n/3$ and $n/2$, there is no matching between level $i$ and level $i+1$. Here is a similar example where $P$ has a maximal and minimal element. 

Both the cell complex, $C$, and the dual cell complex $C'$ are refined by the first barycentric subdivision $BC$. There are maps $C \to BC$ and $C' \to BC$, sending a cell $\sigma$ to the sum of all cells of the same dimension contained in $\sigma$; these maps are both quasi-isomorphisms. So, if you allow me to formally invert quasi-isomorphisms, I'm done. Is the question whether there is an honest map of chain complexes between $C$ and $C'$, without subdividing? 

There is an obvious computation here that no one seems to be doing. Invert the power series for $j$, to write $$q^{-1} = j + a(0) + a(1) j^{-1} + a(2) j^{-2} + \cdots.$$ (Notice that the $a(i)$ will be integers.) Raise this to the, for example, $5$th power to get $$q^{-5} = j^5 + b(-4) j^4 + \cdots + b(0) + b(1) j^{-1} + \cdots.$$ See whether the coefficients $b$ are dropping off fast enough to give a simple explanation. People are assuming that the fact that the coefficients for $j$ in terms of $q$ grow rapidly means that the coefficients for the inverse will grow rapidly too, but that doesn't seem justified to me. UPDATE: Ok, here is some data. $$q^{-1} = j - 744 - 196884/j + \cdots = \mathbb{Z} - 7.5 \times 10^{-13} + \cdots $$ $$q^{-2} = j^2 - 1488 j + 159768 - 42987520 / j + \cdots = \mathbb{Z} - 1.6 \times 10^{-10}$$ From here, it get's too long to write out the details, so I'll just give the first noninteger term: $$q^{-3} = \mathbb{Z} -9.88 \times 10^{-9} + \cdots $$ $$q^{-4} = \mathbb{Z} -3.08 \times 10^{-7} + \cdots $$ $$q^{-5} = \mathbb{Z}-6.35 \times 10^{-6} + \cdots $$ $$q^{-6} = \mathbb{Z}-9.72 \times 10^{-5} + \cdots $$ $$q^{-7} = \mathbb{Z}-1.19 \times 10^{-3} + \cdots $$ $$q^{-8} = \mathbb{Z}-1.22 \times 10^{-2} + \cdots $$ $$q^{-9} = \mathbb{Z}-0.109 + \cdots $$ $$q^{-10} = \mathbb{Z}-0.860 + \cdots $$ Juding from Michael's data above, the later terms also make substantial contributions, but I think this explains a large part of the mystery. And, in case it is useful to anyone, here is the first 14 coefficients of $q^{-1}$ as a power series in $j^{-1}$. {1, -744, -196884, -167975456, -180592706130, -217940004309744, -282054965806724344, -382591095354251539392, -536797252082856840544683, -772598111838972001258770120, -1134346327935015067651297762308, -1692324738742597705005194275401888} Notice that the series starts $q^{-1} = j - 744 -196884/j + \cdots$. 

This is very far from my expertise, but I believe that the point of Universal Differential Equations is that any behavior exhibited by any differential equation can be found in a UDE for certain choices of parameter. (Think by analogy to a universal Turing machine, which can mimic any Turing machine.) So, if you are willing to idealize a lot, it would be enough to find a physical model for a UDE. 

I claim that every projective scheme $V$, over a finite field $k$, all of whose components have dimension $\leq d$, admits a finite morphism to $\mathbb{P}^d_k$. Let $q=|k|$. Key Lemma: Let $V_1$, $V_2$, ... $V_s$ be a finite collection of subvarieties of $\mathbb{P}_k^N$. Then there is a homogenous polynomial $f$ in $k[x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_N]$ such that $f|_{V_i}$ is nonzero for every $i$. Proof: (improved thanks to comments below) Choose a closed point $v_i$ on each $V_i$; we will force $f$ not to vanish at any of the $v_i$. Choose $M$ large enough that every $V_i$ is in $\mathbb{P}^N(\mathbb{F}_{q^M})$. Let $a_0$, $a_1$, ... $a_N$ be a basis for $\mathbb{F}_{q^{(N+1)M}}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^M}$. Then the linear form $$a_0 x_0 + a_1 x_1 + \cdots a_N x_N$$ does not vanish on any $Vvi$. This, of course, does not have coefficients in $k$. But the product $$\prod_{i=0}^{(N+1)M-1} \left( a_0^{q^i} x_0 + a_1^{q^i} x_1 + \cdots a_N^{q^i} x_N \right)$$ is similarly nonzero, and does have coefficients in $k$. This concludes the proof of the key lemma. 

As I imagine you already know, Egecioglu and Remmel gave an elegant bijective proof that $K K^{-1}=I$. And, as you say, Sagan and Lee gave a bijective proof that $K^{-1} K = I$, but it is much more complicated. I imagine this is the proof you want to improve. One of the surprising facts about bijective proofs is that sometimes there is an elegant proof for $AB=I$ but not for $BA=I$. I use "elegant" in a vague sense, because Loehr and Mendes have an algorithm which takes a bijective proof of $AB=I$ and outputs a bijective proof of $BA=I$, so there are no examples where there is a bijective proof of one equality and not the other. Loehr and Mendes work out the bijection proving $K^{-1} K=I$ as one of their examples. Since Loehr and Mendes is the only paper in MathSciNet citing Sagan and Lee, and there are no papers citing Loehr and Mendes, I'm going to guess that there has not been further progress on this subject. Hopefully Richard Stanley, Igor Pak or Ira Gessel will turn up soon; if they haven't heard about any progress, it will be extremely safe to guess that there hasn't been any. It occurs to me that it might be interesting to try to show, in the sense of computational complexity, that there are situations where there is a short bijective proof of $AB=I$ but only long bijective proofs for $BA=I$. Speaking vaguely, the obstacle should be that the implication $(AB=I) \implies (BA=I)$, although true in the $n \times n$ matrices for any $n$, is not true in an arbitrary ring, so you somehow need to know that you are dealing with matrices. I haven't thought about this question in any depth. 

The Kahler condition is a local condition on your metric. Namely, if $J$ is complex multiplication and $g$ is a $J$-invariant metric, define a $2$-form by $\omega(u,v) = g(u, Jv)$. The Kahler condition is that $d \omega=0$. So, you should be satisfied with local examples. For example, take coordinates $z_1 = x_1+ i y_1$ and $z_2 = x_2 + i y_2$ on $\mathbb{C}^2$. Let $$g = x_2 (dx_1^2 + dy_1^2) + x_1 (dx_2^2 + dy_2^2).$$ This is a metric on the open chart where $x_1$, $x_2 >0$. This is basically the simplest possible example of a non-Kahler metric. A good exercise is to check that the various Kahler identities do not hold on it. 

There is an obvious obstacle: the nonreduced scheme $k[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]/\langle x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \rangle^2$ is $0$-dimensional, but can't be embedded in any space of dimension less than $n$. More generally, if there is a point whose Zariski tangent space has dimension $n$, then we need $n$ coordinates to embed the scheme. So, for example, if $A$ is the subring of $k[t]$ generated by the monomials $t^n$, $t^{n+1}$, $t^{n+2}$, ..., then $\mathrm{Spec} \ A$ is a reduced one dimensional scheme which can't be embedded in less than $n$ dimensions. Replace "dimension" by "maximal dimension of any Zariski tangent space" and I think there should be a result like this. 

Jim already knows this very well but I'll state for the record that there are a number of nontrivial variants of the EKLP result, involving dimer placements on other two dimensional regular grids. Ciucu's Perfect matchings and perfect powers is a good survey and I added a few more to the list in Perfect matchings and the octahedron recurrence. I talked with Rick Kenyon about these examples, and we agreed that they basically seem to show up when the spectral curve (as in Kenyon-Okounkov-Sheffield) has genus zero. I'm not prepared to state a precise result here, though. (Perhaps Rick is?) I view all these dimer results as much closer to each other, and much easier, than the MacMahon or Zeilberger/Kuperberg results. It sounds like Jim is looking for things outside the dimer realm, so this won't satisfy him, but I figured I'd leave this note in case someone else stumbles upon this question in their search results.
