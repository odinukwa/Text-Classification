$URL$ The shadow cast by a planet upon its moon's orbit will have a diameter of 2 planetary radii. If the moon's roughly circular orbit has a radius of 5 to 20 planetary radii it will have a circumference of 31.4159 to 125.6636 planetary radii or 15.70795 to 62.8318 times the diameter of the shadow cast by the planet. Thus the month/day of the habitable moon will be about 15.70795 to 62.8318 times as long as the period in eclipse - if the moon orbits the planet in the same plane, or close to it, as the planet orbits their sun. If the moon's orbital plane is more than slightly different from that of the planet, the moon will be eclipsed by the planet on rare occasions or will never be eclipsed by the planet. If the habitable moon and its planet orbit in the same plane, the habitable moon's month/day should be about 15.70795 to 62.8318 times as long as the period in eclipse once per month/day. If the of the planet orbited by the habitable moon should be at least nine times the length of the month/day of the habitable moon, there should be at least 9 eclipses during a year of the planet, and the year of the planet should be at least 141.37155 to 565.4862 times as long as an eclipse period. If the eclipse period is about 40 Earth hours or 1.6666 Earth days as said in the original question, the habitable moon's month/day will be about 628.318 to 2,513.272 Earth hours, or 26.179916 to 104.7196 Earth Days. Thus the length of the planet's years should be about at least 235.61924 to 942.47694 Earth days or at least 0.6450 to 2.5803612 Earth years. 

There were Chinese man-powered paddle wheel boats and ships for hundreds of years before steam engines were invented. $URL$ So theoretically someone could invent a man powered propeller for airships before steam or internal combustion engines are invented. There actually have been specially designed man powered heavier than air aircraft. Therefore man powered lighter than air airships are a theoretical possibility. I see that some have actually been built. $URL$ 

Many species of sharks can live for longer or shorter periods in various depths of water. Sharks that are sometimes seen at the surface can sometimes be found thousands of feet or meters below the surface. Great White sharks, for example, are usually found from the surface down to 825 feet, but have been found as far down as 4,200 feet. Greenland sharks, which have been found in relatively shallow rivers and dived among by scientists, have also been found as deep as 7,200 feet, and the closely related pacific sleeper sharks have been found on the surface, have also been found as far down as 6,500 feet. $URL$ There is no problem with some shark species that are well known to the public because they are often seen at or near the surface spending part of their time below 450 feet. I am not sure how well they would survive if going above 450 feet was always fatal. And most of their food supply would be gone if all life above 450 feet died. 

Considering that the intelligence of sperm whales is unknown but possibly roughly equivalent to that of humans, so that objective outside observers might consider sperm whales to be persons, what your company is planning seems to be very close to being murder or kidnapping and enslavement. So I strongly suggest that your story end with the persons responsible for that program being arrested. The first indication that colossal squid existed was body fragments in the stomachs of sperm whales. 

If the moon circled the planet every 500 years and was in geosynchronous orbit, the planet would have a day 500 years long! Oh, you said nearly geosynchronous orbit. What you seem to mean is the moon actually orbits the planet many times in 500 years, but the position of the spot directly beneath the moon slowly circles around the planet every 500 years. Earth like life needs relatively short day/night cycles, so if the planet is like Earth and the people and their plants and animals are like humans and earth life, they will probably need relatively short day/night cycles to keep the planet from heating up too much during the day and cooling too much during the night. So if the planet is exactly like Earth exactly synchronous orbit would take exactly one day and there would be about 365.25 days in a year and so in 500 years there would be about 182,625 days. 360 arc degrees in a circle divided by 182,625 is 0.0019712 degrees. 21,600 arc minutes divided by 182,625 is 0.1182751. 1,296,000 arc seconds divided by 182,625 is 7.09650 arc seconds. Thus the moon would not appear exactly stationary in the sky but would move by 7.09650 arc seconds, or 0.1182 arc minutes, or 0.0019712 arc degrees every day. It would take the apparent position of the moon 845.52295 days to move by one arc degree, about twice the apparent width of the moon. since one degree on Earth is about 60 miles, it would take about 2.3149 years for the sub moon spot to move by about 60 miles. Note: Assuming a natural satellite or moon orbiting a planet that is exactly like Earth, geosynchronous orbit would be well outside the Roche limit that would cause a moon to break up, so the moon in geosynchronous orbit should be fine. So it would be possible for a moon to be positioned nearly in geosynchronous orbit of an Earth duplicate with enough of a difference for the spot on the planet directly below the moon to circle the planet every 500 years. But the idea that a radioactive moon could kill life exposed to it's radiation seems implausible because the Earth's atmosphere, magnetic field, and ozone layer block most forms of dangerous radiation from Earth's surface. If you change them enough that a radioactive moon can kill life on the planet, you change them enough that solar radiation, solar wind, and cosmic rays will probably kill all life on the planet everywhere anyway, so getting out from under the radioactive moon won't do the life any good. So you need some other way for a moon to kill at least some life on the planet. If the moon orbits the planet in exactly the same plane that the planet orbits the sun, the moon is likely to be eclipsed around midnight by the shadow of the planet. But if the moon's orbit is titled a little it will never be eclipsed but remain in sunlight all through the planetary midnight. And maybe near the center of the planet facing side of the moon there is a large crater with an almost parabolic cross section and a smooth, mirror like reflective surface. And the parabolic shape happens to have a focal point near the surface of the planet. That would be quite a coincidence, or maybe the work of malevolent super advanced aliens. So around midnight, as the far side of the planet has cooled a lot from the daytime heating, the sub moon location get a big blast of light and heat reflected from the moon. So the sub moon location will not cool down as much during the night as the rest of the planet's surface, and so will get hotter and hotter day after day after day. And this superheated region of the planet will move around very slowly. Hot land or water heats up the air above it. Hot air rises, and forms low pressure zones from the surface it rises from. And low pressure zones caue wind circulation which forms storms. Thus the planet could have a permanent hurricane with the eye at the sub moon spot and perhaps having damaging winds spread over most of the hemisphere. And the eye of that hurricane would slowly move a few miles per year. That would not kill all life on the hemisphere but would force Humans who grew crops that would be destroyed by the winds to slowly migrate ahead of the hurricane.
