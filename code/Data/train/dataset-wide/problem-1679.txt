No, no stars have an exactly spherical shape. The reason for this is that the centrifugal force of the star's rotation is much greater at the equator of the star than it is at the poles, for the simple reason that the rotational velocity is greater. This greater centrifugal force pushes the equator outwards, stretching the star into an oblate shape. This is called gravity darkening. Because we have only visually resolved the surfaces of a few other stars, it's not something that is commonly directly observed (though the effect can also be observed from stellar spectra). Regulus is one star that has been observed as an oblate spheroid spectrographically. The image below shows the star Altair, directly imaged using the CHANDRA space telescope. Go here for an animation! 

Ceres is many orders of magnitude larger than any satellite that we could launch. So we could never practically use spacecraft to change our orbit significantly, and even an enormous near-miss asteroid would be of little consequence. But, it hasn't stopped some from trying! 

Certainly it's a function of astronomy - chances are, if you're doing science outside the Earth then by definition it's astronomy in some form or another. There are many sub-fields of astronomy that are useful in the search for extra-terrestrial life: 

Clean your eyepieces in the same way you would clean a camera lens. An air blower, soft (i.e. camel hair) brush, lens tissue or microfibre cloth, and a solvent or alcohol will do the trick. When I was an undergraduate I did some work with lasers and very expensive dielectric coated mirrors. The techniques here will show you how to carefully clean optics. Never completely wet your lens tissue or cloth. One drop on a lens tissue is usually enough, or a couple of drops on a microfibre cloth. Essentially, you need to: 

To make a real-life example, let's consider a radio signal. Since a distant receiver will be getting a frequency-modulated signal not unlike FM radio, we are not concerned with angular resolution. We don't care if the "image" is blurred, or even if some areas of the originally transmitted beam entirely miss our receiver. All we are concerned with is the modulation of frequency over time - it's a one-dimesional signal. In this case, a receiver is a noise-limited system. This NASA report outlines some of the limitations that a realistic implementation of interstellar communication must deal with. Even in the case of a quantum noise-limited system, we can still make the best of the limitations dealt to us. If the signal-to-noise ratio is above an acceptable threshold then the signal will be received well. There are so many factors to consider that really only an order-of-magnitude estimate is feasible. I don't know enough about this to come up with a good estimate myself of the noise levels of a particular system. Project Cyclops (1971) was the initial investigation into the feasibility of a search for extraterrestrial intelligence. For example, on page 41, we can see that the minimum noise temperature of a receiver receiving the 2.4 GHz Arecibo message is about 4K - the major contributor to noise here is the CMB. Frequencies of this order of magnitude will usually provide the best possible noise performance - too high and quantum noise and atmospheric effects become significant. Too low, and galactic noise takes over. This noise temperature provides a noise floor for the signal. The receiver usually introduces a significant noise temperature to the degree of some tens or hundreds of Kelvin, so any practical limitations on interstellar communication tend to become a function of our equipment. Although the Arecibo message was broadcast at a good frequency, for very long-distance communication amplitude modulation is superior to frequency modulation as it's easy to increase the pulse duration and interval to compensate for a weaker signal strength. This table from page 50 of the well-worth-reading Cyclops report shows that a single $100~ \mathrm{m}$ transmitter/receiver combination, with a transmission power of $10^5~\mathrm{W}$, could function at a distance of 500 light years. 

What makes you think that it is "obviously not 2013 on Earth"? In actual calculations, astronomers use the Julian day, which is a decimal representation of time. A Julian year is exactly 365.25 days of 86,400 seconds each. Astronomical coordinates are usually written in the J2000 epoch, which allows us to compensate for Earth's axial precession. Our ability to measure and record time is limited only by the accuracy of our most precise clocks. There's nothing fundamentally wrong or imprecise about it. 

We are situated inside the galactic disk. The first image below, showing our approximate location, is a fabrication rather than a photograph. Such a photo would require a space probe to be tens of thousands of light years above the plane of the disk, which is patently infeasible with current technology. We don't even know exactly how many spiral arms our galaxy has! But from where we are, we can still see a great density of gas and dust stretching 360 degrees across our sky, as you look along the galactic plane. These "inside views" are indeed real photographs - much the same as if you go outside on a dark night, well away from the city lights, you yourself will see its faint, dusty outline much like in the second image (which I can assure you is real). 

We determine the spectral type (i.e. temperature) of a star using multicolour photometry, or (ideally) spectroscopy. By guesstimating the temperature, mass and radius of a star, we can say that two stars that have pretty similar observational properties probably are closely related to each other. Cepheid variables, for example, display periodic pulsations that depend quite strongly on their intrinsic luminosity -- this is why they're reasonably good standard candles. Their characteristic variability makes them clearly identifiable as a Cepheid, and observations of their pulsation are backed up by data that place them in the same region of the HR diagram. If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then chances are it's a duck. If it's as hot as a Cepheid and pulsates like a Cepheid, then it probably is a Cepheid. So to answer your final paragraph: yep. Though with no spatial resolution and often (in the absence of parallax measurements) only tenuous distance data, classifying stars is a rather messy business. 

I have mulled over this a couple of times (it's a really interesting question!), and hopefully come up with a somewhat enlightening answer. I haven't been able to find a good, modern reference for these details (perhaps I just suck at literature searches...) so there's a little mucking around in the history books The total timescale of evolution onto the main sequence for a protostar in the T Tauri mass range ( < 3 solar masses) is on the order (of magnitude) of several tens of millions of years. The ignition of fusion is not precisely a "runaway" reaction: however it occurs relatively quickly and once it starts, gravitational contraction quickly ceases. The evolution of a 1 solar mass protostar follows these basic steps. Things are a little different for different masses - too complicated to explain here but the references should provide ample further reading! 

You're insulting them, by asking them to justify why the work they base their livelihood upon isn't a load of rubbish. You cannot justifiably criticize an accepted scientific theory without coming up with an equally plausible idea (unless you manage to prove that something is wrong). And unless someone does come up with a better idea, the nebular theory will continue to expand and evolve to better match our observations. That is the scientific process. 

Condensation will build up because the temperature of your optics has fallen below the dew point. You simply have to keep the temperature your telescope above the dew point, which can be quite difficult on humid nights. Dew shields can help, as can dew heaters (which literally just gently heat your telescope and/or eyepiece). 

The orbital speed of Earth around the sun is $U = 29.8~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$. So at a mass of $$M = 5.97\times 10^{24}~\mathrm{kg},$$ it has a kinetic energy of $$K = 2.65\times 10^{33}~\mathrm{J}$$ and momentum $$P = 1.78\times 10^{29}~\mathrm{kg~m~s^{-1}}.$$ So let's say Ceres is performing a gravitational slingshot as in the simple diagram below. Ceres has a mass $m = 9.47 \times 10^{20}~\mathrm{kg}$. It approaches Earth at velocity $v$, and after the slingshot its final velocity is (up to, for a low-mass object) a velocity of $2\times U+v$. 

The most recent suggestions are that it was a nova or supernova, however no one really knows what the object was. The verbatim records describe it as a star, though it is not certain whether or not it was a "true" star (in those times, a star being any object that had a fixed right ascension and declination). Perhaps it was just a planet. In any case I suspect it is unlikely you will be able to see it with your naked eye today. Even if you could, its true identity has certainly been lost in history.

I can tell you just from this page alone that it's a bunch of pseudoscience and quackery. These folks are conspiracy theorists and catastrophists. Please correct me if there is, but I cannot find a single article on this that is published in a reputable, peer-reviewed journal. 

With a lot of difficulty if you want to do it numerically by yourself. The Moon's orbit is very complex. Far and away the easiest method would be to use NASA's HORIZONS service for calculating ephemerides, which will get you very comprehensive and accurate information on objects at your specified times. I don't think that HORIZONS can directly return the time that the Moon is at its maximum altitude. However, if you can write some basic computer code then it shouldn't be difficult to query the ephemerides with a precise (say 1 minute) time interval and find the maximum altitude from there. 

A Jeans-unstable cloud of gas and dust begins to contract, exchanging gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, and thus heat. The luminosity of the protostellar cloud increases as it collapses. It takes around 100,000 years for the initial period of rapid collapse to finish, at this point the cloud is very luminous (perhaps 20 solar luminosities and 8000K). Over the next 1 million years, the protostellar cloud slowly contracts and cools to around 4500K. The protostar then travels down the Hayashi track, contracting further but changing little in temperature - its luminosity continues to fall. This is the stage where T Tauri stars are at. Most T Tauri stars are younger than 3 million years old. The star then follows the Henyey track, where the luminosity begins to slowly increase again as a radiative zone develops in the star's core and it continues to slowly contract. This can take some tens of millions of years. Finally, the conditions in the core are extreme enough for fusion to begin. The timescale from all the energy being provided by gravitational contraction to all the energy being provided by fusion, is on the order of 1 million years. The star's luminosity (counter-intuitively) decreases again when this happens, as the energy from fusion doesn't quite offset that from gravitational contraction, which ceases when fusion begins. 

You can buy remarkably cheap reflecting telescopes these days on a mount called the Dobsonian mount. They don't (usually) have fancy GoTo automated pointing and tracking, but give fantastic bang for buck as the majority of their cost is invested into the biggest primary mirror possible. Building a telescope would be a great hobby and learning experience, and there are many books which will show you how. Just don't expect to save a significant sum of money over a commercially built scope - it could even be more expensive to build your own. Fancy GoTo tracking mounts are not usually worth the expense and hassle (in setting them up) for a first-timer, though the Orion Intelliscope series is an intriguing compromise. For an extra $100 or so, the telescope has no guiding motors, but tracks where you push the telescope and a hand controller will tell you how much further you have to go till you reach your target. My recommendation? Get the biggest Dobsonian mount scope you can afford. With a mirror greater than 10" things begin to get large and unwieldy, so 10 inches (mirror diameter, not tube length) is my recommended maximum size for a first telescope. Just go for the biggest aperture you can buy and easily carry. Don't invest much in GoTo systems, as although they can be quite useful they are also a pain to set up if you don't have the scope permanently mounted. 

Usual methods of estimating stellar ages involve isochrone approximations. It can also help to estimate a star's radius by correlating its absolute magnitude with effective temperature and apparent magnitude. In the absence of these measurements or observations of tell-tale variability, how might you guess a star's age and evolutionary status? Given a single, high-resolution $(R\gtrsim 50000)$ spectrum as your only data point, how easy is it to accurately infer the age and evolutionary status of a star? For example, how would the spectrum differ between a red dwarf and red giant, both with of $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 4000~\mathrm{K}$? Or between two red dwarfs of ages $2~\mathrm{Gyr}$ and $8~\mathrm{Gyr}$? A good answer could describe how surface gravity $(\log g)$ affects spectral lines (and how this relates to stellar mass and radius), what elements we might observe more strongly at different stages of evolution, and some observational results of gyrochronology. 

Be insanely careful if you are using a solvent such as acetone. Although a good for cleaning optics, it's not very nice to paint and plastic so it should be a last resort for very stubborn marks well away from the edges of the lens (so you'll never touch the paint with it). Methyl or isopropyl alcohol are safer but less effective, or a generic lens cleaner from a camera store. 

The nebular hypothesis is simply the best model that fits our observations - that's how the scientific method works. In the last decade, we have been discovering and analysing increasing numbers of planetary and protoplanetary systems. Our models of the formation of these systems are continually refined as both our observations improve and our computing power increases. 

During the later stages of planet formation, in this early Solar system, the planets were still forming. Neptune exchanged angular momentum with the remaining planetesimals, and its orbit expanded outwards. If Pluto were in a near-circular orbit larger than Neptune's (at about 33 AU), there is a high chance that Neptune could capture Pluto and lock it an orbital resonance (this probably happened when Neptune was at about 25 AU). As Neptune's orbit continued to expand outwards, this expansion drew out the eccentricity of Pluto's orbit.

Gravity assists such as this are a form of elastic collision. There's a bit of number crunching here (hopefully no mistakes!), so you'll want to be familiar with the basics of momentum, kinetic energy, and the conservation thereof. 

Some stars are also non-spherical due to the effects of a nearby star in a close binary orbit. Much like how the Moon causes tides on Earth, two stars can stretch each other's surfaces. If they're very close to one another, as in the picture below, there can even be mass transfer between them (ref common envelope). 

Use a blower to blow off as much dust as you can. Then use a soft brush. Dampen a small square of lens tissue with pure alcohol or acetone (see warning below). Gently draw or wipe the tissue across the surface once, and then discard. Repeat if necessary. You may need to fog the lens with your breath to help remove water-soluble gunk. 

The total momentum of the system must be conserved. Ceres has changed direction and thus gained a significant amount of momentum in the leftwards direction: the same momentum that Earth must then lose. Kinetic energy is also conserved. So, we have a system of equations, where the subscripts i and f are initial and final momenta and velocities. M and U are the mass and velocity of Earth, m and v are that of Ceres. $$MU_i^2 + mv_i^2 = MU_f^2 + mv_f^2$$ which says that the sum of the initial kinetic energies of the two objects must equal the sum of the final kinetic energy. We also have conservation of momentum: $$MU_i + m\vec{v}_i = MU_f + m\vec{v}_f $$ Solving these equations, the solution is $$v_f = \frac{(1-m/M)v_i + 2U_i}{1-m/M} $$ If Ceres approached Earth at $v_i = 30~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$, I get a solution of $v_f = 89.6~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$ - even for such a massive object, the $v_f \approx 2U+v$ approximation is extremely good. This means that Ceres' velocity has nearly been tripled by the gravity assist. So, the final momentum of Earth is $$MU_f = MU_i - mv_i - mv_f = 1.78 \times 10^{29}~ \mathrm{kg~m~s^{-1}} $$
