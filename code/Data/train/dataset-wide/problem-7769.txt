Given a braiding $\Psi: X \otimes Y \to Y \otimes X$ for two objects $X,Y$ in a monoidal category, it seems reasonable to assume that $\Psi$ extends uniquely to a braiding $X^k \otimes Y^l \to Y^l \otimes X^k$, for all $k,l \in {\mathbb N}$. The proof would surely be based upon the Yang--Baxter property of $\Psi$ and the fact that one can express any permutation as a product of transpositions. However, I can't seem to write it down exactly. 

Let $A$ be a not neccessarily commutative algebra, and let $B \subset A$ be a subalgebra of $A$. Moreover, let $M$ be an $A$-bimodule, and let $N \subset M$ be a $B$-sub-bimodule. The tensor product $N \otimes_{B} N$ has a natural inclusion in $M \otimes_{A} M$, and it seems to me that this inclusion should be injective, but I can't prove it. Am I right here, or does one need to make extra assumptions? Is there a clean/non-messy way to prove all this? The question boils down to showing that $$ (N \otimes_B N) \cap \lbrace m_1a \otimes m_2 - m_1 \otimes am_2 | m_i \in M\, a \in A \rbrace. $$ is equal to $$ \lbrace n_1b \otimes n_2 - m_1 \otimes bm_2 | n_i \in N,b \in B \rbrace. $$ But I can't see how to do this. 

This is a continuation of a question asked by me previously with some added hypothesis. Let $X, Y$ be irreducible projective schemes over $\mathbb{C}$, $W \subset X \times Y$ a closed irreducible subscheme. Suppose that the natural projection map $pr_2:W \to Y$ is surjective on the underlying topological spaces, and every fiber is reduced. Note that for all $x \in W$, there is a natural map of tangent spaces $\phi_x:T_{W,x} \to T_{Y,pr_2(x)}$. If there is a point $y \in Y$ such that the $\mathbb{C}$-vector space generated by the union $\cup_{x \in pr_2^{-1}(y)} \phi_x(T_{W,x})$ does not coincide with $T_{Y,y}$, does this mean that $Y$ is nonreduced at the point $y$? 

I'm trying to learn about the Lefschetz decomposition but am having a very basic problem: For the fundamental form $K$ of a Kahler metric on a complex manifold $M$, the corresponding Lefschetz operator $L$ is defined by $$ L:\Omega^k(M) \to \Omega^{k+2}(M), ~~~~~~~ \omega \mapsto K \wedge \omega. $$ From basic exterior algebra we must have $K \wedge K = 0$. Thus, to my eyes, we should have $$ L^2(\omega) = L(K \wedge \omega) = K \wedge (K \wedge \omega) = (K \wedge K) \wedge \omega = 0 \wedge \omega = 0. $$ However, the repeated Lefschetz operator is a central feature in Kahler theory. What am I missing? 

Let $f:X \to Y$ be a proper, flat morphism of projective scheme and $Y$ is an irreducible, non-singular surface. Assume further that there exists a Zariski open subset $U$ of $Y$ whose complement is of codimension $2$ such that the total space $f^{-1}(U)$ is non-singular and such that $f:f^{-1}(U) \to U$ has geometrically irreducible fibers. Denote by $\eta$ the generic point of $Y$. Suppose that there exists a morphism from $\eta$ to the generic fiber $X_{\eta}$. Then, does there exist a morphism $s:Y \to X$ such that $f \circ s$ is identity on $Y$? EDIT: Assumptions as above. Then, does there exist a rational section of $f$? 

I can't see any qualifiers preceding or succeeding the statement. Am I missing something obvious here, or is this just plain wrong? Do there not exists kernels of coalgebra maps that are not coideals? 

For $H$ a Hopf algebra, let $V$ be a right $H$-comodule with coaction $\Delta_R$. Moreover, let $W$ be a subspace of $V$ such that $\Delta_R(W) \subseteq W \otimes H$, and note that this implies that $\Delta_R$ restricts to a coaction $V/W \to V/W \otimes H$. If we denote, $$ V^H := \lbrace v \in V ~ | ~ \Delta_R(v) = v \otimes 1 \rbrace, $$ and analagously $$ (V/W)^H := \lbrace [v] \in V/W) ~ | ~ \Delta_R([v]) = [v] \otimes 1 \rbrace, $$ where $[v]$ denotes the coset of $v$, and $\pi:V \to V/W$ be the canonical projection, then when do we have $$ \pi(V^H) = (V/W)^H? $$ 

Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and $X_K$ a smooth projective curve on $K$. Denote by $\bar{K}$ the algebraic closure of $K$ and $X_{\bar{K}}$ the base change of $X_K$ to $\bar{K}$. Under the natural morphism from $X_{\bar{K}} \to X_K$, we have an induced morphism $\mbox{Pic}^0(X_K) \to \mbox{Pic}^0(X_{\bar{K}})$. Is this morphism surjective? If not true in general, is there any known condition on $K$ under which this holds true? 

Let $X$ be a projective scheme and $\pi:\mathcal{Z} \to \mathbb{P}^1$ a surjective morphism of finite type such that for any pair $t_0, t_1 \in \mathbb{P}^1$, the fibers $\mathcal{Z}_{t_0}$ and $\mathcal{Z}_{t_1}$ are rationally equivalent subschemes of $X$. Does this imply $\pi$ is flat? Note here that I am not apriori assuming the rational equivalence of the fibers are coming from $\pi$. 

Let $M$ be a Kahler manifold, with metric $g$, fundamental form $\omega$, and dual Lefschetz operator $\Lambda$. Now $\Lambda$, and contraction with $\omega$, both map the two forms $\Omega^2(M)$ to $0$-forms, ie smooth functions. Are they equal? I think this is almost certainly true, but I can't see a clean argument. Do I need Kahler here? I would guess this works for all complex manifolds. 

For the real Grassmannian Gr$(N,k)$ we have the well-known isomorphism $$ \text{Gr}(N,k) = O(N)/(O(k) \times O(N-k)) $$ For the complex case, we have $$ \text{Gr}(N,k) = U(N)/(U(k) \times U(N-k)) $$ I would like to know if anything like this holds in the finite field setting, ie can the finite field Grassmannians be described as a homogeneous space of an algebraic group over a finite field, or something like this? 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field (not necessarily of characteristic $0$), $X$ a non-singular affine closed subscheme in $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ for some $n \ge 2$. Denote by $I_X$ the ideal of $X$ in $\mathbb{A}^n_k$. Let $X'$ be a first order infinitesimal deformation of $X$ i.e., $X'$ is flat over $\mathrm{Spec}(k[t]/(t^2))$ having $X$ as the closed fiber. Denote by $I_{X'}$ the ideal of $X'$ in $\mathbb{A}^n_k \times \mbox{Spec}(k[t]/(t^2))$. By the infinitesimal lifting property, we know that $X'$ is isomorphic to $X \times_k \mbox{Spec}(k[t]/(t^2))$. But this isomorphism is not canonical. The question is whether there is an isomorphism between $X \times_k \mbox{Spec}(k[t]/(t^2))$ and $X'$ such that the induced morphism of ring $$\frac{k[X_1,...,X_n]}{I_X} \otimes_k k[t]/(t^2) \to \frac{(k[t]/(t^2))[X_1,...,X_n]}{I_{X'}}$$ sending $X_i$ to $X_i$? Furthermore, can we get such an isomorphism for which $t$ maps to $t$ as well?
