In the static weak-field approximation, the metric is approximated in terms of the the Newtonian gravitational potential $\Phi$ as: $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\left(1+2\Phi\right)\mathrm{d}t^2 + (1-2\Phi)\mathrm{d}S^2\text{,}$$ where $\mathrm{d}S^2$ is the metric for Euclidean $3$-space. A more general situation requires one to solve a multi-body problem in general relativity, although the parametrized post-Newtonian formalism provides a canonical approximation scheme. So the completely general answer to your question is "it's very difficult problem of numerical general relativity that doesn't have a neat analytic solution." However, at large distances from slowly-moving objects (i.e., large compared to their Schwarzschild radii, we can approximate a multi-body time dilation relative to a stationary observer at infinity as just given by the sum of their gravitational potentials: $$\frac{\mathrm{d}\tau}{\mathrm{d}t} = 1 - \frac{1}{c^2}\sum_k\frac{GM_k}{r_k} \text{.}$$ Note that this is consistent with the Schwarzschild formula for large radial coordinates, since by the Taylor-MacLaurin expansion, $$\frac{\mathrm{d}\tau}{\mathrm{d}t} = \sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}} = 1 - \frac{GM}{rc^2} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{R^2}{r^2}\right)\text{,}$$ where $R = 2GM/c^2$ is the Schwarzschild radius. This also means that simply multiplying the factors is a pretty good approximation as long as those factors are close to $1$. 

You may find this article interesting, The Yellow Sun Paradox, as to why we consider the sun yellow in casual observation. I would add another possible physiological explanation to the three suggested in this article: The retina's blue cones saturate at lower illumination than the red and green ones, which creates a deficit of blue signal to the optical nerve under heavy stimulation, resulting in a perception of red + green = yellow. Conversely the sensitivity of the blue cones is why very dim objects such as faint stars in the night sky usually seem to be blue. 

I agree with @Gerold, "meteorite jewelry" usually means a band made of iron meteorite. The good thing about the way you are doing it with "stone" settings, is that it practically prevents allergic reaction plus less rusting. Frequent oiling also helps. But even so, get ONLY Gibeon or Seymchan meteorite material for the best patterns and rust-resistance. You MUST find a reputable dealer, some will LIE. Good Luck. Oh there is also Pallasite material, very pricey, which ranges in content from silicate inclusions in an Fe-Ni matrix to Fe-Ni inclusions in a silicate matrix. Pallasites are only used as stones or inlays. Far too fragile for band material. 

If you discount cosmological expansion, it will simply be wrong. However, first-order corrections to the Newtonian gravity part of simulations do exist in the post-Friedmann formalism. I'm not really familiar with PFF, but according to Bruni et al. (2014), the leading-order correction to Newtonian gravity introduces a vector potential in the $g_{0i}$ term in the metric that can produce weak lensing effects but doesn't affect matter dynamics. Which is entirely sensible because that kind of gravitomagnetic effects should be suppressed by a further $v/c$ term for matter, just like magnetism. 

Yes, light gravitates. The gravitational charge is energy. Well, gravity is a spin-2 force, so you really have momentum and stress as well, but they are analogous to a generalization of electric current. In general, anything that contributes to the stress-energy tensor will have some gravitational effect, and light does that, having both an energy density and putting a pressure in the direction of propagation. 

Couldn't comment as I do not have the proper rep yet, but regarding @user3355020 and the answer provided by @Gerald, (and me being far less educated than I ever could have imagined before reading this), I interpret it like this: (and I wouldn't be surprised if this is wrong) the speed of light is constant, but the expansion rate of the universe is not. The over-simplified observed effect is similar to the feeling of having a dream where you're in a hallway and you're running away from something as fast as you possibly can,focused on the end of the hallway, but the hallway seems to stretch more and more as time goes by. Much in the same way, light is the person running and 'space' is the hallway and earth is the opening at the end. Some light was able to get far enough in the beginning that the stretch did not impact it so much as to make it impossible to reach earth (it's just going to take it 13+ billion yrs), and some light (and from my understanding of the answer given by @Gerald all light after a certain 'time') will never reach earth. 

It is correct that the Kerr black hole solution of GTR allows travel between universes. However, that does not mean that if you actually jump into any kind of black hole that you could go to another universe. To motivate the resolution to this conundrum, let's start off very easy: suppose you stand on the ground with a ball in your hand, and you throw it with some initial velocity. For simplicity, let's ignore everything except a uniform gravity. Mathematics will then tell you that the ball follows a parabolic arc, and when and where the ball will hit the ground. And if you take the resulting equations too literally, then it will also tell you that the ball hits the ground twice: once in the future, once in the past. But you know the past solution isn't right: you held the ball; it didn't actually continue its parabolic arc into the past. A morally similar kind of thing occurs for, say, a Schwarzschild black hole. If you look at it in the usual Schwarzschild coordinates, there's a problem at the horizon. Mathematics will then tell you that the problem is just with the coordinate chart, and that there's actually an interior region to the black hole that becomes apparent in different coordinates. And if you do this generally enough, it will tell you that there's more to it than even that: there's also white hole with a reverse horizon and its exterior region--another universe. This full "maximally extended" Schwarzschild spacetime has this other universe connect to ours via an "Einstein-Rosen bridge" and then "pinch off", producing separate black and white holes. Of course, that too is an artifact of mathematical idealization: and actual black hole is not infinitely extended in the past and future; it was actually produced by something, a stellar collapse. (And the "bridge" isn't traversable anyway; one will be destroyed in the singularity if one tries.) Finally, on to the Kerr solution, it's a bit better because formally the singularity is avoidable, unlike the Schwarzschild case. However, it's still physically unreasonable: in addition to the fact that actual black holes aren't eternal, the interior of the Kerr solution is unstable in regard to any infalling matter, which will perturb the solution into something else entirely. Therefore, it cannot be taken as a physically meaningful. Still, it is true that full Kerr spacetime contains a way into another universe--in fact, infinitely many of them, chained one after another. If you're interested in the details of its structure, you could look at some Penrose diagrams of those black hole solutions. 

Now, as to the images. There are three possible reasons for an image to be yellow or orange. Perhaps, as a nod to expectations, it has been colorized. Possibly it is a false color image that maps a real but non-visible spectrum (radio, microwave, IR, UV, or X-ray) onto the visible spectrum. But most of the images you present us with in your google search are using a technique sometimes called flame gradation, where a gray-scale (black→gray→white) is mapped on to a flame-scale: 

to allow a much greater range of gradation in intensity to be perceived. It also suggests rather naturally a cold→cool→warm→hot gradation. 

Colliding galaxies sometimes merge and sometimes pass through each other. Either way, there are huge changes as a result. What are the parameters that matter in determining whether a collision will result in a merger or a hit and run, or something in between? What will be the result of the Milky Way-Andromeda collision? Thinking about this some more, I suppose the most clearcut distinctions for the result would be whether the two supermassive black holes end up unbound, bound, or merged. Would it be possible for the bulk of the two galaxies to merge, but one or two of the SMBH's go on their merry way?
