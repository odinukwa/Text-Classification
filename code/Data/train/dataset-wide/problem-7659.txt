Inversion with respect to a circle of radius $\sqrt 2$ centered at $i$ exchanges the unit circle and the real numbers (union infinity). One can apply this inversion to the set of roots of a palindromic polynomial (palindromic: $\xi$ and $1/\xi$ are simultaneous roots) getting the roots of another palindromic polynomial. This transformation yields an involution on the set of palindromic polynomials with rational coefficients (and roots in $\mathbb C^*\setminus\lbrace i,-i\rbrace$) which exchanges the role of the unit circle and the real numbers. This is thus a sort of geometrical explanation of the phenomenon. 

We consider the class $C$ of directed simple (no multiple edges) graphs having the property that every vertex is reachable by a directed path from every other vertex. Given an integer $k$, what is the maximal possible number of (directed) edges in a graph of $C$ with $n$ vertices such that there are no directed cycles of length $\leq k$? For $k=2$ this means simply that the existence of an edge from $v$ to $w$ forbids the existence of an edge from $w$ to $v$ and one can thus choose arbitrary orientions (giving rise to a graph in $C$) on the edges of the complete unoriented graph. For $k=3$, one has also to forbid oriented triangles which is not possible by orienting all edges of a complete graph on $n\geq 3$ vertices such that the result is in $C$. On the other hand, there are of course no triangles by choosing arbitrary orientations (giving rise to an element in $C$) of a complete bipartite graph. There are thus such graphs having roughly $n^2/4$ directed edges. There should be better upper and lower bounds. Motivation: G. Higman (A finitely generated infinite simple group. J. London Math. Soc. 26, (1951). 61--64) constructed finitely generated infinite simple groups by considering quotients of the finitely presented group $$\langle g_1,\dots,g_n|g_{i-1}^{-1}g_ig_{i-1}=g_i^2\rangle$$ where indices are modulo $n$. This group is trivial for $n=2,3$ and infinite for $n\geq 4$. Given a directed graph, one can consider the corresponding group-presentation with generators corresponding to vertices and directed edges corresponding to relations $a^{-1}ba=b^2$. The triviality of the group constructed by Higman associated to $n=2,3$ implies that we want to avoid oriented cycles of length $\leq 3$ when searching for interesting examples. 

Series representations for functions and the fact that $\mathbb C$ is "rigid" in contrast to $\mathbb R$ when discussing differentiability and series developements. This "explains" for example how pocket calculators compute trigonometric functions, logarithms and exponentials. 

Choose cyclic orientations of all edges around each vertex and attach discs to the edges following the cyclic orientation around each vertex. The result is an oriented compact surface with a connected component for each connected component of the graph. (Using the convention that an isolated point is glued around the boundary of a disc.) 

I guess the historically first example is the Theorem of Pythagoras, already known to the Babylonians but probably not discovered by a "proof" satisfying modern standards. 

Out of procrastination I computed $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty k^{-k^2}\sim 1.06255080549625593786944593879.$$ The inverse symbolic calculator identified this number as "From generalized Zeta function". I do not recognize this sum as anything similar to a zeta function and obvious variations ($\sum_{k=1}^\infty k^{-k}$ was recognized as what it is and $\sum_{k=1}^\infty k^{-k^3}$ gave no result in the inverse symbolic calculator) seem not to be related to "generalized zeta functions". Does someone have a clue what "From generalized Zeta function" means? 

Given two integers $n$ and $N$ such that $N>{n+1\choose 2}$, we denote by $\alpha_n(N)$ the number of elements $(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ in $(\mathbb Z/N\mathbb Z)^n$ such that the $2n$ elements $x_1,x_1+1,x_2,x_2+2,x_3,x_3+3,\dots,x_n,x_n+n$ of $\mathbb Z/N\mathbb Z$ are all distinct. The number $\alpha_n(N)$ is then a polynomial function of the form $N^n-2nN^{n-1}+\dots$. Is there a nice formula for the polynomial $\alpha_n(N)$? Remark: The analogous problem such that $x_1,x_1+1,x_2,x_2+2,x_3,x_3+4,x_4,x_4+8,\dots, x_n,x_n+2^{n-1}$ (and many similar variations and generalizations) is much easier and I have a solution (described in $URL$ 

Refraction illustrates geodesics in metric spaces (with infinitesimal distances proportional to the inverse of the speed of light). Huge enough astronomical objects (of diameter more than 1000km) which spin not too fast illustrate sets of equidistant points with respect to a given center. Waterfalls illustrate parabolas. 

Does there exist a constant $A$ giving an upper bound on the absolute value of the regulator for infinitely many totally real number fields? 

Consider the map $n\longmapsto ny/x$. You want to find a value of $n$ in a given range such that this is almost an integer. Such a point is encoded by an integral point of $\mathbb Z^2$ very close to the linear subspace generated by $(1,y/x)$. Closest points of this form are given by continued fraction approximations: Develop $x/y$ as a continued fraction and choose a convergent $a/b$ with $n=\lambda b$ in your range for small $\lambda$. This $n$ does the job. If you want positive minimal values, then only every other convergent works. In your example, one gets convergents 1/4 and 2/7 and $4\cdot 17=68\equiv 7\pmod 61,\ 7\cdot 17\equiv -3\pmod 61$. Thus $n=7$ is a better solution but the smallest representant modulo $61$ of $7\cdot 17$ is negative. 

The different domains of mathematics (analysis, geometry, algebra, probability, combinatorics etc) are not completely clearly defined and overlap. This is of course not a problem when doing mathematics but sometimes when trying to categorize some work. 

A probably very naive idea is to approximate the average by the absolute value of the determinant by a typical random element in your set. The Euclidean length of the $i-$th row in an average element is probably computable (and given perhaps by something like $k_i\sqrt{n}/2$, more precisely, it should be close to $k_i\int_0^1\cdots\int_0^1\sqrt{t_1^2+t_2^2+\dots+t_n^2}dt_1dt_2\cdots dt_n$ for large $k_i$). Making the (also very naive) assumption that the $n$ rows of a typical matrix, rescaled to be of unit length (with respect to the Euclidean norm) are $n$ independent equidistributed random variables of the unit sphere, one can probably compute the determinant by geometric arguments (I guess someone has thought of this and done the computations since it is a rather natural question). This gives at least a guess of what the average might be. 

Most mathematicians are aware that our species consists of two genders, denoted for simplicity by the multisets $\lbrace X,X\rbrace$ and $\lbrace X,Y\rbrace$, with offspring given by $\lbrace A,B\rbrace$ for $A\in\lbrace X,X\rbrace$ and $B\in \lbrace X,Y\rbrace$. I am asking for the existence of combinatorial structures generalizing this construction. More precisely, given a finite set $\mathcal C$ of $n$ distinct elements ($n=2$ and $\mathcal C=\lbrace X,Y\rbrace$ in the above example) and an integer $k$, we denote by $\mathcal M_k$ the set of all multisets containing exactly $k$ not necessarily distinct elements of $\mathcal C$. A gender partition of a subset $\mathcal S\subset \mathcal M_k$ is a partition of $\mathcal S$ into $k$ non-empty parts $\mathcal G_1,\dots,\mathcal G_k$ called genders such that the following two conditions hold: (i) Given $(g_1,\dots,g_k)\in\mathcal G_1\times \dots \times \mathcal G_k$, every element $(x_1,\dots,x_k)\in g_1\times \dots\times g_k$ gives rise to a multiset $\lbrace x_1,\dots,x_k\rbrace$ which is in $\mathcal S$. (ii) Every multiset $g\in\mathcal S$ is of the form $\lbrace x_1,\dots,x_k\rbrace$ for $(x_1,\dots,x_k)\in g_1\times \dots\times g_k$ where $g_i\in \mathcal G_i$ are suitable elements. Examples with $\mathcal C=\lbrace X,Y\rbrace$ are: (a) $\mathcal S= \lbrace X,X\rbrace\cup \lbrace X,Y\rbrace$ with $\mathcal G_i$ given by singletons. (b) $\mathcal S= \lbrace \lbrace X,X\rbrace,\lbrace Y,Y\rbrace\rbrace \cup \lbrace X,Y\rbrace$ with $\mathcal G_1=\lbrace \lbrace X,X\rbrace,\lbrace Y,Y\rbrace\rbrace$ and $\mathcal G_2$ consisting of $\lbrace X,Y\rbrace$. (c) An example with $k=3$ (easily generalizable to arbitrary values of $k$) is given by $\mathcal S=\lbrace \lbrace X,X,X\rbrace,\lbrace X,X,Y\rbrace, \lbrace X,Y,Y\rbrace\rbrace$ with $\mathcal G_i$ given by singletons. More examples of gender partitions $\mathcal S=\mathcal G_1\cup \dots\cup \mathcal G_k$ are fairly easy to construct. (And there are fairly easy notions for "products", "quotients", one can split an element of $\mathcal C$ into several new elements, etc.) The following additional condition is more difficult to satisfy: Call a gender partition $\mathcal S=\mathcal G_1\cup \dots\cup\mathcal G_k$ balanced if $\mathcal S$ admits a stationary probability measure $\mu$ giving equal weight $\frac{1}{k}$ to all genders $\mathcal G_i$. A probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal S$ is stationary if the probabiliy $\mu(\lbrace x_i,\dots,x_k\rbrace)$ of every offspring of $(g_1,\dots,g_k)$ (with respect to uniform choices for $x_i\in g_i$) is proportional to $\prod_{i=1}^k\mu(g_i)$. (Stationary probability measures exist always and are unique if $\mathcal S$ is minimal in some sense.) Example: The examples (a) and (b) above are balanced, (c) is not balanced. Question: Produce other examples of balanced gender partitions. Is there for example a balanced gender partition for $k=3$? Remark: One can also consider probabilities on offsprings which depend on the choice of $x_i\in g_i$. Example (c) is not balanced even in this more general framework. Variation: Instead of working with multisets, one can also work with sequences of length $k$. An offspring of $k$ sequences $g_1=(g_1(1),\dots,g_1(k)),\dots,g_k=(g_k(1),\dots,g_k(k))$ with $g_i\in\mathcal G_i$ is then given by $g_1(\sigma(1)),\dots,g_k(\sigma(k))$ where $\sigma$ is a (not necessarily arbitrary) permutation of $\lbrace 1,\dots,k\rbrace$. 

A room dedicated to waves, waterwaves, soundwaves and lightwaves illustrating interference, refraction, Fourier transform and so on with the help of concrete (and playful) devices, and explaining that waves are as much mathematics (trigonometric functions, differential equation, complex numbers) as physics (optics, acoustics, quantum mechanics). Perhaps one could also do something around the heat equation? 

Let $\varphi:\mathcal S^{d-1}\longrightarrow \mathbb R_{>0}$ be a strictly positive function describing the boundary $\varphi(\mathbf x)\mathbf x,\mathbf x\in\mathbb S^{d-1}$ of a $d-$dimensional closed convex set $C$ with barycenter at the origin. We consider the decomposition $\varphi=\oplus_{\lambda\in \mathbf{Spec}(\Delta)}\varphi_\lambda$ into eigenvectors associated to distinct eigenvalues of the Laplacian. To what extend does the sequence $\parallel \varphi_\lambda\parallel_{\lambda\in\mathbf{Spec}(\Delta)}$ determine $C$? (This is certainly the case for a sphere of radius $\rho$ since then $\varphi=\varphi_0=\rho$.) Are there examples of two non-isometric convex sets (or even two non-isometric polytopes) for which the two corresponding sequences of norms coincide? Moreover, the convexity of $C$ gives probably constraints for the norms $\parallel \varphi_\lambda\parallel$ since spherical harmonics associated to high eigenvalues wiggle a lot and have thus to be involved with coefficients that are small with respect to $\parallel \varphi_0\parallel$. What are these constraints? 

Choosing for every prime number $p$ an arbitrary rational value $\alpha_p$ for its formal derivation $p'$, one gets a derivation on the rationals by extending the definition with the Leibniz rule given by $\left(\pm\prod_{p}p^{\nu_p}\right)'=\pm\sum_{p}\alpha_p\frac{\nu_p}{p} \prod_{p}p^{\nu_p}$ where sums and products are over all primes (and one can even consider rational exponents $\nu_p$ but let us stick to integers for simplicity). We have then $(ab)'=a'b+ab'$ and $(a^n)'=na^{n-1}a'$ but $(a+b)'\not=a'+b'$ in general. Are there choices of the values $\alpha_p$ giving rise to interesting dynamical systems $x\longrightarrow x'$ on the rationals? (The word "interesting" is of course not well-defined but examples are: only finitely many orbits (in the sense that $a,b$ are considered in the same orbit if $a^{(n)}=b^{(m)}$ for natural integers $n,m$), almost all orbits $a^{(\mathbb N)}$ have infinitely many different elements, almost all orbits $a^{(\mathbb N)}$ are finite, ...) Natural candidates are perhaps $\alpha_p=1$ for all $p$, $\alpha_p$ a (linear combination of) Dirichlet character(s) with rational values or for example $\alpha_p=p$ (this choice fixes all primes). I guess that in general one cannot say much and the study is messy, except if all $\alpha_p$ except one are zero. A first perhaps non-trivial case is given by $\alpha_p=0$ for all primes $p\geq 5$ but $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ are both non-zero rationals. Which choices of values for $\alpha_2,\dots$ give rise to an interesting differential calculus? More precisely, we want a canonical primitive in $\mathbb Q[l_2,l_3,l_5,l_7,l_{11},\dots]$ for every rational number where $l_p$ is a symbol for the logarithm $\int p^{-1}$ of each prime $p$. Are there such choices and if yes has the map $x\longrightarrow \int x$ an interesting dynamical behaviour? I guess that this can be extended to general number fields (where one has probably to work with ideals instead of numbers). Motivation: none except fun and perhaps the existence of a good exercise on the Leibniz rule and the chain rule for undergraduates. 

One should surely also mention the Riemann hypothesis since Riemann computed a few zeros of the zeta function by hand and observed that they were on the critical line. I guess that this contributed to his statement, together with the functional equation, of course. (I hope that I did not overlook this response in the many previous answers, sorry otherwise). Another experimental result with a happy ending is the birth of random matrix theory by Wigner who guessed the circular law after computer experimennts if I am not mistaken. Both subjects have been recently linked experimentally. 

Since the first bin contains $k$ balls with probability $$\frac{{e\choose k}{me-e\choose b-k}}{{me\choose b}},$$ we get the recursion relation $$p_e(m,b)=\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor e/2\rfloor}\frac{{e\choose k}{me-e\choose b-k}}{{me\choose b}}p_e(m-1,b-k)$$ with $p_e(m,b)$ denoting the probability that each of the $m$ bins filled with $e$ balls contains at least as many white than black balls where the total number of black balls is $b$ and with the bins filled randomly in an obvious sense. (If we want strict inequality, we have to replace the upper summation-bound $\lfloor e/2\rfloor$ by $\lfloor (e-1)/2\rfloor$. Using the obvious initial condition $p_e(1,b)=1$ if $b\leq e/2$ (respectively $b$ strictly smaller than $e/2$ if we wish strict inequality) and $p_e(1,b)=0$ otherwise, we can compute $p_e(m,b)$ by an algorithm needing roughly the computation of $2mb+m$ binomial coefficients and having a memory requirement $b$ (by computing $p_e(a+1,0),\dots,p_e(a+1,b)$ using the values $p_e(a,0),\dots,p_e(a,b)$. 

$\mathbb R^3$ is much more rigid than $\mathbb R^2$ when considering conformality: Conformal transformations of $\mathbb R^2$ do not form a finite-dimensional Lie-group. 

Knowing $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty} \left(1+\frac{r}{N}\right)^N=e^r$ (the case where all $a_i$ are equal) we can use continuity and $\left(1+\frac{r}{N}\right)^{Na_i}\sim 1+a_ir$ if $N$ is very huge and $a_i\rightarrow 0$. 

The longest (descending) chain starts obviously with the partition $n$ having a unique part and ends with the partition $1+1+\dots+1$ into singletons. One should move from $n$ to $1+\dots+1$ by moving dots (unities) down row by row whenever possible along staircases: \begin{eqnarray*}&&n,(n-1)+1,(n-2)+2,(n-2)+1+1,(n-3)+2+1,(n-4)+3+1,\\&&(n-4)+2+2,(n-4)+2+1+1,(n-5)+3+1+1,(n-5)+2+2+1,\\&&(n-6)+3+2+1,(n-7)+4+2+1,\dots\end{eqnarray*} etc. Rule: $\dots+\lambda_k+\lambda_{k+1}+\dots$ moves to $\dots+(\lambda_{k}-1)+ (\lambda_{k+1}+1)+\dots$ if $k$ is the largest index such that $\lambda_{k+1}-\lambda_k\geq 2$ (where $\lambda_{k+1}$ can be zero). If no such $k$ exists, diminish the last maximal part by $1$ moving the dot by the minimal possible amount (such moves are necessary in the lower half of the chain in order to "empty" the staircase). I guess one can get a formula for the length of this chain (which can probably be shown to be of maximal length by an induction argument) in terms of triangular numbers. The maximal length should be $2{k+1\choose 3}+\alpha k$ where $k$ is maximal such that $n={k+1\choose 2}+\alpha$ with $\alpha\in\{0,\dots,k\}$. (Without stupid mistake on my behalf.) The first values for $n=1,2,\dots$ are $$0,1,2,4,6,8,11,14,17,20,24,28,32,\dots.$$ This is sequence A6463 of the OEIS which mentions that it is the solution to the above problem!
