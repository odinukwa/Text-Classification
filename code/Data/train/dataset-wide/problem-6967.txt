The blue line is equation (1) where $\theta = 1$ and the red line is 45-degrees line. It can be seen that for all k > 0, k will converge to steady-state k*. The steady-state equilibrium is globally stable. The case is similar for $\theta > 1$, in which the steady-state equilibrium is globally stable. If $\theta < 1$, like $\theta = 0.5$, we can plot the graph similar to: 

where (9.15) is: $$(1+n)[1+\beta^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}(\alpha(k^*)^{\alpha-1})^{\frac{\theta-1}{\theta}}] = (1-\alpha)(k^*)^{\alpha - 1}$$ My question is why $\theta$ has to be greater than or equal to 1 for the steady-state equilibrium to be globally stable? As the textbook derives in (9.17): $$k(t+1)=\frac{(1-\alpha)k(t)^\alpha}{(1+n)[1+\beta^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}(\alpha k(t+1)^{\alpha-1})^{\frac{\theta-1}{\theta}}]}$$ We can rearrange to get: $$\begin{align} k(t)&=\big[ \frac{1+n}{1-\alpha} [k(t+1)+\beta^{-\frac{1}{\theta}}\alpha^{\frac{\theta-1}{\theta}}k(t+1)^{(\alpha-1)(1-\frac{1}{\theta})+1}] \big]^\frac{1}{\alpha} \text{ .....(1)} \end{align} $$ Let $n = 0.01$, $\alpha = 0.25$, $\beta = 0.75$. If $\theta = 1$, we can plot the graph: 

I think that this article might be helpful: “Exotic Preferences for Macroeconomists” $URL$ They give a thorough explanation of many preference functionals and show their usefulness with macroeconomic applications. Im not a specialist in macroeconomics, so I dont know the literature that well, but I think that the most used preferences nowadays are the Epstein-Zin preferences. The article I cite discusses thoroughly their properties. A nice thing this paper has is that it contains detailed comments from Peter Lars Hansen and Ivan Werning among others at the back. Hope it helps! 

I had an interesting casual discussion with a colleague the other day. A lot of western economies at least, such as New Zealand, have some form of retirement pension. It New Zealand it's called Superannuation. For a single pensioner, the amount received is 40% of the average wage. I mentioned that as we get an aging population, the cost to the tax payer of paying this pension will increase. Currently about 12% of the budget is used to pay Superannuation. One of the common solutions put forward is to raise the age that people are eligible to receive the pension. However, my colleague pointed out that raising the retirement age will likely keep older people in the workforce longer, and pointed out that India in fact lowered the retirement age, as to generate jobs for young people. So this poses an interesting problem - on one hand, increasing the retirement age saves the government and taxpayer money. On the other hand, it possibly takes jobs from young people and stiffles their career. Is there any research on the effect of retirement ages and their effect on employment? 

They both want to express that the co-domain of the choice correspondence must include all the non-empty subsets of the power set of X, i.e from any menu of options, you must choose something. My question is, which one is the correct way to define it? Clearly, since $\emptyset \neq \{\emptyset\}$, both definitions cannot be equivalent. My intuition would tell me that from the list above, (1) is the correct one. For example, if $X=\{\text{pasta (p)}, \text{chicken (c)}, \text{sushi (s)}\}$, then the power set of $X$ is: $$ 2^{X}=\Bigg\{\emptyset, \{p \}, \ \{c \}, \{s \}, \{p,c \}, \{p,s \} , \{c,s \}, \{ p,c, s\} \Bigg\} $$ Since I want to “take out” the empty set from $2^{X}$ so that the choice from any non-empty subset of $X$ is itself non-empty, and since $\{\emptyset\} \notin 2^{X}$, it should be $$ c:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow 2^{X}\backslash \emptyset $$ Thank you for any answers! 

The borrowers say to country A's exporter, 'I would like to buy some widgets, get the cash from my bank' and exporter (or rather, the exporter's bank, who is based in country A) says to the bank 'Cash please!'. Country B's bank doesn't have the cash to honor every loan they've made, so they're unable to honor the payments and the loan they gave the borrowers is essentially worthless. The exporter doesn't send the goods. The exporter in country A's bank is ok with the promise of payment from the bank in country B. Afterall - there are also exporters in country B selling goods to people in country A, and this will balance out the loan. 

Your question seems a bit broad. What kind of “theoretical economics” are your reading? Nevertheless, I infer from what you write that you need to start from the beginning with maths for economcis (and maths in general), (this is because of your comment not knowing when to use an exponent and when to multiply. Having said this, I would recommend: “Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis” by Hammond et al This book starts at the basics and builds up mathematical tools to study economic ideas. Having mastered this book, I would try “The Structure of Economics” of Eugene Silberberg. This books is more advanced, but it is “economics with mathematics”, so having aquired the basic mathematical tools in the first book, this book focuses con economic models from a mathematical standpoint. 

It's often said that the best thing you can do to help after a natural disaster is to give money. I have a simple question about how and where that money is sent. I imagine often resources can be donated, but money is still required to utilise them. Is there a study showing the breakdown? 

There are concerns that Auckland, New Zealand, is currently experiencing a housing bubble. Auckland is one of the top 10 cities in the world on a housing unaffordability index. The question is - how as economists can we tell whether housing prices reflect a bubble or genuine market value? I would be looking at average wages, crime rates, happiness, and other social measures of the city (ie. it's reasonable that people would be willing to spend more on a house in a utopian city). A good answer should comprehensively list these and explain the relevance of these metrics. 

The graph is similar to graphs for the case that $\theta \geq 1$. The steady-state equilibrium is still globally stable. I can't find a case where $\theta < 1$, but the steady-state equilibrium is not globally stable. It seems that $\frac{1}{\alpha} > 1$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ determines the shape of equation (1), making the steady-state equilibrium globally stable. It would be good if someone could show me a counter-example where $\theta < 1$, but the steady-state equilibrium is not globally stable. It would be better if someone could show me how to prove proposition 9.4 formally. Acknowledgement: The graphs are modified from those generated by Wolframalpha. Edit (Apr 19, 2017): Case $\theta = 0$: Note that when the textbook derives (9.17), it implicitly assumes that $\theta \neq 0$ (for derivation of Euler equation for consumption in P.333 of 2009 edition of the textbook). When $\theta = 0$, equation (1) no longer applies. Returning to the utility maximization problem with $\theta = 0$: $$ \text{max } U(t) = c_1(t) + \beta(c_2(t+1)) \text{ such that } c_1(t) + \frac{c_2(t+1)}{R(t+1)} = w(t) \\ \Leftrightarrow \text{max } U(t) = c_1(t) + \beta(w(t) - c_1(t))R(t+1) = c_1(t) (1 - \beta R(t+1)) + \beta R(t+1)w(t) \\ \text{ ...Should treat R(t+1) as given as consumer's own optimization problem} $$ s(t) has to be non-negative for $k(t+1) = \frac{s(t)}{1+n}$ and k(t+1) is non-negative. $$ c_1(t)^* = \begin{cases} w(t)\text{, for }\beta R(t+1) <1 \\ [0, w(t)]\text{, for }\beta R(t+1) = 1 \\ 0\text{, for }\beta R(t+1) > 1 \\ \end{cases} $$ $$ s(t)^* = \begin{cases} 0\text{, for }\beta R(t+1) <1 \\ w(t) - c_1(t)^* \in [0, w(t)]\text{, for }\beta R(t+1) = 1 \\ w(t)\text{, for }\beta R(t+1) > 1 \\ \end{cases} $$ For $R(t+1) = f'(k(t+1)) = \alpha k(t+1)^{\alpha - 1}$, $$ k(t+1) = \frac{s(t)}{1+n} = \begin{cases} 0\text{, for }\beta R(t+1) <1 \Leftrightarrow k(t+1) < (\alpha \beta)^{\frac{1}{1 - \alpha}} \\ \frac{w(t) - c_1(t)}{1+n} \in [0, \frac{w(t)}{1+n}]\text{, for }\beta R(t+1) = 1 \Leftrightarrow k(t+1) = (\alpha \beta)^{\frac{1}{1 - \alpha}}\\ \frac{w(t)}{1+n} = \frac{k(t)^\alpha - k(t)\alpha k(t)^{\alpha -1}}{1+n} = \frac{1-\alpha}{1+n}k(t)^\alpha\text{, otherwise} \Leftrightarrow k(t) > [\frac{1+n}{1 - \alpha} (\alpha \beta)^{\frac{1}{1 - \alpha}}]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}} \\ \end{cases} $$ Cases: Case 1: $\beta R(t+1) < 1 \Leftrightarrow R(t+1) < \frac{1}{\beta}$: As the production function $f(k)$ is Cobb-Douglas, it satisfies the Inada condition: $lim_{k(t) \to 0} f'(k(t)) = \infty$. But as $f'(k(t)) = R(t)$, $lim_{k(t) \to 0} R(t) < \infty$ for $R(t) < \frac{1}{\beta} < \infty$ as $\beta \in (0,1)$, violating the Inada condition. This contradiction means this case is impossible. Case 2: $\beta R(t+1) = 1 \Leftrightarrow \beta \alpha k(t+1)^{\alpha-1} = 1 \Leftrightarrow k(t+1)^{\alpha-1} = \frac{1}{\alpha \beta} \Leftrightarrow k(t+1)^{1-\alpha} = \alpha \beta$: Denote saving rate at t as $\mathcal{S}(t) = \frac{s(t)}{w(t)}$. $k(t+1) = \frac{s(t)}{1+n} = \frac{\mathcal{S}(t)w(t)}{1+n} = \frac{\mathcal{S}(t)(1-\alpha)k(t)^\alpha}{1+n}$. At steady state, $k^* = \frac{\mathcal{S}^*(1-\alpha){k^*}^\alpha}{1+n}$, meaning $\mathcal{S}^* = \frac{1+n}{1-\alpha}{k^*}^{1-\alpha} = \frac{1+n}{1-\alpha} \alpha \beta$. For $\mathcal{S}^* > 1 \Leftrightarrow (1+n)\alpha\beta > 1 - \alpha \Leftrightarrow \beta > \frac{1 - \alpha}{\alpha (1+n)}$, which is possible. As saving rate cannot be larger than 1, this contradiction means this case is impossible. Case 3: $\beta R(t+1) > 1$: This case is possible. $$ k(t+1) = \frac{1-\alpha}{1+n} k(t)^\alpha $$ We can draw the graph: The red line is 45-degrees line. The blue line is $k(t+1) = \frac{1-\alpha}{1+n} k(t)^\alpha$ where $0 < \alpha < 1$. For all k(0) > 0, k will converge to steady state $k^* = \frac{1-\alpha}{1+n} {k^*}^\alpha \Leftrightarrow k^* = [\frac{1-\alpha}{1+n}]^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}$. The steady-state equilibrium is globally stable. 

In practise what happens is that the banks are exchanging money between each other all day (for example XYZ bank customers may have paid cheques to ABC bank customers), and at the end of the day they need to settle the difference by taking a loan from someone. In New Zealand's system for example, that difference can be borrowed from the Reserve Bank (New Zealand's central bank) - paying interest at the Official Cash Rate (OCR). This rate is set by the Reserve Bank - and is the primary means that the Reserve Bank controls inflation.
