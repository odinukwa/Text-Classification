Suppose a Lie group $G$ acts properly on a manifold $M$. Let $\pi: M\rightarrow M/G$ be the projection. One can construct a bounded, smooth "cut-off" function $$c:M\rightarrow [0,\infty),$$ with two properties: 

Part 1 of question: I've seen it implicitly written that the index of $D$ is unchanged by this modification. Why is this true (perhaps from a functional calculus perspective)? Part 2 of question: Is it possible to see that the index of $D$ is unchanged using the integral expression $$f(D)\psi = \frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^\infty D(D^2+1+\lambda^2)^{-1}\psi\,\,d\lambda?$$ For instance, if $D$ is invertible as an operator $H^1\rightarrow L^2$ (where $H^1$ is the first Sobolev space), with inverse $D^{-1}:L^2\rightarrow H^1$, can we write down an inverse for $f(D):L^2\rightarrow L^2$ using an integral expression that involves $D^{-1}$? 

It seems that Keesling's 1994 paper "The One-Dimensional Cech Cohomology of the Higson Compactification and Its Corona" contains the required result (Corollary 1). It may have been mis-cited. 

My question concerns a statement on page 12 of the following paper of Baum, Connes, and Higson: $URL$ about the definition of the $G$-index map from the $G$-equivariant $K$-homology group $K_0^G(X)$ to $K_0(C_r^*(G))$, where $X$ is a proper $G$-compact $G$-manifold. Suppose $(H_+,H_-,F)$ is a $G$-equivariant abstract elliptic operator on $X$ (defined on the previous page of the same paper), so that $H_+$ and $H_-$ are Hilbert spaces equipped with unitary $G$-representations and $G$-covariant representations $\pi_{\pm}$ of $C_0(X)$, and $F$ is a certain bounded $G$-equivariant Hilbert space operator $H_+\rightarrow H_-$ satisfying a list of conditions (page 11). One can complete of the subspace $\pi_{\pm}(C_c(X))H_\pm\subseteq H_\pm$ into a $C_r^*(G)$-module $\mathcal{H}$, as well as complete the operator $F$ into an adjointable operator $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathcal{H}$. It is then stated that "thanks to the axioms for an abstract elliptic operator (and the fact that $X$ is $G$-compact)", $\mathcal{F}$ is in fact a Fredholm operator. I'm looking for some clarification and confirmation on two questions (the first is more of a sanity check): 

Hi Mathoverflow. This question is about building intuition for the Proj construction. When I first started learning about schemes, I found the construction of the structure sheaves on Spec and Proj very confusing. However, after enough time had passed I began to understand the construction for Spec: It is sort of an algebraic partition of unity argument. The construction of the structure sheaf on Proj is still very mysterious to me. For completeness it goes something like this: 

this paints a very vivid picture. Indeed, if you are thinking about just sets and functions, everything is golden and this makes perfect sense. Even if you are thinking about manifolds, everything is fine. However, it is not immediately obvious how to translate such a statement into the language of schemes and that is one of the biggest hurdles when learning algebraic geometry, so lets walk through how the translation works in this case. The formula above already gives a hint as to what is going on in the scheme world. Write $\mathbb{P}^3 = {\rm Proj} \mathbb{C}[z_{00},z_{01},z_{10},z_{11}]$. Being slightly imprecise (you can fix this by talking about line bundles) the homogeneous polynomial $z_{ij}$ pulls back to $x_i y_j$. This means that regular function $ z_{pq} / z_{ij}$ pulls back to $ x_p / x_i \cdot y_q / y_j $ which is a regular function on $ D_+(x_i) \times D_+(y_j)$. We have described a morphism $D_+(x_i) \times D_+(y_j) \to D_+(z_{ij})$. Both of these schemes are affine so we only need to explain how regular functions pull back to describe the morphism. Now we want to glue all of these morphisms together. It is a little messy to write down but you can algebraically verify that both of the morphisms $D_+(x_i) \times D_+(y_j) \to D_+(z_{ij})$ and $D_+(x_i') \times D_+(y_j') \to D_+(z_{i'j'})$ restrict to the same morphism $$ D(x_i' / x_i) \times D(y_j' / y_j) \to D(z_{i'j'} / z_{ij}) $$ modulo changing coordinates (when you change coordinates on a product, you change coordinates on each component independently). This means they glue to give us an affine morphism $ \mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^3 $ under which $z_{ij}$ pulls back to $ x_i y_j$. 

Suppose $D$ is a Dirac operator acting on sections of a bundle $E$ over a manifold $M$, and define the Sobolev spaces $H^i(E)$ via the inner products $$\langle e_1,e_2\rangle_{H^i}:=\sum_{k=0}^i\langle D^k e_1,D^k e_2\rangle_{H^0},$$ where $e_1,e_2\in C_c^\infty(E)$. Then the closure $\overline{D}$ of $D$ is a bounded operator $H^1(E)\rightarrow H^0(E)$. When $E$ is a vector bundle, $H^i(E)$ are Hilbert spaces, hence $\overline{D}$ is guaranteed to have an adjoint $\overline{D}^*:H^0(E)\rightarrow H^1(E)$. More generally, when $E$ is a bundle of Hilbert $A$-modules over some $C^*$-algebra $A$, it is still said in the literature (see for instance part 1 of Bunke's 1995 paper on Callias-type operators) that $\overline{D}^*$ also exists, even though one knows that in general, bounded operators need not be adjointable. It seems to me that if $s\in H^1(E)$ and $t\in H^0(E)$, we have $$\langle\overline{D}s,t\rangle_{H^0} = \langle s,\overline{D}(\overline{D}^2+1)^{-1}t\rangle_{H^1},$$ and so it looks like $\overline{D}(\overline{D}^2+1)^{-1}:H^0(E)\rightarrow H^1(E)$ would be the adjoint, except that the existence of $(\overline{D}^2+1)^{-1}$ means that $D$ is essentially self-adjoint, which is true many cases but in general needs to be proved (and which is something that people often state after declaring $\overline{D}$ to be bounded adjointable). Question -1: Is the above expression for $\overline{D}^*$ correct when $D$ is essentially self-adjoint? Question 0: How does one show, without knowing $D$ is essentially self-adjoint, that $\overline{D}$ is adjointable? (Is there an argument using pseudo-differential calculus, for instance?) 

Let $\lambda$ be a partition with $\leq n$ rows and let $L_{\lambda}$ be the corresponding irreducible representation of ${\rm GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$. Let $e_m(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ be the $m$th elementary symmetric polynomial. Is there a known formula for the element $c_m \in Z(U(\mathfrak{gl}_n))$ which acts on $L_{\lambda}$ by the scalar $e_m(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)$? It is easy to check that $c_1 = E_{11} + \dots + E_{nn}$, so I suspect that $c_m$ should be related to the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial. Also, I am aware of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism, but have not been able to use it to produce a formula. I would be particularly interested in references where this is worked out. I couldn't find it in any of the standard representation theory text books. 

If there is even a single NPC problem in P, then P = NP. NPC problems are defined to be the hardest problems in NP in a suitable sense: every other NP problem reduces to them in polynomial time. 

In the theory of algebraic groups one of the fundamental results is the structure theorem for connected solvable groups. I never understood the proof in any of the standard textbooks, so I just moved on and treated the result like a black box. Some time later I realized that over $ \mathbb{C} $ you can prove the theorem easily using the exponential map. (side question: Is it true that once you have proved the structure theorem over $ \mathbb{C}$ then you have it over any algebraically closed field of characteristic $ 0 $?) I still have absolutely no idea why this structure theorem is true over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. 

Let us say that a bounded smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ has vanishing variation at infinity (or satisfies "property $A$" for short) if, for any $r\neq 0$, we have $$\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{|f(x+r)-f(x)|}{|r|} = 0.$$ In particular this means that $$\lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\left(\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{|f(x+r)-f(x)|}{|r|}\right) = 0.$$ An example of such a function is any smooth function whose gradient vanishes at infinity (or satisfies "property $B$" for short): that is, $$\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\left(\lim_{r\rightarrow 0}\frac{|f(x+r)-f(x)|}{|r|}\right) = 0.$$ On the other hand, there are functions satisfying property $B$ that do not satisfy property $A$. One type of example is any smooth function that has a limit as $x\rightarrow\infty$ but whose derivative does not go to zero; however note that such functions can always be approximated in the uniform norm by a sequence of functions satisfying property $A$. Question: can any function satisfying $A$ be approximated in the uniform norm by a sequence of functions satisfying $B$? More precisely: given any $f$ satisfying $A$, can we find a sequence of functions $(f_i)$ satisfying $B$ such that for any $\epsilon > 0$, $||f-f_i||_\infty<\epsilon$ for all $i$ sufficiently large? 

Let $M$ be a manifold and $\pi : E \to M$ a rank $n$ vector bundle on $M$. We can define a connection on $E$ in two ways: 

I understand the intuition behind this result: Since the open sets are so big, the scheme $$ \varprojlim_{p \in U\subseteq X \; \text{open}} U $$ captures a lot of infomation about $X$ at the point $p$. I can imagine a proof which goes like this: We can assume without loss of generality that the varieties in question are affine. Therefore we are reduced to proving that an isomorphism $ R_{\mathfrak{p}} \to S_{\mathfrak{q}}$ of rings induces an isomorphism $ R_f \to S_g$ for suitable elements $f \notin \mathfrak{p} $ and $ g \notin \mathfrak{q} $. This approach is a bit disappointing in my opinion because the result is so geometric and we reduce it to a formal proof about localization. 

Let $\mathcal{R}$ be representations of $U(\mathfrak{g})$ and $\mathcal{R}_q$ be type 1 representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$. As you mentioned, $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}_q$ are equivalent as categories. This is because they are both semisimple and they have the same set of irreducibles. Moreover, $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}_q$ have the same fusion ring. You can see this by considering characters. They are not equivalent as tensor categories because the associators are fundamentally different. You can see this concretely in the case $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{sl}_2$ by computing 6j symbols as described in the book The classical and quantum 6j symbols. More abstractly, the 6j symbols are "coordinates" on the moduli stack of tensor categories with a fixed fusion ring. For example, if $G$ is a finite group, then the moduli stack of tensor categories with fusion ring $\mathbb{C}[G]$ is $H^3(G,\mathbb{C}^{\times}) / {\rm Out}(G)$.
