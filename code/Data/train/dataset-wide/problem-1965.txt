or when looking for the Salina Group (the blue dots are cross-reference from the Paleobiology Database, if I understood correctly): 

At the request of the OP, a little word on another group of organic-walled microfossil with a extensive, coherent Paleozoic fossil record: the Chitinozoans. This enigmatic group was found by Eisenack (1931) and because of their resistance to acids & bases he thought they consisted of chitin, hence the name he gave them. However studies (Voss-Foucart & Jeuniaux 1972; Jacob et al. 2007) showed that they do not consist of chitin or any kind of chitin-like bioproduct but of a network of kerogen with aromatic compounds. The diagenetic path that lead to this chemical composition is however unknown, meaning that we know neither what was their chemical composition when those organisms (NB: we don't know as well what their biological affinities are, though metazoan eggs seem to be a popular hypothesis, see e.g. Paris & Nõlvak 1999) were alive nor how they preserved.

Redrawn after Zachos et al. 2001. This is a plot of the Cenozoic variations of $\delta\ce{^{18}O}_{Cibicidoides}$ according to Zachos et al. 2001 (this is a bit outdated now but the Paleocene is roughly the same in more modern curves such as Zachos et al. 2008 or Cramer et al. 2011). It is supposed to follow variations in deep ocean temperatures and thus reflect the climate state at a given time. The Paleocene is the timeframe delimited by the two vertical bars (you can see the PETM quite clearly on one of the two bars). From that plot it seems the Paleocene deep-sea temperature prior to the PETM is roughly at the same level at it is during the Middle Eocene (ca. 45 Ma), i. e. warmer than most of the Cenozoic but colder than the Early Eocene or most of the Cretaceous. There isn't actually that many studies focussing on the Paleocene itself, this is clearly a time interval that is studied so far mostly because of the K/T boundary or the PETM, i. e either because of its start or its end.

Organic-walled microfossils (wether they be dinoflagellates, pollens, spores or "acritarchs") all have in common to contain an organic compound known as sporopollenin (for the spores and pollens) or dinosporin (for dinoflagellates and, I believe, acritarchs as well). Both compounds have chemical and structural similarities but have appeared independently. Those compound are incredibly resistant. To give you an idea, to collect siliceous microfossils we first dissolve the sediments with HCl (hydrochloric acid) to get rid of carbonate microfossils. Palynologists (who study such organic-walled microfossils) uses HF (hydrofluoric acid) to get rid of both carbonate and siliceous microfossils (e.g. Doher 1980). Sporopollenin therefore resist to HF, which has a pH of ca. 3. In addition to this, they are also unusually resistant to microbiological degradation (e. g. Gunnison & Alexander 1975). They are however not resistant to oxydation, hence, probably, why we don't find more of them in the sediments. Additionally, to break sporopollenin walls (in order to study the inner side of those walls) ultrasound can be used (e. g. Lennie 1968). "Organic-walled" doesn't mean no hard part, it just means no "mineral" hard part. Sources: Doher, I., 1980.

So the polymerization process to go from resin to solidified resin (copal) takes weeks. At that point, the system is already closed meaning the contained organisms correspond to that time interval. The next step (amberification) consists of further polymerization as well as oxydation and can take several million years (Poinar 1992). However the minimum time needed for this process is unknown.

The main interest of tephrochronology (i.e. dating sediments using volcanic ash layer) is specifically its instantaneity (relatively to geological timescale of course). It is precisely used for higher-resolution dating. An example would be the Kawakawa/Oruanui tephra from New Zealand which is a good isochronous marker bed at 26.5 ka, spread over 1500km, but represents probably only a few months of volcanic activity (see e. g. Manville & Wilson 2006) Important factors vis-à-vis the usefulness of a specific ash layer however are its geographical extent (a volcanic event that will spread an ash layer over a whole basin would be more useful in that it will be used to correlate a large number of sites together) and maybe its volume (you need a minimum amount of material to work with, I'll assume).

To answer the $p_{CO_2}$ aspect of the question, here is a graph modified from Kent & Muttoni (2013): 

The process of forming continental crust is indeed thought to have started in the early Archean (i. e. between ca. 4 Ga and ca. 3.5 Ga). But it did continue later: Hawkesworth & Kemp showed in their 2006 review that while much of the continental crust had formed by 2 Ga, i. e. until the middle of the Paleoproterozoic, some of it still continued forming later. As far as the Fennoscandian shield is concerned, it seems that though it started forming in the Meso-Archean, and that much of the eastern and northern part of it are Archean (see Slabunov et al. 2006), the southern and western part is indeed mostly Paleo- and Mesoproterozoic (see e. g. Lahtinen et al. 2008). In Figure 1 of Lahtinen et al. 2008, it seems that the southern part of Finland, just north of the Gulf of Finland (the Uusimaa Belt) is Paleoproterozoic.

I'm going to answer assuming you are referring to the time between the moment when the organism absorbs the carbon and the moment when it is trapped in sediments. I'm also going to answer by talking about what I know best, i. e. diatoms, which happens to be the major component of the biological pump. The variation you are referring to is consistent with the fact that coastal diatoms only have a few hundred meters to sink before reaching the seafloor, whereas open-ocean diatoms are sinking for ca. 1000 to 5000 meters. According to a compilation by Lisitzin (1972), so arguably a little dated, the settling velocity of marine diatoms in the water column is only of a few meters per day (he advances the number of 0.2 to 1.2m/day for 20 to 50µm-sized marine diatoms). But it can vary according to many factors and some of the coarsest, heaviest forms (such as resting spores) or diatoms that travel down in fecal pellets of copepods can be faster and reach the seafloor in an open ocean setting in only a few hundred days. We don't usually consider this as being part of the biological pump sensu stricto but of course most of the organic matters created by diatoms from atmospheric CO2 is recycled by the zooplankton that grazes on them, which is in turn recycled by what feeds on that zooplankton, etc. Eventually some of them will end up trapped in sediments as well. This lengthens the process of course. Lisitzin, A. P., 1972. Sedimentation in the world ocean. Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists, Special Publication 17: 218pp. 

Since this percentage is an area ratio, it fluctuates with sea level. Consequently it has fluctuated quite a few during the Phanerozoic (see Haq et al. 1988; Miller et al. 2005 for instance). Now if we're talking in term of oceanic/continental crust ratio, the present day continental crust age repartition shows that, by 2 Ga, ca. 60% of the present day continental crust was already formed (see e. g. Hawkesworth & Kemp 2006) meaning that most of the variation in oceanic/continental crust occurred prior to the middle Paleoproterozoic. Haq et al. 1988. Mesozoic and Cenozoic chronostratigraphy and cycles of sea-level changes. SEPM Special Publication, 42: 71-108. Hawkesworth & Kemp 2006. Evolution of the continental crust. Nature, 443: 811-817.

According to a review by Nance & Murphy (2013), there are five known supercontinents, from the most recent to the most ancient: 

See Klemme 1994 for a detailed explanation on the origins of the Jurassic source rocks (i. e. 25% of the world's reserve at the time): most of them are marine, but some are fluvial or from lagoonal inland seas (table 3.2).

Finally, identifying the environment at the time of deposition of the outcrop where the fossil was found have always been the most straight-forward test done using fossils. It is also probably the easiest and most obvious hypothesis to test for an 8 years-old: go to a local fossiliferous outcrop (a geological map of your area will be necessary for this), make her look for fossils and answer whether or not the studied area was underwater at the moment this outcrop was deposited, or how deep it was, etc., based on the fossils she found. Similarly fossils can be used to test hypotheses on the age of the outcrop but unless your local outcrop happen to contain trilobites, ammonites or mammals, it might be too technical for an 8 years-old. 

There seems to be indeed reasons to believe in an enhanced volcanism during the Cretaceous at least. The Cretaceous timescale is indeed peppered by the formation of large igneous provinces (known collectively as LIP; short review in Ogg & Hinnov 2012a): Parana at ca. 135Ma, the Ontong-Java Plateau at ca. 125Ma, the Kerguelen Plateau at 118Ma, the Caribbean Province at 90Ma and of course the famous Deccan Traps at the K/Pg boundary. In addition to those large events, they were as well other more minor pulses of large-scale volcanism during the earliest Cretaceous (Shatsky Rise), and at ca. 87Ma (Madagascar Traps) and ca. 73Ma (Sierra Leone Rise). The 5 LIP, though localized to a specific region each time, had a global impact on the climate and on the oceans, as seen on $\delta ^{13}C$ curves for instance, or during the different episodes of Oceanic Anoxic Events. As far as the pop culture trope is concerned, most of these volcanic events were partly underwater (Shatsky Rise, Sierra Leone Rise, Kerguelen Plateau, Ontong-Java) so I doubt dinosaurs were roaming around active volcanoes. It is probable that the trope originated instead in the idea that the Deccan Traps triggered the end Cretaceous mass extinction (i. e. the disparition of non-avian dinosaurs, in particular). In comparison (see Ogg & Hinnov 2012b), there were only one LIP forming during the Jurassic in the Karoo Basin (South Africa); if we ignore the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province which formed just below the base of the Jurassic (it may or may not have caused the end-triassic mass extinction).

In Schmidt & Dilcher 2007, the authors were interested specifically on how amber can trap aquatic organism, so this is a specific, out-of-the-norm case study but it might give you at least on order of magnitude. Here is an extract:
