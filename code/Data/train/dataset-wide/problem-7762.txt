Let me extend my comment. The Osterwald-Schrader axioms were invented to make the physical idea of Wick rotating quantum fields rigorous. Namely, the OS axioms are axioms on the correlation function of some classical fields, which ensure that these correlation functions can be analytical continued, such that they fulfill the Wightman axioms, thus give quantum fields on a Hilbert space via the Wightman (which is basically the GNS) reconstruction. If you assume conformal covariance, the correlation functions are formally the same (off diagonal), but for quantum fields they are well-defined on the diagonal, because they are boundary values of holomorphic function in some tube. So for 1D example the two-point function gets: $$ W(x,y) = \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0^+} \frac1{(x-y+i\varepsilon)^{2d}} $$ where the limit is in a weak sense. But the fields don't commute anymore, for example if $d=1$ $$\langle [\phi(x),\phi(y)]\rangle=W(x,y)-W(y,x)\sim \delta'(x-y)$$ so the commutator is supported on the diagonal. But it is a perfect conformal covariant distribution, which is conformally covariant. So in your example you could take $$ W(f)=\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0^+} \int_\mathbb{R} \frac{f(x)}{x+i\varepsilon}\,dx $$ as an extension to the Schwartz functions. 

There is only one equivalence class of indecomposable module categories, namely the trivial one. Let us look into the possible algebras. They are $1$ and $1\oplus \tau$, and both have a unique algebra structure. For the first this is trivial and for the second is basically saying that the $A_4$ subfactor is unique. But $1\oplus\tau =\tau\otimes \bar\tau$ so it coincides with the internal action hom $\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(\tau,\tau)$ of Fib as a module category over itself. Here is another proof. The only possible connected Ã©tale (commutative) algebra is $1$, as the OP points out. Then by Corollary 3.8 in 

A fully faithful tensor functor between fusion categories with the same Frobenius-Perron dimension is dominant, thus an equivalence. 

The Drinfeld center $Z(C)$ of a braided category "contains" $C$ and $\bar C$ (the category with opposite braiding) and therefore also $C\boxtimes \bar C$ and you can show that the following is equivalent 1) $C$ is modular 2) $Z(C)$ is equivalent with $C\boxtimes \bar C$. In other words, for a braided category $C$ there is a natural notion of a center $Z(C)$ and a natural embedding $C\boxtimes \bar C$ in $Z(C)$ which is an equivalence if and only if $C$ is modular. 

The Drinfeld center of a spherical fusion category has topological central charge $0\pmod 8$ see Remark 5.19 in 

I think it should work as follows. Let $\Omega$ be a vector cyclic and separating for $N$. Then $$\Omega_2=\begin{pmatrix} \Omega & 0\\0 &\Omega \end{pmatrix}$$ is cyclic and separating for $M=N\otimes \mathbb M_2(\mathbb C)$, where $M$ acts by left multiplication. If we can choose isometries $s,t\in N$ satsifying $ss^\ast +tt^\ast =1$, with $s^\ast s =t^\ast t=1$ and $t^\ast s =s^\ast t =0$ then $$\Phi= \begin{pmatrix} s^2\Omega &st\Omega \\ ts\Omega & t^2\Omega\end{pmatrix} =v\Omega_2\,, \qquad v=\begin{pmatrix} s^2 &st \\ ts & t^2\end{pmatrix} $$ should be a joint cyclic and separating vector for $N\otimes I_2$ and $M$. Because we can write every element in $M$ as $$ \begin{pmatrix} a &b \\c & d\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} as^\ast s^\ast+b t^\ast s^\ast + c s^\ast t^\ast +d t^\ast t^\ast& 0\\0& as^\ast s^\ast+b t^\ast s^\ast + c s^\ast t^\ast +d t^\ast t^\ast\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} s^2 &st \\ ts & t^2\end{pmatrix}\,,$$ we have $ (N\otimes I_2)v = M $ and in particular $\Phi$ is cyclic for $N\otimes I_2$. Further $\Phi$ is cyclic for $M'$ because $\Omega_2$ is cyclic for $M'$ and $\Phi=v\Omega_2$ with $v\in M$. In the case asked, $N=B(H)$ and $H$ separable, let $\{e_0,e_1,e_2,\ldots\}$ be a ONB of $H$. Define e.g. isometries by $se_i=e_{2i}$ and $te_i=e_{2i+1}$ in $B(H)$. Take $B(H)$ in the standard form acting on the Hilbert-Schmidt operators $L^2(H)$. Then any positive element $\Omega\in L^2_+(H)$ will be cyclic and separating for $B(H)$. 

This is rather an addition to my comment, as Scott Morrision already give the same answer. Usually, what's meant by the Verlinde formula is that the fusion coefficients $N_ {ij}^k$ can be determined by the S-matrix by the formula: $$ N_{ij}^k = \sum_l \frac{S_{jl}S_{il} (S^{-1})_{lk}}{S_{0l}}. $$ While this formula looks mysterious, it basically says that the matrix $S$ diagonalizes the fusion rules, as I want to explain now. Let us see the fusion coefficients as matrices $N_i$ with coefficients $(N_i)_{ik}=N_{ij}^k$. If we assume that the fusion rules are associative and abelian it follows that these matrices commute, i.e. $N_iN_j=N_jN_i$, so in principle they can be simultaneously diagonalizable, that means there exist a matrix $S$ such that $$N_i = SD_iS^{-1},$$ where $D_i$ are diagonal matrices with eigenvalues $\lambda^i_j=(D_i)_{jj}$. Another assumption is that the eigenvalues are non-degenerate. Now $N_0$ is the identity matrix and it holds $SN_0=S$, which implies $$ S_{il} = \sum_k N_{i0}^k S_{kl}= \sum_{m,k} S_{0m}\lambda^i_m (S^{-1})_{mk}S_{kl} = S_{0l}\lambda^i_l $$ and it holds: $$ \lambda^i_l=\frac{S_{il}}{S_{0l}} \quad \Longrightarrow N_{ij}^k = \sum_l \frac{S_{jl}S_{il} (S^{-1})_{lk}}{S_{0l}}. $$ So this part is trivial. The insight of Verlinde was, that the modular transformation $\mathcal{S}:\tau\mapsto -1/\tau$ acting on the characters $\chi_\mu(\tau)$ associated to primary fields $\phi_\mu$ diagonalizes the fusion rules, more precisely the matrix $S$ given by: $$ \chi_k(-1/\tau) = \sum_l S_{kl} \chi_l(\tau) $$ does the above job for the fusion $i \times j$ of primary fields, i.e. $N_{ij}^k$ fulfilling: $$ \chi_{i\times l} (\tau) = \sum_k N_{ij}^k \chi_{k}(\tau). $$ I am probably too young to know about the history, but from what I read this is the reason why this formula is called Verlinde formula. A first proof of this goes back to Moore and Seiberg. In the categorical approach, the matrix $Y_{ij}$ associated to the Hopf link in a modular tensor category diagonalizes the fusion rules, that gives the case of the formula Scott Morrison mentions. The first time this was proven in the abstract setting of what is called nowadays unitary braided categories was afaik in Rehren: "Braid group statistics and their superselection rules": The Algebraic Theory of Superselection Sectors, D. Kastler ed., Proceedings Palermo 1989, World Scientific 1990, pp. 333-355 

Yes, the same thing can be done using in terms of the TL algebra. Namely, that is how the Jones polynomial was originally defined. For TL, there are two ways to get the link invariant, which both leads to a skein theory formula. The original way of Jones or the Kaufmann bracket. See also here: $URL$ Another way to see it is, that the representation category of $\mathrm{SU(2)}_k$ (which is the same of $U_q\mathrm{sl}_2$ for some $q$) and the Temperley-Lieb-Jones planar algebra $A_{k+1}$ are essentially the same, just that in the $\mathrm{SU(2)}_k$ case the fundamental representation is pseudo-real while Temperley-Lieb is real, but they lead to the same link invariant (at different discrete values I think). The issue is also considered in for example, where they show how the Skein relation construction and the quantum group gives the same invariant up to a minus sign, or exactly the same using a non-standard ribbon element and for framed undirected links: $URL$ 

I am looking for a counter example which shows, that a full rational 2D CFT (with respect to a given chiral subtheory) is not characterized by its modular invariant partition function. People tell me such an example exists, but noone could point out a concrete example or reference to me. 

While symmetric Frobenius algebras in symmetric monoidal categories play a role in 2D TFT, Frobenius algebras in symmetric monoidal categories with "Nakayama automorphism" which is an involution play a role for TQFT on spin surfaces. The symmetric ones (i.e. trivial Nakayama automorphism") give exactly TFTs not depending on the spin structure, see $URL$ 

I guess the OP refers to Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants coming from ribbon categories which are the representation category of quantum groups at root of unity. This construction works for every non-degenerated ribbon category, also called modular tensor category. (Non-degenerate means that the S-matrix is invertible. The S-matrix is obtained as follows, the entry $S_{ij}$ is the categorical trace of a "double braid" $c_j,i\circ cc_i,j\in \mathrm{Hom}(i\otimes j,i\otimes j)$ where $i,j$ run over a choice of isomorphism classes of simple objects, in other words, $S_{i,j}$ is the value of the Hopf link colored with $i$ and $j$.) So I guess the OP is basically asking for modular tensor categories which are not coming from quantum groups. Examples are Drinfeld centers of fusion categories, but this invariants coincide with the Turaev-Viro invariant for the fusion category and are in general not coming from q-deformations of Lie algebras/Quantum groups. There are two examples of this form discussed in $URL$ one comes from the even part of a $E_6$ subfactor and the other from the even part of the Haagerup subfactor. I guess for both examples there is no skein theory established, and it is probably easier to calculate the invariants from the underlying fusion category. There are also standard constructions to pass from one modular tensor category to another one by taking, for example, commutative algebra objects in a given category. In this case, the local modules of the algebra give a new modular tensor category. There is discussion in $URL$ There is also a list of some known examples of modular tensor categories on $URL$ 

Here is a trivial example for Question 1. Take $R\otimes 1\subset R\otimes \mathrm{B}(\ell^2(\mathbb N))$, then the only irreducible bimodules in the summands are the respective trivial ones, thus the rank is finite. The index is infinite, since the relative commutant is infinite dimensional. Similarly, for a type III factor $M$ you can take the subfactor $\rho(M)\subset M$, where $\rho =\sum_i^\infty \mathrm{Ad} v_i$, where $\sum_i^\infty v_iv_i^\ast=1$ and $v^\ast_iv_j=\delta_{ij}$. More general, one can take a reducible subfactor with infinite relative commutant, such that the local subfactors generate the same finite set of bimodules (or a subset of it). Examples are easy to construct, start with a finite index finite depth subfactor $\rho(M)\subset M$ of type III and take $\rho_\oplus(M)\subset M$ with $\rho_\oplus=\bigoplus_{i=1}^\infty \rho$. The same construction can be adapted to a type II${}_1$ factor and yields an inclusion into a type II${}_\infty$ subfactor. 

I am also fine with an example in any other formulation of CFT any reference in physics literature, non-degenerate braided subfactors or similar... 

Let $\mathcal C$ be the $\mathrm{SU(2)}_k$ modular tensor category and let $\mathcal M$ be a module category. Ostrik showed in the same article the OP mentioned that there is an algebra $A$ in $\mathcal C$, such that $\mathcal M\cong \mathcal C_A$ as (left) module categories. Let $\mathcal D=\mathrm{Fun}_\mathcal{C}(\mathcal M,\mathcal M)$ be the dual category, which is equivalent with the bimodule category ${}_A\mathcal C_A$. Now by definition every invertible object in $\mathcal D$, i.e. every object in the Picard group $\mathrm{Pic}(\mathcal D)$, gives a symmetry of the module category $\mathcal M$ and also of its based ring. Then it is easy to check in the literature (see below) that all symmetries of $G=A,D,E$ Dynkin diagrams correspond to invertible elements of $\mathcal D$. Namely, one simply has to count that there are exactly $|\mathrm{Aut}(G)|$ invertible objects, *edit*: (see Noah Snyder's comment) acting "faithful" on the Grothendieck ring. Thus all symmetries of the Dynkin diagram are symmetries of corresponding module category Much of the data of the dual categories for $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ has been calculated in the subfactor literature. See for example Section 6.2 of Jens BÃ¶ckenhauer, and David E. Evans, Modular invariants, graphs and $\alpha$-induction for nets of subfactors. III., Comm. Math. Phys. 205 (1999), no. 1, 183â228. and Section 6 of Jens BÃ¶ckenhauer, David E. Evans, and Yasuyuki Kawahigashi, Chiral structure of modular invariants for subfactors, Comm. Math. Phys. 210 (2000), no. 3, 733--784.. Remark. The OP ask for quantum $sl_2$, but by Proposition 8.2.6 in FrÃ¶hlich, JÃ¼rg(CH-ETHZ-P); Kerler, Thomas(1-HRV) Quantum groups, quantum categories and quantum field theory. Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 1542. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1993. viii+431 pp. ISBN: 3-540-56623-6 it follows that all modular tensor categories of $\mathrm{SU(2)}_k$ type are braided equivalent.
