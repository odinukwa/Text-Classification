It is easy to see that a space $X$ has Lebesgue covering dimension less than or equal to $n$ if and only if whenever $\mathcal{U}$ is an open covering, there is some refinement $\mathcal{V}$ so that whenever $O_{0},...,O_{n+1}\in\mathcal{V}$ are distinct we have $O_{0}\cap...\cap O_{n+1}=\emptyset$. This notion can be extended to locales in the obvious way. In particular, we say that a frame $L$ has Lebesgue covering dimension at most $n$ if whenever $C\subseteq L$ and $\bigvee C=1$, there is some $D\subseteq L$ with $\bigvee D=1$, for all $d\in D$ there is some $c\in C$ with $d\leq c$, and where if $x_{0},...,x_{n+1}\in D$ are distinct, then $x_{0}\wedge...\wedge x_{n+1}=0$. I am not aware if the point-free version of the Lebesgue covering dimension has been studied already, but point-free topology has not been well developed, so it seems like someone would study the point-free Lebesgue covering dimension in the future. 

The paper 1 by Thomas Jech gives several characterizations of the $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebras $B$ such that there is some measure $\mu$ that makes $(B,\mu)$ a $\sigma$-finite measure algebra. I will state a couple of those characterizations here and I would encourage the reader to look at Jech's paper for the other characterizations and more information. If $B$ is a Boolean algebra, then a cellular family is a subset $r\subseteq B\setminus\{0\}$ such that if $a,b\in r,a\neq b$, then $a\wedge b=0$. A partition of a Boolean algebra $B$ is a cellular family $p\subseteq B\setminus\{0\}$ with $\bigvee p=1$. A Boolean algebra $B$ satisfies the countable chain condition if every partition of $B$ is countable. A Boolean algebra $B$ is weakly distributive if whenever $p_{n}$ is a partition of $B$ for all natural numbers $n$ there is a partition $p$ of $B$ where if $a\in p,n\in\mathbb{N}$, then the set $\{b\in p_{n}|a\wedge b\neq 0\}$ is finite. A measure algebra is a pair $(B,\mu)$ such that $B$ is a $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra and $\mu:B\rightarrow[0,\infty]$ is a mapping such that $\mu(a)=0$ iff $a=0$ and $\mu(\bigvee_{n}a_{n})=\sum_{n}\mu(a_{n})$ whenever $a_{n}\wedge a_{m}=0$ for $m\neq n$. 

the space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is regular if and only if for each $U\in\mathcal{T}$, we have $U=\bigcup\{V\in\mathcal{T}|V\prec U\}$, and the space $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is completely regular if and only if for each $U\in\mathcal{T}$, we have $U=\bigcup\{V\in\mathcal{T}|V\ll U\}$. 

The free groups cannot be axiomized by first order axioms. If the free groups were axiomatizable by first order axioms, then the ultraproduct of free groups would be a free group. However, the group $\mathbb{Z}$ is free, but for every non-principal ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $\mathbb{N}$, the ultrapower $\mathbb{Z}^{\mathcal{U}}$ is not free since it is an abelian group of cardinality continuum. More generally, any ultrapower $G^{\mathcal{U}}$ by a non $\sigma$-complete ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ of any free group $G$ is not free since the ultrapower $G^{\mathcal{U}}$ contains an isomorphic copy of the non-free subgroup $\mathbb{Z}^{\mathcal{U}}$ (recall that the subgroup of a free group is always free). 

E. The answer to question E is no for varieties by a simple cardinality argument. Indeed, we can say much more. We claim that if $\mathcal{A}$ is an algebra with arbitrarily finitary operations and $X,Y\subseteq\mathcal{A}$ are minimal generating sets(i.e. no subset of $X$ generates $\mathcal{A}$), then either $X$ and $Y$ are both finite or $X$ and $Y$ are both infinite and of the same cardinality. The proof is by a simple cardinality argument. If $X,Y$ are minimal generating sets, then for each $x\in X$ there is a finite subset $Y_{x}\subseteq Y$ with $x\in\langle Y_{x}\rangle$. Therefore $X$ is generated by $\bigcup_{x\in X}Y_{x}$. However, since $X$ and $Y$ are minimal generating sets, we have $Y=\bigcup_{x\in X}Y_{x}$. Therefore, if $X$ is finite, then $Y=\bigcup_{x\in X}Y_{x}$ is finite as well. Similarly, if $Y$ is finite, then $X$ is finite, so $X$ is finite if and only if $Y$ is finite. If $X$ is infinite, then $|Y|=|\bigcup_{x\in X}Y_{x}|\leq\aleph_{0}\cdot|X|=|X|$ and similarly $|X|\leq|Y|$, so $|X|=|Y|$. 

$\mathbf{Proof}$ $1\rightarrow 3$. Suppose that $X$ is paracompact. Then let $\mathcal{U}$ be the collection of all relatively compact open subsets of $X$. Then $\mathcal{U}$ has a locally finite open refinement $\mathcal{V}$ and clearly each $V\in\mathcal{V}$ is paracompact. $3\rightarrow 2$. Suppose that $x$ has a locally finite open covering $\mathcal{C}$ consisting of relatively compact open sets. Let $(\mathcal{C},E)$ be the graph where we let $U,V$ be connected by an edge if $\overline{U}\cap\overline{V}\neq\emptyset.$ If $x\in\overline{U}$, then there is an open set $O_{x}$ which intersects only finitely many sets $\overline{W}$ for $W\in\mathcal{C}$, namely $W_{1,x},...,W_{n_{x},x}$. Therefore, there are $x_{1},...,x_{n}$ in $\overline{U}$ such that $\overline{U}\subseteq O_{x_{1}}\cup...\cup O_{x_{n}}$. In particular, the only sets $W$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that it is possible that $\overline{U}\cap\overline{W}$ are the sets $W_{1,x_{1}},...,W_{n_{x_{1}},x_{1}},...,W_{1,x_{n}},...,W_{n_{x_{n}},x_{n}}$. Therefore, the graph $(\mathcal{C},E)$ is locally finite. Therefore let $P$ be the partition of $\mathcal{C}$ into connected components. Then $\{\bigcup\mathcal{R}|\mathcal{R}\in P\}$ is a partition of $X$ into open sets where each $\bigcup\mathcal{R}$ is $\sigma$-compact. $2\rightarrow 1$. This follows from the well-known fact that every open cover $\mathcal{U}$ of $X$ has an open refinement $\bigcup_{n}\mathcal{A}_{n}$ such that each $\mathcal{A}_{n}$ is locally finite. $\mathbf{QED}$ 

Suppose that $b$ is a braid. Then $b$ can be uniquely written as $D_{RL}(b)^{-1}N_{RL}(b)$ where $D_{RL}(b),N_{RL}(b)$ are the unique positive braids such that $b=D_{RL}(b)^{-1}N_{RL}(b)$ and where $D_{RL}(b)^{-1}\wedge_{L}N_{RL}(b)=e$ where $r\wedge_{L}s$ denotes the left gcd of the positive braids $r$ and $s$. See Chapter 2 of Dehornoy's book Braids and Self-Distributivity for more information about this decomposition. I wonder what information about the braid $b$ can be recovered from the positive braids $D_{RL}(b),N_{RL}(b)$. Suppose that $b$ is a braid. Then if Karen has access to both $D_{RL}(b),N_{RL}(b)$, then Karen is able to recover the entire braid $b$. What information about the braid $b$ can Karen recover if she has access to only $D_{RL}(b)$ or only $N_{RL}(b)$? I am mainly interested in orderly braids $b$ where if $w=\sigma_{\alpha_{1}}^{e_{1}}...\sigma_{\alpha_{k}}^{e_{k}}$ is a braid word for $b$ with a minimized length, then there will likely be many $i$'s where $\alpha_{i}$ is very close to $\alpha_{i+1}$. I am also interested in what properties of the braid $b$ make it likely or unlikely for one to recover information about $b$ when one knows $D_{RL}(b)$ or $N_{RL}(b)$. 

Let me expound on a somewhat plausible scenario of an inconsistency in the large cardinal hierarchy that may take a very long time to appear. A rank-into-rank embedding is an elementary embedding $j:V_{\lambda}\rightarrow V_{\lambda}$. Lemma If $j$ is a rank-into-rank embedding, then $(j*j)(\alpha)\leq j(\alpha)$ for all ordinals $\alpha$. Proof Suppose that $\alpha<\lambda$. Let $\beta$ be the least ordinal such that $j(\beta)>\alpha$. Then $$V_{\lambda}\models\forall x<\beta,j(x)\leq\alpha.$$ Therefore, by elementarity, $$V_{\lambda}\models\forall x<j(\beta),(j*j)(x)\leq j(\alpha).$$ In particular, since $\alpha<j(\beta)$, we conclude that $(j*j)(\alpha)\leq j(\alpha)$. $\mathbf{QED}.$ The above lemma has the following corollary as a purely combinatorial consequence. If $1\leq x\leq 2^{n}$, then let $o_{n}(x)$ be the least natural number such that if $A_{n}$ is the classical Laver table of cardinality $2^{n}$, then $A_{n}\models x*2^{o_{n}(x)}=2^{n}$. In other words, $o_{n}(x)=\text{log}_{2}(p)$ where $p$ is the period of $x$ in the classical Laver table $A_{n}$. Corollary Assume there exists a rank-into-rank cardinal. Then for all natural numbers $n$, one has $o_{n}(1)\leq o_{n}(2)$. The functions $n\mapsto o_{n}(1)$ and $n\mapsto o_{n}(2)$ are strictly increasing. However, Randall Dougherty has shown that these functions increase very very slowly. A straightforwards computer calculation shows that $o_{n}(1)\leq o_{n}(2)$ whenever $o_{n}(1)\leq 4$. Under large cardinal hypotheses, we have $o_{n}(1)\rightarrow\infty$. However, the statement $o_{n}(1)\rightarrow\infty$ does not seem to imply that $o_{n}(1)\leq o_{n}(2)$ for all $n$. In the following theorem, $f_{n}^{\text{Ack}}$ is a version of the Ackermann function. Theorem (Dougherty) The least natural number $n$ such that $o_{n}(1)\geq 5$ is at least $f_{9}^{\text{Ack}}(f_{8}^{\text{Ack}}(f_{8}^{\text{Ack}}(254)))$. Corollary If there is a natural number $n$ with $o_{n}(1)>o_{n}(2)$, then the least natural number $n$ such that $o_{n}(1)>o_{n}(2)$ is greater than $f_{9}^{\text{Ack}}(f_{8}^{\text{Ack}}(f_{8}^{\text{Ack}}(254)))$. Therefore if one tries to prove that rank-into-rank cardinals are inconsistent by exhibiting an $n$ such that $o_{n}(1)>o_{n}(2)$, then one would need to take more than $f_{9}^{\text{Ack}}(f_{8}^{\text{Ack}}(f_{8}^{\text{Ack}}(254)))$ steps. Of course, there may be short-cuts in showing that $o_{n}(1)>o_{n}(2)$ for some $n$ which take much less time than actually calculating the least $n$ such that $o_{n}(1)=5$. Or there could be an entirely different sort of contradiction with the assertion that there exists a rank-into-rank cardinal. For the record, here are the first few values of $o_{n}(1)$ and $o_{n}(2)$. $o_{1}(1)=0,o_{1}(2)=1;o_{2}(1)=1,o_{2}(2)=1;o_{3}(1)=2,o_{3}(2)=2;o_{4}(1)=2,o_{4}(2)=2;o_{5}(1)=3,o_{5}(2)=3;o_{6}(1)=3,o_{6}(2)=3;o_{7}(1)=3,o_{7}(2)=4;o_{8}(1)=3,o_{8}(2)=4;o_{9}(1)=4,o_{9}(2)=4$. If such an inconsistency were to pop up only very far away, then such an inconsistency will not have any effect on the mathematics that mathematicians here on Earth will do because nobody will live long enough to observe such a contradiction. This being said, set theorists generally do not think that there is any contradiction anywhere in the large cardinal hierarchy up until say $I0$ no matter how distant the contradiction is located. 

Let $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ be the set of all elementary embeddings $j:V_{\lambda}\rightarrow V_{\lambda}$. If $A\subseteq V_{\lambda}$, then let $j^{+}(A)=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}j(A\cap V_{\alpha})$, and let $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}[A]=\{j\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}\mid j^{+}(A)=A\}.$ We say that a non-trivial subalgebra $X\subseteq\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ has the simplicity property if whenever $\gamma<\lambda$ and $\gamma$ is a limit ordinal, and $\simeq$ is a congruence on $X$ such that $j\equiv^{\gamma}k\Rightarrow j\simeq k$ for all $j,k\in X$, then there is some $\ell\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}[A]$ where $j\simeq k$ if and only if $j\equiv^{\mathrm{crit}(\ell)}k$ for all $j,k\in X$. 

Let $I$ be an uncountable set, and give $\mathbb{R}^{I}$ the product topology. Then $\mathbb{R}^{I}$ becomes a complete locally convex topological vector space. Let $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{I}$ be the set of all sequences $(x_{i})_{i\in I}$ such that $x_{i}\neq 0$ for at most countably many indices. Then $A$ is a sequentially closed, but $A$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^{I}$, so $A$ is not closed. 

Such a map does not exist since a continuous map on $X$ must be constant almost everywhere. In other words, if $f:X\rightarrow X$ is a map such that $f^{-1}[A]\in u$ for each $A\in u$, then $\{x\in X|f(x)=x\}\in u$. For a proof, see the book The Theory of Ultrafilters by Comfort and Negrepontis Thm 9.2 or Andreas Blass's dissertation p. 12. 

$\mathbf{Proof}$ Suppose that $(\{1,...,n\},C)$ is a closure system with $\emptyset,\{1\},...,\{1,...,n\}\in C$. Then $\emptyset,\{1\},...,\{1,...,n\}$ is a chain in $C$ of length $n+1$. Now assume that $L\in C$ is join-irreducible in the lattice $C$. Then clearly $L=\bigvee_{a\in L}^{L}C^{*}(\{a\})$. Therefore, since $L$ is join-irreducible, we have $L=C^{*}(\{a\})$ for some $a\in\{1,...,n\}$. In particular, there can be at most $n$ join-irreducible elements in the lattice $C$. We conclude that $height(L)\geq|J(L)|$, so $height(L)=|J(L)|$, and $C^{*}(\{1\}),...,C^{*}(\{n\})$ are the join-irreducibles in $C$. Now for the converse, assume that $L$ is a finite lattice such that $height(L)=|J(L)|$ and $J(L)=n$. Let $0=x_{0}<x_{1}<...<x_{n}=1$ be a chain of length $n+1$. Then $J(x_{0})\subset J(x_{1})\subset...\subset J(x_{n})$ (and each subset here is a proper subset). Since $J(x_{i})\subseteq J(L)$ for $0\leq i\leq n$ and $J(L)=n$, we conclude that there are $a_{1},...,a_{n}$ such that $J(x_{i})=\{a_{1},...,a_{i}\}$ for $1\leq i\leq n$. In this case, we have $J(L)=\{a_{1},...,a_{n}\}$. Now let $C=\{J(x)|x\in L\}$. If $a\in J(L)$, then $a\in\bigcap_{i\in I}J(x_{i})$ if and only if $a\leq x_{i}$ for $i\in I$ if and only if $a\leq\bigwedge_{i\in I}x_{i}$ if and only if $a\in J(\bigwedge_{i\in I}x_{i})$. Therefore $\bigcap_{i\in I}J(x_{i})=J(\bigwedge_{i\in I}x_{i})$. We conclude that $C$ is a closure system. Furthermore, we have $J(x_{i})=\{a_{1},...,a_{i}\}\in C$ whenever $0\leq i\leq n$. I now claim that the mapping $f:L\rightarrow C$ where $f(x)=J(x)$ for all $x\in L$ is a lattice isomorphism. By definition, the mapping $L$ is surjective. Furthermore, since each $x\in L$ is a join of join-irreducible elements, we have $x=\bigvee J(x)=\bigvee f(x)$. Therefore, if $f(x)=f(y)$, then $x=\bigvee f(x)=\bigvee f(y)=y$. Therefore, the mapping $f$ is a bijection. Now, if $x\leq y$, then clearly $f(x)\subseteq f(y)$, and if $f(x)\subseteq f(y)$, then $x=\bigvee f(x)\leq\bigvee f(y)=y$. Therefore, the mapping $f$ is an order-isomorphism, and hence a lattice isomorphism. $\mathbf{QED}$ In particular, if $L$ is a finite lattice with $height(L)=|J(L)|$ and $B\subseteq L$ is a chain of length $height(L)+1$, and $B\subseteq M\subseteq L$ is a subset closed under taking all meets, then $M$ is a finite lattice with $height(M)=|J(M)|$. If $P$ is a poset and $x\in P$, then let $\downarrow x=\{y\in P|y\leq x\},\uparrow x=\{y\in P|y\geq x\}$. If $L$ is a complete lattice, then let $C=\{\downarrow x|x\in L\}$. Then $(L,C)$ is a closure system and the lattices $L$ and $C$ are isomorphic. In particular, for each finite lattice $L$, there is a closure system $(\{1,...,n-1\},C)$ such that the lattice $C$ is isomorphic to $L$. Let $D$ be the collection of all sets $L\subseteq\{1,...,n\}$ such that if $n\in L$, then $L\cap\{1,...,n-1\}\in C$. Then it is easy to show that $D$ is a closure system with $\emptyset,\{1\},\{1,2\},...,\{1,2,...,n\}\in D$. Therefore $Height(D)=|J(D)|$. Now define a mapping $\iota:C\rightarrow D$ by $\iota(L)=L\cup\{n\}$. Then $\iota$ is an injective lattice homomorphism and an isomorphism from $C$ to $\uparrow D^{*}(\{n\})$. We therefore conclude that for each lattice $L$ there is a lattice $M$ with $Height(M)=|J(M)|$ and an $x\in M$ such that $L\simeq\uparrow x$. In particular, if a universal sentence $\phi$ is satisfied by each finite lattice $L$ with $Height(L)=|J(L)|$, then $\phi$ is satisfied by every finite lattice (this is because universal sentences are preserved under taking subalgebras). Thus, the finite lattices with $Height(M)=|J(M)|$ do not satisfy any identities that are not satisfied by all finite lattices. 

Here is another counterexample. I claim that the set $\{(x,y)\in X\times X|x\leq y\}$ is never measurable whenever $X$ has cardinality greater than the continuum. Suppose that $\{(x,y)\in X\times X|x\leq y\}$ is measurable. Then the set $\{(x,y)\in X\times X|x\geq y\}$ is also measurable. Therefore, the diagonal $\{(x,x)|x\in X\}=\{(x,y)\in X\times X|x\leq y\}\cap\{(x,y)\in X\times X|x\geq y\}$ is also measurable. To see that the diagonal cannot be measurable, assume that $B\subseteq X\times X$. Then define $B_{x}=\{y\in X|(x,y)\in B\}$. Now define an equivalence relation $\simeq_{B}$ on $X$ where $x\simeq_{B}y$ if and only if $B_{x}=B_{y}$. Now let, $\mathcal{B}$ be the collection of all subsets of $X\times X$ where $\simeq_{B}$ has at most continuumly many equivalence classes. Then I claim that $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. Clearly, $\mathcal{B}$ contains both $\emptyset$ and $X$. Furthermore, $\simeq_{B}=\simeq_{B^{c}}$, so $\mathcal{B}$ is closed under complementation. Now assume that $B_{n}\in\mathcal{B}$ for all $n\in\omega$ and let $B=\bigcup_{n}B_{n}$. Now let $\simeq$ be the equivalence relation on $X$ where $x\simeq y$ whenever $x\simeq_{B_{n}}y$ for all $n\in\omega$. Then define a mapping $i:X/\simeq\rightarrow \prod_{n\in\omega}X/\simeq_{B_{n}}$ by letting $i([x]_{\simeq})=([x]_{\simeq_{B_{n}}})_{n\in\omega}$. Then $i$ is an injective mapping, so since $|\prod_{n\in\omega}X/\simeq_{B_{n}}|\leq(2^{\aleph_{0}})^{\aleph_{0}}=2^{\aleph_{0}}$, we conclude that $X/\simeq$ has cardinality at most continuum. Now define a mapping $j:X/\simeq\rightarrow X/\simeq_{B}$ by $j([x]_{\simeq})=[x]_{\simeq_{B}}$. Then $j$ is surjective. Therefore $X/\simeq_{B}$ has cardinality at most continuum as well. Therefore, $B\in\mathcal{B}$, so $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. On the other hand, $\mathcal{B}$ contains all products $R\times S$ where $R,S\subseteq X$, but $\mathcal{B}$ does not contain the diagonal $\{(x,x)|x\in X\}$. Therefore, the product $\sigma$-algebra does not contain the diagonal either. 

Let $B_{n}$ denote the $n$-strand braid group. Let $B_{[m,n]}$ denote the subgroup of $B_{n}$ generated by the strands $\sigma_{m},...,\sigma_{n-1}$. If $b$ is a braid, then let $|b|$ denote the length of the shortest braid word that represents $b$. Suppose now that $n,r,s$ are natural numbers with $1<s<r<n$. If $b\in B_{n}$ is a braid chosen at random, then what are some bounds for the expected value of $\textrm{Min}\{|abc|:a\in B_{r},c\in B_{[s,n]}\}$. I am especially interested in the cases where $s$ and $n-r$ are small compared to $n$. I am especially interested in the case when $s=2$. I will let the answerer choose the distributions to use. Heuristic and experimental answers are welcome. 

$\textbf{Question 1}$ The answer to this question is affirmative. The closure operators that you call good closure operators are normally called algebraic closure operators. Furthermore, each algebraic closure operator is of the from $\mathrm{scl}_{\mathcal{A}}$ for some algebra $\mathcal{A}$. A proof of this fact is given here on Theorem 3.5 in Chapter 2. Suppose that $C$ is an algebraic closure operator on some set $A$. Let $\mathcal{F}_{n}$ be the set of all $n$-ary functions $f:A^{n}\rightarrow A$ such that $f(a_{1},...,a_{n})\in C(a_{1},...,a_{n})$ whenever $a_{1},...,a_{n}\in A$. Let $\mathcal{A}=(A,\bigcup_{n}\mathcal{F}_{n})$. Then it is easy to see that $C=\mathrm{scl}_{\mathcal{A}}$. 

From the above result, we conclude that if $X$ is an $F$-space, then every sequence in $X$ is eventually constant. If $(x_{n})_{n}$ is not eventually constant, then take a subsequence $(y_{n})_{n}$ where each $y_{n}$ is distinct and where the set $Y:=\{y_{n}|n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is discrete. Let $f:Y\rightarrow [0,1]$ be the map where $y_{n}=0$ whenever $n$ is even and $y_{n}=1$ whenever $n$ is odd. Then $f$ extends to continuous map $g:X\rightarrow[0,1]$. However, the sequence $g(y_{n})$ cannot converge to anything, so $(x_{n})_{n}$ is not convergent. In particular, since $\beta D$ is an $F$-space for discrete $D$, there are no non-trivial convergent sequences in $\beta D$. [1] Gillman, Leonard, and Meyer Jerison. Rings of Continuous Functions,.

Let $X$ be a separating proximity space. Then the Smirnov compactification of $X$ can be defined in terms of filters. A filter $F$ on a proximity space $X$ is said to be a round filter if for each $R\in F$, there is an $S\in F$ with $S\prec R$. An end is a round filter $F$ such that if $A\prec B$, then $B\in F$ or $X\setminus A\in F$. It can be shown that the ends are precisely the maximal round filters. The Smirnov compactification of $X$ is simply the collection of all ends. See [1] for details on proximity spaces and the Smirnov compactification. In my research, I used the Smirnov compactification in finding the maximal ideal space of $L^{\infty}(\mu)$ for any measure $\mu$. One can generate other examples of spaces of ultrafilters by looking at zero-dimensional spaces. Recall that a space is zero-dimensional if it has a basis consisting of clopen sets. The advantage of looking at zero-dimensional spaces is that the ultrafilters are generally ultrafilters on Boolean algebras. If $X$ is a zero-dimensional space, then the Banaschewski compactification of $X$ is simply the collection of all ultrafilters on the Boolean algebra of clopen sets of $X$. A space $X$ is said to be strongly zero-dimensional if whenever $Z_{1},Z_{2}\subseteq X$ are disjoint zero sets, then there is a clopen set $C$ with $Z_{1}\subseteq C,Z_{2}\subseteq C^{c}$. For example, every zero-dimensional Lindelof space is strongly zero-dimensional. One can show that a space $X$ is strongly zero-dimensional if and only if $\beta X$ is zero-dimensional. It turns out that the Banaschewski compactification of zero-dimensional space $X$ is the Stone-Cech compactification if and only if $X$ is strongly zero-dimensional.
