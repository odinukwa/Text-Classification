Hi... I am wondering how 'eigenvalues' that don't lie in my Hilbert space combine into producing the spectral measure. I study probability and I am quite ignorant in the field of spectral analysis of operators on Hilbert spaces so please go easy on me :), yet i tried reading parts of the classical Simon and Reeds "Functional analysis" volume 1, and other books. I feel i am very far from an answer. At least, now i can formulate my question. The mathematical setting is the following: I consider a general (possibly unbounded) operator $A$ on a Hilbert space H with scalar product $(. , .)$, say $H = L^2( \mathbb{R} )$. $D(A)$ will be a dense domain. I do understand that the spectrum $\sigma(A)$ is defined as the complementary of the resolvent set, and can be broken into continuous, residual and point spectra. In the case of self-adjoint operators (hence closable), a very abstract version the Von-Neumann spectral theorem asserts that $A$ can be diagonalized using a spectral decomposition of the identity. The full setting would look like (cf "Quantum physics for mathematicians" by Leon Takhtajan): 

To continue on Byron's answer, properties 1) and 3) specify the law of the process, but not the topological features of a given trajectory $\omega$. In a sense, 1) and 3) are enough to define the Wiener measure, since generating n points from a brownian path only needs those. Byron exhibited another 'version' of the process that is not continuous by changing the process on a set of measure 0 (his stopping time will never hit a specific point $t$ taken in advance because the law of T has a density). A typical verification that needs to be done is if a process defined by its law has continuous versions, which is what entails Kolmogorov continuity theorem (link wikipedia page). Basically, the idea is that if $X_t$ and $X_s$ are close on average when $t$ and $s$ are close, you can change the process on a set of zero measure to get something continuous. I can also recommend reading the beginning of the classical Revuz and Yor about definitions of 'undistinguishable processes' and 'versions of the same process'. Cheers 

I realised that this is actually not such a difficult question, so I'll answer it myself! (My solution is somewhat inspired by Jochen Wengenroth's comment. Thanks Jochen) From the definition of $|| \cdot ||_{X_c}$, we immediately have $||x||_{X_c} \leq ||x||_X$ for all $x \in X$. So if $||\cdot||_{X_c}$ is a norm on $X$, then the completion $X_c$ of $(X,||\cdot||_{X_c})$ is a Banach space, and $X$ embeds continuously into $X_c$. If $x \in X$, then there exists an $x^*$ in the dual $(X_c)^*$ such that $x^*(x) \neq 0$ - because $X_c$ is a Banach space. But since $X$ embeds continuously into $X_c$, we have that $x^*$ restricts to an element of $X^*$, and therefore we've found $x^* \in X^*$ such that $x^*(x) \neq 0$. So $X^*$ separates points. This is good enough for the applications I have in mind, but I'm still interested in other characterisations when $X^*$ separates points, so feel free to contribute any more that you may have. 

The lecture notes of the various Internet Seminars on Evolution Equations ($URL$ sound like something you'll enjoy. The topics vary with each seminar, but all are based on semigroup theory. I participated in the 16th internet seminar, and I found the lecture notes from this seminar quite illuminating (particularly when paired with Engel-Nagel). The notes are at $URL$ Enjoy! 

For $p,q \in (0,\infty)$ and $s \in \mathbb{R}$, one can define certain function spaces, $B_s^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $F_s^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces respectively. The definition of these spaces is a bit complicated, and it probably won't offer any new insight to anybody who hasn't already considered these spaces, but it can be found for example in Triebel's 'Theory of Function Spaces II' (section 2.3.1) or Grafakos' 'Modern Fourier Analysis' (section 6.5.1). For both of these spaces, one can rightfully refer to $p$ as the 'integrability index' and to $s$ as the 'regularity index'; for example, the spaces $F_s^{p,2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ are equivalent to the Sobolev spaces $W_s^{p}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, and one can justify the integrability/regularity interpretations when $q \neq 2$ or for the spaces $B^{p,q}_s(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Is there a simple way of describing the role of the $q$ index? Or are stuck with referring to it as 'the third index'? 

tl;dr: Is there such a thing as a W*-completion of a C*-algebra, and if so, where can I read about it? I'm wondering about the relationship between (abstract) C*-algebras and W*-algebras. On the one hand, every W*-algebra is a C*-algebra. On the other hand, it seems to me that it should be possible to complete any C*-algebra to a W*-algebra. (Categorially, this would be a reflection.) In the case of commutative algebras, I even think that I know how this works: every commutative C*-algebra is the algebra of continuous functions on some compact Hausdorff space, and we extend this to the W*-algebra of essentially bounded Borel-measurable functions on the space (considered up to equality almost everywhere). So, is this correct? Does it work for noncommutative algebras as well? Is there a good algebro-analytic (without passing through topology) description of this? Is there a good reference, especially online? Also, in the commutative case, it seems that every state (positive normal linear functional) on a C*-algebra extends uniquely to its W*-completion, so they have the same space of states. Is this correct? Does it extend to the noncommutative case? Another question is how this relates to concrete algebras (those given as algebras of operators on some Hilbert space). One way to complete a C*-algebra would be to pick a concrete representation and take its weak closure (or double commutant). But I expect that this will depend on the representation chosen. (And my analysis is bad enough that I can't check this for even the commutative case.) I'd appreciate any help even for the main question, never mind this stuff about states and representations! 

This isn't really a research question, but at least it's research-level mathematics. I'm talking with some other people about the first uncountable ordinal, and I want some facts to inform this discussion. Specifically, what useful or interesting foundations of mathematics do or don't allow one to prove the existence of an uncountable ordinal? If you don't have a better interpretation, then for "useful", you can probably take "capable of encoding most if not all rigorous applied mathematics"; for "interesting", you can probably take "popular for study by researchers in foundations". For "existence of an uncountable ordinal", you could take "existence of a well-ordered uncountable set", "existence of a set whose elements are precisely the countable ordinals", etc. Hopefully there is a body of known results or obvious corollaries of such, since it could be a matter of some work to apply this question to foundational system X, and I don't expect anybody to do that. 

A precise statement in the language of interpolation theory (in more generality, but this is the best way to state the result in my opinion) can be found in Theorem 6.4.5(7) of Bergh and Löfström's Interpolation Spaces. If you haven't learned some abstract interpolation theory, now's your chance! This also answers your Question 2: there is indeed a result in the case $r_1 \neq r_2$, $p_1 \neq p_2$. You have $T : H^{s_1} \to H^{s_2}$ with $s_2$ defined analogously to $s_1$. 

Let $(X,d,\mu)$ be a metric measure space (i.e. $(X,d)$ is a metric space and $\mu$ is a Borel measure on $X$). Let's say that $X$ is doubling if there exists a constant $C \geq 1$ such that $0 < \mu(B(x,2r)) \leq C\mu(B(x,r)) < \infty$ for all $x \in X$ and $r > 0$ (note the finiteness and positivity conditions which don't always appear in this definition). The metric space $(X,d)$ is Polish if it is separable and completely metrisable (i.e. there exists a complete metric, not necessarily $d$, which determines the same topology). Are there any examples of metric measure spaces $(X,d,\mu)$ which are doubling but not Polish? One can prove that if $\mu(B(x,r)) \in (0,\infty)$ for all $x \in X$ and $r > 0$, then $(X,d)$ is separable, so we only need to concern ourselves with complete metrisability. (I haven't seen this in the literature anywhere, so I have no idea if this is already known, but I have a proof of my own.) My approach to this problem was to take a non-Polish metric space which is geometrically doubling (every ball can be covered by uniformly finitely many balls of half the radius) and invoke the theorem which guarantees the existence of a doubling measure (Theorem 13.3 in Heinonen's Lectures on Analysis on Metric Spaces). But alas, a key hypothesis of this theorem is that $(X,d)$ is complete (hence Polish), so this doesn't work. 

On a noncompact Riemannian manifold $M$, the $L^2$-spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ sits inside $\mathbb{R}$ (by self-adjointness), either to the left or to the right of $0$ depending on sign convention. I know that under various curvature assumptions one can show that the $L^p$-spectrum is equal to the $L^2$-spectrum for $p \neq 2$. Without making any geometric assumptions on $M$, is it possible to conclude that the $L^p$-spectrum of $\Delta$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$? If not, is there anything we can say about the $L^p$-spectrum without having to make any additional assumptions?
