Prohibit any $n\times n$ square which is not a subsquare of a shifted complete square. For a $(N+n)\times (N+n)$ square one of whose $n\times n$ corners contains a black cell, only its $(2n-1)\times (2n-1)$ corner squares may also contain something black. 

It seems that if you replace $x,y,z$ by their hulls and apply the `obvious' claim to them then you get the desired half-plane $h$. Namely, if $h$ or its complement contains, say, $x$ then it surely contains $\mathop{\rm hull} x$. 

Just to augment @js21's answer. The question of whether irrational $x_i$ are necessarily transcendent is equivalent to this question. As the answer suggests, even this specific question is wide open, or at least was such in 2012. As for the other bases $b>2$, the result is similar. Defining $x_i$ as in js21's answer, you get that $$ x_{b-1}=\frac{x+\frac1{b-1}-f(x)}{b} $$ is algebraic though not normal. (Surely, if $x_{b-1}$ is just rational, then $x-(b-1)x_{b-1}$ will be an algebraic irrational though not normal.) 

These are just several thoughts. but it seems that they show in particular that the answr is $0$ for $k< p^p-1$. $\def\FF{{\mathbb F}}$ 1. Firstly, denoting $d=\mathop{\rm lcm}(p-1,p^2-1,\dots,p^p-1)$ we see that $A^{pd+p}=A^p$ for every matrix $A$ (the order of a semisimple component divides $d$, and we need $p$ in order for a nilpotent component to vanish). Thus we may assume that $k < pd+p$. 2. Your sum is equal to $$ S=\sum_{a_{11}\in\FF_p} \dots\sum_{a_{pp}\in\FF_p} \left(\sum_{i=1}^p\sum_{j=1}^p a_{ij}E_{ij}\right)^k, $$ Now expand the inner brackets; we obtain $$ S=\sum_J \left(\sum_{a_{11}\in\FF_p} \dots\sum_{a_{pp}\in\FF_p} a^J\right)M_J, $$ where the outer summation is taken over some multiindices $J$ with $|J|=k$, and $M_J$ are some matrices. The summation in brackets over $a_{ij}$ gives zero unless the exponent of $a_{ij}$ is nonzero and divisible by $p-1$. Thus the sum in the brackets vanishes unless all the coordinates of $J$ are nonzero and divisible by $p-1$. So, if $k < p^2(p-1)$ then $S=0$, as is in the case $k=80$ and $p=17$. 3. For the remaining case, we need to calculate $M_J$. Assume that $J=(j_{11},\dots,j_{pp})$ (all $j$'s are multiples of $p-1$). Consider a digraph $G_J$ with $\FF_p$ as the set of vertices and $j_{k\ell}$ edges from $k$ to $\ell$. Now, if $M_J=[m_{k\ell}]$ then $m_{kk}$ is the number of Eulerian paths starting at $k$ (multiplies by the sum in brackets which is $-1$), and all other entries are zeroes. Now let us show that the number of such cycles is divisible by $p$. We will assume that $k=1$, so that the cycles start and end at $1$. Split each cycle into subcycles starting at $1$, ending at $1$ and not passing through $1$ any more. Correspond to each cycle all the cycles obtained by permutatons of subcycles; thus the set of all cycles is partitioned into such equivalence classes, and the number of elements in each class is a corresponding multinomial coefficient $\binom{s}{s_1,\dots,s_t}$ where $s_1,\dots,s_t$ are the numbers of occurences of different subcycles. This coefficient is divisible by $p$ unless in the $p$-adic notation there are no transitions in the addition $s_1+\dots+s_t=k$. Notice that there are at least $p$ distinct subcycles --- at least one starting from each of the edges $1\to 1$, $1\to 2$, \dots, $1\to p$. Moreover, we may partition all the subcycles into such classes --- the number in each will be divisible by $p-1$. THus, we have $p$ nonzero numbers divisble by $p-1$, and there shpuld be no transitions in addition of these $p$ numbers; this may happen only if $k\geq (p-1)+p(p-1)+\dots+p^{p-1}(p-1)=p^p-1$. So, for $k< p^p-1$ we definitely have $S=0$. EDIT. Below in the comments, several improvements of this bound are shown. 

$\lceil n/d\rceil+d-2$ hyperplanes always suffice. To achieve this, we first choose $H_1,\dots,H_{d-1}$ in a manner that $H_1$ separates $\lceil n/d\rceil$ points from the rest, $H_2$ separates $\lceil n/d\rceil$ of those rest ones, and so on. Thus we get $d$ sets $S_1,\dots,S_d$ separated from each other, each consisting of at most $k=\lceil n/d\rceil$ points. We prove by induction on $k$ that such $d$ sets can be separated completely by $k-1$ hyperplanes. To perform the induction step, we implement the ham-sandwich theorem to bisect att $S_1,\dots,S_d$. We may shift this bisecting hyperplane a bit, so that on one side we get a collection of sets $S_1^1,\dots,S_d^1$ with at most $\lceil k/2\rceil$ points in each, and on the other side we have a collection of $S_1^2,\dots,S_d^2$ with at most $\lfloor k/2\rfloor$ points in each. Now apply the induction hypothesis to each of these collections separately. Perhaps, the `$+d$' term can be improved by choosing the initial hyperplanes in a smarter way? 

OLD VERSION. It seems that one may encode, say, Wang tiles by this type of restrictions. E.g. it answers Q2 (and Q1 in its present form) in the affirmative. Proceed as follows. Assume you have $\leq n!$ translational types of yiles. Choose $N$ much larger than $n$. 

$$ g(x)h(x)=(x^2-4x+5)(x^{14}+5x^{13}+16x^{12}+40x^{11}+81x^{10}+125x^9+96x^8 $$ $$ \qquad -x^7+6x^5+25x^4+71x^3+160x^2+286x+355) $$ $$ =x^{16}+x^{!5}+x^{14}+x^{13}+x^{12}+x^{11}+x^{10}+240x^9+484x^8 $$ $$ + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 11x^2 + 10x + 1775. $$ $g(2)=1$, $h(2)=378919$. In fact, it is known that each polynomial with no nonnegative real roots has a multiple with only positive coefficients. Moreover, there exists a large variety of such polynomials, hence there is nothing special in such an example. So, having obtained $h(x)$ such that the last few coefficients of $g(x)h(x)$ are large enough, you may change few its last coefficients to make $h(a)$ prime. That's how this concrete example was obtained: first, I have found one by one the coefficients of $h(x)$ so that the first coefficients of the product are ones and the next two are positive, then I have added the negative coefficient and repeated the procedure, and then I have changes the last coefficient to make $h(2)$ prime. It might be helpful to notice the following fact. If $g(x)$ has a complex root with argument $\alpha$, then each its multiple $p(x)$ with nonnegative coefficients has the degree at least $\pi/\alpha$. To see this, just substitute that root into $p(x)$ and look at the sign of the imaginary part. EDIT, I'm a bit lazy to construct an explicit example with the last coefficients $\pm1$, sorry; but here is the way. Take $g(x)=x^2(x-2)^2+1$. In the same way you may find the polynomial $h(x)$ such that $g(x)h(x)$ has positive coefficients (and $h(x)$ does not) --- since $g(x)$ has no nonnegative real roots. Next, consider $g_1(x)=x^4g(1/x)$ and construct the corresponding polynomial $h_1(x)$, say of degree $n$ (we need $h_1$ to have $1$ as the leading coefficient; it is surely possible). It remains to notice that $g(x)(x^{n+5}h(x)+x^nh_1(1/x))$ is almost the desired example; you just need to change the appropriate coefficients of $h$ and $h_1$ to make the corresponding value prime. I am almost sure thath this is possible... Notice that one may even decrease the exponent $n+5$ (the only fact to check is that the second factor should have a negative coefficient, and that of $h(x)$ is somewhere in the middle). 

Multiply the whole equality by $(-1)^n$. First of all, notice that $k\choose m_1,\dots,m_k$ is the number of ways to permute the numbers $\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_k$, so the left-hand side equals $$ L=\sum_{\lambda_i\geq 1, \; \lambda_1+\dots+\lambda_k=n} (-1)^k\prod_{i=1}^k{n+1\choose \lambda_i}. $$ Denote $$ S(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{n+1} {n+1\choose j}x^l=(1+x)^{n+1}-1. $$ Then, due to the formula above, $L$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $$ 1-S(x)+S(x)^2-\dots=\frac1{1+S(x)}=\frac1{(1+x)^{n+1}} =\sum_{i=0}^\infty(-1)^i{n+i\choose i}x^i, $$ thus $L=(-1)^n{2n\choose n}$, as desired. 

Let us define the following function on nonnegative integers (the definition can be simplified a bit, but I prefer to present it in this form): $$ f(n)=\begin{cases} 4n, & x=6n\; \text{ or }\;x=6n+1;\cr 4n+2, & x=6n+2\; \text{ or }\;x=6n+3;\cr 2n, & x=6n+4\; \text{ or }\;x=6n+5. \end{cases} $$ Then $f(x) < x$ for all $x>2$ and $x=1$, and $f(x)$ lies in the orbit of $x$. Moreover, it can be checked straightforwardly that for every two numbers interchanged by one of the generators, they have a common image under some iterations of $f$. This means that one orbit consists of all the numbers coming to $0$ after a sufficient number of iterations, and the other orbit consists of those coming to $2$. Now let us check what happens in this process. Surely one may concentrate only on the even numbers, since $f(2n)=f(2n+1)$ is always even. Thus we change the variable by $y=x/2$ and introduce the function $$ g(y)=\frac{f(2y)}2=\begin{cases} 2n, & y=3n;\cr 2n+1, & y=3n+1;\cr n, & y=3n+2\cr \end{cases} = \begin{cases} \lfloor y/3\rfloor, & 3\;\big|\; (y+1);\cr \lceil 2y/3\rceil, & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases} $$ Considering the preimages under $g$, we see that each $y$ generates the numbers $3y+2$ and $\lfloor 3y/2\rfloor$ lying in the $y$'s orbit, and all the numbers are generated by such process from $0$ and $1$ (or from $1$ and $2$), thus partitioning into two orbits. Now, if we denote by $\mu(n)$ the density of, say, elements of the first orbit on $[2n,3n)$, then we obtain $$ \mu(3n)=\frac{\mu(n)+2\mu(2n)}3. $$ It seems that this, together with the observation that $\mu(n)$ and $\mu(n+1)$ are close to each other, should suffice to see that the limiting density exists. 

This holds for every subset $N\subseteq V$, not only for nets. Every ball $B(x,r)$ is covered by a union of $2^{2k}$ balls $B(x_i,r/4)$. Now, if for some $i$ there exists $n_i\in B(x_i,r/4)\cap N$, then $B(x_i,r/4)\subseteq B(n_i,r/2)$. So such balls $B(n_i,r/2)$ cover $B(x,r)\cap N$. 

Let $W_P(p,q,r,s)$ be the number of such words starting by $P$ and ending by $P$, and let $$ f_P(x,y,z,t)=\sum_{p,q,r,s}W_P(p,q,r,s)x^py^qz^rt^s. $$ Define $f_Q$, $f_R$, $f_S$ similarly (all words start by $P$!). Then $$ \pmatrix{f_P\\f_Q\\f_R\\f_S} = \pmatrix{0&x&x&x\\y&0&y&y\\z&z&0&z\\t&t&t&0}\pmatrix{f_P\\f_Q\\f_R\\f_S} +\pmatrix{x\\0\\0\\0}, $$ which implies $$ \pmatrix{f_P\\f_Q\\f_R\\f_S} =\pmatrix{1&-x&-x&-x\\-y&1&-y&-y\\-z&-z&1&-z\\-t&-t&-t&1}^{-1}\pmatrix{x\\0\\0\\0}. $$ Thus the generating function for your $W(p,q,r,s)$ is $$ f(x,y,z,t)=\pmatrix{0&1&1&1}\pmatrix{1&-x&-x&-x\\-y&1&-y&-y\\-z&-z&1&-z\\-t&-t&-t&1}^{-1}\pmatrix{x\\0\\0\\0}, $$ which, accorging to Maple, is $$ f(x,y,z,t)=\frac{x(y+z+t+2yz+2yt+2zt+3yzt)}{1-xy-xz-xt-yz-yt-zt-2xyz-2xyt-2xzt-2yzt-3xyzt}. $$ I doubt there is a much closer form. But you may find the expressions like yours in particular cases from here. 

On Q1. The intersection of sub-semiball with the boundary sphere of the ball cannot contain two opposite points. Thus, bu the Borsuk--Ulam(--Lusternik--Shnirelman) theorem it is impossible to cover this sphere by three such closed sets. Let me now finish the consideration of Q2 started by Douglas. For $k\geq 7$, again $k+1$ sub-$k$-sectors suffice! Take $k-1$ (not sub!) $k$-sectors centered at the center of the disk with very small overlaps. Taking their appropriate sub-$k$-sectors we cover everything except a very small "star" around the center and, roughly speaking, a $(k-\varepsilon)$-sector of a bit larger radius. Now put the $k$th sub-$k$-sector so as to cover the star and most of the $(k-\varepsilon)$-sector, without some part around its boundary arc. This arc, together with its boundary, can now be covered by the last sub-$k$-sector. You may see an example for $k=7$ below. I tried to do my best, but it seems that one needs to be very precise in order to cover the central star; still, it's obviously possible. Eight sub-7-sectors $URL$
