So the author does not derive the differential equations as the result of a theoretical model -the author just wants to obtain the movement through time of equilibrium price (the author assumes market-clearing), as a second order differential equation. So it is a purely descriptive/forecasting exercise, devoid of any economic theory background. The author obtains the solution, which includes a number of coefficients to be determined, for which the author mentions

Complexity issues are always a factor in choosing model frameworks. In addition, my feeling is that historically the impressive possibility brought to light by the OG models was that an economy could be "dynamically inefficient" (=being characterized by over-accumulation of capital). After some empirical studies provided evidence that the main western economies did not appear to over-accumulate capital, there was perhaps an impression that the model, while structurally more realistic, had not "that much to offer" to compensate for its added complexity... Not so, according to Philipe Weil, who celebrated the model's first 50 years of existence in the paper Weil, Philippe. 2008. "Overlapping Generations: The First Jubilee." Journal of Economic Perspectives, 22(4): 115-34. (freely downloadable). The paper is an enjoyable non-technical read, full of compacted information, knowledge and insights. A quote (bold my emphasis): 

A note on the parameter constraints: $$TC(q)=a+bq+cq^{2}+dq^{3} = a + q(b+cq+dq^{2})$$ It appears that what we want is that for the second degree polynomial to not take negative values. This would require for it to not have real and positive roots. Since $c<0$, then if there are real roots one of them will be positive. This would imply that for an interval of positive values of $q$ the 2nd degree polynomial will take on negative values, and marginal cost will turn negative. So we need the discriminant to be negative, and so $c^2 - 4bd < 0 \implies c^2 < 4bd$. I don't see whey they write "$3$" instead of "$4$". -__________________________________ As for obtaining such a cost function rigorously from a production function: The reference is Silberberg. E (1990), "The Structure of Economics" (2nd ed), ch. 9. A) When the production function is homogeneous of degree $r$, then the cost function has the form $$C(q,\mathbb w) = q^{1/r} \cdot h(\mathbb w)$$ where $h(\mathbb w)$ is a function of prices (of input factors), and it is homogeneous of degree one (or "linearly homogeneous"). B) When the production function is homothetic, which can be represented as a monotonic function of a homogeneous of degree one function, then the cost function remains multiplicatively separable in output and prices for some function $J(q)$: $$C(q,\mathbb w) = J(q)\cdot h(\mathbb w)$$ But again, since homotheticity is a monotonic transformation of homogeneity of degree one, $J(q)$ should not be expected to take any polynomial form like the one you seek. So none of the usual functional specifications for production functions will give a cost function like the one you want to arrive at. And indeed in papers with such cost functions I have never seen a derivation of the underlying production function. If any positive result comes up, I will return. 

Covering the historical part, you may want to look at: 1) The Battle of Bretton Woods: John Maynard Keynes, Harry Dexter White, and the Making of a New World Order which appears to be written in a "non-fiction thriller" style, revolving around the argument that 

Essentially this objection implicitly assumes that with $Q_C$ machines in hand, company $A$ will be able to produce more than $Q_A$ product units. But if this is the case, then after the first purchase, company $A$ won't demand more machines from $C$, hence $C$ won't demand additional gearing systems from $B$, hence $B$ won't demand any additional product units from $A$, and so any remaining productive capacity of the $Q_C$ machines will not be used. If this objection does not assume the existence of this additional capacity, then the $Q_C$ machines will fully depreciate in order to produce $Q_A$ product units -and then, there may be initially classified as "investment", but at the end of the production cycle of $A$ they will be recorded as "depreciation charge", i.e. a bona fide running expense (which is what they are, since they fully depreciate). I would suggest to study Input-Output models of an economy. 

To complement @AdamBailey to-the-point answer, the purpose of this post was to alert interested readers to the consequences of changing decision-variables in our thinking. We are accustomed to think of Demand as either "price depending on quantity" or "quantity depending on price". But on the production-cost side, we automatically tend to think of cost depending on quantity, not on selling price. Therefore, being even a bit tediously explicit with notation pays off (ask the guys over dynamic optimization, e.g. Caputo's book). In the specific example, the symbols $TR$, $MR$, $MC$, do not reveal the decision variable, and this is where the ruse was based. But if, we wrote $$\max \pi = TR[Q(P)] - C[Q(P)]$$ we would clearly signaled that our ultimate decision variable is price, and so $$f.o.c: \;\;\;MR(Q)\cdot \frac {\partial Q}{\partial P} - MC(Q)\frac {\partial Q}{\partial P} =0 $$ $$\implies (MR(Q) - MC(Q))\cdot \frac {\partial Q}{\partial P} =0 \implies MR(Q) = MC(Q)$$ while also we would clearly see that $$\frac {\partial TR}{\partial P} = MR(Q)\cdot \frac {\partial Q}{\partial P} = \frac {\partial Q}{\partial P}Q + Q$$ and so that the requirement on the price elasticity of demand leads to $$\frac {\partial TR}{\partial P} = MR(P) = Q\frac {\partial Q}{\partial P}Q + Q < 0 \implies MR(Q)\cdot \frac {\partial Q}{\partial P} < 0 \implies MR(Q) >0$$ (since $\frac {\partial Q}{\partial P} <0$). So at the optimal point, marginal revenue with respect to quantity should be positive, but marginal revenue with respect to price should be negative. 

A change in labor wage could bring about a simultaneous change in the market demand and supply curves. Assume that wages increase: consumers now have more income and this in principle will affect the demand curve. On the other hand, the costs of the firms have increased, and this will affect the supply curve. The same could be said in case space rents increase: it results in an increase in (asset) income for consumers/asset holders, and an increase in costs for firms renting the space. 

I can also offer my professional experience on the matter, which says that some times these are used as merely veils for what is essentially a conventional loan earning interest. As a side remark, Christian institutions like the Catholic Church never officially lifted their condemnation of "usury"/charging interest -they just don't actively enforce the doctrine. (As far as I could find, the most recent papal discussion of usury occurred in Pope Benedict XIVâ€™s encyclical of 1745, Vix pervenit.) 

Consider two standard relations that tend to hold: $$i_t = r_t + \pi^e_{t+1} \tag{1}$$ where $i_t$ is domestic nominal interest rate, $r_t$ is domestic real interest rate, and $\pi^e_{t+1}$ is expected domestic inflation. The expression is known as the Fisher equation. Also, we have the uncovered interest rate parity $$ i_t = i^*_t - [s^e_{t+1} - s_t] \tag{2}$$ where $i^*_t$ is "foreign" nominal interest rate, and $[s^e_{t+1} - s_t]$ is expected appreciation of domestic currency in percentage terms ($s$ is the natural logarithm of "foreign currency per unit of domestic currency" exchange rate). Combining the two and re-arranging we have $$[s^e_{t+1} - s_t] = i^*_t - r_t - \pi^e_{t+1} \tag{3}$$ Assume that inflation is monetary, and keep $i^*_t,r_t$ constant. Then expectations for domestic inflation will tend to reduce expected appreciation of domestic currency, and may even turn it into an expected depreciation, especially if expected domestic inflation is high. Shortening the length of the time periods, this tendency becomes more of "actual" inflation and "actual" exchange rate. The fundamental reason is of course what the OP was thinking: if we think of USD as another good (which it is since it is a store of value and can be exchanged for goods), then, if English pound loses value due to inflation and can buy less goods, why should it be still able to buy the same amount of the good "USD"? 

By the implicit function theorem, when we have an equilibrium equation $F$ $$F \equiv Q^s - Q^d = 0 \implies F\equiv kp^2-D(p)=0$$ the equilibrium change of, in this case, $p$ when $k$ changes is given by $$\frac {dp}{dk} = -\frac {\partial F/\partial k}{\partial F/ \partial p}$$ Since $D(p)$ is not given explicitly, you won't get a fully parametric answer of course, but the sign of $D'(p)$ will help you determine the direction of movement. 

Let's move now to McCloskey's example: Ex post, It would appear that "points are fungible" as regards the question "which points won the game": Once the game is over, we have a passed, static situation of one team "having produced" 68 fungible units of the good, and the other team having produced 70 fungible units of the good. But what happens when the game is ongoing? I.e., A dynamic situation? Here, not all points are the same, not all are as easy ("costly", "of the same value"), the sequence of scoring and the ups and downs of the score are important (most probably for behavioral reasons, and so squarely in the land of economics also, since many games are professional and material rewards are involved), there may be autocorrelation, or cross correlation, or forward causation or all of them... (Remember a "good" is also characterized by its place in time and space). So in this perspective, I would not say that we can argue that "points are fungible". But then, if during the production process points are not fungible, and theoretically we could record and attribute differentiated value to each one of them, then in what sense, moving in the ex post view, after production has finished, we will suddenly say "points are fungible"? I could only see that if we had no information on how the game evolved. Then we would be forced to say "absent any other information, we have to treat points as fungible".
