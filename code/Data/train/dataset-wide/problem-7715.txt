Let $x$ and $y$ be two elements of $S_n$. Let $U(x,y)$ be the intersection $(BxB \cap B_{-} y B)/B$ inside the flag variety. Here $B$ and $B_{-}$ are the groups of upper and lower-triangular matrices respectively. Kazhdan and Lusztig define the $R$ polynomial $R_{x,y}(q)$. As explained in Theorem 1.3 of Deodhar, one such description is that $$R_{x,y}(q) = \# U(x,y)(\mathbb{F}_q).$$ Now, $U(x,y)$ is an affine variety, so I don't get to know that the weight filtration matches the cohomological filtration. But, looking at examples, it looks like the coefficient of $(-1)^{\ell(x) - \ell(y) - i } q^i$ in $R_{x,y}(q)$ is the Betti number $\dim H^i(U(x,y))$. For example, with $n=2$, $x=(21)$ and $y$ being the identity, then $U(x,y)$ is the torus $\mathbb{A}^1 \setminus \{ 0 \}$, it has $q-1$ points, and its betti numbers are $\dim H^0 = \dim H^1 = 1$. This is probably something very standard, but I didn't find it the first few places I tried, and it seemed faster to ask here than to keep looking. Thanks! 

It's false! Take $\mathbb{A}^3$ with coordinates $(x,y,z)$. Blow up the origin, and let $E$ be the exceptional divisor. Delete the line $E \cap \{ z=0 \}$. The resulting quasi-projective variety will be our $Y$. Since $Y$ is quasi-projective, it is separated. $Y$ is an example of a quasi-projective variety with no complete curves that is not quasi-affine. I wrote an earlier answer showing that any $Y$ must have no complete curves and suggesting that might imply $Y$ quasi-affine; I have now deleted that answer since it was a dead end except to point me towards which $Y$ to investigate. First, let us see that $Y$ is not quasi-affine. Since $B \ell_{(0,0,0)} \mathbb{A}^3$ is smooth, and $Y$ is obtained by deleting a codimension $2$ locus from it, any global function on $Y$ extends to $B \ell_{(0,0,0)} \mathbb{A}^3$. But any function on $B \ell_{(0,0,0)} \mathbb{A}^3$ contracts $E$. So any global function on $Y$ contracts $E \setminus \{ z=0 \}$, and global functions on $Y$ do not separate points. Now, we build our torsor. We will cover $Y$ with two open charts: $U$ is the complement of the proper transform of $\{ z = 0 \}$. We have $U \cong \mathbb{A}^3$, with coordinates $(x z^{-1}, y z^{-1}, z)$; we define $p = x z^{-1}$ and $q = y z^{-1}$. The other chart will be $V:= Y \setminus E$. So $V \cong \mathbb{A}^3 \setminus \{ (0,0,0) \}$. The open set $V$ is not affine, but the global functions on $V$ are $k[x,y,z]$. Note that $U \cap V \cong \mathbb{A}^2 \times (\mathbb{A}^1 \setminus \{ 0 \})$, with coordinate ring $k[x,y,z^{\pm}]$. Take $U \times \mathbb{A}^1$ and $V \times \mathbb{A}^1$, with coordinates $u$ and $v$ on the respective $\mathbb{A}^1$ factors, and let $\mathbb{G}_a$ act by translation on each $\mathbb{A}^1$. Glue these trivial torsors by $v = u + z^{-1}$; this makes sense since $z^{-1} \in \mathcal{O}(U \cap V)$. This will be $X$. We write $\pi$ for the map $X \to Y$ and $\psi$ for the map $Y \to \mathbb{A}^3$, contracting $E$. To repeat, $X = \pi^{-1}(U) \cup \pi^{-1}(V)$. We have $\pi^{-1}(U) = \mathrm{Spec}\ k[p,q,z,u]$ and $\pi^{-1}(V) = \mathrm{Spec}\ k[x,y,z,v] \setminus \{ x=y=z=0 \}$ To show that $X$ is quasi-affine, consider the following $7$ functions: $$pz=x,\ qz=y,\ z,$$ $$a:=pzu+p=xv,\ b:= qzu+q = yv,\ c:=zu+1=zv,$$ $$d := zu^2+u = z v^2 - v .$$ For each function, I have given one formula which displays it as an element of $\mathcal{O}(\pi^{-1}(U))$ and another which displays it as an element of $\mathcal{O}(\pi^{-1}(V))$, so these are global functions on $Y$. Let $R$ be the ring generated by these functions. I claim that the map from $X$ into $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ is an embedding (at which point it is an open embedding, since both varieties have dimension $4$). We first check that the map separates points. Suppose that $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are sent to the same point of $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$. Since $(x,y,z) \in R$, we see that $\psi(\pi(\alpha_1)) = \psi(\pi(\alpha_2))$. First, suppose this common point is not $(0,0,0)$. So $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are in $\pi^{-1}(V)$ and are of the form $(x,y,z,v_1)$ and $(x,y,z,v_2)$. But we then have $x v_1 = x v_2$, $y v_1 = y v_2$ and $z v_1 = z v_2$, and $x$, $y$ and $z$ cannot all be $0$ on $V$, so $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$ in this case. Now, assume that $\psi(\pi(\alpha_1)) = \psi(\pi(\alpha_2)) = (0,0,0)$. So $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are in $U$, and are of the form $(p_1, q_1, 0, u_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2,0,u_2)$. But then $p_1 \cdot 0 \cdot u_1 + p_1 = p_2 \cdot 0 \cdot u_2 + p_2$, $q_1 \cdot 0 \cdot u_1 + q_1 = q_2 \cdot 0 \cdot u_2 + q_2$ and $0 \cdot u_1^2 + u_1 = 0 \cdot u_2^2 + u_2$, so we again conclude $\alpha_1 = \alpha_2$. This shows that $X \to \mathrm{Spec}(R)$ is injective on points, but we want to know it is an embedding of schemes. Now that we know injectivity on points, we just need to do a local computation. The following table gives inverses on each of the open sets $\{ z \neq 0 \}$, $U \cap \{ zu+1 \neq 0 \}$, $V \cap \{ x \neq 0 \}$ and $V \cap \{ y \neq 0 \}$; we leave it to the reader to check that these sets form a cover. $$\begin{array}{@{\mbox{On}\ }r@{,\ }rcl} \{ z \neq 0 \} & (x,y,z,u) &=& (x,y,z, (c-1) z^{-1}) \\ U \cap \{ zu+1 \neq 0 \} & (p,q,z,u) &=& (ac^{-1}, b c^{-1}, z, d c^{-1}) \\ V \cap \{ x \neq 0 \} & (x,y,z,v) &=& (x,y,z,a x^{-1}) \\ V \cap \{ y \neq 0 \} & (x,y,z,v) &=& (x,y,z,b y^{-1}) \\ \end{array}$$ 

There is an analogous construction in the purely real case. The analogue of the sheaf of homolorphic functions is the sheaf $LC$ of locally constant functions. A locally free $LC$-module is equivalent to a local system, and hence to a vector bundle $V$ with integrable connection $\nabla: V \to V \otimes \Omega^1$. One then has the exact sequence of sheaves: $$LC(V) \to C^{\infty}(V) \to C^{\infty}(V) \otimes \Omega^1 \to C^{\infty}(V) \otimes \Omega^2 \to \cdots \to C^{\infty}(V) \otimes \Omega^n.$$ Here $LC(V)$ is the sheaf of locally constant sections of the local system $V$, and $C^{\infty}(V)$ is the sheaf of smooth sections. Just as in the complex case, one can then show that the sheaf cohomology $H^q(X, V)$ is isomorphic to the deRham cohomology $$\mathrm{Ker}(C^{\infty}(V) \otimes \Omega^q \to C^{\infty}(V) \otimes \Omega^{q+1}) / \mathrm{Im} (C^{\infty}(V) \otimes \Omega^{q-1} \to C^{\infty}(V) \otimes \Omega^{q}).$$ In particular, if $V$ is the trivial local system, this is the isomorphism between sheaf cohomology and deRham cohomology. 

A very similar notion is that of an irreducible morphism. In an abelian category, a morphism is called a split monomorphism if it is an inclusion of an direct summand, and a split epimorphism if it is the projection onto a direct summand. A morphism is called split if it has either of the above properties. A morphism $f$ is called irreducible if it is not split but, whenever $f=st$, either $s$ is a split monomorphism or $t$ is a split epimorphism. I have never seen this definition used outside abelian categories, but I think it makes sense in any category: We can define split monomorphisms as the maps which have right inverses and split epimorphisms as the maps which have left inverses. 

One can get every prime which is NOT a Sophie Germain prime; that is to say, such that (p+1)/2 is not prime. Proof: if (p+1)/2 is not prime, then we can factor p+1 = xy. If p+1 is not prime, we can impose that x and y are greater than 2 and, since p is prime, it is not of the form x^2-1 (except for p=3). So we can take 2 < x < y. Then take (a,b,c) = (1,x-1,y-1). 13 and 37 cannot be achieved. 

Adding unto Boyarsky's answer: Stephen Cohen has given quantative bounds for how often generic polynomials work. If I've skimmed his paper correctly, when the coefficients are integers chosen from the interval $[-N, N]$, the probability that the Galois group comes out wrong is $O(N^{-1/2} \log N)$, with an explicitly computable constant which depends on the group and the precise parameterization being used. 

I just had a student come to my office hours and ask me a ton of questions, the answer to all of which was "that's a slight variant to the implicit function theorem, which is proved by formal manipulation from the implicit function theorem". For example: $\def\RR{\mathbb{R}}$ Let $f : \RR^n \to \RR$ be a smooth function and suppose that $\partial f/ \partial x_n \neq 0$. Then, locally, $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}, f)$ are coordinates on $\RR^n$. Let $f : \RR^n \to \RR$ be a smooth function and suppose that $\partial f/ \partial x_n \neq 0$. Then, locally, $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1})$ are coordinates on $\{ f=0 \}$. Let $U$ be a small open set in $\RR^d$ and let $(f_1, \ldots, f_d): U \to \RR^n$ parameterize a patch on a manifold $M$ in $\RR^n$. Suppose that $\det (\partial f_i/\partial x_j)_{1 \leq i,j \leq d} \neq 0$. Then $x_1$, ..., $x_d$ are local coordinates on $M$. Let $g_1$, ..., $g_{n-d}$ be smooth functions $\RR^n \to \RR$. Let $M= \{g_1=g_2=\ldots=g_{n-d} = 0 \}$. Suppose that $\det (\partial f_i/\partial x_j)_{1 \leq i,j \leq n-d} \neq 0$. Then $M$ is a smooth manifold of dimension $d$ and $x_{n-d+1}$, ..., $x_n$ are local coordinates near $0$. 

I don't know a name for this concept, but I know names for two related concepts. A simplicial complex $\Delta$ is called flag or clique if, whenever $v_1$, $v_2$, ..., $v_r$ is a collection of vertices such that $(v_i, v_j)$ is an edge of $\Delta$ for all $1 \leq i < j \leq r$, then $(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_r)$ is a face of $\Delta$. A simplicial complex $\Delta$ is called balanced if $\Delta$ is pure of dimension $d$ and it is possible to color the vertices of $\Delta$ with $d+1$ colors so that no face contains two vertices of the same color. If $\Delta$ is the order complex of a poset then it is flag; if $\Delta$ is the order complex of a graded poset then it is balanced. 

I know how I want to answer this question. I'll write up the easy parts here, and leave the hard part for you :). 

The answer is no. Here is a counter-example $$\left( \begin{matrix} 0 & -5 \\\\ 1 & 0 \end{matrix} \right) \quad \mbox{and} \quad \left( \begin{matrix} -1 & -3 \\\\ 2 & 1 \end{matrix} \right).$$ Both of these matrices have characteristic polynomial $x^2+5$. For $p \neq 2$, $5$, this polynomial has no repeated factors so any matrices with this polynomial are similar. By the same argument, they are similar over $\mathbb{Q}$. By brute force computation, they are also similar at $2$ and $5$. However, they are not similar over $\mathbb{Z}$. Consider $\mathbb{Z}^2$ as a module for $\mathbb{Z}[t]$ where $t$ acts by one of the two matrices above. Both of these matrices square to $-5$, so these are in fact $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$-modules. If the matrices were similar, the similarity would give an isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$-modules. But these are not isomorphic: the former is free on one generator while the latter is isomorphic to the ideal $\langle 2, 1+ \sqrt{-5} \rangle$. In general, the way to classify similarity of matrices over $\mathbb{Z}$ is the following: If the matrices do not have the same characteristic polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$, they are not similar. If they do, let $f$ be the characteristic polynomial and let $R=\mathbb{Z}[t]/f(t)$. Then your matrices give $R$-modules, and the matrices are similar if and only if the $R$-modules are isomorphic. If $R$ is the ring of integers of a number field, then $R$-modules are classified by the ideal class group. In general, they are related to the ideal class group, but there are various correction factors related to how $R$ fails to be the ring of integers of its fraction field (or how it fails to be a domain at all). I don't know the details here. 

If $G$ is a graph all of whose faces are triangles, and $G'$ is its dual, then recall that $G$ is $4$-vertex-colorable if and only if $G'$ is $3$-edge-colorable. It is unclear whether you are asking about the situation of $G$ or of $G'$ having a Hamiltonian cycle. As far as I know (but I am not a graph theorist), there is no relation between these two conditions. Whitney's theorem says that, modulo some minor hypotheses, $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle. Specifically: 

Barvinok, in Lecture 1 of his Park City Lectures (reprinted in IAS/Park City Math Series Volume 13), defines an Euler characteristic which is very similar to this one. His domain of definition is sets whose indicator functions can be written as a finite linear combination of indicator functions of polyhedra, and he states as an exercise that this can be extended to linear combinations of indicator functions of convex sets. With his conventions, chi is not a homeomorphism invariant, because chi(\mathbb{R})=1 and chi( (0,1))=-1. It is not clear to me what harm would come from letting the Euler characteristic of the real line be -1. 

$\def\ZZ{\mathbb{Z}}$Yes, we can take $N = p^{n!}-1$. Given $A \in GL_n(\ZZ/p^2)$, lift $A$ arbitrarily to $\tilde{A} \in GL_n(\ZZ_p)$. Let $\tilde{\lambda}_i$ be the eigenvalues of $\tilde{A}$; they live in the ring of integers of some finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Let $\bar{A}$ be the reduction of $\tilde{A}$ modulo $p$ and $\bar{\lambda}_i$ be the reduction of $\tilde{\lambda_i}$ modulo $p$. Then $\bar{\lambda}_i$ is in $\mathbb{F}_{p^d}$ for some $d \leq n$. Moreover, since $\tilde{A}$ is invertible over $\ZZ_p$, we know that $\bar{\lambda}_i \neq 0$. Let $\tau_i$ be the Teichmuller lift of $\bar{\lambda_i}$. So $\tau_i^N=1$. THIS IS THE BROKEN STEP: Write $\tilde{\lambda}_i = \tau_i (1+p \alpha_i)$. The left hand side of your equation is $$\sum_i \tau_i^N (1+p \alpha_i)^N -n = \sum_i (1+p \alpha_i)^N -n \equiv n + p N \sum_i \alpha_i -n \equiv -p \sum \alpha_i \bmod p^2.$$ On the right hand side, notice that $\prod \tau_i$ must be the Teichmuller lift of $\prod \bar{\lambda}_i = \det(\bar{A})$. Since $\det(\bar{A}) \in \mathbb{F}_p^{\ast}$, this shows that $\left( \prod \tau_i \right)^{p-1}=1$. So your right hand side is $$\prod \tau_i^{p-1} (1+p \alpha_i)^{p-1}-1 = \prod (1+p \alpha_i)^{p-1}-1 \equiv -p \sum \alpha_i \bmod p^2.$$ 

Yes, $x^p+y^p = z^{\lfloor p/2 \rfloor} t^{\lceil p/2 \rceil}$ is rational. Put $p=2m+1$. I assume, since you call it a surface, you are considering this as a projective equation. Dehomogenize with respect to $t$ to get $x^{2m+1}+y^{2m+1} = z^m$. In the open chart where $xyz \neq 0$, we can write this as $(x/y)^{2m+1} + 1 = z^m/y^{2m+1}$. Make the change of coordinates $$a=xy^{-1},\ b=y^{-(2m+1)} z^m,\ c= y^2 z^{-1}$$ with inverse $$x=ab^{-1} c^{-m},\ y=b^{-1} c^{-m},\ z=b^{-2} c^{-(2m+1)}.$$ In the new coordinates, we have $a^{2m+1}+1 = b$, with the obvious parametrization $(a,b,c) = (s,s^{2m+1}+1, t)$. This is a standard trick for finding good rational forms of high degree equations with few variables: Find the lattice generated by the differences of the exponents -- in this case, the $\mathbb{Z}$-span of $(2m+1,-(2m+1),0)$ and $(0,-(2m+1), m)$. Saturate it -- we get the $\mathbb{Z}$-span of $(1,-1,0)$ and $(0,-(2m+1),m)$ and complete to a basis $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & - (2m+1) & m \\ 0 & 2 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$ of $\mathbb{Z}^3$. Inverting this determinant $1$ matrix gave me the formulas for $(x,y,z)$ in terms of $(a,b,c)$, and the equation become much lower degree in the new variables.
