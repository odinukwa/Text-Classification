It doesn't. It may improve a bit movement range and reduces stiffness and pain. When it comes to rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, gout and infectious arthritis there's nothing that passive movement can do due to the etiology of these conditions. Autoimmune arthritis (rheumatoid and lupic) requires immunosupressive therapy. Gout requires lowering uric acid blood levels. Infectious arthritis requires antibiotherapy [1]. 

A large EMP can induce high currents and voltages in the victim, damaging electrical equipment or disrupting its function. A very large EMP event such as a lightning strike is also capable of damaging objects such as trees, buildings and aircraft directly, either through heating effects or the disruptive effects of the very large magnetic field generated by the current. An indirect effect can be electrical fires caused by heating [2]. Most devices use Lithium-Ion or Lithium-Polymer batteries nowadays:

No, people don't actually change personality when talking in another language. Use of a second language accesses different cultural norms that activate appropriate behavioral expressions. Personality is taken to be what we are while behaviour is what we do [1].

It is not possible for a lightning strike or electromagnetic pulse to last a few hours and maintain a voltage of a few volts and in the same time limit the current to no more than a few amps (the graph is for one cell). Let's make a rough comparison:

No. Evidence for pheromonal communication was found in mice. This kind of communication requires a pheromone and a sensory organ. There is no sensory organ in humans.
