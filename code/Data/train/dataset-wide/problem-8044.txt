I'm not a set theorist, but I understand the 'pop' version of set-theoretic forcing: in analogy with algebra, we can take a model of a set theory, and an 'indeterminate' (which is some poset), and add it to the theory and then complete to a model with the desired properties. I understand the category theoretic version better, which is to take sheaves (valued in a given category $Set$) over said poset with a given Grothendieck topology (the double negation topology). The resulting topos is again a model of set theory, but now has the properties you want, absent from the original $Set$. But what is this poset, really? Is it the poset of subobjects of the set you want to append to your theory/model (say a set of a specified cardinality, or some tree with a property)? Is it related to a proof of the property you are interested in? To clarify, I'm not interested in the mechanical definition of an appropriate generic poset, but what it is morally. Bonus points for saying what it 'is' before and after forcing, if this even makes sense.

An fpqc sheaf is exactly what you think it is: a functor from the opposite of the category of schemes (or relative schemes) to $Set$ (i.e. a presheaf) such that the usual glueing conditions hold for fpqc covers. You may be thinking of the fact remarked on here: $URL$ that the collection of fpqc covers of a scheme doesn't have a cofinal set, and so one cannot just assume that the site at hand is small. Even though sites that people work with can be large (say $Aff$) 'nice' Grothendieck pretopologies are given by a set of covering families for each object, or at the very least have a cofinal set of covering families (this means there is a coverage given by a set of covering families, and this is enough to define sheaves, though generally weaker than a pretopology). Without this 'local smallness' condition (called WISC), the category of sheaves may not be locally small. There is an example of a functor on schemes which admits no fpqc sheafification. In the case of large sites without the condition WISC, the appropriate thing to consider is small sheaves, namely sheaves that are small colimits of representable sheaves. 

Both give rise to derivators, and indeed thinking about homotopy theories as non-abelian derived categories is what led Grothendieck to introduce then (note that Heller and Franke independently came up with derivators, but I'm not sure they had the same motivation) 

It is well-known that "the" stack of elliptic curves (allow me to be vague as to singular curves, compactifications etc) has a presentation by a groupoid in schemes. One of the things that needs to be proved to see this is that the sheaves of isomorphisms between two elliptic curves over a base is representable (I'm simplifying a bit, clearly), say by an algebraic space (see e.g. L&M-B Corollaire 3.13) What happens if we take instead the presheaf of isogenies between two elliptic curves? My guess is that it is a sheaf. But is it representable? I have no intuition at all. Clearly elliptic curves and isogenies are not an algebraic stack as usually defined: they do not form a category fibred in groupoids. I'm asking specifically about the (pre)sheaf of isogenies here, and not elliptic curves up to isogeny. This has applications to Charles Rezk's work discussed in his ICM talk, if people want motivation. One could ask analogous questions about abelian varieties, but I'll hold off. 

Recall the definition of a symplectic groupoid. Roughly this is a Lie groupoid such that the object manifold is Poisson, and the arrow manifold is symplectic such that the symplectic form is compatible with the groupoid structure. There is naturally a forgetful 2-functor $SymplGpd \to LieGpd$. Clearly not every Lie groupoid is in the image of this functor. Pick, for instance a manifold which is not symplectic and consider the trivial Lie groupoid with this as objects. But given that a Lie groupoid is in the image of the forgetful 2-functor, what does the fibre over it look like? To ask a question off the top of my head, would it be too much to ask that symplectic groupoids with identical underlying Lie groupoids are Morita equivalent (in the sense of Xu see e.g. this or this, or this for the quasisymplectic version, in case that helps.) I'm cheating a bit here, because I am not specifying the 1- and 2-arrows of the 2-category of symplectic groupoids. I do this so that answers can clarify what these might be and how this relates to my question. 

Let $G$ be a Lie group acting properly on a smooth manifold $M$, and equip $M$ with a Riemannian manifold that is adapted to the foliation by orbits. The celebrated theorem of Palais is that there exist slices for the action. Is there any work that find estimates for the maximum radii of slices in the given metric, in terms of other geometric data? I'm particularly interested in the case when we have an open set $U$ in $M$ that is invariant, and when we can say $U$ has a global slice. Is is possible to say that if the diameter of $U$ is smaller than some quantity, then it has a global slice? 

The space underlying the projective unitary group of a separable, infinite-dimensional Hilbert space has a number of topologies, so for the purposes of this question, pick you favourite and answer for that one. I've read that $PU(H)$ is a Fréchet manifold, but that was without saying which topology. There are two ways I can see to think about this. First is that if we know what sort of manifold $U(H)$ is, then we know what $PU(H)$ is, as the former looks locally like a chart of $PU(H)$ times $U(1)$. So we can consider the closed (I think!) subspace $U(H) \subset End(H)$. Alternately we can consider $PU(H)$ as sitting inside the Hilbert-Schmidt operators on $H$ as the projective unitaries act freely on the latter. (EDIT: this is not right, as pointed out by Andrew. I was thinking of the inclusion $PU(H) \hookrightarrow U(HS(H))$, which doesn't really tell us much in hindsight.) I'm not familiar enough with the analysis to turn the above observations into results, and I may be interested in other topologies. So the question is, is there the structure of a Banach or even Hilbert manifold on $PU(H)$? 

The Artin-Mazur codiagonal $\nabla:ssSet \to sSet$ is right adjoint to the total decalage functor $Dec:sSet \to ssSet$. The total decalage functor is defined to be precomposition with the ordinal sum functor $+:\Delta\times \Delta \to \Delta$, $+([n],[m]) = [n+m+1]$. If we agree to call a bisimplicial set $X= ([n]\times [m] \mapsto X_{nm})$ a bi-Kan complex if each simplicial set $[k] \mapsto X_{km}$ and $[k] \mapsto X_{nk}$ is a Kan complex (for all $n$ and $m$), then I'm wondering if it is known in the literature whether $\nabla X$ is a Kan complex. Perhaps in Artin-Mazur's monograph? Note that a bi-Kan complex is not necessarily the same as an internal Kan complex in the category of Kan complexes (I haven't checked this - just a warning) 

1 The context of the discussion was the effect on ordinary mathematics the discovery that ZFC was inconsistent. Tom Leinster argues (and I agree) that the most likely culprit would be Replacement, since the rest of ZFC is essentially equivalent to ETCS, and the axioms of ETCS encode the operations on sets that underly day-to-day practice of people who aren't set theorists. [EDIT: On reflection, I'm putting words into Tom's mouth a little here. The actual point he has made is that if a contradiction were found with using Replacement, it wouldn't affect most mathematicians, but it a contradiction were found in ETCS (equivalently, BZC) then we could start to worry. If we assume that 'ordinary' mathematics is consistent, as it seems to be, then one might make the---justified or not---leap that a little-used axiom is the place a contradiction might be found, if one existed. As others have pointed out in the comments below, Comprehension is also a contender for a 'risky' axiom.]

If you are doing serious category theory, then at some point you will come across what are affectionately known as 'size considerations' or similar. In particular, any presheaf category $Cat(C,Set)$ and the subcategory of sheaves is not locally small (homs are sets) when $C$ is not a small category (set of objects). For example, you might want to consider the category of sheaves on the category of spaces, or schemes, or on a topos (these are not usually small). Then the Yoneda embedding, as Ryan points out, will not work, which is a bit of a problem. One workaround is the axiom of universes, say with two universes $U \in V$. Then you can talk about locally small categories in $U$ - homs are elements of $U$ whereas the objects form a subset of $U$ (so these categories are '$U$-large'). Then the presheaf category consists of functors to the category of sets which are (isomorphic to) elements of $U$. The (pre)sheaf category is then locally small in $V$, and the Yoneda embedding for this category is taken into presheaves with values in the category of sets which are (isomorphic to) elements of $V$. Whenever you see the phrase 'locally small', you can be sure someone is using some sort of foundations that distinguishes between large and small - Universes, GBN class-set theory or similar - to get around the issue. Edit: Actually if one wants to think of schemes as sheaves on CRing, then you need to think hard about local smallness, otherwise the category of schemes will not be category under the naive definition that the homs are sets. 

Let's put ourselves in the framework of ZF. Is it true that if we think of the set of real numbers as a rational vector space, there are continuum-many linearly independent vectors? I feel that we could then use this to make an injection from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}$, the quotient vector space by the 1-dimensional subspace $\mathbb{Q}$. Does this strategy work? This is to help me think about the result that (in ZF) $|\mathbb{R}| \leq |\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}|$, proved by Mycielski in 1964. I haven't looked at his paper, just trying to imagine how one would prove this result. 

This was in fact answered by Thomas Bloom in this comment in response to exactly my question above (posed by Qiaochu Yuan): 

This seems like a natural question to ask, but I've not seen it discussed in my reading around (limited to Easton's paper, the third edition of Jech's Set theory and a small handful of articles). What do you get when forcing with a proper class of conditions that you don't get when forcing with, say, a set of conditions larger than one's model of set theory? Or rather, why isn't a large set of conditions enough? Blass makes a throwaway remark in his 1984 paper The interaction between category theory and set theory 

A surjective submersion can be characterised in the category of smooth manifolds as being an element in the largest pullback-stable class of regular epis. Also, submersions have local sections through every point in their codomain. Or they look locally like a projection out of a cartesian product with fibre a vector space. This latter is in fact how submersions are defined for infinite-dimensional (well, Fréchet) manifolds. The first definition works fine for smooth spaces, but proofs may not generalise if they need some of the other properties. The second one works if you are considering concrete smooth spaces, but is meaningless otherwise. The third definition implies the second, but restricts the sort of fibres. Edit: Another property of surjective submersions is that they are the largest class of morphisms which admit sections over open covers (which we can assume are made up of charts) of which all pullbacks exist. This means that surjective submersions are in some sense a 'saturation' of the singleton pretopology consisting of covers of the form $\coprod U_i \to X$.
