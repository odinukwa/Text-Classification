I am trying to understand the Segal-Sugawara construction from the book "vertex algebras and algebraic curves" by Frenkel, Ben-Zvi in 3.4.8. As an absolute layman in the area of mathematical physics and vertex algebras, I have difficulties to understand the arguments there, as it seems many details in the proof have been omitted. More concretely, the computations of $S_n.J^{b}_{-1}v_k$ for $n=-1,0,1$ are still obscure for me. Could anyone explain these computations with more details? 

In the literature, in many places the computations of Cohomology of the affine singular and projective smooth models are done interchangeably. Let us work with curves. For example, if $\pi:Y\to \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is a cyclic cover of the $\mathbb{P}^{1}$, then $Y$ is projective and smooth but in in practical cohomological computations the affine singular model $X$ defined by the equation $X:=\{y^l=\prod (x-a_k)^{d_k}\}$ is used. Of course $Y$ is the normalization of $X$ and I know that $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})\cong H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$. But for example when the curve is defined over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$ and you compute the Hasse-Witt matrix $F:H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})\to H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ how can one still use the basis of $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$ and computations be in terms of $a_k$ and $d_k$ above (which come from $X$)? The precise example that I have in mind is the following: (Taken from the paper I. Bouw, The p-rank of ramified covers of curves. Compositio Math. 126 (2001), 295â€“322.). The standard way of computing the above Hasse-Witt matrix is to decompose the cohomology $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$ in to eigenspaces $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})_{i}$ of the natural $\mathbb{Z}/l \mathbb{Z}$-action for $1\leq i\leq l-1$. Then a basis for $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})_{i}$ is computed by taking two open sets $V_1=\pi^{-1}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus \infty)$ and $V_2=\pi^{-1}(\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus \{0\})$. Then $\Gamma(V_1,\mathcal{O}_{V_1})=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{l-1} k[x]v_i$ where $v_i=y^i \prod (x-a_k)^{-[id_k/l]}$. My problem/question is: $v_i$ is only a rational section (not regular) and on $X$ (not $Y$) so how can it be viewed as a regular section? If you pull it back to $Y$ to become a regular function, then first of all the equation of $v_i$ certainly changes and secondly, how come that the resulting matrix $F$ is still the same, although we are using a basis of $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})$ (instead of $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y})$)? (Because if $F:V\to V$ and you change the basis, of course the matrix of $F$ changes too!) 

I am wondering what is the etiquette of publishing a "folklore" result? Though special cases of the result are well-known, the proof is not readily available in any reference text or paper I've seen. I will include it in the background of my thesis, and I could stick it onto another paper which I am working on (in which I use the folklore result). However, the paper I am working on is in a very niche area, whereas the proof of this result is useful to the bulk of researchers in my field. My options are: 

This must be an easy question but I don't have a good argument for it and have not found a counterexample: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$ such that the center of $G$, $Z(G)$ is trivial, i.e. $Z(G)=\{1\}$ is it true that the center of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$, denoted $Z(G_{\mathbb{R}})$ is also trivial? 

If $f: X \rightarrow C$ is the universal family of false elliptic curves (i.e. abelian surfaces $A$ such that $End(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is a totally indefinite quaternion algebra over $\mathbb{Q}$), then $C$ is a Shimura curve. My question is : How does the the variation of Hodge structures(VHS) of this universal family look like? Of course I know that for any family of abelian varieties over a Shimura curve, the VHS has the form $R^{1}f_{*}\mathbb{C}= (\mathbb{L} \otimes \mathbb{T}) \bigoplus \mathbb{U}$ where $\mathbb{U}$ and $\mathbb{T}$ are unitary and $\mathbb{L}$ is uniformizing, but I want a more specific description in the case of a universal family of false elliptic curves. 

Consider a pair of principal bundles $P \to M$ and $P' \to M'$ with groups $G$ and $G'$, respectively. A morphism from $P$ to $P'$ is a pair $(\Phi, \phi)$ where $\phi: G \to G'$ is a Lie group homomorphism and $\Phi: P \to P'$ is a fibre bundle map which is equivariant with respect to $\phi$ in the sense that $\Phi(u.g)= \Phi(u).\phi(g)$. This gives us a category $\mathsf{Prin}$ of principal bundles and their homomorphisms. If we require that $G = G'$ and $\phi= \mathrm{id}_G$ then we get the subcategory $\mathrm{Prin}G$ of $G$-principal bundles. Now, we know that the construction of associated bundles is a bifunctor $\mathsf{Prin} G \times G\mathsf{Man} \to \mathsf{Bund}$, where $G\mathsf{Man}$ is the category of manifolds with left $G$-action and $\mathsf{Bund}$ is the category of fibre bundles. Now, suppose that we pick a morphism of principal bundles $(\Phi, \phi)$ as above, where $G$ and $G'$ might differ. Then what is the relationship between the corresponding associated bundle functors? Do we get a natural transformation between the functors, for example $P' \times_{G'} (-) \Rightarrow P \times_{G}\phi^*(-)$, where $\phi^*: G'\mathsf{Man} \to G\mathsf{Man}$ is the restriction functor? If so, under what conditions would this be a natural isomorphism? For a concrete example, suppose $(\Phi, \phi)$ is a morphism from a $\mathrm{Spin} (n)$ principal bundle $P$ to an $\mathrm{SO}(n)$-principal bundle $P'$, where $\phi: \mathrm{Spin}(n) \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{SO}(n)$ is the universal covering space. Typically, $P'$ will often be the orthonormal frame bundle of an oriented semi-Riemannian manifold. My go-to reference for these sort of things is Natural Operations in Differential Geometry by Kolar, Michor, and Slovak, but I couldn't find an answer there. I have this question tagged as spin geometry because I figure people working in this field have thought about this sort of question before. 

If $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is a cyclic cover of $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ with Galois group $\mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$ and thus with the (affine) formula $y^{m}= (x_{1}-a_{1})^{t_{1}}....(x_{n}-a_{n})^{t_{n}}$ there is a Galois group decomposition on the cohomolgy $H^{1}(C, \mathbb{C})$ (or more generally on the sheaf $R^{1} \pi_{*} \mathbb{C}$ ) and the dimension of the eigenspace with respect to the character $j \in \mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$ is given by the formula $-1+ \sum_{i=1}^n < jt_{i}/m> $ (where $< x>$ denotes the franctional part of the number $x$ ) . Now if the Galois group of the covering $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is not cyclic, is there a formula that computes the dimension of the eigenspaces? Or generally how can one compute the dimension of the eigenspaces? For simplicity you can always assume that the covering $\pi$ is abelian (i.e. the Galois group is abelian) and thereof the fiber product of cyclic covers. 

The standard weak formulation of the Neumann problem for the Poisson equation is to find $u \in H^1 ( \Omega)$ such that for every $v \in H^1 ( \Omega)$: $$ \int_{\Omega} \nabla u \nabla v d x = \int_{\Omega} fv d x + \int_{\partial \Omega} gv d s $$ for given $f \in L^2 ( \Omega)$ and $g \in H^{- 1 / 2} ( \Omega)$. My goal is to introduce an arbitrary coordinate change and arrive at an analogous weak formulation. I start with the classical formulation $- \Delta u ( x) = f ( x)$ and $\partial_n u ( x) = g (x)$ with everything fine and smooth. Let now $\phi : \Omega \rightarrow \tilde{\Omega} : x \mapsto \phi ( x) = : \tilde{x}$ be $C^{\infty}$ and bijective and define $\tilde{u} \circ \phi = u$. Applying the chain rule to $ \Delta_x ( \tilde{u} \circ \phi)$ we find the differential operator $L$: $$ L \tilde{u} ( \tilde{x}) = a_{i j} ( x) \partial_{i j} \tilde{u} ( \tilde{x}) + b_i ( x) \tilde{u} ( \tilde{x}), $$ where $a_{i j} ( x) = \partial_k \phi_i ( x) \partial_k \phi_j ( x)$, $b_i ( x) = \Delta \phi_i ( x)$ and we used the usual summation convention over repeated indices. Yes the coordinates are all mixed up: I left out a composition with $\phi^{- 1}$ because it's messy. It now holds that $\Delta_x u ( x) = L \tilde{u} (\phi ( x))$ for all $x \in \Omega$. Question 1: My operator is not in divergence form, so deriving the weak formulation is going to be a real mess. What would be a better approach? Question 2: How do I transform the boundary conditions? I'd like something like $$ \partial_{\nu} \tilde{u} ( \tilde{x}) = \tilde{g}( \tilde{x}) . $$ The chain rule applied to $\partial_n ( \tilde{u} \circ \phi)$ results in $\partial_{\nu} \tilde{u} ( x) = \nabla \tilde{u} ( x) \nu ( x) = \nabla \tilde{u} ( x) D \phi ( x) n ( x)$, which is partly natural since the normal vector field is transformed with the differential, but is far from what I'd need during the partial integration deriving the weak formulation, which would rather be (assuming $L$ were in divergence form) $$ \partial_{\nu} \tilde{u} = a_{i j} \partial_i \tilde{u} \nu_j .$$ This must be pretty basic, but I'm a bit confused here... 

Inverse image of sheaves is exact, but generally only has a right adjoint (direct image). Also, for locally compact Hausdorff spaces, direct image with proper supports is left exact, but does not have any adjoints in general unless we pass to the derived category. 

In classical finite-dimensional differential geometry, the Lie functor preserves surjections, sending a surjective Lie group homomorphism to a surjective Lie algebra homomorphism. As pointed out below, the functor does not preserve all epimorphisms in the category of Lie groups, but only those which are also epimorphisms (surjective) in the ambient topos of sets. Does this continue to hold in synthetic differential geometry? In this case, it seems that the appropriate definition of a "surjective" Lie group homomorphism is a Lie group homomorphism which is an epi within the ambient smooth topos. To start, suppose we have a "surjective" Lie group homomorphism: $\phi: G \to H$. That is, for maps $\psi_1: H \to M$ and $\psi_2: H \to M$, if $\psi_1 \circ \phi = \psi_2 \circ \phi$ then $\psi_1 = \psi_2$. Now if $f_1 : \mathfrak{h} \to N$ and $f_2 : \mathfrak{h} \to N$ are any maps, we suppose that $f_1 \circ \phi_* = f_2 \circ \phi_*$. Then for any Lie algebra element $(X: D \to G) \in \frak{g}$, we have $$f_1 (\phi \circ X) = f_2 (\phi \circ X).$$ But I am not sure how to conclude that $f_1 = f_2$. Indeed, as far as I know covariant representable functors do not in general preserve epimorphisms. Sorry if this is obvious; I like to read up on SDG as a hobby, but I am not an expert in category theory or topos theory. 

Consider the Laplace operator defined in the biggest possible subset of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ and let $z \in \mathbb{C}\backslash\mathbb{R}$. Therefore $z \notin \sigma (\Delta)$ the spectrum of $\Delta$, and the resolvent $R=(-\Delta - zI)^{-1}$ is well defined and bounded in all of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$. I'm trying to find the integral kernel for this operator, that is a function $K(x,y)$ such that almost everywhere in $\mathbb{R}^2$: $$(Ru)(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^2} u(y)K(x,y) dy$$ Let $f := ( - \Delta - z I)^{- 1} u$ and let $\mathcal{F}$ be the Fourier transform. Now $$ ( - \Delta - z I) f = u \Rightarrow \mathcal{F} ( ( - \Delta - z I) f) =\mathcal{F} ( u) \Rightarrow ( \xi^2 - z) \hat{f} ( \xi) = \hat{u} ( \xi) . $$ Solving for $\hat{f}$ and applying $\mathcal{F}^{- 1}$ we arrive at (modulo some constant depending on your favourite definition of $\mathcal{F}$) $$ f ( x) =\mathcal{F}^{- 1} \left( \frac{1}{\xi^2 - z} \hat{u} ( \xi) \right) =\mathcal{F}^{- 1} \left( \frac{1}{\xi^2 - z} \right) \ast u ( x) $$ So I need to calculate $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} \frac{e^{ix \cdot \xi}}{\xi^2 - z} d \xi $$ and I'm completely stuck. Does anybody have any ideas or references? Thanks. 

If $f: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}_{2g+2}$ is a general family of hyperelliptic curves (defined over $\mathbb{C}$), we know that the algebraic connected monodromy group $Mon^{0}$ of this family is equal to the full symplectic group. Now if we have a 1-parameter family of hyperelliptic curves given for example by the expression $y^{2}= (x-h_{1}(t))....(x-h_{2g+2}(t))$ where $t$ is the parameter in $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ and the $h_{i}$ are holomorphic functions in $t$, is the group $Mon^{0}$ of this family also equal to the full symplectic group $Sp_{2g+2}$? if not, how can one compute the monodromy group of such family? 

Let $X$ be a compact Shimura curve. If we remove finitely many points from this curve, do we neccessarily get a "non-compact Shimura curve"? I have some reasons to believe that the answer is negative, but don't have a proof nor a counter example. However if the answer is really No, does there exist a well-known structure / property for this punctured Shimura curve? 

Purely from the adjunctions in the recollement and (co)continuity of (left)/right adjoints, we have that 

I've read through the classic Chern-Simons paper where they introduce the Chern-Simons forms. These are differential forms whose exterior derivative gives you the characteristic forms for any given choice of invariant polynomial, and the construction of Chern-Simons forms is a functor on the category of principal bundles with connection. So somehow this construction has to do with differential cohomology and differential characters. Admittedly, I only have a very vague understanding of differential characters and differential cohomology. I have skimmed through the Cheeger-Simons paper but the big idea hasn't popped out at me yet. Also, I am interested in invariants of principal bundles with connection, but from the nlab page on the topic it seems that differential cohomology has to do with circle bundles with connection. Is this indeed the case? Or is it useful for principal bundles with other sorts of structure groups? Essentially, I'm hoping to see the big-picture before I invest myself in learning differential cohomology and differential characters. 

I asked this question already in mathstackexchange but got no answer, so I ask it again here. Let $\mathbb{H}_{g}$ be the Siegel upper half space, i.e., the set of complex symmetric $g\times g$ matrices with positive-definite imaginary part. Royden in his article "inavariant metrics on TeichmÃ¼ller space" gives the inifinitesimal form of the Kobayashi distance (metric) on $\mathbb{H}_{g}$ as the operator norm $\frac{1}{2}||Y^{-1/2} dZ Y^{-1/2}||$. My question is what is the Kobayashi distance between two given points on $\mathbb{H}_{g}$? For example, when $g=1$, (i.e., $\mathbb{H}_{g}=\mathbb{H}_{1}$ is the upper half plane) it is well-konwn that the Kobayashi distance (finite version of the Kobayashi metric given above) between $z$ and $w$ in $\mathbb{H}$ is the usual hyperbolic distance $d_{\mathbb{H}}(z,w)$. What is the generalization of this to the upper half space?
