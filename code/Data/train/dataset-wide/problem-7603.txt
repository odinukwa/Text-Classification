What is Chern-Simons theory? I have read the wikipedia entry, but it's pretty physics-y and I wasn't really able to get any sense for what Chern-Simons theory really is in terms of mathematics. Chern-Simons theory is supposed to be some kind of TQFT. But what kind of TQFT exactly? When mathematicians say that it is a TQFT, does this mean that it's a certain kind of functor from a certain bordism category to a certain target category? If so, what kind of functor is it? What kind of bordism category is it? What kind of target category is it? How exactly is the functor defined? Also, from attending talks of Michael Freeman, I know that Chern-Simons theory is supposed to describe some aspects of the fractional quantum Hall effect. How does this work? How do I take some sort of Chern-Simons computation on a 3-(or 4-?)manifold and extract from that some kind of physical prediction about some 2d electron gas? I've also heard that Witten has interpretted various knot invariants like the Jones polynomial in terms of Chern-Simons theory. So does this mean that the Jones polynomial of a knot has a physical interpretation? If so, what is it? 

There was some discussion about this (and other things) at the secret blogging seminar fairly recently: $URL$ 

The Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov theorem states that deformations of Calabi-Yau manifolds (compact Kaehler manifolds with trivial canonical bundle) are unobstructed. This recent paper of Iacono and Manetti gives an algebraic proof of the theorem for algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0. As far as I know this is the only algebraic result in this direction. 

Just as a very naive motivation, note that in many situations Gromov-Witten invariants are zero simply because of "stupid reasons", like degree/dimension reasons (i.e. the degree of the integrand doesn't match the virtual dimension), and so provide no information. But the Gromov-Witten classes may still be nonzero and contain some information. 

Aside: Personally, I think that students of algebraic geometry should take a course on Riemann surfaces before (or while) taking a course on abstract algebraic geometry. Certainly I wish that I had done this. The theory of Riemann surfaces is very beautiful and I think it really helps to motivate some of the "big theorems" that you typically build up to in a first course in abstract algebraic geometry: for example Riemann-Roch and Riemann-Hurwitz. Probably it is not hard to guess that I also think that students of algebraic geometry should have taken a course on differential geometry before taking a course on abstract algebraic geometry. 

Here's an idea; I'm not sure if all of the steps are possible, but I think it should work. Take a simplicial complex of dimension $n$ (all simplices are of dimension $\leq n$). "Thicken" the simplicial complex to get a new topological space containing the original simplicial complex as a deformation retract, such that there is an open neighborhood $U_\sigma$, homeomorphic to an $n$-ball, of each simplex $\sigma$ which deformation retracts to that simplex. Do this so that the intersections $U_\sigma \cap U_{\sigma'}$ are equal to $U_{\sigma \cap \sigma'}$. Now take the open cover $\{ U_{\sigma} \}$; then the Cech complex associated to this open cover should be the "same" as the complex that computes the simplicial (co)homology of the simplicial complex. "Same" here probably means "canonically homotopy equivalent". For example, if you think of a circle as being the simplicial complex given by a triangle with 3 edges and 3 vertices, then this essentially matches up with your example (2). This is essentially the same as Mariano's explanation, but sort of in the converse direction. This sort of thing might be covered in some older books, like Munkres' "Elements of Algebraic Topology" or Spanier's "Algebraic Topology". Cech cohomology doesn't seem to really be covered in most contemporary algebraic topology books; I guess it's just not very useful for what people are interested in these days. 

One application that I know of the Mumford conjecture is Teleman's proof of Givental's conjecture in this paper. Givental's conjecture states that when the quantum cohomology of a smooth projective variety (or compact symplectic manifold) is (generically) semisimple (meaning that the algebra is semisimple for generic values of the deformation parameter), then the higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants are uniquely and explicitly determined by the quantum cohomology. Since quantum cohomology consists of genus 0 information, another way to say this is that the higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants are uniquely and explicitly determined by the genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants, when the quantum cohomology is semisimple. The proof, extremely roughly, uses the Mumford conjecture in the following way: semisimplicity allows you to go back and forth between low genus and high genus without loss of information. The Mumford conjecture tells you what things look like in very high genus, so if you want to know what something in some arbitrary genus looks like, you kick it up to very high genus, identify it by the Mumford conjecture, and then kick it back down to its original genus. ---Begin large parenthetical remark--- You might then ask, which smooth projective varieties (or compact symplectic manifolds) have semisimple quantum cohomology? Smooth projective toric varieties form a class of examples. Arend Bayer showed that semisimple quantum cohomology is preserved under blowing up points. There are other examples... There is an interesting conjecture of Dubrovin which states that a variety has semisimple quantum cohomology if and only if its derived category has a full exceptional collection. (This conjecture is based heavily on mirror symmetry philosophy...) I don't know the status of this conjecture. But I think it is true, for example, that having a full exceptional collection is preserved under blowing up points. (Proved by Orlov? Bondal?) ---End large parenthetical remark--- It is also apparently possible to view the Mumford conjecture as a special case of the cobordism hypothesis. Take a look at Jacob Lurie's paper on TFTs, particularly section 2.5. 

I can't think of any good specific examples off the top of my head, but I'm sure that there must be lots of examples where you can much more easily prove something about an affine variety by adding "points at infinity", i.e. by looking at the projectivization of the variety. 

In Manin's book "Frobenius manifolds, quantum cohomology, and moduli spaces", section 0.6.2, the argument ("an old trick of enumerative geometry") is attributed to Kontsevich. I would guess that Kontsevich probably came up with the "streamlined proof" but preferred to talk about it within the framework of WDVV because it more readily generalizes this way, and because it leads to nice-sounding statements like "the enumerative formula is equivalent to associativity of quantum multiplication". That's what I imagine at least. Also, I would be inclined to trust Manin's attribution, as he collaborated with Kontsevich on these early works. 

When we are dealing with ordinary things or dg things (where thing = algebra or category), I think I understand how HH^2 corresponds to 1st order deformations and HH^3 corresponds to obstructions. One often hears (or at least I often hear) that HH^* corresponds to A-infinity deformations. I am wondering whether there is any reference which works this out precisely. EDIT: This seems to be incorrect (depending on what we mean by "deformation"). See Damien's answer. And see David Ben-Zvi's comment. 

The zeta function $Z_X(t)$ of a variety $X$ is defined to be $\exp(\sum N_r t^r/r)$, where $N_r$ is the number of $\mathbb{F}_{q^r}$-points of $X$. Write $\zeta_X(s) = Z_X(q^{-s})$. Then the above statement implies that the zeros and poles of $\zeta_X(s)$ lie on the lines given by $\mathfrak{Re}(s) = i/2$ with $i=1, \dots, 2n$. The function $\zeta_X(s)$ is also equal to $$\prod_{x \in X} \frac{1}{1-|k(x)|^{-s}}$$ where $|k(x)|$ is the order of the residue field of $x$ (which is always finite). Now if $X = \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}$ were somehow a smooth projective variety of dimension 1 over $\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{F}_1$, then $\zeta_X(s)$ would be the Riemann zeta function, and... 

Another book that covers Dolbeault cohomology very nicely is "Complex Geometry" by Daniel Huybrechts. I highly recommend it. 

I do not know very much about quantum field theory, but I have seen, in my reading, that stable graphs can appear in QFT in the form of, I think, Feynman diagrams. By stable graph I mean a "graph with tails", whose vertices are labelled by nonnegative integers, and such that each vertex with labeling 0 has valence at least 3, and each vertex with labeling 1 has valence at least 1. Algebraic geometers of course know that stable graphs also give a stratification of the Deligne-Mumford spaces $\overline{M}_{g,n}$: Vertices with label $g$ correspond to genus $g$ curves; edges correspond to nodes; tails correspond to marked points. Valency conditions correspond to finitude of automorphism group of the nodal curve. Is there an explanation for this coincidence? I guess there is probably some kind of explanation via Gromov-Witten theory. But I get the impression that stable graphs show up in QFTs more generally, and beyond Gromov-Witten theory. Do they? If so, how? And where? 

Good afternoon. Let $M$ be, say, a compact symplectic manifold. Both deformation quantization (as in Kontsevich) and quantum cohomology yield "deformations" (in the appropriate respective senses) of "classical" data -- the Poisson algebra of functions $C^\infty(M)$ and the cohomology algebra (or rather, Frobenius algebra) $H^\ast(M; \mathbb{C})$ respectively. 

I actually never quite worked out the curl formula myself in terms of fancier differential geometry language. I imagine it's: take a vector field (in $\mathbb{R}^3$), turn it into a 1-form using the standard Riemannian metric, take de Rham d of that to get a 2-form, take Hodge star of that using the standard orientation to get a 1-form, turn that into a vector field using the standard Riemannian metric. I imagine that the appearance of the determinant / cross product comes from the Hodge star. I imagine that one can work out divergence in the same way, and the reason why the formula for divergence is "simple" is because the Hodge star from 3-forms to 0-forms is simple. Is my thinking correct? Stewart's book provides some comments about how to give curl and divergence a "physical" or "geometric" or "intuitive" interpretation; the former gives the axis about which the vector field is "rotating" at each point, the latter tells you how much the vector field is "flowing" in or out of each point. Is there some way to use these kinds of "physical" or "geometric" pictures to "prove" or explain curl(gradient f) = 0 and div(curl F) = 0? Is there some way to explain to undergrad students how the formulas for curl and div do in fact agree with the "physical" or "geometric" picture? Though such an explanation is perhaps less "mathematical", I would find an explanation of this sort satisfactory for my class. Thanks in advance! 

There is a good amount of 'experimental evidence', I guess. There have been lots of other models proposed, and they've all been proven to be computationally equivalent to Turing machines. This is true even for quantum computers. That is, they can all do the exact same things that Turing machines can. But there is also the question of whether this equivalence is a polynomial-time equivalence. This leads to the 'strong Church-Turing thesis'. It is believed by many that quantum computers are strictly better than classical computers in terms of time complexity, though as far as I know this has not been proven yet. If this were proven, then the strong Church-Turing thesis would be false. Then the natural thing would be to assert a quantum version of the strong Church-Turing thesis... 

Deligne-Illusie prove degeneration of the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence for smooth projective varieties using purely algebraic methods. Then probably the corresponding result in the analytic category follows by GAGA or some such thing. 

What do Gromov-Witten invariants (of say a Calabi-Yau 3-fold) represent, or what are they supposed to represent, in terms of string theory? When I compute GW invariants, am I actually computing some interactions between some particles, or what ...? Please be gentle, and use only undergraduate-level physics words, if possible. (Perhaps this is too much to ask! Ok well, I'd rather get a response that involves fancier physics words than no response at all.) I suppose this question is more physics than math -- I hope that's ok. 

Why, from a string theory perspective, is it natural to consider the Deligne-Mumford (resp. Kontsevich) compactification of the moduli of curves (resp. maps [from curves to a target space X]) rather than some other compactification? In any case, what other compactifications of the moduli of curves have been studied? Similarly, what other compactifications of the moduli of maps have been studied? Do any of these other compactifications lead to an interesting "Gromov-Witten theory"? 

I'm really glad that this question was posted, because I am currently in the process of trying to learn about the cotangent complex myself. First of all, the wikipedia entry on the cotangent complex is pretty good, so you should take a look at it if you haven't already. I'll try to make some naive and vague comments about the relation to deformation theory, as Charles has hinted at. The two examples on the bottom of the wikipedia page are already instructive. The first example of a cotangent complex is that of a smooth $S$-scheme $X$. Then the cotangent complex in this case is just the cotangent bundle $\Omega_{X/S}$. By Kodaira-Spencer theory, we know that the tangent bundle $T_{X/S}$ has a lot to do with the deformation theory of $X$. The second example is the cotangent complex of a closed embedding $X\to Y$ of smooth $S$-schemes; it is the conormal bundle of $X$ in $Y$. Similarly to how the tangent bundle $T_{X/S}$ tells us about deformations of $X$, the normal bundle $N_{X/Y}$ tells us about deformations of $X$ inside of $Y$. If you look at e.g. chapter 3 of Deformations of Algebraic Schemes, you will find precise versions of the vague statements I've made above. My understanding is that the cotangent complex is a rather general gadget that contains information about deformations, in particular, it works for situations where your schemes (or stacks) are not necessarily smooth. One such situation of interest is in Gromov-Witten theory, where we consider moduli of stable maps, which can be very singular, even when considered as Deligne-Mumford stacks.
