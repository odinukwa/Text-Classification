You are correct in your reading of the laws. The offside line is at the second-to-last defender without regard to whether one of them is a goalkeeper or not. The player circled red is also where the offside line should be marked and judged. At the moment of the screen capture, the attacking player on the far side by the goalpost is clearly in an offside position. If they play the ball or influence play, they also commit an offside offence. However, it is unclear how close the attacking player on the near side, very close to the line, would be to an offside position. This is due to a combination of perspective and graphical inaccuracy and still capture eliminating knowledge of movement. Only someone flat with the circled defender would have sufficient perspective to make this decision. For me personally, they appear to be not offside at this exact moment, but they may have moved enough to be made offside prior to the screen capture. 

The referee would write "#7 38 C4 @ IFK" to indicate who received the caution, why the caution was given and when, under what justification in the laws. Various systems are used by different organisations to make it easy to note the reason for a card, and remind the referee what occurred when they write a match report afterward. Beyond that, referees develop an experience that helps them remember offences long enough to get through the match. They also have two assistants recording everything as well, so if anything is not recalled, the three can confirm details of the event. 

Quite simply, USA Hockey is the official governing organisation for amateur ice hockey in the USA. They decide what rules and regulations apply to national competitions; they educate and give accreditation to officials; they select the national teams; they run the Hall of Fame; they are the representative of USA in the IIHF and of USA ice hockey in the IOC. They are not the organisers or managers of the USA NHL, but they claim a close partnership, and if you intend to play professionally, it is likely that you will need to play well in the amateur competitions that they do have oversight responsibility for - something that would almost certainly require membership. I cannot find any regulation governing membership of USA-origin NHL players in external organisations and therefore cannot say whether USAH membership is neutral, recommended or even mandatory. However I doubt it would be considered a negative factor and therefore would be neutral at worst. You can find a run-down of membership benefits in the PDF at $URL$ Note that one is insurance, and some USAH policies relate to persons in contact with youth. Presumably a team or club or league has added financial and legal risk if allowing non-USAH members to play, and therefore may also mandate that you be a member before you can officially play (that is, if USAH itself doesn't; I cannot find a reference either way on this). You should ask the team, club or league secretary if such a mandate is in place and whether they recommend membership, or what the potential outcomes would be for e.g. injury liability, playing and administration fees, eligibility. 

The (Standard ODI) Playing Conditions quoted and cited are from July 2015. They were not updated recently to the time of asking. When playing under such conditions, there is no request for a power play by either team. The three power plays, the limits of which you have stated, are all mandatory. The ICC World Cup 2015 featured variance from the Standard. Clause 41.2.5 therein allowed for two power plays: 

You are correct that a batsman may stand however they please in front of the wicket. This is normally subject to Law 41.14 and 41.15, but a backyard game does not typically have a pressed pitch to play on, and this law is somewhat irrelevant. Your friend is incorrect that the wide range increases. The only determination of a wide is that the batsman cannot play it - this is going to be the case regardless of where a batsman stands. However, the Preamble to the Laws makes several very important points, some of them being 

The batsman can only be Run Out in this situation if it is attempting to score by running between the creases. If no such attempt is made, the batsman is Stumped instead (Law 39.1, Out Stumped and Law 38.2.b, Batsman not Run Out). As a delivery is a free hit, the batsman cannot be out Stumped (Law 28.17, Out from a No ball, which is further applied to the free hit itself). Whether the batsman was or was not attempting to run between the creases cannot be determined by anybody who was not present and does not have access to conclusive video or audio evidence. In the case that it is not clear even to witnesses or by examination of evidence (and in particular, it is not clear to the umpires of the match in question) benefit of the doubt is presumed for the batsman (Law 27.6, Consultation by umpires), and therefore the decision should be not out. 

It's extremely easy to kick a football half the length of the field or more (and for a notable portion of players, from one penalty area to the other). Without a rule limiting attackers to be not beyond the last defenders, the attacking team is forced to build play throughout the field, with long balls an option only suitable in certain situations rather than being the superior choice in a majority of the time. This results in a competitive game based on the work of the team as a whole, rather than two or three individuals who either kick the ball a great distance or are adept at trapping, volleying or otherwise receiving the ball to score. 

Under Rule 12 "Player Conduct" in the 2016 NFL rulebook, Section 1, Article 4 includes the prohibition that 

If the competition is a single round-robin each team plays each other team once. The number of games played by each team is one less than the number of teams. For example, 11 - 1 = 10 games. A home-and-away competition or a double round-robin repeats this. The number of games is twice that for a single round, for example 2 Ã— 10 = 20 games. Note that for an odd number of teams, each team will have one bye per round, adding an additional week of competition per round (assuming one game is played per week). 

Give points based on relative position to the last place team, not the first place. Then players can score more only if more people play - the result is that those in contention for overall places will encourage people to come so they can try to catch up faster. Give a multiplier for points based on consecutive weeks played. You might step it at every K weeks and have a maximum multiplier of X. There is also possibility of only reducing the multiplier by one step each missed week, or even just the count by one week each missed week, so that having one night off doesn't destroy the reward for otherwise being very committed. Build teams each week based on current ranking. Divide the ranks into e.g. four even grades. A team is randomly formed so that the grades of players add to five. Then a game is randomly formed so that the grades of players add to ten. That way teams are sure to be balanced, and it isn't just good players teaming up against everyone else. In addition to points from games, each set of four players each week votes for a bonus to the best attitude or fairest player in that group. This can be a single lump of points added afterwards, or B points added to their weekly score before the multiplier. 

Since the ball is not in play when it first touches the ring, an argument can be made that it should not be included as a circumstance for Article 29.2 to be applied. This is however a very weak argument, and without a statement from FIBA such as that in the Official Interpretations document, it would otherwise be ignored.
