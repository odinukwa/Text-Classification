Consider a space $X$, whose points are right and left limiting points of $[a,b]$, i.e. points of the form $x+$ and $x-$, where $x\in(a,b)$ and points $a+,b-$. If $f\colon [a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ is a Cadlag function, you can define $f(z)$ for $z\in X$ by formulas $f(x+)=\lim_{y\to x+} f(y)$, $f(x-)=\lim_{y\to x-} f(y)$. Moreover, you can define a topology on $X$ such that function on $X$ is continuous iff it is obtained by the procedure described in the previous sentence from Cadlag function on $[a,b]$. Space $X$ with this topology is compact and you can apply Arzela-Ascoli theorem. The result of this is the following: 

P.S. Here is a proof I came up with after some trial and error. We would like to define $F=f(PP^*)$, where $f(x)=0$ if $x=0$ and $f(x)=1$ otherwise. To check, that $F$ is well-defined we need to check, that $f$ is continuous on the spectrum of $PP^*$. To do this it is enough to show, that the open interval $(0,1)$ doesn't intersect with its spectrum or, equivalently, that $(2PP^*-1)^2\geq 1$. Expanding we see, that this is equivalent to $PP^*PP^* \geq PP^*$. Define $A=P-P^*$. Then $A^*A\geq 0$. On the other hand expanding we get $A^*A=PP^*+P^*P-P-P^*$, so $PP^*+P^*P\geq P+P^*$. Multiplying by $P$ on the left and by $P^*$ on the right we get $PP^* + PP^*PP^*\geq 2 PP^*$ or $PP^*PP^*\geq PP^*$. Thus $F=f(PP^*)$ is indeed well defined. Since $f(x)$ is real valued and $f(x)=f(x)^2$ we have $F=F^*=F^2$. To show, that $FP=P$ notice, that $f(x)x=x$ for $x\geq 0$. Therefore $FPP^*=PP^*F=PP^*$ and $(FP-P)(FP-P)^*=(F-1)PP^*(F-1)=0(F-1)=0$. Thus indeed $FP=P$. Thus we have $$P=F+(P-F)=F+F(P-1).$$ Finally, notice, that $(P-1)F=(P-1)PP^*F=0P^*F=0$, so $P-1=(P-1)(1-F)$ and $$P=F+F(P-1)(1-F).$$ 

Each voter can have any set of rational preferences. This requirement is called “universal admissibility”. If a voter prefers Candidate A to Candidate B, and Candidate B to Candidate C, then he/she prefers A to C. This requirement is called “transitivity”. If every voter prefers A to B, then the group prefers A to B. This is sometimes called the “unanimity” condition. If every voter prefers A to B, then any change in preferences that does not affect this relationship must not affect the group preference for A over B. For example, if a set of historians unanimously decides that Abraham Lincoln was a better president than Chester A. Arthur, a changing opinion of Bill Clinton should not affect this decision. This more subtle requirement is called “independence from irrelevant alternatives”. There are no dictators. In other words, no voter exists whose preferences determine the preferences of the whole group. 

On the first page of Chapter 1 of Rieffel's Deformation Quantization for Actions of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $, Rieffel defines a family of seminorms on the space $ A^{\infty} $ of smooth vectors of a Fréchet space $ A $, for some action $ \alpha $ of the Lie group $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $ on $ A $, as follows. Suppose we already have a family $ (\| \cdot \|_{i})_{i \in \mathbb{N}} $ of seminorms on $ A $ that determine its topology. Choose a basis $ \lbrace X_{1},\ldots,X_{d} \rbrace $ of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $. Then for each $ k \in \lbrace 1,\ldots,d \rbrace $, let $ \alpha_{X_{k}} $ denote the operator of partial differentiation on $ A^{\infty} $ in the direction of $ X_{k} $; we thus identify $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $ with its Lie algebra in the usual way. For convenience, denote $ \alpha_{X_{k}} $ simply by $ \partial_{k} $. Next, for any multi-index $ \mu = (\mu_{1},\ldots,\mu_{d}) \in \mathbb{N}_{0}^{d} $, let $ \partial^{\mu} $ denote the higher-order partial derivative $ \partial_{1}^{\mu_{1}} \cdots \partial_{d}^{\mu_{d}} $. Then equip $ A^{\infty} $ with the seminorms $$ \forall (j,k) \in \mathbb{N} \times \lbrace 1,\ldots,d \rbrace ~~ \& ~~ \forall a \in A^{\infty}: \quad \| a \|_{j,k} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \sup_{1 \leq i \leq j} \sum_{|\mu| \leq k} \frac{\| \partial^{\mu} a \|_{i}}{\mu!}, $$ where $ |\mu| \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \mu_{1} + \cdots + \mu_{d} $ and $ \mu! \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \mu_{1}! \cdots \mu_{d}! $. My question is: As we are applying partial derivatives to $ a \in A^{\infty} $, are we identifying $ a $ with the function $ f_{a}: \mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow A $ defined by $ {f_{a}}(\mathbf{x}) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \alpha(\mathbf{x},a) $? Thank you very much in advance! 

Not a good fitting :(. This is actually why I ask this question. But note, I haven't used the data I have for k(x). Let's check, how is it approximated by $\Im(f(x))$ (with coeffitients from the previous fitting). 

I've tried to fit a $n(x)$ by $\Re(f(x))$ with $f(x)=1+\sum_i\frac{c_i^2}{x-a_i-i b_i^2}$ with $c_i,a_i,b_i\in \mathbb{R}$. Here is the result of the fitting: 

I don't know the answer, just some thoughts. Suppose you have $n$ vertices of the first type and $l$ of the second. Of course, you know the answer if there is no restriction on the number of edges (you want it to be odd). Therefore equivalently I can calculate cases, when it is odd with coefficient (-1) and cases, when it is even with coefficient 1 (I denote this amount by $N$). Let $y_1,\dots,y_n,z_1,\dots,z_l$ be elements of $\mathbb{Z}\_2=\mathbb{Z}/(2\mathbb{Z})$, corresponding to the vertices of the graph. Edges are given by $n\times l$ matrix $A$. Then $N$ is the coefficient of $h^m$ in $S(h,h)$, where $S$ is defined by $$S(h,g)=\sum_{y\in\mathbb{Z}\_2^n,\;z\in\mathbb{Z}\_2^l} h^{|y|} g^{|z|} (-1)^{\sum_{i,j}y_i A_{ij} z_j}.\tag{1}$$ Here $|y|$ is amount of components in $y\in \mathbb{Z}\_2^n$ which are equal to $1$. One can get rid of the sum over $y\in\mathbb{Z}\_2^n$ in the following way: $$S(h,g)=\sum_{z\in\mathbb{Z}\_2^l} g^{|z|}\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1+h(-1)^{\sum_j A_{ij} z_j}).\tag{2}$$ This for example solves the problem in two cases: 1. we fix the number of vertices only in one part of a bipartite graph and the map $\mathbb{Z}_2^l\to\mathbb{Z}_2^n\colon z\mapsto x$ with $x_i=\sum_j A_{ij} z_j$ is surjective (in this case we can omit $g^{|z|}$ in $(2)$, make described change of coordinates and apply again the trick we used to get (2) from (1)); 2. amount of vertices in one part of a bipartite graph is small enough (in this case the sum (2) has small enough number of terms and each of them can be calculated in a polynomial time); 

Ginsparg's Applied Conformal Field Theory (hep-th/9108028 section 7.6) has a nice proof of the Jacobi Triple-Product formula and Euler's pentagonal number theorem. The equalities can be interpreted as the equivalence between the partition function of a free chiral boson and the partition function of two chiral fermions on a torus. This is an example of bosonization and plays an important role in string theory. The proof can be explained without any reference to physics, but the crucial difference in statistics (Boson/Fermion) employed in the proof becomes obscured. 

Witten's proof of the positive energy theorem using spinors drastically simplified the original proof by Schoen and Yau. 

The following conjecture is motivated by two different presentations of the affine cone over Grassmannian $Gr(2,6).$ One as a GIT quotient of $Hom(\mathbb{C}^2, \mathbb{C}^6)//SU(2)$ and the other as an affine variety defined by ${6 \choose 2} = 15$ Plucker coordinates, ${4 \choose 2} = 15$ Plucker relations, and ${6 \choose 6} = 1$ syzygy. Any thoughts on its proof (or disproof), or how to "fix" the left-hand side to give a full equality would be appreciated. Conjecture: The coefficients of $t^{4k}, k \in \mathbb{Z}$ in the expansion of the LHS and RHS of $$ \frac{1}{(1- t^6)} \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint \frac{dz}{z} (1 - z^2) PE( i_E) = \frac{1}{(1- t^6)} \prod_{1\le i < j \le 6} \frac{\left( 1- u_i^{-1} u_j^{-1} t^4 \right)}{(1-u_i u_j t^2)} + t^6 + t^{12} +t^{24} -\frac{t^{48}}{\left(t^{12}-1\right)^2}$$ agree, where $$i_E = t^6 \chi_3(z) + \left (t \chi_f(u) - t^5 \chi_{\bar{f}}(u) \right) \chi_2(z)$$ $$PE(i_E) = \frac{1}{(1 - t^6 z^2)(1 - t^6)(1 - t^6 z^{-2})} \prod_{1 \le i <j \le 6} \frac{(1 - t^5 z u_i^{-1} )(1 - t^5 z^{-1} u_i^{-1})}{(1 - tz u_i)(1 - t z^{-1} u_i)}$$ here $\chi_f(u) = \sum_{i=1}^{6} u_i, \qquad \chi_{\bar{f}}(u) = \sum_{i=1}^6 u_i^{-1}$ are the characters of the fundamental and anti-fundamental representations of $SL_6(\mathbb{C})$ and we have taken $\prod_{i=1}^{6} u_i = 1.$ $\chi_3(z) = z^2 + 1 + z^{-2}, \qquad \chi_2(z) = z + z^{-1}$ are the characters of the adjoint and fundamental representations of $SU(2).$ The Haar measure on $SU(2)$ is $\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint \frac{dz}{z} (1 - z^2)$. The integral simply picks off the coefficient of $z^{-1}$ in the series expansion in $t,z$. There are some similarities with the elliptic beta integral of Spiridonov and its degenerations to the Nassrallah-Rahman and Askey-Wilson integrals. However, it isn't obvious if they can be applied. 

Suppose, for simplicity, that $N=\infty$, so you are just taking values from a distribution. In order to answer your question, you should have some prior knowledge about this distribution (i.e. a probability distribution in the space of all distributions). I will give you two examples of this. Example 1: Suppose, you are doing (many times) some experiment, which has 2 results: 0 or 1. You don't know the probability p of "1", any value $p$ from 0 to 1 is possible. Then you can formalize your knowledge as the following: $p$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. Suppose, that after a few experiments you have got the sequence w="1010110111", you can write the formula, for a posterior density $f(p)$ of $p$. In general, if you have $n$ zeros and $m$ ones then $$f(p)=\frac{(1-p)^np^m}{\int_0^1(1-p)^np^mdp}=\frac{1}{n+m+1}\begin{pmatrix}n\\\\n+m\end{pmatrix}(1-p)^np^m.$$ This formula is just a continuous version of Bayes' theorem Because mean of the result of experiment is exactly $p$, the formula, written above, is exactly formula for the distribution, you are searching for. If w="1010110111", then n=3, m=7 and this distribution looks like this: 

Suppose $N=\|(I+K)^{-1}\|$. In order to calculate $N$ one can do the following. Write $$N^2= \\|(I+K)^{-1}(I+K^\*)^{-1}\\| = \\|(1+K+K^\*+K^\* K)^{-1}\\| = 1/(1+\lambda),$$ where $\lambda$ is the smallest eigenvalue of $K+K^\*+K K^\*$. Try to calculate it using your explicit formulas. 

The mathematical economist Kenneth Arrow showed in a landmark paper (stemming from his PhD thesis) that one obtains a contradiction if all five assumptions are assumed to hold. In fact, Assumptions (1) - (4) imply the existence of a dictator. However, these assumptions seem fairly reasonable and consistent, so the fact that they are contradictory is why Arrow named his paper “A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare”. His result is known nowadays as Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. 

Another example from real analysis would be the question of the pointwise convergence of the Fourier series of a continuous function (defined on a closed interval). Many people, including Dirichlet and even the master rigorist Weierstrass himself, believed that the Fourier series of such a function converges pointwise everywhere to the function itself. Some clung on to this belief so strongly that they even viewed it as an infallible axiom. Hence, one can imagine the great upset when, in 1876, Paul du Bois-Reymond proved the existence of a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at a point. His proof is non-constructive and uses a method called the principle of condensation of singularities. I have absolutely no idea how the method works, but I do know of a very common proof that uses the Baire Category Theorem (using the Baire Category Theorem, one can also prove the existence of continuous functions that are not differentiable at any point). After the dust had settled in the wake of du Bois-Reymond's seismic discovery, people started fervently believing that there should exist a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges everywhere - an opinion that lay on the other extreme! Andrei Kolmogorov inadvertently lent support to this claim by exhibiting, in 1926, an $ {L^{1}}([- \pi,\pi]) $-function whose Fourier series diverges everywhere. However, there was great upheaval once more in Fourier-land when the combined efforts of Lennart Carleson and Richard Hunt in the late 1960's showed that the Fourier series of any $ f \in {L^{p}}([- \pi,\pi]) $ converges almost everywhere to $ f $, for all $ p > 1 $ (this result subsumes the case of continuous functions). During an interview with the AMS, Carleson revealed that he had originally tried to disprove his result (pertaining to $ p = 2 $), but in the end, his failure to produce a counterexample convinced him that he should be working in the other direction instead. Therefore, in the field of Fourier analysis, viewpoints have changed and cherished beliefs have been destroyed - twice. 

$$q^{-[n/2]/2}\sum_{k=0}^{[n/2]}(-1)^k \sum X_{j_1}\dots X_{j_{n-2k}},$$ where the second sum is over sequences $0=j_0,j_1,\dots ,j_ {n-2k},j_{n-2k+1}=n+1$ such that $j_0< j_1< \dots< j_ {n-2k}< j_{n-2k+1}$ and $j_{l+1}-j_l$ is odd for $l=0,\dots,n-2k$. Is not this a simple expression you are searching for? 

I've noted, that the following fact can be proven in a few lines using $C^*$-algebra theory. I wonder if it has a simple elementary proof or not. Probably you can give me a reference. 

Assume we have a $3\times 3$ grid with rows and columns being short exact sequences of $C^*$-algebras. This gives a grid of 6-term exact sequences: 3 "horizontal" sequences and 3 "vertical" sequences, forming a torus-like diagram with 18 groups and 36 maps. Commutativity of 16 out of 18 squares follows from naturality of functors $K_0$, $K_1$ the index map $\delta_1$ and exponential map $\delta_0$. Two squares remain, and it seems, that they are "anti-commutative", but I didn't manage to prove this. These squares are the following. 

This is not a complete answer, but a collection of observations (mainly about part (1)), which may be useful for the problem. Let's denote maximal determinant with $D_n$. Case $n=1$ is a trivial exceptional case, where determinant is uniformly distributed on $[a,b]$. So we can assume, that $n\geq 2$. In this case the minimal value of determinant is $-D_n$, because we can always permute two rows. Moreover, by the same reason, the distribution of the determinant is symmetric with respect to 0. Lemma: the answer to 1 has the form $D_n = (b-a)^{n-1} \max_i (c_i a + d_i b)$, where $c_i,d_i$ are some integers, $i=1,\dots,i_{max}(n)$. Proof: First, note, that the determinant is linear in each of matrix elements. Therefore any local (and hence global) maximum and minimum will be achieved for the extremal values of the elements. That is, we can assume, that each matrix element is either $a$ or $b$. Let $A$ be such a matrix. Do the following:

Many recurrence relations such as the Somos-4 sequence can be embedded into the octahedron recurrence with some periodic identifications. It would be interesting to see if the simultaneous recursions in 109955 can also be embedded into the octahedron recurrence. 

Given a Fano threefold $X$, its index $ind(X)$ is the largest integer $r$ such that there exists a divisor $H$ such that $rH \cong -K_X$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the associated (ample) line bundle and define the twisted forms $\Omega^q(k) = \Omega^q \otimes \mathcal{L}^k$. When do the twisted cohomology groups $H^p(X, \Omega^q(k))$ vanish? The Kodaira-Nakano vanishing theorem states that the cohomology groups vanish for $p+q > 3.$ For simple examples such as $\mathbb{CP}^3$ and the quadric hypersurface, many more of the twisted cohomology groups vanish. What results are known? Can anything stronger be said if $X$ has a Kahler-Einstein metric? Added: There are few scattered results in the literature. For example: The only two threefolds with non-vanishing $H^0(X, \Omega^1_X (1))$ are the Mukai–Umemura threefold $V_{22}$ and $V_{18}$ [math.AG/0310390]. 

This problem was posed on Math StackExchange some time ago, but it did not garner any solutions there. I think that it is interesting enough to be posed here on Math Overflow, so here it goes. Let $ \mathcal{A} $ be a unital Banach algebra over $ \mathbb{C} $, with $ \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{A}} $ denoting the identity of $ \mathcal{A} $. For each $ a \in \mathcal{A} $, define the spectrum of $ a $ to be the following subset of $ \mathbb{C} $: $$ {\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}}(a) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \lbrace \lambda \in \mathbb{C} ~|~ \text{$ a - \lambda \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{A}} $ is not invertible} \rbrace. $$ With the aid of the Hahn-Banach Theorem and Liouville's Theorem from complex analysis, one can prove the well-known result that $ {\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}}(a) \neq \varnothing $ for every $ a \in \mathcal{A} $. All proofs that I have seen of this result use the Hahn-Banach Theorem in one way or another (a typical proof may be found in Walter Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis). Hence, a natural question to ask would be: Can we remove the dependence of this result on the Hahn-Banach Theorem? Is it a consequence of ZF only? Otherwise, if it is equivalent to some weak variant of the Axiom of Choice (possibly weaker than the Hahn-Banach Theorem itself), has anyone managed to construct a model of ZF containing a Banach algebra that has an element with empty spectrum?
