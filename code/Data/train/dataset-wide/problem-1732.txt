Note in edit: My answer is based on the practice amongst professional astronomers and not on what some dictionaries say. I reckon the latter are somewhat behind the times, when all planets, asteroids etc known where those in orbiting the Sun. Wikipedia is a great resource, but anybody can change its contents and, not surprisingly, some of its pages are quite biased. 

Flat here means "has Euklidean geometry" (on large scales), as explained by Helen's answer. Observationally, the universe appears flat, i.e. any deviations are within the uncertainties. Of course, if the universe is infinite, no statements on the whole universe can ever be made, but only on our local observable patch of it. 

Btw2, I don't think that elites in classic times (Greek/Egyptian/Middle East Cultures ~1000Bc and more recent) seriously considered the Earth to be flat. All the constructions of epicyles etc for explaining the data assume a spherical Earth in the centre of the cosmos. Flat is much more arcane than Geocentric. 

Since gas makes only a small fraction of the total mass of a galaxy, the removal of their gas will have little effect on the dynamics of the galaxies, though they will stop forming new stars or feeding an AGN. In fact, such collisions are observed for not for galaxies, but for galaxy clusters (when the individual galaxies are mostly unscathed, but the cluster gas gets stuck in the middle), such as the bullet cluster. 

Scientists are, of course, well aware of the errors emanating from this (and other) assumptions (in particular if the situation is as simple as here) and care is taken (if not by every individual scientist, then certainly by the concensus reached by the scientific community) that these errors have no bearing on the scientific conclusions. Your quote from a undergraduate-level textbook proves nothing in this respect. 

Essentially, a planet can be considered as a self-gravitating fluid. As was already known to Archimedes, under gravity low-density fluids are buoyant and rise, while high-density fluids sink. So, with some local exceptions, planets are always well structured from the densest material in the core to lower-density material further up. 

Even if you could withstand the conditions (pressure, temperature, radiation, charged particles, magnetic field, gravitational crunch) on the 'surface' of the Sun, you cannot step onto the Sun: it has no surface. But why does it appear to have a sharp edge? The Sun is a ball of hot plasma permeated with magnetic fields and photons (=electro-magnetic radiation). The photons are permanently absorbed and re-emitted, whereby transporting energy from the Solar depths (another transport process is convection). To very good approximation, the photons follow a black-body spectrum with the temperature equal to that of the ambient gas. Now, the image of the Sun that we perceive is made from those photons that managed to escape unscathed. The likelihood for a photon coming from a certain depth and escaping the Sun decreases exponentially with depth $d$ as $\mathrm{e}^{-d/\tau}$ with optical depth $\tau$. Since $\tau\ll R_{\odot}$, the radius of the Sun, the Sun appears to have a sharp edge. The same also applies to gas planets: you cannot step onto them, but would sink. 

The short answer is: we are made from the "stuff" contributed by many stars. The interstellar medium from which the Solar system formed was enriched by all sorts of elements synthesised in previous generations of stars. Most of the heavy elements are formed and injected into the ISM in a supernova explosion of a massive star. 

Depends on how the angular momentum (that manifests itself as Earth's rotation) would be absorbed. If, magically, it's absorbed smoothly and evenly, then not much dramatic happens initially (a small change in your weight and some earthquakes as response to the missing centrifugal forces), but the Earth climate and weather would change dramatically within about 100 hours (mind you that the day==year), the day side heating and drying up and the night side freezing. If, on the other hand, the angular momentum is absorbed only at certain points, for example if some cosmic giant stops rotation with its finger, then all other structures would need to decelerate from the rotation, likely destroying most human constructions, causing massive flooding of the continents, crumbling of mountains, huge earthquakes, instant death to most non-microbic life forms. 

Even though I'm a professional astronomer (but not an expert on this field), I don't have a good answer. AFAIK, this question is still open. Actually, the fact that most planets in the Solar system rotate in the same sense as they orbit the Sun is an important constraint on possible planet formation scenarios (of which still several are presently discussed by scientists). For example, the idea that planets form out of dust collected at the centre of vortices in the proto-planetary disc can be almost ruled out, because retrograde vortices are much more stable and long-lived than prograde ones (Jupiter's red spot is a retrograde vortex), and hence planets should be retrograde, but aren't. 

It indeed appears the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and The Milky Way (MW) are en route to a collision. This will lead to a merger of the two galaxies forming an elliptical galaxy. The flattened disc structure of M31 and MW comes about because their gas dissipated energy but conserved momentum: a disc is the minimum energy state at given angular momentum. The gas in the disc then forms stars, which are more or less on the same orbit as the gas, i.e. circling the respective galaxies. A disc galaxy is dynamically cold, i.e. the speed of the mean motion of the star around the galaxy is much larger than their random motions. The merger destroys all these structures and replaces them with a much smoother and dynamically hot structure, when the density is roughly constant on (concentric) triaxial ellipsoids. There are several types of stellar orbits in such galaxies, but most important are the so-called box orbits, when the stars oscillate in a large box-like volume and have no preferred mean direction of motion. In the early phases, the elliptical galaxy will have some temporary structures (so-called shells), which are remnants of the merger process itself. The gas in M31 and MW will most likely be swept into the inner parts of the elliptical where it may form many new stars and contribute to the feeding of the AGN which emerges from the coalescence of the two supermassive black holes of M31 and MW. But energy fed back from the new formed stars via supernovae and stellar winds as well as from the AGN will drive the remaining gas out of the elliptical galaxy, leaving it "red and dead", i.e. without star formation and young blue stars. The merger of M31 and MW will hardly increase the already neglible rate of stellar collisions. Given the vastness of galaxies compared to the size of stars, such collisions are extremely unlikely. The only places where such collisions occur are the very dense cores of globular clusters. 

I don't think your attempt to distinguish the micro and macro scales is helpful. As it stands, the physical theories (quantum mechanics etc) are deterministic, that is the initial conditions pre-determine all future: there is no random element ("Gott w√ºrfelt nicht" -- god does not throw dice -- to quote Albert Einstein). Of course, this is debatable, but certainly beyond astronomy, better (meta)phyiscs and philosophy ... 

You may want to use perturbation theory. This only gives you an approximate answer, but allows for analytic treatment. Your force is considered a small perturbation to the Keplerian elliptic orbit and the resulting equations of motion are expanded in powers of $K$. For linear perturbation theory, only terms linear in $K$ are retained. This simply leads to integrating the perturbation along the unperturbed original orbit. Writing your force as a vector, the perturbing acceleration is $$ \boldsymbol{a} = K \frac{GM}{r^2c^2}v_r\boldsymbol{v}_t $$ with $v_r=\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}$ the radial velocity ($\boldsymbol{v}\equiv\dot{\boldsymbol{r}}$) and $\boldsymbol{v}_t=(\boldsymbol{v}-\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}(\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}))$ the rotational component of velocity (the full velocity minus the radial velocity). Here, the dot above denotes a time derivative and a hat the unit vector. Now, it depends what you mean with 'effect'. Let's work out the changes of the orbital semimajor axis $a$, eccentricity $e$, and direction of periapse. 

The number density of stars is not well constrained, because it hinges critically on the behaviour of the stellar mass function at low stellar masses. Low-mass stars tend to be dim and hard to detect. What is reasonably well constrained, instead is the mass density of stars, where low-mass objects contribute little, even if their number is large. 

The subject of galaxy (including the Milky Way) formation is still hotly debated by the professionals. But is is quite clear that the process is a hierchical mess. The standard picture involves cold dark matter (CDM), which first forms structures (sheets, filaments, haloes) into which the baryons fall. Since the baryons can dissipate and cool by radiation), some of them accumulate at the centre of the haloes, where they form a rotating disc (since angular momentum cannot be radiated away). Stars form (roughly) whenever the gas density is high enough. This all is happening on various scales. First, smaller galaxies form, but mergers quickly lead to the formation of larger ones. Most stars in galactic discs actually formed in situ (rather than in a progenitor galaxies). Accreted stars (from merged progenitors) are typically not in a disc-structure, but form a spheroidal structure (stellar halo, bulge). A major merger (mass ratios 1:3 to 1:1) destroys the stellar discs and leads to the formation of an elliptial galaxy. The Milky Way galaxy cannot have had a merger with mass ratio 1:1 to 1:4 in the last few Gyr, and even a 1:10 merger should have left some detectable traces. 

To summarise the results below: semi-major axis and eccentricity are unchanged, but the direction of periapse rotates in the plane of the orbit at rate $$ \omega=\Omega \frac{v_c^2}{c^2} \frac{K}{1-e^2}, $$ where $\Omega$ is the orbital frequency and $v_c=\Omega a$ with $a$ the semi-major axis. Note that (for $K=3$) this agrees with the general relativity (GR) precession rate at order $v_c^2/c^2$ (given by Einstein 1915 but not mentioned in the original question). 

Edited. No if you talk about the escape velocity form Earth. This follows simply from the fact that energy $E$ is conserved. An object that is not gravitationally bound to Earth has $E>0$ and hence $v>v_{\mathrm{esc}}$ when hitting ground. 

You are missing one last ingredient: the correlation between the virial radius $r_{\mathrm{vir}}$ and the virial mass $M_{\mathrm{vir}}$. The idea is that the orbital time scale of a particle orbiting in the halo becomes roughly equal to the age of the universe at $r_{\mathrm{vir}}$. This implies a relation between the (mean) density of the halo and of the universe: $$ \bar{\rho}_{\mathrm{vir}} \equiv \frac{3M_{\mathrm{vir}}}{4\pi r_{\mathrm{vir}}^3} = \Delta \rho_{\mathrm{crit}}(z) $$ where $\bar{\rho}_{\mathrm{vir}}$ is the halo's mean density interior of $r_{\mathrm{vir}}$, $\rho_{\mathrm{crit}}$ is the critical density of the universe (as function of redshift $z$), and $\Delta$ a parameter that depends on the cosmology. Often $\Delta=200$ is used and the corresponding quantities labeled $r_{200}$ and $M_{200}$ instead. See also this Wikipedia page. So the way to construct a halo is as follows: 

Edited to respond to the comment, effectively rephrasing the question to consider a "slighly different" early state of the universe. Well, it pretty much depends what you mean by "slighly different". If the laws of physics are completely untouched, I would think that the universe would evolve statistically in exactly the same way. This is because all the statistical characteristics of the early universe (the power spectra and correlation functions of the various energy densities, for example) come about from the laws of physics (via natural instabilities, for example) rather than the initial state. However 1, our understanding of the laws of physics and their deeper origin is still very limited. This means that it is not clear whether a slightly different early state with exactly the same laws of physics is actually at all possible. This is particularly true for the nature of gravity and the vacuum, neither of which is currently properly understood at the quantum mechanical level. However 2, one has to bear in mind that we don't know whether the universe is finite or infinite. If it is infinite (and the observational evidence from our finite patch of the universe indicates that it has a flat or open, but not closed, spacetime), we cannot really make any sensible conclusions from our finite observable patch. This includes this answer! Except, of course, if we invoke an extended version of the cosmological principle, something like "an infinite universe must be the same everywhere", which is (meta)physical non-sense. This is the main reason why I don't like cosmology too much. 

It has too low a temperature. To not emit much in the visible part of the spectrum, a star has to be very cold indeed, at most a few 100K, when radiation is mostly in the infrared (which is still detectable). By definition, a star is an object that undergoes (or has undergone) hydrogen burning (H$\to$He fusion). This sets an lower mass limit of 0.08M$_\odot$. All objects of that mass (or more) ever formed in the universe are still much hotter than 100K. However, in the very distant future, some 'dead' stars (without remaining fusion energy source) will cool down to such temperatures, this includes white dwarves. It has too high a gravitational redshift for any light to appear in the visible. In fact, the so-called stellar-mass black holes (remnants of supernova explosions of massive stars) may in fact be such objects: strange stars denser than a nucleus (consisting of a quark-gluon plasma as dense as a neutron) but with such a small size and high mass that any radiation emitted from their surface is redshifted by a factor 1000 or larger. 

The energy density of the universe is quite well known. Most seems in the form of what is called "dark energy", which accelerates cosmic expansion. Next comes dark matter, accounting for some 20%, then baryonic matter, about 4%. Electromagnetic radiation (photons) contributes so little that I forgot how much. Most of the energy density in photons is in the cosmic background (CMB), the remnant of an ealier epoch when electromagnetic radiation dominated the energy budget of the universe. The cosmic expansion makes the energy density of photons decay faster than that of matter, because (in addition to the decrease in spatial density $\propto(1+z)^{-3}$) photons also get red-shifted, adding another factor $(1+z)^{-1}$.
