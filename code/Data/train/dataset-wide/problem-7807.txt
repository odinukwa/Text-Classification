The quickest proof I know of uses the accessible adjoint functor theorem. The curious thing is this: from a theoretical perspective, the cocompleteness hypothesis is more useful; yet in practice it is the completeness hypothesis that is easiest to verify. For instance, it is easy to see that many categories of essentially algebraic structures (e.g. groups, rings, categories) are accessible and complete, but the construction of colimits in these categories is often non-obvious. The only instance of the "if" direction I am aware of is a corollary of Giraud's theorem: any category satisfying Giraud's axioms is necessarily complete. This is obvious if we assume Giraud's theorem, because any such category is a topos of sheaves on a Grothendieck site, hence, a reflective subcategory of a complete category. 

Let $f : X \to Y$ be an open (and continuous) map of locales. Suppose the relative diagonal $\Delta_f : X \to X \times_Y X$ is an open embedding of locales. Does it follow that $f : X \to Y$ is a local homeomorphism? The answer is yes if I replace "locale" with "topological space". Indeed, by the definition of the product topology, there must exist an open covering of the image of $\Delta_f$ by "rectangles", i.e. open subspaces of the form $U \times_Y V \subseteq X \times_Y X$ for open subspaces $U \subseteq X$, $V \subseteq X$; but if $U \times_Y V \subseteq \operatorname{im} \Delta_f$, then the restriction $f : U \cap V \to Y$ must be injective, hence is an open embedding (because $f : X \to Y$ is an open map). But $\{ U \cap V : U \times_Y V \subseteq \operatorname{im} \Delta_f \}$ is an open covering of $X$, so we are done. In fact, everything in the above argument goes through for locales, except for the very last step where I assert that we have an open covering of $X$. There, I have used the fact that a collection of open subspaces is an open covering if and only if every point is contained in some member of the collection. So the argument would work if $X$ is a spatial locale. But can we avoid the use of points? 

When considering the heat kernel of a Schr\"odinger operator $$- \Delta + V(x) $$ where $\Delta$ is the standard Laplacian on ${\mathbb R}^n$ and $V$ is a nonnegative potential function that has nice behavior at infinity (proper, grows polynomially), one usually sees the term $$e^{-tV(x)}$$ and the asymptotic expansion of the Gaussian integral $$\int_{{\mathbb R}^n} e^{-t V(x)},\ t \to 0.$$ If $V(x)$ is homogeneous, namely, $V(rx) = r^\alpha V(x)$, the above integral is just a power of $t$ (in particular, no log term). However it seems that in more general case when $V(x)$ is not homogeneous, for example, when $$V(x, y) = V_1(x, y) + V_2(x, y)$$ which is the sum of two homogeneous polynomials of different degrees, the expansion may have $\log t$ terms. Question: What is the general form of the asymptotic expansion of this integral as $ t\to 0$? 

Consider a family of complex curves ${\mathcal C} \to {\mathbb D}$ such that the central fibre is a nodal Riemann surface while other fibres are smooth Riemann surfaces. We choose a family of conformal metrics by restricting a smooth metric on ${\mathcal C}$. So near the nodes (with local models $xy = t$, where $t$ is the coordinate on ${\mathbb D}$), the metric is roughly the restriction of the Euclidean metric on ${\mathbb C}^2 = \{(x, y)\}$. Let $\Delta_t$ be the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the fibre over $t$. What is the behavior of the spectra of $\Delta_t$, or rather the few lowest positive eigenvalues of $\Delta_t$, as $t\to 0$? I (sort of) know in the case of a single separating nodes, the lowest positive eigenvalue of $\Delta_t$ converges to 0 in a rate comparable to $(\log |t|)^{-1}$, while other positive eigenvalues stay uniformly away from $0$. I want to know about the case that the node is non-separating, as well as the case of multiple nodes. The result I look for is not simply the convergence of spectra, but also the rate of convergence of the few lowest eigenvalues. More generally, is there any reference/results about the behavior of the Laplacian spectra of families of higher dimensional manifolds with normal crossing degenerations? 

Thus, recalling Łoś's theorem, any two elementarily equivalent structures in $\Sigma\textbf{-Str}$ are connected by a cospan. 

By Lambek's theorem, any initial algebra for an endofunctor $F$ has the property that its structural morphism $\alpha : F A \to A$ is an isomorphism. So we seek an object $A$ such that $P P A = \Omega^{\Omega^A} \cong A$. However: Proposition. If a topos $\mathcal{E}$ contains an object $A$ such that $P A$ is a subquotient of $A$, then $\mathcal{E}$ is a degenerate topos (i.e. $0 \cong 1$). Proof. This is Proposition D4.1.8 in [Johnstone, Sketches of an elephant]. 　◻ So, suppose that $A \cong P P A$. Clearly, $A$ is a subobject of $P A$ via the singleton operator $\lbrace \cdot \rbrace_A : A \to P A$, so this isomorphism exhibits $P P A$ as a subquotient of $P A$, which by the proposition implies our topos is degenerate. That said, $\Omega$ is a bit special. The general form of Cantor's theorem for function-sets is known to fail in toposes; for example, in the effective topos, if $N$ is the natural numbers object, then $N^N$ is a subquotient of $N$. There are also cartesian closed categories (hence toposes via Yoneda) containing an object $A$ such that $A \cong A^A$ (and hence $A \cong A^{A^A}$). 

There are many GIT quotients, since to define one requires a choice of $G$-line bundle, so a pair of naturals for each $F$. There's an obvious democratic choice -- $(a,b) = (1,1)$ for every $F$ -- but I think this will in general lead to properly semistable reduction, which is a little icky. (Instead of just taking the quotient of an open set, further identifications are required.) I will be lazy and put all the burden on the first three: $(2n,2n), (4n-1,3n), (n,1)$, and $(1,1)$ for each of the rest. I think the effect on the stable set is the following. The first two flags must be in general position w.r.t. one another, so we can use $PGL(3)$ to move them to the base and anti-base flag, respectively. This leaves over the diagonal matrices $T$ acting on $F^{n-2}$. The line in the third flag shouldn't be in the $xy$, $xz$, or $yz$ coordinate planes. That defines an open set in $F$ whose $T$-quotient turns out to be ${\mathbb P}^1$. So the final quotient space is ${\mathbb P}^1 \times F^{n-3}$. For more about these undemocratic GIT quotients, see the purple book [Guillemin-Lerman-Sternberg]. 

Suppose $F: {\mathbb C}^N \to {\mathbb C}$ defines a singularity at the origin (for simplicity one can assume that $F$ is a quasi-homogeneous polynomial). Suppose it is nondegenerate, i.e., $dF(z) = 0$ only at $z = 0$. Let $D_i \subset {\mathbb C}^N$ be the divisor defined by $\partial_i F$. My question is: is there a natural condition on $F$ to guarantee the following (or can we prove the following under the nondegenerate condition): For any $I \subsetneq \{1, \ldots, N\}$, $F$ doesn't vanish identically on (any component of) the intersection $$\bigcap_{i \in I} D_i.$$ 

Let $(M, \omega)$ be a symplectic manifold and $G$ be a compact Lie group. Suppose we have a Hamiltonian $G$-action on $M$, with moment map $\mu: M \to {\mathfrak g}^*$. We assume that the moment map is proper in case $M$ is noncompact. The question is: for any loop $\gamma: S^1 \to G$, and a point $x\in M$, is the loop $t\mapsto \gamma(t) x$ a contractible loop in $M$? So we assume neither $G$ or $M$ is simply-connected. We may assume that $\gamma$ is actually a 1-parameter subgroup of $G$, generated by a vector $\xi \in {\mathfrak g}$. In the case $M$ is compact, we restrict the moment map to this subgroup, which is equivalent to a real valued function $\mu_\gamma$. Then the gradient flow of this function should push the loop to a critical point, which is a fixed point of this subgroup. Hence this shows that the loop is contractible. Now if $M$ is noncompact, the gradient flow doesn't necessarily converge to a critical point (could escape to $\pm \infty$). Note that the real valued function $\mu_\gamma$ is not necessarily proper. So the above method fails. But I still guess that the loop should be contractible. Is there any proof or counter-example? Or should we add some conditions to guarantee this? 

In principle $\textrm{End}(X)$ could have two elements, $\textrm{id}_X$ and $0_X$. If it has only one element, then $\textrm{id}_X = 0_X$, so for all $f : X \to Y$, $f = f \circ \textrm{id}_X = f \circ 0_X = 0$. Similarly, for all $g : Z \to X$, $g = \textrm{id}_X \circ g = 0_X \circ g = 0$. Thus $X$ is both initial and terminal. This argument works in any category with a reasonable notion of zero morphism, not just preadditive categories. 

They are not equivalent even for complete lattices. For example, consider the lattice (actually, frame) $\textrm{Ouv}(X)$ of open sets of a topological space $X$. Given a continuous map $f : X \to Y$, taking inverse images gives a lattice homomorphism $f^{-1} : \textrm{Ouv}(Y) \to \textrm{Ouv}(X)$, and this is guaranteed to preserve infinite joins. However, infinite meets need not be preserved: for example, consider the "identity" map $f : \mathbb{R}^\textrm{disc} \to \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}^\textrm{disc}$ is $\mathbb{R}$ considered as a discrete topological space. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is Hausdorff, $\lbrace 0 \rbrace$ is the intersection of all the open neighbourhoods of $0$, and hence the meet in $\textrm{Ouv}(\mathbb{R})$ of all open neighbourhoods of $0$ is $\emptyset$. But the meet in $\textrm{Ouv}(\mathbb{R}^\textrm{disc}) = \mathscr{P}(\mathbb{R})$ of all open neighbourhoods of $0$ is $\lbrace 0 \rbrace$, so $f^{-1} : \textrm{Ouv}(\mathbb{R}) \to \textrm{Ouv}(\mathbb{R}^\textrm{disc})$ indeed fails to preserve infinite meets. 

Consider the Lagrange multiplier $$F(x, t, c) = f(x) + t( g(x) - c).$$ If $g$ satisfies your condition and $f$ is generic, then one can show that $$S:= \{ (x, t, c)\ |\ \nabla f(x) + t \nabla g(x) = 0,\ g(x) - c = 0 \}$$ is a 1-dimensional manifold. Its intersection with $c= a$ or $c= b$ are the critical point set of $f|_{g=a}$ and $f|_{g= b}$. This implies that (if $a$ and $b$ are generic), then the mod 2 counting of the two critical point sets are equal. In your counter-example, the $g = 0$ slice corresponds to a so-called "birth-death" which is not generic. 

In a symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$, $J$-holomorphic curves are special minimal surfaces if $J$ is compatible with the symplectic structure and the metric is induced by $\omega$ and $J$. Minimal surfaces satisfy the monotonicity property, i.e., if $S$ is a minimal surface passing through $p$, then for $r$ small enough, the area of $S \cap B_r(p)$ is at least $c r^2$, for some constant $c>0$ depending on the metric. This property can be used to prove, for example, the removal of singularity of $J$-holomorphic curves, and also, the diameter of a $J$-holomorphic curve cannot be arbitrarily large if the energy (area) is bounded. In Gromov-Witten theory, one also consider perturbations of the Cauchy-Riemann equation, as $\overline\partial u = \nu(u)$, for other reasons. If just to prove removal of singularity, we can view the graph of a solution as a holomorphic curve in $\Sigma \times M$ (if domain is $\Sigma$), with respect to some almost complex structure on $\Sigma \times M$ depending on $\nu$. But my question is, if $\nu$ is sufficiently small (in $C^0$, for example), can we prove a monotonicity result for a solution $u$ to $\overline\partial u = \nu(u)$ (but not its graph)? I suspect this holds because for $\nu$ small, a solution should be close to a real $J$-holomorphic curve. 

Zhelobenko has books on the subject from 1970, 1983, 1994, 2004. I'm pretty sure it's the 1970 that I saw the most concrete branching laws in. The special cases you're interested in are really easy, by the way, in that the branching laws are "multiplicity-free". For example, the $SU(2)$ irrep of dimension $n+1$ breaks into the $U(1)$ irreps with weights $n,n-2,n-4,\ldots,-n$, each only once. 

"Yoga" and "yoke" (as in of oxen) are derived from the same Indo-European root, meaning a linkage. Of course "linkage", and "relation", and "connection", and "join", all have mathematical meanings already, so one must go further afield to talk about two mathematical concepts being yoked to one another. When I have seen the word used by mathematicians (esp. Bott), it is usually in exactly this way -- the yoga of X and Y, not of X. (As such I must disagree with the comment `of course it has nothing to do with any proper meaning of the word "yoga".') 

We know that a mixed Hodge structure on a complex vector space $H$ with an integral lattice $H_{\mathbb Z}$ consists of the weight filtration and the Hodge filtration. For an isolated hypersurface singularity represented by a function germ $f: ({\mathbb C}^n, 0) \to ({\mathbb C}, 0)$, we have the vanishing cohomology bundle $${\mathscr H}^* = \bigcup_{t \in {\mathbb D}^*} H^{n-1}(V_t; {\mathbb C}) \to {\mathbb D}^*.$$ Here $V_t = f^{-1}(t)$. A mixed Hodge structure can be defined on the fibres of ${\mathscr H}^*$. Let $\{{\mathscr F}^p\}_{p=0}^n$ be the Hodge filtration. The integral lattice is spanned by the parallel integral cocycles with respect to the Gauss-Manin connection. A simple case is that when $f$ is a quasi-homogeneous polynomial. Suppose $d_1,\ldots, d_n, D$ are integers such that $$f( t^{d_1} z_1, \ldots, t^{d_n} z_n) = t^D f(z_1, \ldots, z_n).$$ Denote $\nu_i = d_i / D$. Then for the holomorphic $n$-form $\omega = z_1^{k_1}\cdots z_n^{k_n} dz_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dz_n$, we have the so-called ``geometric sections'' of the cohomology bundle, whose value at $t$ is the residue form $$\big[\frac{\omega}{df}\big]|_{V_t}.$$ This section belongs to ${\mathscr F}^p$ if and only if the charge of $\omega$, given by $l = \sum_{i=1}^n (k_i+1) \nu_i$, is less than or equal to $n-p$. (One can refer to the book ``Singularity I'' of Arnold etc.) Here is the question: for quasi-homogeneous singularity, what is the complex conjugation of a geometric section (which can be given explicitly)? In the paper "${\mathcal N}=2$ Landau-Ginzburg vs. Calabi-Yau $\sigma$-models: non-perturbative aspects" by S. Cecotti, there is a physics description of this complex conjugation on page 1766 which I don't quite understand (especially the term of ``spectral flow''). Is there any mathematical literature which contains such discussion? 

Let $G$ be a complex reductive Lie group, $B$ a Borel subgroup, with which to define "dominant weight". Let $\lambda$ be an integral weight, not necessarily dominant, but nonetheless giving a one-dimensional $B$-rep $\mathbb C_\lambda$. Then we can define the Verma module $U{\mathfrak g} \otimes_{U\mathfrak b} \mathbb C_\lambda$, which has compatible actions of $\mathfrak g$ and $B$ (it's a "$(\mathfrak g,B)$-module"), and a unique irreducible quotient $V_\lambda$, again a $(\mathfrak g,B)$-module. If $\lambda$ is dominant, then $V_\lambda$ is actually a (finite-dimensional) $G$-irrep, so we know how to compute its weight multiplicities in manifestly positive ways, e.g. counting Littelmann paths. For $\lambda$ not dominant, $V_\lambda$ is infinite-dimensional, but its weight multiplicities are still finite (since they're bounded by those of the Verma module). 

This is only about the "big question". The symmetric $n\times n$ matrices appear naturally as the big cell on the Lagrangian Grassmannian. Any projectively normal embedding (e.g. first include into the ordinary Grassmannian, then Pl\"ucker embed) of any $G/P$ is defined by degree $1$ and $2$ equations, a result one can find in the book [Brion-Kumar] for example. Here, that result will give you a bunch of quadratic relations between the minors of size $n$. 

Let $E\to B$ be a fibre bundle. The Leray-Hirsch theorem states under suitable assumptions, the cohomology of $E$ is an $H^*(B)$-module generated by suitable cohomology classes in $E$. Is there any analogous results for the homology of $E$? Any reference? 

Is there any example of GIT quotients of linear actions on a Euclidean space ${\mathbb C}^n$ that satisfy the following conditions? 

I think the recent work by Huagui Duan and Yiming Long $URL$ showed the existence of at least two closed geodesics. 

Suppose $X$ is a topological manifold and $Y \subset X$ is a locally flat submanifold. We know that $Y$ doesn't necessarily have a tubular neighborhood. My definition of a tubular neighborhood of $Y$ is a neighborhood $U$ with a map $\pi: U \to Y$ which is identity on $Y$ and $\pi: U \to Y$ is a disk bundle over $Y$. The locally flatness implies, however, every point $p\in Y$ has a neighborhood in $Y$ which has a tubular neighborhood. So "having a tubular neighborhood" is a property which cannot be simply glued from local to global. However, I wonder if the following is true. Suppose $Y$ has an open cover $\{Y_i\}$ and each $Y_i$ has a tubular neighborhood $\pi_i: U_i \to Y_i$. Suppose we require that $\pi_i$ agree on overlaps, i.e., $\pi_i(U_i \cap U_j) = \pi_j(U_i \cap U_j), \forall i,j$ Can this condition imply the existence of a tubular neighborhood of $Y$? Or, what should be the correct and natural condition to gurantee the gluing from local to global?
