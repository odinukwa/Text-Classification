M. A. Lukomskaya's proof of van der Waerden's theorem on arithmetic progressions is a remarkable application of the Schubfachprinzip and induction. 

We say that the (base ten) prime number $p=a_{n}a_{n-1}a_{n-2}\cdots a_{1}a_{0}$ is right-truncatable if all of the following numbers are prime: \begin{eqnarray*}a_{n},\\a_{n}a_{n-1},\\ a_{n}a_{n-1}a_{n-2},\\ \vdots\\ a_{n}a_{n-1}a_{n-2} \cdots a_{1}.\end{eqnarray*} According to user David W. Wilson of the OEIS, there exist only $83$ right-truncatable prime numbers: Mr. D. W. Wilson also claims that the largest such prime is $73 \, 939 \, 133$. Since the first of these two claims provides a clear-cut answer to a problem which I had come up with some time ago (before I even knew these primes were called right-truncatable; in point of fact, I had christened 'em as totally prime (go figure!)), I would like to know if you know of (or can supply) a non-computer-assisted straightforward proof of the finiteness of the set of right-truncatable prime numbers... It may be mentioned that, in order to test those two assertions of Mr. D. W. Wilson, I wrote a Mathematica program that determines whether or not a given prime number is right-truncatable and had it look for primes of that type in the interval $[10^{8}, 10^{9})$:

It has to be noted that in practice univalent and schlicht are not perfect synonyms. For instance, on Function theory of one complex variable by Greene and Krantz, we can read this (my emphasis): 

I've read in a number of places that, building on previous work of T. Nagell, W. Ljunggren proved in 1 that the Diophantine equation $$\frac{x^{n}-1}{x-1} = y^{2}$$ doesn't admit solutions in integers $x>1, y>1, n>2$, except when $n=4, x=7$ and $n=5, x=3$. Since neither I have been able to spot a copy of Ljunggren's paper online (and even if I had made every effort to acquire an electronic copy of it, it all would have been to no avail because I don't read Norwegian) nor I have access to Ribenboim's edition of the Collected Papers of these authors, would anybody here be so kind as to explain in some detail how it was that Ljunggren proved this notable result? Unfortunately, Nagell doesn't say much about Ljunggren's demonstration in his review of 1... Please, let me thank you in advance for your learned replies! References [1] W. Ljunggren, Some theorems on indeterminate equations of the form $\frac{x^{n}-1}{x-1} = y^{q}$ (In Norwegian). Norsk. Mat. Tidsskr. 25 (1943), pp. 17--20. 

The main (and only) theorem in the said paper by T. Salát and S. Znám is the following one: For any $a>0,$ let us denote the sum $\sum_{p \leq x} p^{a}$ with $S_{a}(x)$. Then, we have that $$\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{S_{a}(x) \cdot\log x}{x^{1+a}} = \frac{1}{1+a}.$$ Their proof depends on the Prime Number Theorem. In case you want to take a look at the paper, you can find it here: $URL$ Last but not least, note that the late P. S. Bruckman may have had a different proof of this result: $URL$ 

In point of fact, it was W. Ljunggren who proved in his 1942 paper "En egenskap ved de midtre binomialkoeffisienter" (Norsk. Mat. Tidsskrift 24 (1942), 18-22) that $$p^{3n+\varepsilon} \mid F_{p}$$ where $\varepsilon=0$ if $p=2$, $\varepsilon = 1$ if $p=3$, and $\varepsilon =2$ if $p \geq 5$. You can find the following sketch of Ljunggren's proof in pages 563-564 of the second volume of The Collected Papers of Wilhelm Ljunggren: 

Did any of you guys ever read those lines by Roland Schmidt (?) where he talked about the terseness of articles in Group Theory in the days prior to the conclusion of the classification of the finite simple groups? The complete story might have appeared in the Notices of the AMS or a similar publication or in an online recollection of group-theoretical anecdotes; I think that I read it 14 or 15 years ago. All I can recall is that, at some point of his write-up, R. Schmidt (?) brought up that famed Group Theory Year in UC (1960-1961) and a hilarious exploit by J. H. Conway and David Wales from the epoch. I really hope that somebody out there has read it recently and can tell me where I can find it again. Thanks. Added (Nov 8/2010) The said Conway incident went something like this: "one day he (Professor Freese, as you can read in the first reply to the thread) found Conway and Wales working with some relations and generators. Conway and Wales said they wanted to see if it was a group what they had there. Professor Freese could not help but ask How could it not be?, to which, they immediately replied It could be infinite!" Added (Nov 19/2010) I'm sure that in that elusive note one could also find the following story: "A typical journal page(?) in those days would look something like this Theorem. All groups are finite. Proof. Deny." I also remember that I didn't really get the joke at the time, but that's another story... Does anybody here remember reading something like this some time ago? C'mon fellas! I know I could not have been the only one in here to catch it back in the day. 

I would like to mention a handful of examples that may be considered passé nowadays, but were prominent at some point in time. 

For what it is worth, I reproduce below the relevant paragraphs in Chowla's aforementioned paper. The number of solutions of the equation $$\epsilon - \epsilon^{\prime} =1 \qquad \qquad \qquad(1)$$ where $\epsilon$ and $\epsilon^{\prime}$ are units of a fixed algebraic number field $R(\theta)$ is finite. Proof. Let $n$ be the degree of the field $R(\theta)$. With the usual notation we write $n=r_{1}+2r_{2}$, $r=r_{1}+r_{2}-1$ (see e.g. the Chelsea reprint of Landau's Algebraische Zahlen) and (in accordance with the Dirichlet-Minkowski theorem) $$\epsilon = \rho\eta_{1}^{a_{1}} \cdots \eta_{r}^{a_{r}}, \quad \epsilon^{\prime} = \rho^{\prime} \eta_{1}^{a_{1}^{\prime}} \cdots \eta_{r}^{a_{r}^{\prime}}$$ where $\eta_{1}, \ldots, \eta_{r}$ is a system of fundamental units of $R(\theta)$ and $\rho, \rho^{\prime}$ are certain roots of unity belonging to $R(\theta)$. Write for $m\in\{1,\ldots, r\}$ $$a_{m} = q_{m}(2n+1)+t_{m}, \quad a_{m}^{\prime} = q_{m}^{\prime}(2n+1)+t_{m}^{\prime}$$ where the $q$'s and $t$'s are rational integers and $0\leq t_{m}, t_{m}^{\prime} \leq 2n$. Then $(1)$ becomes $$\rho \, \eta_{t_{1}}\cdots \eta_{r}^{t_{r}} \alpha^{2n+1}-\rho^{\prime} \, \eta_{1}^{t_{1}^{\prime}} \cdots \eta_{r}^{t_{r}^{\prime}} \beta^{2n+1}=1$$ where $\alpha, \beta$ are integers (in fact, units) of $R(\theta)$. By a well-known extension of the Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem (see, for example, vol. 2 of LeVeque's "Topics in number theory", pp. 150-154) the equation $$\lambda \alpha^{2n+1} - \mu\beta^{2n+1} = 1$$ where $\lambda, \mu$ are fixed integers of $R(\theta)$ and $\alpha, \beta$ are the unknowns (also integers of $R(\theta)$) has only a finite numbers of solutions. Hence our assertion regarding $(1)$. [Note. $\rho$ and $\rho^{\prime}$ can assume only a finite number of values.]
