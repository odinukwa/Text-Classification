A website ( $URL$ ) says that the $abc$ conjecture implies that there are only finitely many solutions to the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ with $\gcd(x,y,z)=1$ and $n\ge 4$. This one I have proven. Lang's Algebra (p. 196) says that the $abc$ conjecture implies that for all $n$ sufficiently large, there are no solutions to the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ with $x,y,z\ne 0$. This one I have not proven (is it true?). What are the strongest known assertions about Fermat's Last Theorem that follows from the $abc$ conjecture, and how are they proven? I searched the web but people tend to just say vague things like "implies asymptotic version of FLT" and such. 

Definition. An $m\times n$ matrix is said to be a partial Hadamard matrix (let's say PHM) if its entries are chosen from $\lbrace -1, 1 \rbrace$ such that the dot product of each pair of row vectors is $0$. Details. This of course relates to the famous Hadamard conjecture which looks at $m=n$, but I am interested in the weaker $m<n$ case. Specifically, I am wondering about how many distinct $m\times n$ PHM exist given some, say $2$, of the row vectors, up to row permutation - as well as their construction. Questions. What are some good resources on results known about PHM? Are there iconic papers in the field?

We make a random geometric graph $X(n;r)$ as follows. Choose $n$ points uniformly, independently, in the unit square $[0,1]^2$, for vertices, and then connect a pair of vertices $\{ p,q \}$ by an edge if $d(p,q) < r$. For the purposes of this question, we set $r = c / \sqrt{n}$, where $c>0$ is small. It is known (see for example Mathew Penrose's book Random Geometric Graphs) that as $n \to \infty$, with probability approaching one, there are no connected components on more than $O( \log n)$ vertices. That is, as long as $c$ is sufficiently small, we are in the sub-critical regime in the sense of continuum percolation. What I'd like to know is a good upper bound for the number of vertices in the longest induced cycle in $X(n;r)$. By the above we know that, with high probability, there are no induced cycles on more than $O( \log n)$ vertices, but this seems like a fairly coarse bound and I would like to know if it possible to improve this to something like $O( \sqrt{ \log n} )$. (I know that it is not possible to get much smaller than $O( \sqrt{ \log n} )$; with high probability, there are induced cycles that are about this long.) [Penrose's book covers in great detail: subgraph counts, induced subgraph counts etc., but in the case when the size of the subgraph is fixed, so this is a different sort of problem.] 

Theorem: In this paper of Frei and Levesque, they correct the proof of a result of Halter-Koch and Stender: Define the real pure algebraic number field $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{Q}(\omega_n)$ for $\omega_n=\sqrt[n]{D^n\pm d}>0$ (the $\pm$ sign is fixed), where $d,D,n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $d|D^n$ and $D^n\pm d$ is not a $k^{\text{th}}$-power positive integer for $k|n$. Let $\epsilon_{n,k}=\frac{(\omega_n-D)^k}{\omega_n^k-D^k}$. Then the set $\{\epsilon_{n,k}: k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}, k|n\}$ is an independent system of units in $\mathbb{K}$. Background: I am looking specifically at computing units of algebraic number fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[p]{t})$ for odd primes $p$ (any infinite family in $t\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, with $p$ fixed). Unfortunately, the above result gives only one unit $\frac{(\omega_p-D)^p}{\omega_p^p-D^p}$. Question: Are there results on obtaining at least one other independent (non-torsion) unit? Note: For irreducible $x^p-t$ there is one real root $\sqrt[p]{t}$ and $p-1$ non-real complex roots $\zeta_p^i \sqrt[p]{t}$ for $i=1,\ldots,p-1$ and $\zeta_p=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{p}}$. Then by Dirichlet's Unit Theorem, the unit rank of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[p]{t})$ is $1+\frac{p-1}{2}-1=\frac{p-1}{2}$. Thus I am especially interested in $p=5$ where there can be at most two independent units. 

Given the vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$, endowed with the standard inner (dot) product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle:\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, the problem of almost-orthogonal sets asks, for each $\epsilon> 0$, for the construction (or at the very least, bounds on the cardinality) of a maximal subset $S$ of $U_n$, the set of unit vectors of $\mathbb{R}^n$, such that $\forall x,y\in S: x\ne y\implies |\langle x,y\rangle|\le\epsilon$. For known results, see Matt Cheung's Major Qualifying Project monograph at this link. Question: What are known results, if we restrict ourselves to some subset of $U_n$? Specifically, I am interested in the subset $\lbrace\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\rbrace^n$ consisting of the vertices of the scaled-down unit cube inscribed inside the unit ball centered at $0$. 

Fáry's theorem says that every finite simple planar graph admits a planar embedding with straight line edges. For which $(k,d)$ is it true that every finite $k$-dimensional simplicial complex embeddable in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has an embedding which is linear on every face? It is true when $d \ge 2k+1$ by putting things in general position. I am especially interested to know if anything is known about the case $(k,d)=(2,3)$. I vaguely remember an old conjecture of Branko Grünbaum that every triangulation of the torus admitting a "straight" embedding in $\mathbb{R}^3$ but I don't know a reference (or whether this is still open). 

Paul Erdős was famous for offering money for solutions to math problems. My understanding is that those prizes are still being administered by Ron Graham, even though Erdős passed away several years ago. One of his most famous (and biggest money) problems is the following: 

Lovasz's topological lower bounds on chromatic number were extended by Babson and Kozlov -- they have a series of articles, all available on the arXiv. A nice place to start is "Complexes of Graph Homomorphisms." There are also lower bounds on chromatic number coming from statistical physics -- see Brightwell and Winkler's "Graph homomorphisms and long range action." All that said, it seems that one has to be a bit lucky for these methods to be applicable. See for example, "Neighborhood complex of a random graph," where it shown that topological lower bounds are very far from chromatic number for almost all graphs. 

Let us consider the equation $a^n+b^n=c^n$ for positive integers $a,b,c$ and $n\ge 2$. The $n=2$ case has a well-known and beautiful parametrization known as Pythagorean triples. Fermat's Last Theorem gives us that there are no solutions for $n\ge 3$. It can be observed from the literature that Diophantine equations involving a sum of individual variables to some like power, i.e. $a_1^n+\cdots+a_k^n=b_1^n+\cdots+b_m^n$, are considered to be among the most "attractive" of problems. Maybe with more controversy, it can be said that constructing (a family of) solutions is easier with a greater number of terms, thanks to the added flexibility. In this sense, Fermat's question of splitting a power into two same powers in the "tightest" question. This brings us to the next tightest equations, which add one more term: For which $n\ge 2$ do $a^n + b^n + c^n = d^n$ or $a^n + b^n = c^n + d^n$ (call them $(1)$ and $(2)$ respectively) have solutions in positive integers, what are some solutions, and can we find all of them? We are looking at non-trivial solutions, so in $(2)$, $a,b$ are distinct from $c,d$. Of course, families or full parametrizations represented by polynomials are the prettiest. I read somewhere that full ones exist for $n=2$ in each case, but a reference would be nice. Now $n\ge 3$ is a murky area, as far as I can tell. One famous result is Elkies' counterexamples to Euler's quartic conjecture, so $(1)$ has infinitely many solutions for $n=4$. The Mathworld pages on 3rd powers and 4th powers say that families of solutions to $(1)$ are known for $n=3$, as well as for $(2)$ for $n=3,4$. At this point, for larger $n$, there seem to be no known solutions to either equations; correct me otherwise please. So my question is: What are references to results on larger $n$ for these two equations? Has it been proven that no integer solutions exist for some, probably large, $n$? Maybe even all sufficiently large $n$? 

Suppose $C$ is a smoothly bounded convex body (*) in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and $p$ is a point on the boundary of $C$. Let $r>0$ and let $B(r)$ denote the ball of radius $r$ centered at $p$. 

Following up on Joseph's comment: Branko Grünbaum and others have pointed out that besides the 13 or 14, there are also two infinite families of polyhedra meeting the definition of Archimedean, although generally not considered to be Archimedean. Why prisms and antiprisms are excluded from the list has never been clear to me. In any case, this is not just a historical curiosity --- in any attempt you make to classify them, you should run into these two infinite families. If you use a modern definition, i.e. vertex-transitive, then you will also get 13 others. And a little group theory can help in the classification. If you use a more classical definition, i.e. "locally vertex-regular," you will indeed find a 14th. 

As has already been pointed out, this is the chromatic number $\chi$. (For example, the assertion that all planar graphs have $ \chi \le 4$ is the famous "Four color theorem.") You say your graph has maximum degree $d$. Then in all cases $\chi \le d+1$, and Brooks' theorem gives that in fact $\chi \le d$ as long as $G$ is not a complete graph or an odd cycle. 

Nearly two months after I asked the above question, I have come across a paper where Noga Alon has given an explicit result in Problems and results in Extremal Combinatorics, Part I in section 9, On ranks of perturbations of identity matrices. He says Lemma 9.1. Let $A = (a_{ij})$ be an $n \times n$ real, symmetric matrix with $a_{ii} = 1$ for all $i$ and $|a_{ij}|\le\epsilon$ for all $i\ne j$. If the rank of $A$ is $d$, then $d\ge \frac{n}{1+(n-1)\epsilon^2}$. In particular, if $\epsilon\le \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ then $d\ge\frac{n}{2}$. His proof is rather pretty. I apply the lemma to the question at hand as follows. Application. Suppose $S$ is an $m\times n$ matrix with row vectors $(s_1,\ldots, s_m)$, an $m$-element subset of $\lbrace\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\rbrace^n$ such that $\forall s_i,s_j\in S: i\ne j\implies |\langle s_i,s_j\rangle|\le\epsilon$. Let $A=(a_{ij})$ be its Gram matrix, which is symmetric $m\times m$ with $a_{ii} = \langle s_i,s_i\rangle = 1$ for all $i$ and $|a_{ij}|=|\langle s_i, s_j \rangle|\le\epsilon$ for all $i\ne j$, and rank $d$. Note that the rank of $S$ also $d$. By the lemma, since $n\ge d$, we get $\boxed{n\ge \frac{m}{1+(m-1)\epsilon^2}}$. Assuming $\epsilon\le \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, some manipulation also yields $\boxed{m\le \frac{n(1-\epsilon^2)}{1-n\epsilon^2}}$. Bill Johnson's reference to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma led me to its Wikipedia page, which had the paper as a reference. 

It might be possible to prove that such graphs are perfect without first observing that they are Berge and applying the SPG Theorem, but I suspect this would be hard. It has been noted that the property of being Berge can be completely encoded in the "$P_4$-structure" (the $4$-uniform hypergraph of all induced paths of length $4$). You can find necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be Berge, in terms of its $P_4$-structure here: $URL$ This is part of a larger collection of open problems on perfect graphs: $URL$ 

Motivation: Erdos-Renyi random graphs $G(n,p)$ must have average vertex degree greater than, before they become connected and have nice expansion properties, etc. But this is because they still have isolated vertices. Here we don't have the problem of isolated vertices. (I think I can show that these graphs are a.a.s. connected.) I am aware of the large literature on random $d$-regular graphs, but I thought this might be an alternative model if one does not care about regularity. I am especially wondering about spectral properties of these graphs. 

Take a random configuration of $n$ non-overlapping discs of radius $r$ in the unit square $[0,1]^2$. (You could think of this as taking $n$ points uniform randomly in $[r,1-r]^2$ and then restricting attention to the case that every pair of points $\{ x,y \}$ satisfies $d(x,y) \ge 2r$.) From the point of view of statistical mechanics, the interesting case is when $r^2 n \to C$ for some constant $C > 0 $ as $n \to \infty$, and various kinds of phase transitions have been studied experimentally, but little seems known mathematically. What I am wondering about is whether anyone has studied the following kind of percolation. Set $\lambda >1$ to be a fixed parameter to measure proximity. Define a graph by considering the centers of the $n$ discs to be the vertices, and connecting a pair $\{ x,y \}$ by an edge whenever $d(x,y) < 2 \lambda$.
