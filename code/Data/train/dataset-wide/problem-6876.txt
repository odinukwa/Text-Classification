There are too many questions in your post, and I advise to edit out most of them, especially those that are not answerable (like "is the system just" etc). For just the first question the answer is No, you don't have the same tax rate on income from labor and from capital. Let $\pi$ be profits before tax, $\tau_{\pi}$ the tax rate on profits, $\tau_d$ that tax rate on dividends. Then capital owners will receive (as a percentage of profits) $$(1-\tau_d)(1-\tau_{\pi}) = 1-\tau_d-\tau_{\pi}+\tau_d\tau_{\pi}$$ since the dividend tax is applied to profits after tax. So the total tax rate on capital is $$\tau_c = \tau_d+\tau_{\pi}-\tau_d\tau_{\pi}$$ In your case $\tau_d\tau_{\pi} = 0.10\times 0.15 = 0.015$ So $\tau_c = 0.235$ while tax on labor income is $0.25$. This, in general, is not considered a negligible difference. 

We have first to be clear about what meaning do we give to the word "default". The other answer gave it a temporary meaning ("missing a payment deadline"). In such a case, any direct economic effect is bound to be small (expecially if the delay is short). But there may be indirect economic consequences through the effect on economic expectations. Now let's give to the word "default" a heavy meaning: "non-payment ever of principal and interest", then there will be various direct and indirect effects: The debt market loses Supply, reducing loan opportunities for other debtors. Creditors become more conservative and stringent towards prospective debtors, in view of the loss... in general the debt market suffers -and with it any beneficial economic activity that may need debt financing. Creditors lose current income (the interest), and also become less wealthy. So their financial health worsens which affects directly their level of current engagement in economic activity, and also, their plunging into new economic activity, and so, the future. If the end-creditors are states, then their Government Budget suffers which may indeed lead also to higher taxation. Consider now the following "economic fantasy" twist: Assume that a debtor state announces: "We cannot say when we will be able to start repaying the principal amount of the debt, but we will duly and fully pay the interest accrued in the meantime".... Is there a "bill to be footed" here? It would be very interesting to see what the consequences of such a situation would be. Unfortunately, in Social Sciences, there are all shorts of very interesting experiments that we cannot really execute, so we can only theorize about them, and hope for a "natural experiment" to emerge... 

I am not sure how the contradiction method of proof should work here. Here is my take: Ad absurdum, assume that $x^*$ solves the utility maximization problem, and that we have $y \in \mathbb{R^l_{++}}$ such that $u(y) \geq u(x^*)$, and that that $p \cdot y < w$. So $y$ is feasible, and since $u()$ represents a (rational and continuous) preference relation, $u(y) \geq u(x^*) \implies y \succeq x^*$. Moreover, there is some budget left. Since $x^*$ is not equal to the zero vector, at least one of the elements in the bundles must be a good (not all of them can be bads), say the first one, $y_1$. Define the bundle $y'$ to be equal to $y$ bar $y_1$ and set the quantity $y_1'>y_1$ such that $p \cdot y' = w$. So $y'$ is feasible, and $y'> y \implies y' \succeq y$ since $y_1$ is a good (but we do not assume that local non-satiation holds, and this is why the preference relation is weak. $y_1$ being a good only guarantees that increasing its quantity does not diminish utility). So also $y' \succeq x^*$. Since by assumption $x^*$ solves the utility maximization problem, it has to be the case that $u(y') \leq u(x^*) \leq u(y)$. So, under the ad absurdum assumption, we have that $$ y' > y, \;\;\;\; u(y') \leq u(y) \tag{1}$$ Note that this relation that we ended up with, does not involve anymore anything related to the utility maximization problem and/or the budget constraint. It is a conclusion describing a property of $u()$ as a function, under the ad absurdum assumption. Note also that $y'$ is not unique -we can form many such bundles, and if we accept that other elements of the bundles are also goods and not bads, we can spread the remaining available budget to increase more than one element... Concluding the proof by showing that $(1)$ (and how it can be further extended) contradicts the premise that $u()$ has no local maxima is now easy. 

Your calculation has two typos a) you type two times the minus sign related to $f'$ and b) you write $(1+\delta)$ instead of $(1-\delta)$. If we correct for these we have $$u_{c}(c_{t},m_{t}) + \beta V_{\omega}(\omega_{t+1})\left[\frac{f'(\omega_{t}-c_{t}-m_{t}-b_{t})}{1+n}(-1)+\frac{1-\delta}{1+n}(-1)\right]$$ Taking out the minus sign and $1/(1+n)$, and compacting $f'(\omega_{t}-c_{t}-m_{t}-b_{t})=f_k(k_t)$ we have $$u_{c}(c_{t},m_{t}) - \frac {\beta}{1+n}V_{\omega}(\omega_{t+1})\left[f_k(k_t)+1-\delta\right]$$ which is the expression in the book. As regards the definition of output per worker: Given the clarification in the comments, aggregate output during period $t$ is $$Y_t = F(K_{t-1}, N_{t})$$ while $N_t = N_{t-1}(1+n)$. I guess constant returns to scale are assumed so per capita magnitudes are $$y_t = \frac{Y_t}{N_t} = F\left (\frac{K_{t-1}}{N_t}, \frac{N_{t}}{N_t}\right ) = F\left (\frac{K_{t-1}}{N_{t-1}(1+n)}, 1\right )$$ Now, consider the notational/conceptual problem here: we will tend "automatically" to write $K_{t-1}/N_{t-1} \equiv k_{t-1}$ due of the same index, but $K_{t-1}/N_{t-1}$ is economically meaningless because $K_{t-1}$ is not combined in production with $N_{t-1}$. This ratio describes "capital used in period $t$ per worker in period $t-1$". Anyway, if we clearly declare in building the model that we define $k_{t-1}$ in this way, then we end up with $$y_t = f\left(\frac {k_{t-1}}{1+n}\right)$$ and the budget constraint for period $t$ is correct while the one for period $t+1$ is not. How this affects the first-order condition with respect to consumption? (Notice that with these notational coventions, "capital per worker during period $t$" is $k_{t-1}/(1+n)$ -I have argued elsewhere why it is preferable for modellers to adopt the meaning that $k_{t-1}$ represents the value at the beginning of period $t-1$ and so is used in the production of period $t-1$). 

I guess you mean some edition of Ljungqvist, L., & Sargent, T. J. Recursive macroeconomic theory. MIT press. This is a very valuable book, but not for acquiring a concrete theoretical knowledge. Copying from its marketing-speak, 

Don't commit the cardinal mistake of equating preferences with choices. In the context of Expected Utility Theory, the fact that a risk-averse agent ($RA$) would choose $N$ over $M$ implies that $$E[u_{RA}(N)] > E[u_{RA}(M)]$$ The fact that a risk-neutral agent ($RN$) could choose $M$ over $N$ implies that $$E[u_{RN}(N)] < E[u_{RN}(M)] \implies E(N) < E(M)$$ A risk-lover is a person that could choose $M$ over $N$ even if $E(N) > E(M)$. So here that the opposite inequality holds, it is certain that it will also choose $M$ over $N$, given also the fact that there appears to be no other lotteries to choose from. But never say that the risk-neutral and the risk-lover have "same preferences". They don't -it just happens, given the available lotteries, that they choose the same lottery, even though they have different preferences. 

In their example just before the quote they show that $$\frac {[u(x) - u(y)]}{[u(y) - u(z)]} = \frac {1-\alpha}{\alpha}$$ where $\alpha$ is a probability that reflects the preferences that we are modelling. Quote again (p. 107) 

because, I guess, it creates currently "unacceptable" levels of negative externalities, and we know better than to think that through the pricing of the externalities we will be able to reverse the damages, and all swell. From this point of view, we don't care about distribution between suppliers: it should be equivalent to us whether the existing companies change their capital base, or whether there appear new entrants with new cleaner technologies which will somehow drive out of business (or marginalize) the incumbents. Let's describe the situation with very simple relations: Prior to any pricing of externalities, the typical incumbent (symbolized by $h$ where needed) has a after-income-tax profit function at current time $t$ $$(1-\tau)\pi_{t} = (1-\tau)\big[p_{t}q_{t} -c(q_t)\big] \tag{1}$$ The OP writes that installed capital is "fully written off by now". This means that there is no income tax offset from accounting depreciation, Of course there is a capital base here that operates, needs maintenance, some marginal replacements etc. These costs are captured in the operational cost function (i.e. we assume 100% depreciation rate for them). Assume now that we declare that anyone who continues to use the existing technology will pay an enviromental tax that is linear in quantity, $T_t = \xi\cdot q_t$ (naturally, this tax does not decrease taxable profits). Alternatively, he will be exempt from the tax if he completely renews his capital base, with new technology. The incumbent now has to compare two discounted cash-flow scenaria: $$\text {OLD} : NPV_{Oh} = \sum_{t=0}^{T} \left(\frac 1{1+r}\right)^t\big[(1-\tau)\pi_{ht}-\xi q_t\big]$$ and $$\text {NEW} : NPV_{Nh} = -C_R-I_N+\sum_{t=0}^{T} \left(\frac 1{1+r}\right)^t\big[(1-\tau)\pi_{ht}+\tau\cdot\frac 1T(C_R+I_N)\big] \tag{2}$$ where $C_R$ measure the (capitalized) side-costs of renewal (disposal, disruption of operations etc), while $I_N$ is the needed new investment (including perhaps adjustment costs). $r$ is some average measure of opportunity cost (and not interest rate). We have assumed that the operational costs of the new technology are the same. $\tau\cdot\delta(C_R+I_N)$ is the tax benefit from accounting depreciation of the new investments. $\delta$ is the depreciation rate. We use the Fixed percentage method of Accounting depreciation here. What the situation is for a prospective new entrant? It is easily seen that if he attempts to install Old Technology, he will make less profits than the incumbent (due to the necessary investments). So $NPV_{Oe} < NPV_{Oh}$. If he opts for the new technology for production capacity equal to that of the incumbent described above, we have $$\text {NEW} : NPV_{Ne} = -I_N+\sum_{t=0}^{T} \left(\frac 1{1+r}\right)^t\big[(1-\tau)\pi_{ht}+\tau\cdot\frac 1TI_N\big] \tag{3}$$ It is easy again to determine that, here, $NPV_{Ne} > NPV_{Nh}$ i.e. the entrant is in a better position from the point of view of investment evaluation, because he does not have to bear the side-costs of renewal The tax benefits of the incumbent for depreciation of $C_R$ do not offset in NPV terms $C_R$. Why do we care whether $NPV_{Ne} > NPV_{Nh}$? Because we want, conditional on both using the new technology, the new entrant to have an advantage over the incumbent in terms of financial strength, in order to have the resources to sustain a possible war from the part of the latter. If we want that everybody has an incentive to use the new technology, then we must have $$NPV_{Oe} < NPV_{Oh}< NPV_{Nh} < NPV_{Ne}$$ The first and third inequalities already we already have. For the middle one, which will connect the chain, we need to set the tax rate accordingly: $$NPV_{Oh}- NPV_{Nh} <0 \Rightarrow -\sum_{t=0}^{T} \left(\frac 1{1+r}\right)^t\xi q_t +C_R+I_N-\sum_{t=0}^{T} \left(\frac 1{1+r}\right)^t\tau\cdot\frac 1T(C_R+I_N)\big]$$ Using an average period quantity produced $\bar q$, and denoting $$R\equiv \frac {(1+r)^{T+1}-1}{r(1+r)}$$ this becomes $$NPV_{Oh}- NPV_{Nh} <0 \Rightarrow - R \cdot\xi\cdot \bar q +C_R+I_N-R\cdot\tau\cdot\frac 1T(C_R+I_N) < 0 $$ $$\Rightarrow \left(1-R\cdot\tau\cdot\frac 1T\right)(C_R+I_N) < R \cdot\xi\cdot \bar q $$ $$\Rightarrow \xi > \left(R^{-1}-\frac {\tau}T\right)\frac {C_R+I_N}{\bar q} \tag{4}$$ Inequality $(4)$ determines the minimum level of the environmental tax rate from the point of view of financial incentives in order for the incumbents to switch technologies. So, does it matter whether this minimum level is consistent with the tax rate that would reflect the proper pricing of negative externalities, since by setting it above it, we expect that the old technology will be wiped out? It doesn't seem so. This is important: it says that we can see the environmental tax rate as a threat that it won't be necessary to realize. From a "political point of view", is this minimum tax rate feasible in view of possible reaction, lobbying etc? This is a different chapter. Note that it does not affect our goal what will happen in an oligopolistic framework, where possibly, the market demand cannot sustain both the incumbent and the new entrant (i.e. double output): whatever happens, the one, the other, or both, the appropriately set tax rate ensures that we will see only new technology in operation. 

MULTINOMIAL LOGIT In a multinomial logit where we examine the choice to buy "this or this or this" (mutually exclusive choices $k=1,..,K$), we end up with (after the usual normalization) $$\hat E(q^d_{ik} \mid p_{ik}, \mathbf x_{ik}) = \frac {\exp\{\hat \alpha p_{ik} + \mathbf x'_{ik}\hat \beta\}}{1+\sum_{k=2}^K\exp\{\hat \alpha p_{ik} + \mathbf x'_{ik}\hat \beta\}}$$ Then we can obtain $K$ demands (each conditional on the rest) using (say, for good $1$) $$\hat Q^{(1)}_d(p_1) = \frac {n\cdot \exp\{\hat \alpha p_1 + \mathbf {\bar x}_{1}'\hat \beta\}}{1 + \sum_{k=2}^{K}\exp\{\hat \alpha \bar p_{k} + \mathbf {\bar x}_k'\hat \beta\}} $$ Note that here we have to average the prices of the other goods also. 

Market value cannot be negative. Book value can, but then again, these are outlier companies that can reasonably be taken out of the sample in order to estimate the "normal"/ "average" structure. 

God forbid, if you excuse my language. As many other scientific disciplines, Economics uses Mathematics, it most certainly is not Mathematics, and it can never become Mathematics. Mathematics may get inspiration from the real world, but it then defines and works with its concepts without regard to whether they remain connected to the source of inspiration. Economics on the other hand, is obliged to define its concepts in a way that preserves some degree of relevance to the real-world aspects which it attempts to study. And since the "real-world" that preoccupies Economics is the social world, full of uncertainties and laws nobody has discovered yet, it follows that Economics can never achieve "excruciating precision", and remain relevant. So what? Economics is not Mathematics, we already said that. Economics is harder than Mathematics, exactly because it cannot impose such precision to itself and remain useful. But it abides by the scientific method, and so instead of being confined to verbal arguments, it attempts to "mathematize" them (use symbolic language, that is) so that they can be more transparent and focused as regards their conclusions and their internal consistency. It would be so much more easy to produce verbal treatises, that first would require a round of semantics analysis, and then, if this round eventually concludes somewhere, to discuss the argument per se. But once we put it in symbolic language, we clear the fog and we let our premises (and so our limitations and imperfections) shine for anyone interested to see. That's what I call scientific integrity in Social Sciences, and this is why I consider Economics to be the Avant-garde of Social Sciences. 

To be fair to the author, the quote says that "it is unlikely", not that "it is impossible". But apart from that, the link between "same estimates" and "linearity of the conditional relations" is misleading. Example: assume that for an unconditional distribution, the median $m$ is a linear function of the mean $\mu$ : $$m = c\mu$$ (this is for example approximately the case for the Gamma distribution). Assume that we model the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ as a Gamma distribution, with $$E(Y\mid X) = bX$$ It then follows that the conditional median will be $$m(Y\mid X) = c(bX) = (cb)X = \delta X, \delta \neq b$$ Here, the conditional median can be modeled as a linear function of the conditioning variables also, but we expect that the estimates we will obtain will be different.
