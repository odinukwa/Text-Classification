I strongly recommend the following book as for reference: Chung, Fan R. K. Spectral graph theory. CBMS Regional Conference Series in Mathematics, 92. Published for the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences, Washington, DC; by the American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 1997. I was learning basic notion and analysis on graphs as well. This book contains almost every topics related to analysis. 

I think the answer to this question is ``yes" if in the last inequality you assume that $g\in L^1$ and $m\in L^1$. There are two simple ways to see this: 

I have the following question. For our research purpose, we have introduced the following concept: Let $f:X\to Y$ be a continuous, disrecte and open mapping between two locally compact metric spaces. For each $x\in X$, denote by $U(x,r)$ the component of $x$ in $f^{-1}(B(f(x),r))$. Fix $x_0\in X$ and $y_0=f(x_0)$, $r>0$. We say a map $g:B(y_0,r)\to X$ is a local left homotopy inverse for $f$ at $x_0$ if $g\circ f|_{U(x_0,r)}$ is homotopic to the indentity map on $U(x_0,r)$, via a homotopy $H_t$ such that $x_0\notin H_t(\partial U(x_0,r))$ for all $t\in [0,1]$. Similarly, $g$ is a local right homotopy inverse for $f$ if $f\circ g$ is homotopic to the identity on $B(y_0,r)$ via a homotopy $H_t$ with $y_0\notin H_t(\partial B(y_0,r))$ for all $t\in [0,1]$. If $g$ is a left and right local homotopy inverse, we simply call it a local homotopy inverse of $f$. Let $\mathcal{B}_f^*$ denote the left homotopy branch set, which means the set of points in $X$ at which $f$ has no left homotopy inverse. Let $\mathcal{B}_f$ denote the branch point of $f$, that is the points at which $f$ is not a local homeomorphism. It is clear that $\mathcal{B}_f^*\subset \mathcal{B}_f$. Here comes my question: 

For $k$ alg. closed you can phrase the statement as $\Omega_{A/k}$ is loc. free iff Spec$(A)$ is smooth. 'Spec$(A)$ smooth iff $\Omega_{A/k}$ is loc free' should be true without requiring $k = \bar{k}$. But if $k \ne \bar{k}$ then the condition on the derivatives is not the same as smoothness. For example if $C$ is a curve defined over $\mathbb{R}$ with smooth $\mathbb{R}$ points but with singular $\mathbb{C}$ points then the condition on $f$ and its derivatives will be satisfied but there will be a maximal ideal of Spec$(A)$ with residue field $\mathbb{C}$ where $\Omega_{A/k}$ will have the wrong rank. You can try this with $y^2 = (x^2+1)^2$ and the maximal ideal $(y, x^2 + 1)$ in $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$. But if $A(k) = A(\bar{k})$ then the original statement should hold over $k$. 

I would add Oliver Debarre's: Complex Tori and Abelian Varieties. It does not cover the theory of Abelian functions in as great of depth as many of the other sources cited. But, compared to the others, it does begin at an elementary level, it is concrete and short. In total the book is about 100 pages and the chapters most relevant here are 4,5,6 which take up about 40 pages. For learning this subject I think this book is a good supplement to reading a more advanced source because Debarre is likely to spend more time on aspects other sources might skim over. Another book perhaps worth mentioning is Complex Abelian Varieties by Lange and Birkenhake. It is much longer and covers much more material. It is assumes some algebraic geometry background but I would say no more than Mumford's book. It also deals only with complex theory and it is fairly concrete. 

I am currently reading the book by Professor Jost, "Riemannian geometry and geometric analysis", the last chapter on harmonic maps. It talks mainly about existence and regularity of the theory of harmonic mappings between Riemannian manifolds (with certain constraint on the target manifolds, e.g., non-positive curvature). I wonder whether there is a book with a comprehensive treatment on the theory of harmonic mappings between Riemannian manifolds and with applications in other problems. Another related question that I would like to know is how many different methods that we have to prove the existence of harmonic mappings from a Riemannian manifolds to a Riemannian manifolds with non-positive curvature. How about the regularity part? The motivation behind the question is that I would like to study the theory of harmonic mappings between singular metric spaces (e.g. the survey book of Professor Lin Fanghua). I know the earlier works of Korevaar-Schoen and Jost around the 1990s, considering such problems in general metric space setting. Any comments and suggestions are warmly welcome! 

In one dimensional case, $f\in W^{1,1}$ if and only if $f$ is absolutely continuous. Both the first inequality and the second inequality implies $f$ is absolutely continuous, essentially just by definition using absolutely continuity of integral (when you fix a division of the interval, the right-hand side of the second inequality can be seen as a discrete approximation of the integral over the interval). The second convenient way is to use the “differential quotient", namely for $h\in (0,T)$, consider \begin{equation*} \Delta_hf(t)=\frac{|f(t+h)-f(t)|}{h}, \quad t\in [0,T-h]. \end{equation*} Then the Sobolev space $W^{1‚1}$ can be characterized as $$W^{1,1}([0,T])=\Big\{f\in L^1:\sup_{0<h<T}\int_0^{T-h}\Delta_hf(t)dt<\infty\Big\}.$$ It is straightforward to verify this from the last inequality you have. 

Say I have an ind scheme $X = \cup_i X_i$ over a field $k$. I have its tangent bundle $\hom_k(k[\epsilon], X)$ which I can think of as ind scheme via $\cup_i \hom_k(k[\epsilon],X_i)$. The problem is even if $X$ is smooth it might be the case that most of the $X_i$ are not smooth. I believe this happens at least for polynomial loop groups $G[z^\pm]$. In this case the sheaf of differentials is not locally free. This seems to be an obstruction to constructing the canonical sheaf inductively. Additionally if each $X_i$ is infinite dimensional, which happens for the formal loop group, then it seems like top exterior power doesn't make much sense. And finally if you looked at say $\mathbb{P}^\infty := \cup_n \mathbb{P}^n$ then it also seems unclear what a canonical sheaf should be. If it were a line bundle it could be described as a line bundle $L_n$ on each $\mathbb{P}^n$ which are compatible under pull backs. But then each $L_n$ would have the same degree $d$. But the canonical line bundles $O(-n-1)$ have a different degree on each $\mathbb{P}^n$! So is there any sense in asking for something like a canonical sheaf or dualizing sheaf for smooth ind schemes? UPDATE: Brian Conrad shared the following with me: If $f:X \to Y$ is a map between finite type schemes over a field (or one can be much more general...) then for a relative dualizing complex $\omega_Y$ on $Y$ we have that $f^!(\omega_Y)$ is a relative dualizing complex on $X$ (for suitable functor $f^!$ at derived category level). In other words, one does have "compatibility" for relative dualizing complexes, but with respect to the appropriate "derived pullback" operation $f^!$. (One has to think about duality and "canonical sheaf" in a much broader sense than Serre duality over a field in order to define "relative dualizing object" in a derived category.) The upshot is that one has to work in derived categories (and so develop a suitable formalism of direct/inverse limits in derived categories) to make a good theory of duality on ind-schemes. 

I have recently learned the polar factorization theorem for vector-valued functions due to Brenier. Namely, given a probability space $(X,\mu)$ and a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with the normalized Lebesgue measure (i.e. $\mathcal{L}^n(\Omega)=1$). Then there is a "polar factorization'' for a function $u\colon X\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $u(x)=\nabla \phi(s(x))$ (with very less regularity), where $s\colon X\to \Omega$ is measure-preserving, and $\phi\colon \Omega\to \mathbb{R}$ is convex. Brenier, Yann, Polar factorization and monotone rearrangement of vector-valued functions, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 44 (1991), no. 4, 375-417. The proof I know uses the theory of optimal transportation, for instance can be found in An elementary proof of the polar factorization of vector-valued functions. (English summary) Arch. Rational Mech. Anal. 128 (1994), no. 4, 381-399. Since I am not very familiar with this field, I wonder whether there is some other known proof for this result. In particular, I am also interested in possible extensions of this result, say if we add more restrictions on $u$, can we conclude in the decomposition we have better regularity for $\phi$, say $\phi$ will be strictly convex, instead of convex? Similar for $s$. I am very grateful for possible comments and suggestions. 

Weyl Character formula and multiplicity formula for the weight spaces in a irreducible representation. 

This question is largely out of curiosity but also motivated by an attempt to understand vector bundles on elliptic curves better. I believe it is a theorem of Grauert that any holomorphic vector bundle on a non compact Riemann surface is trivial. In fact I think it holds with vector bundle replaced with principal $G$ bundle with $G$ any complex connected group. In particular line bundles on affine algebraic curves should be holomorphically trivial. The ideal $m = (x,y) \subset \mathbb{C}[x,y]/(y^2 - x^3 + x)$ determines a rank 1 locally free sheaf and hence a line bundle $L$. Any algebraic section of $L$ must vanish somewhere but there should be non vanishing holomorphic sections. Can one write down such a section? Presumably it may be hard to do so in terms of the algebraic coordinates $x,y$ but the curve is biholomophic to $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}^2 - \mathbb{Z}^2$ with the isomorphism given by the Weierstrass function and it's derivative and I would be happy with a section defined on $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}^2 - \mathbb{Z}^2$. 

I think usually the standard approximation arguments gives you the result $C^2(\Omega)\cap C^1(\bar{\Omega})$ and I did not quit see how to reduce to $C^2(\Omega)\cap C^0(\bar{\Omega})$. However, your second question is a good exercise for you to understand the properties of the Green's function. Roughly speaking, $\Delta G(x,y)=\delta_{x-y}$, by the properties of Dirac measure, you can solve the linear equation via (zero boundary case) $$u(x)=\int_\Omega u(y)\Delta G(x,y)dy=\int_\Omega \Delta u(y)G(x,y)dy.$$ When $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$, the above equation clearly tells you $u(x)\to0 $ as $x\in\partial\Omega$. All these facts I mentioned are rather standard and can be found for instance in nice book of Han, Qing; Lin, Fanghua Elliptic partial differential equations. Courant Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 1. New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York; American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 1997. x+144 pp. 

My question is the following: let $f:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a branched covering, namely $f$ is continuous, discrete (each fiber is a discrete subset of $\Omega$) and open (open sets get mapped onto open set), where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a domain. I wonder wether there is any "topological" concept defined on $\Omega$ that is invariant under the branched covering $f$. If we look at the case where $f:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a homeomorphism, then the linking number (from Knot theory) is a topological invariant for $f$ (Say in $\mathbb{R}^3$, I have a circle linked with circle with link number +1, then its image under a sense-preserving homeomorphism will still have linking number +1 and cannot be -1). I wonder whether there are analogous concept that is invariant for a branched covering instead of a homeomorphism. Motivation for this question: It is well-known due to Hencl and Maly that for a Sobolev homeomorphism $f:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}^3$, the Jacobian of $f$ cannot change sign a.e. in $\Omega$, namely either $J_f\geq 0$ a.e. in $\Omega$ or $J_f\leq 0$ a.e. in $\Omega$. The main tool in their proof is the linking number (of circles) that is invariant under homeomorphism. I want to prove the same result but replace the homeomorphism assumption with the condition that $f$ is a branched covering. Thus I am interested in a kind of invariant for branched coverings. Any suggestions and comments are welcome. 

I recently stumbled upon a paper (NON CANCELLATION FOR SMOOTH CONTRACTIBLE AFFINE THREEFOLDS) about the cancellation problem: If $X$ is a variety over $\mathbb{C}$ of dimension $d$ such that $X \times \mathbb{A}^n \cong \mathbb{A}^{n+d}$ when is $X \cong \mathbb{A}^d$? Apparently when $d = 1,2$ the answer is always. The paper remarked that the case $d = 1$ is trivial, but I'm having trouble coming up with an argument. The paper does reference a paper (ON THE UNIQUENESS OF THE COEFFICIENT RING IN A POLYNOMIAL RING) which proves the more general cancellation problem -when does $X \times \mathbb{A}^n \cong Y \times \mathbb{A}^n$ imply $X \cong Y$- for curves (again the answer for curves is always). However I wonder if there is a simple argument for the less general question. I can see that $X \times \mathbb{A}^n \cong \mathbb{A}^{n+1}$ implies that $X$ should be irreducible, affine and smooth. Seems like if you could show genus$(X) = 0$ you would be done, but I'm kinda stuck here. Does someone have a simple argument for this? 

Throughout "curve" means smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field. Motivation and Background I read somewhere that Atiyah has classified vector bundles on elliptic curves. My understanding is that the story is roughly: every vector bundles breaks up as a direct some of indecomposable vector bundles. The indecomposable vector bundles are further divided by their degree and rank. The set $Ind(d,r)$ of isomorphism classes of indecomposable vector bundles of a fixed degree $d$ and rank $r$ has the structure of variety isomorphic to the Jacobian of the curve; namely the curve itself. In fact $Ind(d,r) \cong Ind(0, gcd(d,r) )$ so its enough to consider the degree $0$ vector bundles. Now for $V,V'$ vector bundles on any curve $C$ its true that $\deg V \otimes V' = \deg V\cdot rk(V') + \deg V'\cdot rk(V)$. So in the case of an elliptic curve the set $Ind(0,r)$ is a torsor for $Pic^0(C)$. Additionally, there is a unique isomorphism class $V_r \in Ind(0,r)$ characterized by the fact that $h^0(V_r) \ne 0$ (in fact $h^0(V_r)=1$). The Question Since curves of low genus are usually "simple enough" to easily describe explicitly, I would like to see how explicit I can be with a description of the $V_r$, or at least $V_2$. So my question is simply, given an explicit elliptic curve in $\mathbb{P}^2$, say $zy^2 - x(x-z)(x+z)$can you reasonably show how to construct $V_2$; i.e. give cocyles for it $\phi_{ij} \colon U_{ij} \to GL_2(k)$, or produce a graded module for it? Initial Thoughts $V_2$ should correspond to the unique nontrivial extension in $Ext^1(\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}) \cong H^1(\mathcal{O}) \cong k$.On a curve $C$, $0 \to \mathcal{O}_C \to K(C) \to K(C)/\mathcal{O}_C \to 0$ is a flasque resolution of the structure sheaf and an element in $H^1(\mathcal{O}_C)$ corresponds to a map $\alpha \colon \mathcal{O}_C \to K(C)/\mathcal{O}_C$. Then the desired extension should be the pullback of $0 \to \mathcal{O}_C \to K(C) \to K(C)/\mathcal{O}_C \to 0$ via $\alpha$. The trouble with this is that I can't seem to pin down what $\alpha$ is. I now that, via Serre duality, it corresponds to a global section of $H^0(\omega_C)$ which I can explicitly describe as a differential on the curve. Using the example I mentioned above, on the affine patch where $z \ne 0$, it is: $\frac{dx}{2y} = -\frac{dy}{3x^2-1}$ but I guess I don't understand Serre duality well enough to determine $\alpha$ from this. Also I'm not even sure if this will lead to a reasonable way of getting at the cocylces of $V_2$. And this is so close to "just using the definitions" I have to imagine there might be a better way to go about this... 

Usually in mathematics, if an object enjoys too many good properties, then there will be some kind of rigidity result for it. Conformal mappings are perfect in two dimension and they are solutions to the so-called Beltrami system, which is highly over-determined when n>3. Thus, it is very rigid. By a result of Liouville, conformal mappings are restrictions of Mobius transformations in dimenions higher than two. For a proof of this result, I recommend the excellent book by Iwaniec and Martin, Iwaniec, Tadeusz; Martin, Gaven Geometric function theory and non-linear analysis. Oxford Mathematical Monographs. The Clarendon Press, Oxford University Press, New York, 2001. 

I have a question on Riemannian geometry or CAT(k) geometry, which might be simple for experts. Suppose $M$ is a complete smooth Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded from above by $k>0$. Fix a ball $B\subset M$ with radius less than $\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{k}}$. Fix three points $P,Q,R\in B$. Denote by $PQ$ the unique geodesic that connects $P$ and $Q$ in $B$ and $QR$ the unique geodesic that connects $P$ and $R$. Let $Q_t\in PQ$ be the $t$-fractional point, that is, $d(p,Q_t)=td(p,Q)$ and $d(Q_t,Q)=(1-t)d(P,Q)$, and let $R_t\in PR$ be the $t$-fractional point as well. I wonder whether it is true that there exists a constant $c(k,t)>0$ such that $$d(Q_t,R_t)\le c(k,t)d(R,Q).$$ In case $k=0$, we know that we can choose $c(k,t)=t$. Any comments or references would be greatly appreciated.
