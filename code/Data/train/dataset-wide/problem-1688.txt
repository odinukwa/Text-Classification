But then, it doesn't really make sense to actually call it 'acceleration', does it? This explains (if your previous question was accurate in this phrasing) why Walter uses a more vague term of 'effects' when talking about the above ratio. Instead (once again using the intentional conflation between $r$,$\tau$ and their Newtonian counterparts as an approximation or analogy), it would probably be better to simply think of the Schwarzschild geometry as introducing a new term in the potential that is analogous to a quadrupole moment, which would also put a $\propto 1/r^3$ term into the potential, with the corresponding Newtonian equation being $$(u')^2 + u^2 = \frac{2}{h^2}\left(\frac{E}{m} - \Phi(u)\right)\text{.}$$ Both the effective potential and the first-order equation in $u$ provide a much more straightforward analogy between the Newtonian and Schwarzschild cases. This is actually pretty interesting: if one assumes that the Sun does indeed have a quadrupole moment, e.g., caused by solar oblateness, then one can easily account for the perihelion advance of Mercury. However, because this is simply an analogy, blaming Mercury's behavior on this would simultaneously mess up the behavior of other planets (since the new term depends on orbital angular momentum) and be even more inconsistent for orbits outside the equatorial plane (since actual oblateness should have the quadrupole term dependent on zenith angle, whereas GTR's is not). It is also possible to think of the Schwarzschild geometry itself as a scalar field, which we can similarly decompose into spherical harmonic components. Naturally, like most of the above, this peculiarity is specific to the niceness of the spherically symmetric vacuum. 

In cosmology, the Hubble parameter is sometimes taken to be unitless, by scaling to $100\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$. For example, we sometimes say that $h = 0.704$ when we mean that $H_0 = 70.4\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$. Thus, $100\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ is kind of a de facto standard of comparison. It might be a coincidence, but it's rather suspicious that if one ignores the contribution of radiation (which is justifiable, since it's negligible except in the very early universe) and pretends that $H_0 = 100\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, then the age of the universe when the matter and dark energy densities are equal would be $$\frac{2\ln(1+\sqrt{2})}{3\sqrt{1-\Omega_\text{M}}}\frac{1}{H_0}\bigg\vert_{\Omega_\text{M} = 0.2865} \approx 0.70H_0^{-1}\bigg\vert_{h = 1.0} \approx 6.8\,\mathrm{Ga}$$ I'm using the Ryden reference given in wiki for matter-dominated era above. Thus, I think someone did a guesstimate using a nice, round number for the Hubble parameter and rounded to $7$ billion years. The transition between matter-dominated and dark-energy-dominated is a somewhat arbitrary matter of convention. We could take it mean when matter and dark energy densities are equal, as above, but on the cosmological scale, pressure is three times as important as energy density (cf. Friedmann equations). Thus, we could take it instead as the time when the matter density was twice the dark energy density. This would be earlier than the $9.8\,\mathrm{Ga}$ given in the Ryden reference, but arguably more appropriate because the Friedmann equations would predict zero acceleration, i.e., it would be the transition between inward and outward acceleration. I haven't calculated when that would be, but this sort of conventional fuzziness is might be responsible for the discrepancy between the wiki's matter-dominated era and the dark-energy-dominated era pages. Although the latter claims $5\,\mathrm{Ga}$ instead, rather than $7\,\mathrm{Ga}$ (but it doesn't explain the source). 

In Schwarzschild coordinates, $$\mathrm{d}\tau^2 = \left(1-\frac{2m}{r}\right)\mathrm{d}t^2 - \left(1-\frac{2m}{r}\right)^{-1}\mathrm{d}r^2 - r^2\,\mathrm{d}\Omega^2\text{,}$$ the gravitational redshift $\sqrt{1-\frac{2m}{r}}$ describes the time dilation of a stationary observer at a given Schwarzschild radial coordinate $r$, compared to a stationary observer at infinity. You can check this easily: plug in $\mathrm{d}r = \mathrm{d}\Omega = 0$, the condition that neither the radial nor the angular coordinates are changing (i.e. stationary observer), and solve for $\mathrm{d}\tau/\mathrm{d}t$. The conclusion is that if you have the rocket power to hover arbitrarily close to the horizon, you will be able to see arbitrarily far into the history of the universe over your lifetime. However, that doesn't actually cover what happens to an observer that crosses the horizon. In that case, $\mathrm{d}r\not=0$, and the coefficient of $\mathrm{d}r^2$ above becomes undefined at the horizon: as in the other question, the Schwarzschild coordinate chart simply fails to cover the horizon and so is ill-suited for talking about situations cross the horizon. But that's a fault of the coordinate chart, not of spacetime. There are other coordinate charts that are better adapted to questions like that. For example, the two Eddington-Finkelstein charts are best suited for incoming and outgoing light rays, respectively, and the Gullstrand-Painlev√© chart is adapted to a freely falling observer starting from rest at infinity. 

Isolated black holes are indeed vacuum solutions to general relativity. Thus in particular, the mass and energy density is identically zero everywhere in spacetime. Because of some technical issues, this does not imply that black holes have no energy or mass; rather, it means that we can't directly think of them as an integral of mass or energy density. See also this question. 

In relativity, a light cone is not actually conceptually dependent on light or electromagnetism, though those things are related. It's a bit more abstract that that, and it exists regardless of whether or not anything is actually going on. Once you get a bit used to thinking about spacetime as one thing, and the sequence-of-snapshots is a reasonable analogy, you can ask: given an event (a location and a time), what events could it be affected by, and what events could it affect? Thus, we can define an $O$'s causal future as all events that a signal originating from $O$ could reach, and its causal past as all events that could from which a signal that reaches $O$ could originate. Because in there is a maximum speed any signal could propagate, the boundary of the causal future of any event looks like a cone in spacetime. That speed is indeed the speed of light (as well as that of any massless particle), which is why it's called a (future) light cone, and similarly for the past light cone. But that's incidental--relativity would work even if light was massive. In that case, we'd just have to call the invariant speed $c$ something else. Note that this means that light cone is defined in terms of all possible signals that could be sent, not just those that are actually sent. Therefore, no, it's not something that's 'emitted' by disturbances in the electromagnetic field or anything else. Some disturbances might travel along the light cone, but that's not what the light cone is about, and it exists regardless of whether there are such disturbances. 

Here are the results of some arbitrary cutoffs for the "core" based on $2010$ solar models calculated by Guenther et al: 

Light rays run diagonally. In blue is an example infalling trajectory, not necessarily freely falling. Note the two events where it crosses the horizon and where it reaches the singularity. Shown in red are inward light rays that intersect those events. Thus, the events that the infalling observer can see of the external universe consist of the region between those light rays and the horizon. The events occurring after that won't be seen because the the observer will have already reached the singularity by then. Now suppose the observer tries a different trajectory after crossing the horizon, accelerating outward as much as possible in order to see more of the future history of the external universe. This will only work up to a point: the best the observer can do is hug the outgoing light ray (diagonally from lower-left to upper-right) as much as possible... but since the observer is not actually allowed to go at the speed of light, seeing all of the future of history will be impossible. The best the observer can do is to meet the singularity a bit more on the right of the diagram. By the way, since the light ray worldlines have zero proper time, trying to do that will actually shorten the the observer's lifespan. If you're in a Schwarzschild black hole, you would live longer if you don't struggle to get out. The above is for an eternal, non-evaporating black hole, as that's what you're asking about here. (The 'antihorizon' is there because the full Schwarzschild spacetime is actually an eternal black hole and its mirror image, a white hole in a mirror 'anti-verse', which not shown on this diagram. That's unphysical, but not relevant to the situation we're considering here.) 

In the transition from a higher electron energy level to a lower one, say $m\mapsto n$, a hydrogen atom emits a photon of wavelength $\lambda$ satisfying $$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_\infty\left[\frac{1}{n^2}-\frac{1}{m^2}\right]\text{,}$$ where $R_\infty = 1.09737315685\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ is the Rydberg constant. For $n=1$, i.e. the destination energy level is the ground state, varying $m$ forms the Lyman series: $\text{Ly}_\alpha$ ($2\mapsto 1$), $\text{Ly}_\beta$ ($3\mapsto 1$), $\text{Ly}_\gamma$ ($4\mapsto 1$), etc. The $n=2$ destination energy level forms the Balmer series: $\text{Ba}_\alpha$ ($3\mapsto 2$), $\text{Ba}_\beta$ ($5\mapsto 2$), etc., which was actually the first series to be discovered, and is frequently labeled simply with hydrogen instead.
