I have seen this claim on the Wikipedia page for the Yang-Mills Millenium problem by Alexander Dynin. He is a mathematician working at the Department of Mathematics of Ohio State University and so, I think his should represent respectable work. The question is that I am a physicist and I have not the right knowledge to approach Dynin's work. Please, could you give me some hints and references about so I can make an idea by myself of these techniques? My aim is to get a comparison with the work currently pursued in the area of theoretical physics about this same problem. Thanks a lot beforehand. 

The proof of Mac Lane's coherence theorem is fairly ad hoc. However, higher dimensional rewriting provides some general methods to prove coherence-like theorems. Using this, it is very easy to prove the coherence of "semigroup categories". See for example "Coherence in monoidal track categories", by Y. Guiraud and P. Malbos. 

Let $\sigma$ be a permutation. If two positive braids represent $\sigma$ and are of minimal length among the braids representing $\sigma$, then they are equal. From what I could gather, this result is Theorem 9.2.5 in: Epstein, David, et al. Word processing in groups. AK Peters, Ltd., 1992. This book refers to a paper by Garside called "The Braid group and other groups", but I can't seem to find the result in Garside's paper. I was told that this result can be generalised, replacing the positive braids by elements of an Artin monoid, and the permutation group by the associated Coxeter group. Where can this result be found? I was told that this result appears in "Characters of Finite Coxeter Groups and Iwahori-Hecke Algebras", but I could not find it, probably because I am not familiar enough with the theory to recognise the result that I am looking for. 

There are two different views about the semiclassical limit in quantum mechanics, the first is based on a somewhat shaky ground due to the fact that the existence of the Feynman integral is not proved yet. On the other side, Wiener integral, its imaginary time counterpart does exist and one could pretend to work things out from this and then move to the Feynman integral. The other approach relies on substantial mathematical theorems due to Elliott Lieb and Barry Simon in the '70 and is essentially valid for many-body physics. These latter results make the limit $\hbar\rightarrow 0$ and $N\rightarrow\infty$ equivalent while the former is not really a physical limit due to the fact that Planck constant is never zero. Starting from Feynman path integral, the standard formulation applies to a mechanial problem described from a Lagrangian $L$, normally $L=\frac{\dot x^2}{2}-V(x)$ but one can extend this to more general cases, and then the postulate is that, given a path $x(t)$, this must contribute to the full quantum mechanical amplitude of a particle going from the point $x_a$ to $x_b$ with a term $e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}S}$ being $S=\int_{t_a}^{t_b}dtL(\dot x,x,t)$ the action. All the possible paths contribute and so, the full amplitude will be given by the formal writing $$ A(x_a,x_b)\sim\int[dx(t)]e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_a}^{t_b}dtL(\dot x,x,t)}. $$ Be warned that this integral is not proved to exist yet, but the Wiener counterpart, that can be obtained changing $t\rightarrow it$, exists and describes Brownian motion. Now, if you take the formal limit $\hbar\rightarrow 0$ to this integral you will immediately recognize the conditions to apply the stationary phase method to it. This implies that the functional must have an extremum and this can be obtained by pretending that $$ \delta S=\delta \int_{t_a}^{t_b}dtL(\dot x,x,t)=0 $$ that is, the paths that give the greatest contribution are the classical ones and one recover the classical limit as a variational principle as learned from standard textbooks. While this is a quite common approach, to extend what really happens to a macroscopic system that we can see to respect all the laws of classical mechanics, we have to turn our attention to the limit of a large number of particles $N\rightarrow\infty$. In this case one has more rigorous results. These are due to Lieb and Simon as already said above. They published two papers about Lieb E. H. and Simon B. 1973 Phys. Rev. Lett. 31, 681. Lieb E. H. and Simon B. 1977 Adv. in Math. 23, 22. In the first paper, their theorem 4 states Theorem: For $\lambda < Z$, let $E_N^0$ and $\rho_N^0(x)$ denote the ground-state energy and one-electron distribution function for N spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ electrons obeying the Pauli principle and interacting with $k$ nuclei as described above. Then (a) $N^{-\frac{7}{3}}E_N^0\rightarrow E_1$, as $N\rightarrow\infty$; (b) $N^{-2}\rho_N^0(N^{-\frac{1}{3}}x)\rightarrow\rho_1(x)$ as $N\rightarrow\infty$, where convergence in (b) means that for any domain $D\subset R^3$, the expected fraction of electrons in $N^{-\frac{1}{3}}D$ approaches $\int_D\rho_1 (x)d^3x$. Where $\rho_1(x)$ and $E_1$ refer to the Thomas-Fermi distribution and the corresponding energy. This theorem states that the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$ for a quantum system, under some mild conditions, is the Thomas-Fermi distribution. A system with this distribution is a classical system. The fact that a system with a Thomas-Fermi distribution is a classical one can be seen through the following two references: W. Thirring(Ed.), The Stability of Matter: From Atoms to Stars - Selecta of E. Lieb, Springer-Verlag (1997). L. Hörmander, Comm. Pure. Appl. Math. 32, 359 (1979). The second paper just gives the mathematical support to derive Thomas-Fermi approximation as the leading order of a classical expansion for $\hbar\rightarrow 0$ that I will not present here. 

I haven't checked, but I expect that one should be able to find suitable formulas for the degeneracies (and connections if $C$ and $D$ come equipped with connections) so as to make the join into a bifunctor. However one has to be careful: this bifunctor does not define a monoidal structure on cubical sets (even with connections): it is not associative. Anyway, if you start from the terminal cubical set $\top$, then $\top^{\wedge n}$ (warning: you have to choose a suitable bracketing for this to make sense: for example $(\top \wedge \top) \wedge \top$ and $\top \wedge (\top \wedge \top)$ are not isomorphic) is a good candidate for the image of $\Delta[n]$. I do not know however whether all the morphisms in $\Delta$ have an image between the $\top^{\wedge n}$. A word on the join of cubical sets: AFAIK it appears nowhere in the literature. It doesn't have very good properties on cubical sets. On cubical categories however it should be a monoidal product, and should correspond to the join of $\infty$-categories defined by Ara and Maltsiniotis in "Joint et tranches pour les $\infty$-catégories strictes" 

I am currently working on complex networks. I consider a matrix $\cal N$ with random entries $\delta_{ik}$. These entries are varying randomly in time and so I have a sequence of random matrices that determines a stochastic process. My question is quite simple: Does it exist a generalization of standard stochastic differential equations to random matrices like the case I am considering? Also relevant references are a good answer. Thanks beforehand. 

In order to iterate, you have to substitute the second equation into the first one. So, $$ n_{11}(x,z)=1+\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1)n_{11}(y_1,z). $$ This equation is generally the starting pointing for an iterative procedure, the main tool of perturbation techniques. E.g., you can choose for the first iterate $n_{11}(x,z)=1$ and you will get $$ n_{11}(x,z)=1+\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1) $$ $$ +\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1)\int_{-\infty}^{y_1}dy_2e^{-izy_2}u(y_2)\int_{-\infty}^{y_2}dy_3e^{izy_3}{\bar u}(y_3)+\ldots. $$ You can stop the procedure at any desired order to get an approximation to the solution of the integral equations. Then, you put this approximation to $n_{11}$ back into the equation for $n_{12}$ and you will get an approximate solution for it at the given order. 

Here $H$ is the maximal split torus of $G_2$, $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $K$ such that $\sigma^2\varphi=1$, $\varphi$ is the Frobenius, $U^1$ and $V^1$ are the subgroups of upper and lower unitriangular matrices stable under the exceptional automorphism of $G_2$ induced by $\sigma$ and the root length changing symmetry of the Dynkin diagram, the subgroup $G^1=\langle U^1, V^1\rangle$ and $H^1=H\cap G^1$. My question: is this still the case? 

By locally principal ring they mean a commutative ring such that its localization at any maximal ideal is a principal ideal ring. For euclidean ring $A$ this gives $K_1(\mathsf{C}_\ell,R)=0$. As a byproduct they also prove a stronger version of Suslin's theorem for $SL$ and a locally principal ring. They also have a version for Laurent polynomial rings and claim that by using stability theorems for $K_1$ as in M. Stein's papers one can prove the same results for classical simple algebraic groups of relative rank $\geqslant2$, but the latter has never been written in full details. 

This is only a partial answer but maybe it can lead you somewhere. We can define the join of two cubical sets as follows: If $C$ and $D$ are cubical sets, then $(C \wedge D)_n$ is the set $C_n \sqcup \bigsqcup_{n = i+j+1} (C_i \times D_j) \sqcup D_n$. For $x \in C_i$ and $y \in D_j$, the faces of the cell $x \wedge y \in (C \wedge D)_{i+j+1}$ are given by: 

There are two kinds of "coherence theorem". One of them states for example "bicategories are equivalent to 2-categories", the other kind are results that look like "every diagram of a certain form commute". As far as I know, rewriting has only ever be applied to the second kind of problem. The basic result for proving this kind of thing is Squier's homotopical Theorem, and its extension by Guiraud and Malbos: $URL$ 

I refer to this paper. There is a straightforward approach in this case. You can separate the refraction index in the following way $$ n^2=n_0^2+\xi $$ where $\xi$ is the random part. Then, the equation is $$ \nabla^2U+k^2n_0^2U=-\xi k^2U. $$ Now, turning to the paper I just cited, take the Green function to be ($d=3$ for the sake of simplicity) $$ G(|{\bf r}|) =\frac{e^{ikn_0|{\bf r}|}}{4\pi |{\bf r}|} $$ and the differential equation turns into an integral one $$ U({\bf r}) = U_0({\bf r}) - k^2\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U({\bf r'}). $$ One can iterate this equation and obtain the following solution series $$ U({\bf r}) = U_0({\bf r}) - k^2\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U_0({\bf r'})+k^4\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U_0({\bf r'})\times \int d^3x''G(|{\bf r'}-{\bf r''}|)\xi({\bf r''})U_0({\bf r''})+\ldots. $$ By averaging on the distribution for $\xi$, a normal one by hypothesis, one gets a solution series in terms of the correlation function of the random variable. A simple case is this $$ \langle\xi({\bf r})\rangle =0 \qquad \langle\xi({\bf r})\xi({\bf r'})\rangle=\xi_0^2\delta^3({\bf r}-{\bf r'}) $$ yielding $$ U({\bf r}) \stackrel{?}{=} U_0({\bf r})+k^4\xi_0^2G(0)\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)U_0^2({\bf r'})+\ldots. $$ that is not well defined mathematically. You can consider a case with a finite volume and recover from this situation. 

I am currently studying augmented simplicial sets with some additional degeneracies. I was wondering if it is a structure that was already identified somewhere. This additional data is a family of applications $s_i : S_n \to S_{n+1}$ for $n \geq 0$ and $0 \leq i \leq n$ satisfying the following axioms: $$ \partial_i s_j = \begin{cases} s_{j-1} \partial_{i-1} & j < i \\ Id & j = i \\ s_j \partial_i & j > i \end{cases} \qquad \sigma_i s_j = \begin{cases} s_j \sigma_{i-1} & j < i \\ s_j s_j & j = i \\ s_{j+1} \sigma_i & j > i \end{cases} \qquad s_is_j = s_{j+1} s_{i} \quad i \leq j $$ Some intuition about this structure: it is well known that in the opposite of the augmented simplex category $\Delta_a^{op}$, the object $\mathbf{1}$ is in some sense the universal monoid. The structure I am presenting here are presheaves over a category $\Delta_+$, where $\mathbf{1}$ would be in $\Delta_+^{op}$ the universal "monoid with a morphism towards the unit of the tensor product". For those interested, this is also heavily related to cubical sets: they correspond to cubical sets where you throw away the connections $\Gamma^+$ and the faces $\partial^+$. 

The easiest way to prove this is using variational calculus. You have to put $$ \delta I(G(\omega))=0. $$ The calculation is quite straigthforward and provides the condition $$ \delta G(\omega)=0 $$ and so the extremum is for $G(\omega)=G=constant$. Finally, from the condition you have to set $$ \int_{-k\pi}^{k\pi}G(\omega)=2k\pi G=1. $$ This gives the value of the extremum $G=\frac{1}{2k\pi}$. Expanded on OP request: The idea behind functional calculus (calculus of variations) is to consider a class of functionals, as in your case, that can be amenable to a generalized differentiation. You can find all the rules and the definition of a functional derivative here but for a more serious approach some lectures as the ones I pointed out in the comment area are needed. Your case is particularly simple as one is left in each term with the variation of $G(\omega)$ and this must be zero to find an extremum. Update on OP request: Let us introduce the following functional $$ Z_m[G]=\int_{-k\pi}^{k\pi}\frac{A}{G(\omega)+A}e^{-im\omega}d\omega $$ The functional we are considering takes the form $$ I[G]=Z_0[G]-\frac{Z_1^*[G]Z_1[G]}{Z_0[G]}. $$ Now we have $$ \delta Z_m[G]=-\int_{k\pi}^{-k\pi}\frac{A}{(G(\omega)+A)^2}\delta G(\omega)e^{-im\omega}d\omega. $$ Chain rule applies also to functionals and we can evaluate $\delta I[G]$ immediately to give $$ \delta I[G]=\delta Z_0[G]-\frac{Z_1^*[G]Z_1[G]\delta Z_0[G]-Z_0[G]\delta(Z_1^*[G]Z_1[G])}{Z_0^2[G]} $$ and we see that the condition $\delta G(\omega)=0$ sets the variation to zero. This solution is consistent with the given constraint provided $G=\frac{1}{2k\pi}$. The application of the constarint a posteriori fixes the value of the constant. Further clarification for OP: I will show that a functional that does not depend from at least a first derivative is a constant in one dimension. Let us consider the functional $$ S=\int_a^bL(q(t),q'(t),t)dt. $$ The condition for the extremum just gives $\delta S=0$ yielding Euler-Lagrange equation $$ \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial q'(t)}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial q(t)}. $$ Then, if there is no dependence on derivative we are left with $\frac{\partial L}{\partial q(t)}=0$ that implies immediately $L=L(t)$ and $q(t)=constant$. 

If you ask the matrices to be unipotent, then, first, you can only get matrices from $SL_n$, and second, three is not enough, the torus is the obstacle. But if you take four upper and lower unipotent triangular matrices, you can do it (still in $SL_n$). For this the keyword is "unitriangular factorisation". 

This is an expansion of my comment. The Smith normal form is a normal form of a matrix with entries in any given PID (but this probably works for non-domains and for Bezout rings in general). It goes as follows: given an $m\times n$ matrix $A$, there exist invertible $m\times m$ and $n\times n$ matrices $B$ and $C$ such that $BAC=\operatorname{diag}(a_1,\ldots,a_r,0,\ldots,0)$. Moreover, the entries $a_i$ satisfy $a_i\mid a_{i+1}$ and are unique up to the multiplication by a unit. This decribes the representatives of $GL(m,R) \backslash M(m,n,R) / GL(n,R)$. From here you can obtain the decription for $SL(m,R) \backslash M(m,n,R) / SL(n,R)$ — no independent multiplication by a unit anymore, so the difference is the same as between $K_1$ and $SK_1$. When $R$ is a Euclidean ring, one has an algorith for computing the Smith normal form. This works for any PID, in fact, but the resulting matrices $B$ and $C$ are not necessary elementary in this case. For a Euclidean ring the algorithm gives you the chain of elementary transfromation for obtaining the SNF. As you mentioned, $E(n,R)=SL(n,R)$ when $R$ is Euclidean, but this is not the case for a PID. This equality fails, for example, for the ring $S^{-1}\mathbb{Z}[x]$, where $S$ is the multiplicative system generated by all cyclotomic polynomials. This is a result of D. R. Grayson — $SK_1$ of an interesting principal ideal domain. Here are two other links with examples:
