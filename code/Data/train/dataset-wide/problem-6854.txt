Acquiring a company involves acquiring all of its shares and giving the previous shareholders money, your stock, or other valuable things, like options. You don't have to acquire all the shares on the open market, though. You would never be able to persuade every single shareholder to sell their shares. You just have to get enough that the board of directors (or a majority of shareholders at a shareholder meeting) votes to merge the target company in, converting all existing shares into the cash or shares that you are offering. If the management is willing, you don't have to buy any on the open market. They just vote to accept your offer to merge their company in and all shareholders receive whatever it is you offered. If the management is not in favor, you have to buy enough shares that you plus the other investors who are willing have enough influence to make it happen. This can mean replacing board members or casting direct votes. 

Physical Money M0 is just paper and metal. The paper is printed in D.C. and Fort Worth by the Bureau of Printing and Engraving and banks purchase it using electronic money they have in their federal reserve deposit accounts. Nothing special there and the effective money supply doesn't really change when M0 changes. How the Fed Increases the Money Supply What it sounds like you are asking is how the Fed increases the money supply in general. The Fed is constantly buying, selling, lending, and borrowing. It does this through its open market operations desk at the NY fed and through other mechanisms such as lending to banks at the discount window and paying interest on deposits at the fed. At any time you can look at how much money is flowing out of the fed (purchases, loans, and interest) and how much is flowing in (sales, redemptions, and borrowing) and compute the difference. If they are buying and lending more than they are selling and borrowing, the money supply increases. That's how it happens and it is going on continuously. Sometimes they buy things for above their market price (or push the price up) if they are trying to inject a lot of money into the supply or buoy up a particular market. If the Fed increases the money supply in general, then it is possible that the number of physical dollars in use will increase, which means the Bureau of Printing and Engraving needs to spit out some more paper. This is not that important of a consequence, though. The spitting out of paper is not what increases the money supply. Every physical dollar is purchased with an electronic dollar, so the effective money supply does not change. Where Fed Dollars Come From The key to understanding the Fed is to remember that they are the only institution that doesn't really have a budget constraint. When they buy something, they create brand new dollars to do so. When they sell something, the dollars they receive effectively disappear. Every other institution, including the federal government, must actually have dollars to spend or get them via borrowing. Because of this property, every time they buy something or make a loan, the money supply increases. By the way, the fact that the Fed can make up and destroy money is why it makes little sense to worry about or discuss the Fed's balance sheet. It's the unique institution with the property that its balance sheet doesn't need to affect its behavior. 

We need to be clear about what is a cause and what is an effect. Figure out what changed and why, then follow the results. Results do not cause causes. As a general example, think of a demand/supply relation (for anything). If demand shifts left (reduced demand) and nothing else changes, then the equilibrium price goes down. That means the good is cheaper, but this cheapness doesn't cause increased demand. It's the result of decreased demand. In the first statement, prices rose. Why? An increase in the domestic money supply, presumably? If so, then essentially we have changed numeraire. What used to be a dollar's worth of goods now costs $1.10, both domestically and abroad. If the numeraire did not change abroad and nothing changed about the economy, then a unit of the foreign currency now buys the same amount of goods but more dollars. That's depreciation of the currency. Depreciation is the effect, not a cause. In the second statement, there has been depreciation. Why? Because of an increase in the money supply as mentioned above? If so, then demand for currency will only rise inasmuch as an importer of the same amount of goods will need more dollars, but this numerical increase in demand doesn't translate to making the dollar worth more abroad. The depreciation is the equilibrium result of the change in the money supply. Again, depreciation is the effect. For depreciation to be a cause, rather than an effect, you would need to provide an economic change that directly affected depreciation. Depending on what changed economically, there could be lots of possible outcomes. For any economic analysis, start with an equilibrium result, change one economic thing (the cause), then see how the equilibrium changes (the effect). Then you are done. Don't look at how the equilibrium is different from what it was before and treat that as if it was an economic cause. 

The table appears to have a bunch of errors in it. In particular, the cash flow column seems wrong in every instance. I don't blame you for having problems understanding. For your first question, the cash flow in time 0 is wrong. $1.1^0=1$ as we know. The "end of year 0" means "right now," so there should be no discounting at all. The cash flow should be -100,000, as indicated by the correct value in the present value column. For your second question, cash flow is discounted at the required rate of return to get the present value. In this case, presumably $$ \frac{25,454.55}{(1+0.1)^1} = 23,140.50 $$ Why does that not equal the present value column? Because the table was set up by someone who was confused. The quantity they put in the present value is simply the discounted value of \$30,000 - \$5,000. $$ \frac{30,000-5,000}{(1+0.1)^1} = 22,727.27 $$ To me that seems like a reasonable solution to the problem text. The next period's cash flow should again be (\$30,000-\$5,000) and its present value should be $$ \frac{30,000-5,000}{(1+0.1)^2} = 20,661.16 $$ Anyway, the present value column seems right given the text of the problem. The "cash flow" column was done by someone who was as confused as you are, if not more so. Probably you got this already, but to solve the problem you simply take the sum of everything in the present value column. -------------- EDIT ------------- Now that I look at it again, I bet they just forgot to put parentheses around the (30000-5000) in each entry. And left off a few zeros in the first. Shabby, but not as bad as I was originally thinking. 

Unless I'm misreading you, your question seems to imply that higher treasury yields are intuitively associated with lower inflation. they are not. Higher yields are associated with fear of higher inflation. Consider the following: 

The question asks you to compare the value of an immediate payment and a series of payments in the future. In finance, every set of future payments has an immediate payment equivalent, which we get by dividing each future payment by a discount rate. When this question says "interest rate," it means "discount rate." The two terms are used interchangeably where there is little ambiguity about what is meant. To answer your first question, it doesn't matter what the true risk-free or risky interest rates are now...that's not part of the question. It's a hypothetical world in which there is an interest rate of zero. In that case, future dollars are worth the same as present dollars, so we are comparing the value of \$8,525 with \$12,000. Clearly the latter is better. For the second question, how do we find the present value (immediate lump sum equivalent) of these payments? $$ PV = \frac{1000}{0.07}\left(1-\frac{1}{1.07^{12}}\right) = $7,942.69 $$ Using the formula for the present value of an annuity. We could also do it using the direct approach $$ PV = \sum_{i=1}^{12}\frac{1000}{1.07^{i}} $$ to get the same result. We see that \$8,525 > \$7,942.69 so it's better to take the immediate payment. The answers seem like they were hastily and erroneously written--better to ignore them and rely on my solution than to try and figure them out. The question here is a typical and straightforward introductory undergraduate finance question, though, and well worth understanding. 

There are many plausible scenarios in which the dollar ceases to be the de-facto currency. They all have a few things in common. For people to stop using dollars for international trade, there would need to be two circumstances: 

The process for solving this type of problem is very general--it's not a set of rules. You don't need to attribute fixed costs to one good or the other (if there is only one fixed cost). Here's the procedure: 

=================== EDIT: Additional Help ============= Profit function: $$ \pi=1000Q_a - Q_a^2+2000Q_b-0.2Q_b^2-100(Q_a+Q_b)-1000000 $$ First order conditions $$ \frac{d\pi}{dQ_a}=1000-2Q_a - 100 $$ $$ \frac{d\pi}{dQ_b}=2000-0.4Q_b - 100 $$ Note that from the second first order equation $$ Q_b=\frac{2000-100}{0.4} = 4750 $$ Substituting 450 and 4750 into the profit function gives exactly 3,715,000. Please don't say that right answers are wrong when you are unable to replicate them on your own. It causes those who don't know any better to downvote. 

I know this sounds a little alarmist, but wholesale default on all US government debt is truly an end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scale event. The world truly would change dramatically. Probably future generations would read about the golden age of humanity that ended with the great default. Realistically, the US is not going to completely default on its debt any time soon. If there was even a bit of worry about it, people and institutions would stop using it as such a critical component of their transactions and saving. This would also be a dramatic change, but it would happen over time and reduce the effects, should a default ever happen. I'm not sure what people would use as a substitute. It would be uncharted territory. A more likely, but still apocalyptic, scenario would be some partial default or sustained high inflation. See the above consequences, but scaled down and including loss of confidence in the dollar. 

Unfortunately this question is exceptionally complex and depends on factors such has how many children the person has, which state they live in, and which services/opportunities they are taking advantage of. I read a paper a while back (having a hard time finding it) in which the authors attempted to compute the effective tax rate for all incomes after the various deductions, benefits, alternative minimum tax, and other considerations. The rate was very nonlinear with many peaks and valleys. It was not particularly increasing with income. This is further complicated by state taxes and the fact that states administer many welfare benefits using different criteria from each other. Most taxes scale in and benefits scale out as income increases. I believe the most heavily taxed dollar would be the one that takes you from qualifying for one of the various welfare benefits to not. Many welfare programs have hard cutoffs. This will vary from state to state, though, and may depend on other factors like what your savings are and how your social worker is feeling that day. When I was in graduate school I had a stipend of about \$22K and my friend got slightly less. He qualified for food stamps, WIC, and medicaid, and HUD paid his rent and utilities. He received about \$30K a year in government benefits (not counting the value of medicaid) on top of his stipend. I was just over the income line got none of these (well, my wife got WIC when she was pregnant). So the small difference in our income cost me many thousands of dollars--he lived much, much better than I did. It was more than an income difference, though. HUD paid his rent because he had found a cheaper apartment than I was able to and they had a rent-per-square-foot cutoff. Later I tried restructuring my life in order to qualify for some of these, but the state had changed some of its rules (you had to have less than $2,000 in your bank accounts to qualify). This is also complicated by the fact that the rules are not applied consistently. For example, some of the social workers deciding which benefits he got did not count his stipend as income, while all the ones I talked to counted mine. Your tax rate and marginal tax rate depend on many elements of who you are, where you live, how you file taxes, what consumption choices you make, and luck.
