This doesn't look true as stated. What matters is something like the perimeter of the sites of the path (or of the smallest-perimeter box containing the sites of the path), not the length of the path itself. For example, if the path fills up an $m\times m$ box then the penalty for switching all the sites within the box from plus to minus is exponential in $m$ and not in $m^2$. To prove such a bound (with the appropriate exponent) you can still use the Peierls argument; for a (connected) set to be all minus, there must be some contour separating the set from the boundary. If the set is large, the contour must be long, and you can bound the probability of seeing such a long contour (decaying exponentially in the length). 

Here are two constructions, showing that the expectation of the min can get down to around $1+1/\sqrt{n}$, and on the other hand can get up to a value approaching $2$ as $n\to\infty$. Maybe someone can do better! Let the random variables be $X_1, X_2,\dots, X_n$. (1) Aiming to make the expected minimum small; the idea is to let each value occur once, with a small perturbation to achieve the required probability that any two variables are the same. Fix $p>0$ ($p$ will get small as $n$ gets large). Let $\tilde{X}_1, \dots, \tilde{X}_n$ be a uniform permutation of $\{1,\dots, n\}$. Independently, let $Y$ be drawn uniformly from $\{1,\dots,n\}$. Finally (and independently of $(\tilde{X}_i)$ and $Y$), choose $B_1, B_2, \dots, B_n$ to be independent and each taking value $1$ with probability $p$, and $0$ with probability $1-p$. Now define $X_i$ by setting \begin{equation*} X_i=\begin{cases}\tilde{X}_i& \text{ if } B_i=0\\ Y&\text{ if } B_i=1\end{cases}. \end{equation*} If we choose $p$ such that $p^2 + 2p(1-p)/n = 1/n$, then it's easy to check that for each pair $i,j$, the variables $X_i$ and $X_j$ are equal with probability $1/n$. (Namely, $X_i=X_j$ whenever $B_i=B_j=1$, or $B_i=1, B_j=0$ with $Y=\tilde{X}_j$, or $B_i=0, B_j=1$ with $Y=\tilde{X}_i$.) From this it's easy to get (using symmetry) that all the pairwise distributions are as required. The relevant $p$ is around $1/\sqrt{n}$. Then the probability that the minimum is 1 is approximately $1-p$, and more generally the distribution of the minimum is approximately geometric with parameter $1-p$, and so with mean $1/(1-p)$. Overall we obtain that the expected minimum is $1+1/\sqrt{n}$ plus smaller order terms. (2) Aiming to make the expected minimum large; the idea is to let each value occur either 0 or 2 times, again with a small perturbation to get the pairwise distributions precisely right. For convenience let $n$ be even. Let $Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_{n/2}$ be $n/2$ distinct values chosen uniformly at random from $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Now let $\tilde{X}_1, \dots, \tilde{X}_n$ be a uniform permutation of $Y_1, Y_1, Y_2, Y_2, Y_3, Y_3, \dots, Y_{n/2}, Y_{n/2}$. So each value occurs either 0 or 2 times in the sequence $(\tilde{X}_i)$. The marginal distributions are correct, but the pairwise distributions are not quite correct; we have $\tilde{X}_i=\tilde{X}_j$ with probability $1/(n-1)$, while we want this probability to be $1/n$. To correct this, let $Z_1, \dots, Z_n$ be a uniform permutation of $\{1,2,\dots, n\}$. Now with probability $1/n$, let $X_i=Z_i$ for all $i$, and with probability $1-1/n$, let $X_i=\tilde{X}_i$ for all $i$. Again it's not hard to check that the pairwise distributions are correct. Now the probability that 1 appears in the sequence is approximately $1/2$; more generally, the distribution of the min of the sequence is approximately geometric with probability $1/2$ (since the numbers of occurrences of $1,2,3,\dots$ are approximately independent). The expectation of the min is then $2+o(1)$ as $n\to\infty$. Looking to improve this: note that to get the pairwise distributions right, the number of occurrences of any value $k$ should have mean approximately $1$ and variance approximately $1$ as $n\to\infty$. However, maybe we could improve on construction (2) by one in which the number of occurrences of $1,2,3,\dots$ are not asymptotically independent; again, to get the pairwise distributions right, they have to be asymptotically uncorrelated but this does not imply independence, so maybe by playing around one could get it so that, say, the number of occurrences of 1 and the number of occurrences of 2 tend to be 0 simultaneously (which will help to push up the expected minimum). 

For more informations look this paper about "Gaussian Measures on a Banach Space" theorem 8.2.5 with a complet proof. Edit: I edited my answer because I don't meant the existence of Hilbert space $H‎$ related to the given question but i meant the existence will be satisfied if and only if the conditions cited in theorem 8.2.5 hold 

This question is related to my question here such that i want to find a closed form of $\int_{-1}^1 x^{2k} (\operatorname{erf}(x))^k \,dx $ , for $k$ is even integer because for odd integer is $0$ as we have integrand of odd function , Really for $k=2$ it gives a nice closed form as shown here in wolfram alpha, Now my question here is : 

The transfert operator describe an expression or formula of a transform that $\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{a_k x^k}{k!}$ into $ \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{a_k B_k(x)}{k!}$ is the p-adic operator such that :The eigenvalues of the p-adic transfer operator are the Bernoulli polynomials,and are associated with the eigenvalues $p^{-n}$ , Try to check this paper by LINAS VEPŠTAS, page 8.

Hint: This is not an answer but probably helping you . For $\beta =0 $ the request polynomial is Hermite polynomial with the weight $e^{-x²}$ , but for $\beta >0 $ it seems the polynomial is $p_n(x)= x^n$ , with $n$ is odd integer and you have $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} p_n(x)p_m(x)2\cosh(\beta x)e^{-x^2}=0$ ,with $m$ is even integer, Here we have :$$\int_{-a}^a f(x) \rm{d} x =0$$ because $f(x)$ is an odd function.,and this means the orthogonality polynomials . 

Note:This is not an answer but probably helping you to get the answer of your question.just to show some properties related to your formel series . we denote by $f$ your divergent power series ,The formel series you have is non analytic function and it is smooth ,it's has a positive radius of convergence.Then, it extends uniquely by analytic continuation to a maximally-defined analytic function , Note that the Taylor series of $f$ at $0$ has non-negative coefficients, and it's seems the coefficients are not grow fast that is one of the weaker condition to judge that the formel series you have can be Borel summable 

For the always existence of Hilbert space ‎$H‎$ need some conditions about Banach space and structure of Gaussian measure to be satisfied as montioned in the below theorem where the uniqness is the strong condition for existence but in your case it's not always Hilbert space ‎$H‎$ exist : 

This is not a complet answer may lead to a proof for your boundary problem , We have : \begin{equation} \frac{d^2Y}{dx^2} + M\frac{d}{dx}\left[x^2Y(x)\right] - x^2 Y(x) = 0\;\;\;\;;\;\;\;\; Y(0) = 1 \;\;\;\;;\;\;\;\; Y(\infty) = 0 \end{equation} The above equation can be written as :$y''(x)+Mx²y'(x)+(2xM-x²)y=0$ and the latter give us two cases : for $M=\frac{x}{2}$ the equation is second-order of linear differntial equation where the solution in this case is $\displaystyle y(x)=\frac{c_1x\Gamma(1/4,\frac{x^4}{8})}{2^{0.25}{\sqrt{x}}^{0.25}}$. Now for $M\neq \frac{x}{2}$ , The coeffecients here are analytic functions and this follow legendre differential equation using the power series function you will get : $y(x)=y_{0}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{a_{2n}{x}^{2n}}+y_1\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{a_{2n+1}{x}^{2n+1}}$, just you can check this paper page 135.exercice 5.3 to get a complet steps for solving your ODE using power series
