There is a broad literature that attempts to address the very question you pose- what is the impact of immigration (legal and illegal) on native wages? However, if you're interested in the 'real world' evidence, I'd suggest focusing on empirical labor economics as opposed to more theoretical labor models. The reason for my suggestion is that theoretical economics makes no clear prediction without a lot more information. There are a variety of factors, such as the production function being considered, the labor market conditions observed, the relative substitutability of immigrant and native workers, etc. which tends to make answering the question more of an empirical exercise. As far as the findings of the empirical papers, they actually tend to find relatively little impact of immigrant labor on native wages, with a few notable exceptions. For some examples: This survey paper, though a bit out of date as it's from 2005 outlines the results of 18 papers and finds wide discrepancies depending on modeling techniques and underlying assumptions used. Borjas, 2003 is one of the better known works, and finds what one might expect based on Econ101 models- that an increase in immigrant labor supply leads to a decrease in wages for native workers. A couple very well known articles have tried to tease out the impact of immigration on wages by focusing on particular events (called supply shocks) where the number of immigrants increased "suddenly" for reasons having nothing to do with the economic climate at the time. A pair of papers examined the impact of the Mariel Boatlift, which led to a spike in Cuban immigrants in Miami: The first, a paper by Card 1990 found no evidence of a negative impact of immigration on wages, while Borjas 2015 finds a substantial decrease in the wages for the least educated Miami residents. Several other papers have found either no negative effect, or even positive effects, of immigrants on various worker wages. For example, this paper by Peri in 2011 finds no negative impact of immigrants on wages, but a strongly positive impact of immigrants on productivity. This paper from 2013 finds significant positive impacts of undocumented immigrants on the wages of native workers in Georgia. Ultimately, the exercise of determining the impact of immigrants on wages really depends on the method of analysis and a number of underlying parameters, and applying "standard" (i.e. Principles of Micro) models can lead to erroneous results and a false sense of certainty. If there's anything else in particular you're interested in, let me know and I'll try to improve the answer! EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to include a link to this additional survey paper in the original answer! 

I wrote some silly program where you just fix endowment $e=(e_1,e_2)$ and utility functions $u=(u_1(x_1,y_1),u_2(x_2,y_2))$. The example provides an illustration for your utility functions and $x_1+x_2=1$ and $y_1+y_2=1$. I've drawn 100 indifference curves on an equally spaced grid of given utility levels $\bar u_1\in[u_1(0,0),u_1(1,1)]$ (blue) and $\bar u_2\in[u_2(0,0),u_2(1,1)]$ (red). The black line is the contract curve. I added a second figure with some initial endowment $e_1 = (0.25, 0.75)$, $e_2 = (0.75, 0.25)$ and core. 

Model Consider the following stochastic optimal growth problem in per capita notation. \begin{align} &\max_{c}\int^\infty_0 e^{-\rho t}u(c)dt\\ \text{s.t.}~~~& dk = [f(k) - (n-\sigma^2) k - c]dt - \sigma kdz\\ &c\in[0,f(k)]\\ &k(0) = k_0 \end{align} everthing is standard except for $dz$ which is the increment of a standard Wiener process, i.e. $z(t)\sim\mathcal{N}(0,t)$. The population growth rate has mean $n$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Analytical Solution We presume Cobb-Douglas technology \begin{align} f(k) = k^\alpha,\quad \alpha\in(0,1) \end{align} and CRRA utility \begin{align} u(c) = \frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma},\quad \gamma > 1. \end{align} Set up the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB-e) \begin{align} \rho v(k) = \max_c\left\{\frac{c^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} + v'(k)(k^\alpha - (n - \sigma^2)k - c) + v''(k)\frac{k^2\sigma^2}{2}\right\} \end{align} The first order condition (FOC) reads \begin{align} c = v'(k)^{-\frac{1}{\gamma}}=:\pi(k) \end{align} where $\pi(\cdot)$ denotes the policy function. Resubstitute FOC into HJB-e \begin{align} \rho v(k) = \frac{v'(k)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}}{1-\gamma} + v'(k)k^\alpha - v'(k)(n - \sigma^2)k - v'(k)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} + v''(k)\frac{k^2\sigma^2}{2}. \end{align} We guess a functional form of $v(k)$ with (Posch (2009, eq. 41)) \begin{align} v(k) = \Psi \frac{k^{1-\alpha\gamma}}{1-\alpha\gamma} \end{align} where $\Psi$ is some constant. The first and second order derivative of $v$ are given by \begin{align} v'(k) &= \Psi k^{-\alpha\gamma}\\ v''(k) &= -\alpha\gamma\Psi k^{-1-\alpha\gamma}. \end{align} The HJB-e then reads \begin{align} &\rho \Psi\frac{k^{1-\alpha\gamma}}{1-\alpha\gamma} = \frac{\Psi^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}k^{\alpha(1-\gamma)}}{1-\gamma} + \Psi k^{\alpha(1-\gamma)} - (n-\sigma^2) \Psi k^{1-\alpha\gamma} - \Psi^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} k^{\alpha(1-\gamma)} - \alpha\gamma\Psi k^{1-\alpha\gamma}\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\\[2mm] \Longleftrightarrow \quad & k^{1-\alpha\gamma}\left(\frac{\rho}{1-\alpha\gamma} + n - \sigma^2\left(1 - \frac{\alpha\gamma}{2}\right)\right) = k^{\alpha(1-\gamma)}\left[1+\Psi^{-\frac{1}{\gamma}}\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}\right] \end{align} The maximized HJB-e is true iff the following conditions hold \begin{align} \rho = \left(-n + \sigma^2\left(1 - \frac{\alpha\gamma}{2}\right)\right)(1-\alpha\gamma)\quad \wedge \quad \Psi = \left(\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right)^{-\gamma} \end{align} Resubstitute $\Psi$ into $v$ which finally gives the true value function \begin{align} v(k) = \left(\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}\right)^{-\gamma} \frac{k^{1-\alpha\gamma}}{1-\alpha\gamma}. \end{align} 

There are a few reasons why, at least in a broader theoretical context, substantial government influence in a market economy may have negative consequences. A few are: Crowding Out Effect Increases in government spending can potentially lead to a decrease in investment from the private sector. This can be thought of in the more formal definition of the term (that an increase in government demands for loanable funds can lead to an increase in the interest rates faced by the private sector) or in the more informal one- that government involvement can change the profit motive faced by private entities in the field. If you assume that those private firms are, on balance, more efficient with resources than the governmental agency, it can lead to negative economic outcomes. Market Distortions One potential problem of increased governmental activity in the economy comes from unforeseen distortions that can ripple through other sectors. For all their problems, one nice feature of market equilibria are their ability to reflect private information and demands, and aggregate the individual actions of hundreds of millions of people effectively. That is no small feat; it is hard for a centralized agency to mimic that effectiveness. One of the major problems with centralized economies in practice is their practical inability to allocate resources "efficiently." Modeling government interaction in a repeated game-like context. Another (albeit more philosophical) problem some see is that, even if a larger government would be optimal for right now, it is often difficult to cut bureaucracy once it becomes entrenched. Therefore, we should consider that "future value" of inefficiently large government spending in the future (even if it is optimal to increase government's size today) into today's perceived "payoffs" of different actions. Problems with the Multiplier Effect: The multiplier, as learned in econ101, is a bit oversimplified in its presentation. While there almost certainly is some multiplier in every case, it isn't really just a single number that turns on an economy wide "marginal propensity to consume." Instead, it's far more subtle, and often depends on who is receiving the benefit, what the context of the payment is, etc. Furthermore, some conservative economists argue it is often too small to justify the expense. Now, note that I personally don't really believe much of what was said above. I'm not trying to suggest that Mr. Corbyn should or shouldn't increase the size of government expenditures (I haven't studied the issue enough to make an informed opinion). Furthermore, I think it should be noted (in the interest of fairness) that many times these theoretical concerns can be misapplied in practice: for example, The Laffer Curve may be the most poorly applied theoretical concept in political economy. Let me know if that didn't answer your question, or if you'd like more detail! 

See Romer (2006, Sec 2.3) for details of notation. Dynamics are given by \begin{align} \dot k &= f(k) - (n+g)k - c\\ \dot c &= \frac{c}{\theta}(f'(k) - \rho - \theta g) \end{align} Presume you are located somewhere on the $\dot k = 0$ locus. Now if we increase $c$ one gets \begin{align} \frac{\partial \dot k}{\partial c} = -1 < 0 \end{align} That is, if we are above $\dot k = 0$ capital decreaes over time. Hence at point $A$ we move to the left. Now presume you are located somewhere on the $\dot c = 0$ locus. Now if we increase $k$ one gets \begin{align} \frac{\partial \dot c}{\partial k} = \frac{c}{\theta} f''(k) < 0 \end{align} That is, if we are right of $\dot c = 0$ consumption decreaes over time. Hence at point $A$ we move up in addition (left of $\dot c = 0$). 

Consider the following dynamic dividing a dollar game where agent 1 claims $x(t)$ of the dollar and agent 2 $y(t)$ (paper). \begin{align} &\max_{\{u(t)\}^T_{t=0}} e^{-rT}x(T)\\[2mm] &\max_{\{v(t)\}^T_{t=0}} e^{-rT}y(T)\\[2mm] \text{s.t. }& \dot x(t) = -u(t)\in[0,1-x(t)]\\ & \dot y(t) = -v(t)\in[0,1-y(t)]\\ & x(0) + y(0) > 1 \end{align} where $y(T) = 1 - x(T)$ with $T:=\min\{t \in \mathbb{R}_{++} : x(t) + y(t) = 1\}$ and $r > 0$ is the time preference rate. Optimal feedback control is given by $u(t) = r(1-x(t))$ and $v(t) = r(1-y(t))$. This solution is somehow motivated by guess and verify.
