An aside: the quote mentions "hot money", a term that I dislike because it's so vague. If we define "hot money" to be "international investors' capital moving at high frequencies", hot money doesn't necessarily leave the country when the currency weakens. Indeed, possible central bank interventions in the foreign exchange market aside, if "hot money" is the only private capital moving around quickly, then total hot money flows must net out to zero in the short run: the net capital inflow must equal the current account deficit, which is trivial over the span of a few days. The key point is that although "hot money" doesn't leave in equilibrium, the exchange rate might have to fall substantially for the market to equilibriate. For instance, if investors holding "hot money" collectively get jittery about a currency and want to hold dollars instead, the currency might collapse until it reaches a value where (in the aggregate) they remain willing to hold the same amount. In the identity above, this would be reflected in a dramatic rise in the TRY/USD return premium. This is a common story of crises in developing countries with open but fragile capital markets. 

As Jason Nichols says, these terms are often used interchangeably. The general theme is that pretty much anything can be called a "peg" (except perhaps the case where two countries are literally using the same currency), while "fixed" tends to refer to institutional arrangements that are more automatic, where changes in the exchange rate are perceived to be less likely. "Peg" tends to be used when some entity (e.g. a central bank) is doing the "pegging"; the more active and less automatic the behavior of this entity is, the more likely that you'll call the arrangement a "peg". To further explain the (inconsistent and informal) differences in usage that do seem to exist, I have to describe several different kinds of exchange rate regimes. 

To sum up, my overall impression is that it's pretty vague, but that among 1 to 6 above, you're more likely to call something earlier in the list "fixed", something more in the middle of the list a "peg", and something later in the list a "float". But I am not aware of any formal, clearly specified distinction between terms as general as "fixed" and "peg". When exchange rates are classified, as in the IMF's annual report on the topic, this is usually done in a much more specific and descriptive way. 

Yes, under some conditions. This is the classic integrability problem: for detailed discussion, see some excellent notes by Kim Border. Several other technical conditions are required, but the most economically substantive condition is that the Slutsky matrix must always be symmetric and negative semidefinite. To be concrete, if we define the $ij$th element of the Slutsky matrix at $(p,m)$ to be $$\sigma_{ij}(p,m)=\frac{\partial D_i(p,m)}{\partial p_j}+D_j(p,m)\frac{\partial D_i(p,m)}{\partial m}$$ then we must have $\sigma_{ij}(p,m)=\sigma_{ji}(p,m)$ for all $(p,m)$, and also for any vector $v$ we must have for all $(p,m)$ $$\sum_i \sum_j \sigma_{ij}(p,m)v_iv_j \leq 0$$ The necessity of these conditions follows immediately from basic consumer theory, which shows that if Marshallian demand is derived from constrained maximization of a utility function, then the Slutsky matrix is symmetric and negative semidefinite. But the sufficiency of these conditions (in conjunction with some other technical assumptions) for us to back out a utility function is a more complicated matter, and to get the details I recommend Border's notes or some other advanced micro source. If, assuming that the Slutsky conditions hold, you want a rough practical way (ignoring the technical subtleties) to back out indifference curves in the typical two-good case, the simplest way is probably to use your knowledge of demand to determine the compensating change in expenditure that is necessary to adjust for a given change in prices. Specifically, for either $i=1,2$ use the identity $$\frac{\partial e(p,u)}{\partial p_i} = h_i(p,u) = D_i(p,e(p,u))$$ which, given knowledge of the Marshallian demand function $D$, is a differential equation in the expenditure function $e$. Starting with some initial values $(\bar{p},\bar{m})$ that produce some unknown utility $\bar{u}$, we know that $e(\bar{p},\bar{u})=\bar{m}$. Then, varying $p_1$, we can integrate the above differential equation for $i=1$ to obtain $e(p_1,\bar{p}_2,\bar{u})$ for any $p_1$. And then we can get the Hicksian demand vector $$h(p_1,\bar{p}_2,\bar{u})=D(p_1,\bar{p}_2,e(p_1,\bar{p}_2,\bar{u}))$$ for any $p_1$. Since these Hicksian demands all correspond to the same utility $\bar{u}$, they are on the same indifference curve. By varying $p_1$, we will be able to trace out many different points on this indifference curve. In fact, if demand is sufficiently well-behaved, then we can trace out the entire indifference curve by varying $p_1$ enough in either direction. (By the way, "tracing indifference curves" is all we can do in any event: since the cardinality of utility is irrelevant to Marshallian demand, we can only retrieve ordinal properties like indifference curves and their ordering.) 

It depends on what you mean by overshooting. The original Dornbusch (1976) story is that following a surprise permanent increase in the money supply, the nominal exchange rate "overshoots" its long-run level (the long-run level increases proportionately with the money supply). This is not a directly relevant story today (and I'm not sure that it ever was), because few changes in monetary policy take the form of surprise permanent changes in the money supply. The mechanism for Dornbusch's "overshooting" is that since the price level takes time to adjust, in the short term there is an increase in the real money supply, leading to a decrease in nominal interest rates. This decrease in nominal interest rates leads the currency to weaken. If we cut out the first part about the shock to the money supply and just think about the mechanism itself, where (all else equal) lower nominal interest rates lead a currency to weaken relative to its long-term level, then we have a much more relevant and plausible story. Whenever central banks are looser or tighter than expected in policy, you usually see the exchange rate weaken or strengthen, respectively, as a result. This is related to the notion of uncovered interest rate parity, but it's a weaker version: it doesn't say that UIP always holds (which it definitely doesn't), just that it conditionally holds in response to an interest rate shock. Surprisingly, the international finance literature has been mixed on whether this is true or not, but Michael Kiley has recently shown that conditional UIP seems to hold in response to monetary policy surprises, as identified by monetary policy statement days. I suspect that the previous literature, which was based mainly on VARs without a clear identification strategy, struggled to find a consistent effect due to bad research design. 

In principle, not that much would necessarily happen: if people pulled out their bank deposits in the form of cash, then the central bank would just become a much bigger financial intermediary. Cash is a liability of the central bank: when it introduces cash into the economy, it uses that cash to buy an asset. In a world where the public switched to cash en masse, a central bank fulfilling its usual operating procedure by targeting short-term interest rates would fully accommodate that spike in demand for cash by making much more of it, and accumulating assets in the process. What would these assets be? Well, in this situation they would naturally be loans to banks, which would need the funding. So by withdrawing its funds from the banking system, the public would just trade off holding deposits directly in banks for holding these assets indirectly through the central bank (by holding cash that is backed by loans to those banks). Of course, this is all a bit idealized. In practice a mass withdrawal of funds would presumably be somewhat chaotic, and the central bank would have to be diligent about its role as lender of last resort to avoid disaster. But there is a natural way for the system to work here, and it's amusing to contemplate how in this scenario, we'd really just be adding one more layer of indirection to the financial system. 

For continuous-time stochastic dynamic programming, the small, nontechnical Art of Smooth Pasting by Dixit is a wonderful option. It does a very effective job of conveying the basic intuition. Stokey's more recent The Economics of Inaction is also decent, but for a practical-minded person it probably underperforms Dixit - its much greater length and somewhat heavier notation do not yield commensurate rewards. 

This is all an interesting contrast with the more famous and successful case of intervention, performed in the Panic of 1907 by J.P. Morgan himself. (The original J.P. Morgan was long dead by 1929, though his eponymous son and firm lived on.) In 1907, Morgan engineered a wide variety of rescue measures, making large deposits in struggling banks and large call loans to brokers. These measures are thought to have helped end the panic. The key difference, I think, is that the 1907 panic was a fairly conventional acute crisis in the banks and money markets: recent nominal growth and seasonal demand for currency meant that interest rates were already high, and then a run on banks and trust companies led to more hoarding of currency and extremely high interest rates. Extremely expensive margin borrowing led to a collapse in securities prices, which endangered the banks further (they were more exposed to stocks, through various channels, than they are now), leading to more run pressure, and so on. In this environment, where banks and firms were sound - and money markets would loosen - if only the panic would stop, it was possible for a few decisive interventions to swing momentum in the other direction. The Depression was much different. Thanks to the Federal Reserve, seasonal fluctuations in currency demand and (to an extent) panicked currency hoarding did not lead to a spike in money market rates, which actually fell drastically in late 1929 and 1930 rather than spiking as they did in 1907. Also unlike 1907, the banking crisis did not coincide with the initial stock market collapse - instead, it only started with the Bank of United States failure in December 1930, and in the initial stages was arguably due to fundamental insolvency rather than illiquidity. (Since both nominal real estate prices and food prices collapsed, mortgage default rates - residential, commercial, and farm - were all extremely high.) Bottom line: the crisis of 1929-33 was different enough from the crisis of 1907 that similar measures no longer worked. 

First we need to define the elasticity of substitution $\sigma$. This can be a difficult and confusing concept. (If you want to have your mind blown, look at Table 2 in this survey by Stern, which classifies no fewer than 10 notions of the elasticity of substitution!). That said, the formula that your professor mentions is true only when there are two goods, so I'm going to assume we're restricting ourselves to the two-good case - and there, defining the elasticity of substitution is (for the most part) unambiguous. I'm first going to define it as (minus) the inverse elasticity of the ratio of marginal utilities of $x$ and $y$ to the ratio of their quantities, holding the overall level of utility constant at some $u$: $$\sigma\equiv - \left.\left(\frac{\partial \log(U_x/U_y)}{\log(x/y)}\right)^{-1}\,\right|_{U=u}$$ This measures the curvature of the indifference curve between $x$ and $y$: the higher $\sigma$ (i.e. the more substitutable $x$ and $y$ are), the closer the indifference curve is to a straight line. Now, Hicksian demand minimizes expenditure subject to being on an indifference curve. This involves setting the ratio of marginal utilities equal to the ratio of prices: $$U_x(x^H,y^H)/U_y(x^H,y^H)=p_x/p_y$$ Hence we can reinterpret $\sigma$ as (minus) the elasticity of relative Hicksian demands with respect to relative prices: $$\sigma=-\frac{\partial \log(x^H(p,u)/y^H(p,u))}{\log(p_x/p_y)}\tag{1}$$ Since the denominator has only the relative price $p_x/p_y$, it doesn't depend on how we change this relative price (say, by raising $p_x$ versus lowering $p_y$). Let's assuming that we're just raising $p_x$, and then use your $\varepsilon$ notation for elasticities for simplicity: $$\sigma=-\frac{\partial \log(x^H(p,u)/y^H(p,u))}{\log(p_x)}=\varepsilon^H_{y,p_x}-\varepsilon^H_{x,p_x}\tag{2}$$ At this point, we bring in a simple identity for Hicksian demand, namely that the sum of elasticities of goods with respect to some price, weighted by their shares, is zero (proof included below): $$s_x\varepsilon^H_{x,p_x}+s_y\varepsilon^H_{y,p_x}=0\tag{3}$$ Since $s_x=1-s_y$, we can rewrite (3) as $$(1-s_y)\varepsilon^H_{x,p_x}+s_y\varepsilon^H_{y,p_x}=s_y\cdot(\varepsilon^H_{y,p_x}-\varepsilon^H_{x,p_x})+\varepsilon^H_{x,p_x}=0\tag{4}$$ But the term in parentheses in (4) is just the elasticity of substitution $\sigma$, as we showed in (2). Rearranging, we've proven your professor's statement $$\varepsilon^H_{x,p_x}=-s_y\sigma$$ as desired.
