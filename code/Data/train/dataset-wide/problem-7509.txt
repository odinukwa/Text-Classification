It is true for very special classes of actions and a dense subset of orbits. For instance, in the linear case, for a semisimple semi-Riemannian symmetric space $G/H$, consider the linear isotropy action of the isotropy group $H$ at the base point $x_0=1H$ on the tangent space $T_{x_0}(G/H)$. Then every closed $H$-orbit is semi-Riemannian; in this case the union of closed orbits is an open and dense subset of the ambient space, but it may consist of several components on each of which the signature is different. The case of the adjoint representation of $SL(2,\mathbb R)$ on its Lie algebra is included in this class ($URL$ 

As Aaron and Eric have pointed out, Yamabe's theorem is the statement that an arcwise connected subgroup of a Lie group must be a Lie subgroup. There is also a classical theorem by Cartan and Chevalley, also proved in Hochschild's book, that a connected locally compact topological group admitting a continuous homomorphism into a Lie group which is injective in a neighborhood of the identity must be a Lie group. In particular, if $H$ is a subgroup of a Lie group $G$ and $H$ is connected and locally compact with respect to a topology containing the relative topology, then $H$ is a Lie group (note that Prop. 2.11 in the book by Helgason only addresses local compactness in the relative topology). 

The locally convex space $\mathbb R^{\mathbb N}$ (product of a countable number of copies of $\mathbb R$) equipped with the product topology can be made into an Abelian Lie group with respect to addition and the standard manifold structure. A local basis at the origin consists of open sets of the form $\Pi U_i$ where $U_i$ is an open neighborhood of $0$ in $\mathbb R$ and $U_i\neq\mathbb R$ for fintely many indices $i$ only. Such a neighborhood of $0$ contains nontrivial vector subspaces, so that $G$ contains small subgroups. This example is discussed in "Towards a Lie theory of locally convex groups", Karl-Hermann Neeb, Japan. J. Math. 1, 291–468 (2006). 

A real flag manifold is $M=G/P$ where $G$ is a real semisimple Lie group and $P$ is a parabolic subgroup of $G$. Here parabolic means that the Lie algebra $\mathfrak p$ contains a minimal parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak p_{min}$ of $\mathfrak g$. In order to define this, let $\mathfrak g=\mathfrak k+\mathfrak s$ be a Cartan decomposition, $\mathfrak a$ is a maximal Abelian subspace of $\mathfrak s$, $\mathfrak g =\mathfrak g_0+\sum_{\lambda\in\Sigma} \mathfrak g_\lambda$ be the root decomposition with respect to $\mathfrak a$. We have $\mathfrak g_0=\mathfrak m+\mathfrak a$ where $\mathfrak m$ is the centralizer of $\mathfrak a$ in $\mathfrak k$. Choose a positive subsystem $\Sigma^+$ and let $\mathfrak n = \sum_{\lambda\in\Sigma^+}\mathfrak g_\lambda$ (nilpotent Lie algebra). We get the Iwasawa decomposition $\mathfrak g =\mathfrak k+\mathfrak a+\mathfrak n$. Finally, $\mathfrak p_{min}=\mathfrak m+\mathfrak a+\mathfrak n$. In general, $\mathfrak p = \mathfrak p_{min} + \sum_{\lambda\in\langle\Phi\rangle}\mathfrak g_{-\lambda}$, where $\Phi$ is a subset of of the system of simple roots of $\Sigma$. It turns out $K$, as a subgroup of $G$, acts by left translations on $G/P$ and this action is transitive. In fact, the isotropy algebra at the basepoint is $\mathfrak k\cap\mathfrak p$, and if you count dimensions, you see that the orbit is open. It is also closed by compactness of $K$, so $K/K\cap P=G/P$. It remains to identify the left hand side with an orbit of the isotropy representation of the symmetric space $G/K$, namely, the action of $K$ on $\mathfrak s$, but this is not hard. I can refer you to the nice book "An Introduction to Lie Groups and the Geometry of Homogeneous Spaces", by Andreas Arvanitoyeorgos ($URL$ Edit: Indeed $\mathfrak k\cap\mathfrak p =\mathfrak m + \sum_{\lambda\in\langle\Phi\rangle}(\mathfrak g_{\lambda}+\mathfrak g_{-\lambda})\cap\mathfrak k$ and you can select a point $x\in\mathfrak a\subset\mathfrak s$ such that $\lambda(x)=0$ if and only if $\lambda\in\langle\Phi\rangle$. The desired $K$-orbit is that through $x$. 

Let $G$ be a compact connected semisimple Lie group and fix a left-invariant Riemannian metric $B$ on $G$. Of course, $B$ is completely determined by its value at the identity. Since $G$ is compact and semisimple, the negative of its Cartan-Killing form, which we denote by $\beta$, is a positive definite inner product; the extension of $\beta$ to a left-invariant Riemannian metric is in fact bi-invariant. Next, we diagonalize $B$ with respect to $\beta$, namely, let $f$ be the positive definite symmetric endomorphism of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ of $G$ such that $B(X,Y)=\beta(f(X),Y)$ for all $X$, $Y\in\mathfrak g$. One computes easily from the Koszul formula for the Levi-Civita connection associated to $B$ that $\nabla_XY=\frac12(\mathrm{ad}_XY+f^{-1}\mathrm{ad}_Xf(Y)+f^{-1}\mathrm{ad}_Yf(X))$ for left-invariant vector fields $X$, $Y\in\mathfrak g$. In particular $\nabla_XX=f^{-1}\mathrm{ad}_Xf(X)$ and we see that the one-parameter associated to $X$ is a geodesic if and only if $\nabla_XX=0$ if and only if $[X,f(X)]=0$. In particular, this condition is satisfied if $X$ is an eigenvector of $f$. Note that the Koszul formula above also gives $B(\nabla_XX,Z)=B([Z,X],X])=\frac12\frac{d}{dt}||\mathrm{Ad}_{\exp tZ}X||^2$ at $t=0$, which checks Denis guess that $t\mapsto\exp(tX)$ is a geodesic if and only if $X$ is a critical point of the norm-square in its adjoint orbit. In particular, there are infinitely many one-parameter groups which are geodesics if the rank of $G$ is bigger than one. 

Let $\pi$ be a complex representation of the compact connected Lie group $G$ (no need for semisimplicity here) on a (finite-dimensional) vector space $V$. We say that $\pi$ is of real type if it comes from a representation of $G$ on a real vector space by extension of scalars, and we say that $\pi$ is of quaternionic type if it comes from a representation of G on a quaternionic vector space by restriction of scalars. If $\pi$ is neither of real type nor of quaternionic type, we say that $\pi$ is of complex type. Let $\rho$ be a real irreducible representation of $G$ on a real vector space $W$. By Schur’s lemma, the centralizer of $\rho(G)$ in $\mathrm{End}(W)$ is an associative real division algebra, thus, by Frobenius’ theorem, isomorphic to one of (a) $\mathbb R$, (b) $\mathbb H$ or (c) $\mathbb C$. The relation between real and complex representations is, respectively, that: (a) the complexification $\rho^c$ is irreducible (and we say that $\rho$ is absolutely irreducible) and $\rho^c = \pi$ is a representation of real type; (b) the complexification $\rho^c$ is reducible and $\rho^c=\pi\oplus\pi$ where $\pi$ is an irreducible representation of quaternionic type; (c) the complexification $\rho^c$ is reducible and $\rho^c=\pi\oplus\pi^*$ where $\pi$ is an irreducible representation of complex type and $\pi^*$ is not equivalent to $\pi$ (where $\pi^*$ denotes the induced representation on $V^*=\bar V$). Also $\rho $ is a real form of $\pi$ in the first case ($\rho^c=\pi$), but $\rho$ is $\pi$ viewed as a real representation in the other two cases ($\rho=\pi^r$). Regarding the adjoint representation of a compact simple Lie group, it is always absolutely irreducible. Simplicity of the group is equivalent to irreducibility of the representation. Even in the semisimple case, admiting and invariant complex structure would mean that the Lie group is a complex Lie group viewed as real, not possible due to the compactness. Cartan's theory of real representations of semisimple Lie algebras is masterfully presented in modern form in ESI Lectures in Mathematics and Physics Arkady L.

Irreducible complex flag manifolds are of the form $X=G/P=G_u/K$ where $G$ is a complex simple Lie group and $P$ is a parabolic subgroup, and $G_u$ is a compact real form of $G$ and $K=P\cap G_u$. As a rule, the connnected automorphism group $Aut^0(X)$ coincides with $G$, with the only exceptions: 

It is known that for a simply-connected compact Riemannian symmetric space, the cut locus of a point coincides with its first conjugate locus, see e.g. the book by Cheeger and Ebin, "Comparison theorems in Riemannian geometry", Theorem 5.13. So the answer to (1) is no. Examples of compact symmetric spaces include spheres, projective spaces (real, complex, quaternionic, octonionic), Grassmannian manifolds, Lie groups with bi-invariant metrics etc. So you see that this class of Riemannian manifolds is not small. Further, the cut locus of a point in a symmetric space can be explictly described, and it is in general not a point. In fact, it is a highly non-trivial result, proved by Berger (Green in the $2$-dimensional case), that a manifold with the property that the cut locus of any point is reduced to a single point ("wiedersehens manifold") has to be isometric to a round sphere. 

I think you are right to say that both homogeneous spaces are diffeomorphic as smooth manifolds. Therefore if one of them is a symmetric space, then one can transfer this structure to the other one. However it is common usage and an abuse of language to say that $G/K$ is a symmetric space to mean that $(G,K)$ is a symmetric pair, that is, $G$ is a connected Lie group and $K$ is an open subgroup in the fixed point set of an involutive automorphism of $G$. This is essentially equivalent to your Lie algebraic formulation. In the strict latter sense, $SO(2n+1)/U(n)$ is not a symmetric space. 

A very simple example is a cone of revolution in $\mathbb R^3$ minus the vertex. The restricted holonomy (that is, that generated by parallel transport along loops homotopic to a point, which is also the connected component of the full holonomy group) is trivial because the metric is flat. On the other hand, by flatenning the cone on a plane one sees that going once around the vertex by parallel transport gives a rotation of angle $2\pi(1-\sin\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle of opening of the cone. Since the fundamental group of the cone is $\mathbb Z$, the holonomy group is either a finite or a countable dense subgroup of $SO(2)$ according to whether $1-\sin\theta$ is rational or not. Edit: The cone is not compact! But the connected component of the holonomy group of a Riemannian manifold is always compact. 

My favorite text is chapter 8 in Joseph Wolf's book "Spaces of constant curvature". I have a copy of the 5th edition, published by Publish of Perish, but a 6th edition by AMS Chelsea has recently come out. I don't claim it is an easy read, you need to work a lot on the details, but it gets to the point very efficiently. Perhaps it is fair to say that one can use it as a guide and complement the arguments as needed using the books of Helgason and Loos (2nd volume). In particular, the classification of symmetric spaces is done in a rather elementary way, up to the case of involutions of $E_6$ which requires a bit of theory of roots (this part is best looked up in Loos' book). 

Of course, the two notions are independent one from the other, but often one of them implies the other under some additional hypotheses. For instance: A topological vector space is finite dimensional if and only if it is locally compact. A locally compact topological group with no small subgroups is a finite dimensional Lie group. (Gleason-Montgomery-Zippin) A locally arcwise topological group admitting a continuous injective map into a finite dimensional metric space is a finite dimensional Lie group. (Gleason-Palais) I would like to collect results of this sort in general, and especially concerning topological groups. Does anyone know of any other significant examples? 

Proposition 7 in $URL$ contains a criterion (including a formula and proof; the proof is on page 131) to decide the type of the complex irreducible representation $\pi_\lambda$ of the compact connected semisimple Lie group $G$, where $\lambda$ is the highest weight, in terms of a maximal subset $\mathcal O=\{\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_\ell\}\subset\Delta^+$ of strongly orthogonal roots. Namely, $\pi_\lambda$ is unitary (not self-contragredient) if and only if $\lambda$ does not belong to the real span of $\mathcal O$. Otherwise it is symplectic (resp. orthogonal), meaning that it leaves a quaternionic (resp. real) structure invariant, if and only if $$ k(\lambda) = \sum_{i=1}^\ell \frac{(\beta_i,\lambda)-(\beta_i,s_0\lambda)}{(\beta_i,\beta_i)} $$ is an odd (resp. even) integer. Here $(,)$ is the inner product defined from the Killing form, and $$s_0 := s_{\beta_1}\cdots s_{\beta_\ell}$$ is the Weyl group element that maps the Weyl chamber to its negative. The idea of the given proof is essentially to reduce the problem to a subgroup of $G$ isomorphic to the product of $\ell$ copies of $SU(2)$. The integer $k(\lambda)$ has an interesting meaning. Let $\mathcal U^k(\mathfrak g_\mathbb C)$ be the k-th level in the natural filtration of the universal enveloping algebra of the complexified Lie algebra of $G$. Choose a highest weight vector $v_\lambda$ for $\pi_\lambda$. Then $s_0v_\lambda \in\mathcal U^{k(\lambda)}(\mathfrak g_\mathbb C)v_\lambda$ but $s_0v_\lambda\not\in\mathcal U^{k'}(\mathfrak g_\mathbb C)\lambda$ for any $k'<k(\lambda)$. Here $$ s_0v_\lambda = \pi(X_{-\beta_1})^{n_1}\cdots\pi(X_{-\beta_\ell})^{n_\ell}v_\lambda$$ where $$n_i=\frac{(\beta_i,\lambda)-(\beta_i,s_0\lambda)}{(\beta_i,\beta_i)} $$ and the $X_{-\beta_i}$ are root vectors. The table above lists the numbers $n_i$ for the fundamental representations of simple groups. 

A rational representation $(G,V)$ of a complex reductive linear algebraic group is called multiplicity-free if the decomposition of $\mathbb C[V]$ into irreducible $G$-modules contains each irreducible $G$-module with multiplicity at most one. Part of the importance of such representations lies in the fact that they serve to explain several phenomena in invariant theory and harmonic analysis (e.g. Peter-Weyl theorem). There are several different characterizations of multiplicity free representations, among them: any Borel subgroup has an open (dense) orbit; the principal orbits of a compact real form are coisotropic submanifolds with respect to an invariant (real) symplectic structure. If $(G,V)$ is multiplicity free then $G$ has finitely many orbits in $V$. In particular, it is visible in the sense that $V$ has finitely many nilpotent orbits, and hence the multiplicity of any nonzero weight is at most one, see Kac, V. G. Some remarks on nilpotent orbits. J. Algebra 64 (1980), no. 1, 190–213. It is apparent from the classification of (indecomposable) multiplicity free representations that they are weight multiplicity free, namely, the multiplicity of any weight is at most one. Is there a direct proof of this fact?
