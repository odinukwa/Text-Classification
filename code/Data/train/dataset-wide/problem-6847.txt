Different consumer preferences will lead to different properties of the consumer's willingness to trade one good for another. For instance, suppose that consumers preferences are linear in the consumption of either good: $U=\beta_x x + \beta_y y$ where $\beta_x$,$\beta_y$ are positive constants The marginal utility of $x$ would be $\beta_x$ and the marginal utility of $y$ would be $\beta_y$, and the MRS would be $\frac{\beta_x}{\beta_y}$, also a constant. This tells us the consumer would be willing to trade between $x$ and $y$ at a constant rate. An alternative would be consumption of each good entering utility in a multiplicative fashion (Cobb Douglas), for instance $U=xy$. The marginal utility of $x$ would be $y$ and the marginal utility of $y$ would be $x$ and so the MRS would be $\frac{y}{x}$, which indeed would depend on consumption. In this example, the MRS decreases as consumption of $x$ rises. As the consumer enjoys more $x$ he is willing to give up less and less $y$ for another unit of $x$. So it's not entirely trivial whether the MRS depends on consumption, whether it does or not depends on how you model consumer's preferences. 

Australia is now conducting a survey on same sex marriage, to decide if they take the vote to the parliament or not. Although it is called a survey, the population is treating it as a referendum. The government could decide on its own to legalize the same-sex marriage, the same way it decides on topics such as immigration laws. Are there any economic arguments that help a government to decide which topics are polled from the population and which are not? 

The title "What is the purpose of increasing the minimum wage?" and the question "is there an economic reason as to why a higher minimum wage would benefit the economy?" while overlapping, are not necessarily identical. To answer the latter, minimum wage earners have the highest velocity money in the economy. By this, I mean that when I was working, the next incremental \$1000 was saved or paid debt, but not spent. Our budget was from the lower 60-70% of our income, and we weren't spending to keep up with anyone. But the minimum wage earner is likely living check to check, and has a list of needs that the next \$1, \$10, etc, is going to be spent on. The \$1/hr raise is \$2000/yr that goes right into the economy as spending. There is also the consideration that some number of minimum wage workers are also on government assistance programs for food, housing, etc. If the minimum wage were raised, the assistance will drop, perhaps not dollar for dollar, but in aggregate, some fraction of that increase employers will spend results in lesser demand on the taxpayer. The New York Times has published research concluding that employment is somewhat inelastic at the margin, that a minimum wage increase doesn't immediately result in fewer jobs. 

The dotted line is just to help you read the scale and compare the isoquantas at each production level. It touches all the isoquantas at the point where you have equal inputs of labour and capital. The rest of the explanation is on the figure itself - it's just an example of increasing / constant / decreasing returns to scale. 

From: ILO Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935 (No. 47) This later convention has been ratified by 15 countries only. Further recommendations on the reduction of hours were made in 1962 (source ILO). The ILO also has a page summarizing the work done in the last 100 years on working time, which is a great resource to learn more. 

The question itself has merit, but isolating the variables seems tough to me. The beginning of such a study would start with the Gini coefficient which is a numerical method of determining income distribution with a single number. You'd then seek to correlate Gini with a country's per capita GDP. As a thought experiment, we'd agree that having a select elite 100,000 people and the rest in poverty would be economically awful for any country. The flip side, every family right at the average, would have its own potential economic issues. That average wouldn't be enough for a number of luxury items that the top 10% can afford today. The economy would have to provide more of the goods and services the gap from median to average can't afford and less of the aforementioned luxury items. Those goods' demand wouldn't drop to zero, of course. If the $75K earner really desires the Ferrari, he can save up for one, but the market supply/demand would surely shift for such goods. It would seem to me that the level of spending would be higher and could actually result in higher GDP growth, as those earning the average income tend to spend, not save, their marginal dollars. 

Insurance providers in high-risk areas tend to increase the premiums, particularly for re-insurance (Froot, 2001). Some insurers will also leave the market, with others coming in (Grace, Klein & Liu 2005) Semi-related: One paper with a 1970-2002 analysis of disasters and financial flows suggests that in poorer countries the migrant's remittances increase after the hurricanes covering $\frac 45$ of the damages, but in richer countries it only stimulates lending, not fully offsetting the losses (Yang 2008). 

The variation that is being used to identify $\beta_3$ is basically the individual level deviations away from both the individual mean and average across individuals for the year. So to the degree that your variable of interest is varying over time but does not vary in a differential manner across individuals, you will fail to detect its effect. 

Just thinking out loud here, not saying this is correct others may have a better idea. I'm going to roll with this assumption that you are using best econometric practices so that you trust your estimates and want to take action based on them. (1) The partial effect of going from $I=0$ to $I=1$ would be $E(Y_1|I=1,N=\overline{N})-E(Y_1|I=0,N=\overline{N})$ $=\hat{\alpha_3}+\hat{\alpha_4}+\hat{\alpha_5}\overline{N}$ When irrigation is already positive, the marginal effect of irrigation on yields just be $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}=\hat{\alpha_3}+2\hat{\alpha_4}I+\hat{\alpha_5}N$ (2) So you are curious what level of Nitrogen makes it so that the marginal effect of nitrogen is the same as the partial effect of irrigation? I think you could get at this by finding the $I^*$ and $N^*$ such that $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}=\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial N}$? We've already found $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}$ above, so we need to calculate $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial N}$ $=\hat{\alpha_1}+2\hat{\alpha_2}N+\hat{\alpha_5}I$ From here $\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial I}|_{N=N^*,I=I^*}=\frac{\partial E(Y_1|N,I)}{\partial N}|_{N=N^*, I=I^*}$ $\hat{\alpha_3}+2\hat{\alpha_4}I^*+\hat{\alpha_5}N^*=\hat{\alpha_1}+2\hat{\alpha_2}N^*+\hat{\alpha_5}I^*$ $\rightarrow (\hat{\alpha_5}-2\hat{\alpha_2})N^*=(\hat{\alpha_1}-\hat{\alpha_3})+(\hat{\alpha_5}-+2\hat{\alpha_4})I^*$ $\rightarrow N^*=\frac{(\hat{\alpha_1}-\hat{\alpha_3})+(\hat{\alpha_5}-+2\hat{\alpha_4})I^*}{(\hat{\alpha_5}-2\hat{\alpha_2})}$ I bet the optimal irrigation and fertilizer decision would equate the marginal product of fertilizer per dollar spent on fertilizer with the marginal product of irrigation per dollar spent on irrigation which would be $\frac{\hat{\alpha_3}+\hat{\alpha_4}+\hat{\alpha_5}N}{P_{irrigation}}=\frac{\hat{\alpha_1}+2\hat{\alpha_2}N+\hat{\alpha_5}I}{P_{fertilizer}}$ 

Of course there are limits to this, but those numbers are outside the range of proposed changes to the minimum wage. "Why not just raise the wage to \$50/hr and we can all make \$100K" is a red herring. For a sane view of the issue, focus needs to be on the numbers that are real, in the US, the \$10 level from the current \$7.50. The aggregate extra income to the workers will far exceed the lost wage of those who lose their jobs and there are those who suggest that this money will actually create more jobs as it will quickly create more activity to the businesses catering to these families. Edit - This was written when there was a distinction between the question title and what was asked in the body text. My answer still mentions the difference, no longer there. Also, per comment request, I linked to the article, but links break. If the link breaks for this Times' article I'll link to a copy of it that I've archived. 

have variation in within-individual time paths across individuals (i.e. individual heterogeneity, must be varying at $it$ not just homogeneous across $i$ within $t$.) 

So we are indeed "controlling for" those time invariant unobserved confounding factors, as well as average differences in observed factors across individuals with panel fixed effects. We are indeed "controlling for" covariates that have common variation across individuals within a given year with time fixed effects. Let $y_{it}=\beta_i+\lambda_t+X_{it}\beta+\epsilon_{it}$ be the specification with $i=1\dots N$ and $t=1\dots T$. Initially you do the panel demeaning, which creates the transformed variable $\overset{..}{y}=(y_{it}-\overline{y_i})=\underbrace{(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)}_\text{panel demeaned time dummies}+\text{other demeaned terms unrelated to year FE}$. This removes the $\beta_i$, along with any other time invariant confounding factors. Then you demean with year FE, doing the transformation $\overset{...}{y}=\overset{..}{y_i}-\overline{y_t}$ where $\overline{y_t}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}y_{jt}$. $=\underbrace{(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)}_\text{want to show this = 0}+\text{other demeaned terms unrelated to year FE}$ . . since $\lambda_t$ is common to all $i$ in a given year, $\sum_{i=1}^{N} \lambda_t=N\lambda_t$ and similarly for $\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j=N \frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j$ . . $=(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)-\frac{1}{N}(N \lambda_t -N \frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)+\text{other demeaned terms unrelated to year FE}$ . . distribute the $\frac{1}{N}$ . . $=\underbrace{(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)-(\lambda_t-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{j=1}^{T}\lambda_j)}_\text{=0}+\text{other demeaned terms unrelated to year FE}$ $=\text{other demeaned terms unrelated to year FE}$ 

When you look at case number 1, the Fed lends money to the bank, the bank can ask more than the assets it owns (e.g. asking for 2M when all the cash and bank assets are worth 1M). This means that the debt of the bank is accounted for and will be paid back with interest - but it is not backed. If the bank doesn't pay, even seizing all the bank's assets wont pay the debt back. 

To be clear, when we say a unit fixed effect in econometrics, we are referencing any time invariant observed or unobserved determinant of the dependent variable. It's easy to show that all of these are "wiped out" by the individual level demeaning. The individual level demeaning also controls for the average differences in observed and unobserved independent variables across individuals. Individual fixed effects in the model mean that any source of bias must be time varying. Thus, if someone argues that your variable is endogenous on account of some variable that is constant in your sample, you have already controlled for that by only using variation over time to identify your point estimate. So with the inclusion of these individual fixed effects you can focus on determining time varying covariates that determine your independent variable. Time fixed effects will strip away any changes in variables that are the same for all individuals in a given period of time. For instance, if "individuals" are grouped together in the same state or municipality, and there are some changes in state or municipal policies for all individuals in that year,then the time fixed effects could strip away these effects without a need for measuring them. This only leaves concern over variables that have different time paths within different individuals. So with both time and panel fixed effects, to identify the effect of your variable of interest, exogeneity concerns aside, that variable of interest must
