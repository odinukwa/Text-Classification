You don't drop parameters - you drop explanatory variables. Perfect colinearity is first and foremost a sample problem, it relates to the actual data series you have, not to the theoretical relation between two regressors, although, if you have a large enough sample, it is valid to think that the colinearity property may hold at population level also. Assume the model $$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_1 +u$$ Say that you try to run OLS and you get a message of perfect or near-perfect co-linearity between $x_1$ and $x_2$. This means that the data tell you that an affine relation exists like $$x_2 =\delta_0 + \delta x_1$$ But this means that the regression specification is $$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2(\delta_0 + \delta x_1) +u$$ $$\implies y = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1x_1 +u$$ $$\gamma_0 = b_0 + b_2\delta_0,\;\;\; \gamma_1=b_1 +b_2\delta_1$$ This does not negate or contradict the theory. You just found out that the two variables are in such a relation between them, that their effect on the dependent variable cannot be separately estimated using linear methods like least-squares. You didn't find out that one of them has no effect. 

The community bot bumped this to front page, so let's turn my comments into an answer. The OP makes a mistake in formulating the problem, as follows: For the "not study" case, he says that the agent will have utility from "the saved fees", hence his last-last equation $$\mathbb{E}[u(\text{wealth if not-study})] = (F+0)^a= F^a \tag{1} $$ It follows that currently the agent has wealth $F$ (otherwise how could he "save" the fees...) This comes for a "state-of-the-workd" approach. But when considering what will happen to the agent if it studies, the OP adopts a "income-flow" approach. It writes $$\mathbb{E}[u(\text{wealth if not-study})] = p(y_1 - F)^a + (1-p)(y_2 - F)^a \tag{2}$$ ...ignoring the fact that $F$ is already available. If we wanted to describe a different situation, where the agent has no wealth, and it contemplates whether it would be beneficial to study and pay the tuition fees out of his future income, then we should use eq. $(2)$, but together not with eq. $(1)$ but with $\mathbb{E}[u(\text{wealth if not-study})] = 0$. In Expected Utility Theory we use the "state-of-the world" approach. So the correct equation to go together with eq. $(1)$ (which implies that the agent has already and so certain wealth $F$) is $$\mathbb{E}[u(\text{wealth if study})] = p(F+y_1 - F)^a + (1-p)(F+y_2 - F)^a \\= py_1^a +(1-p)y_2^a \tag{3}$$ Note what we are doing here. In each of the two possible states of the wrold given that the agent will study, the agent starts with wealth $F$ which he will sacrifice in order to study, and gain income $y_1$ or $y_2$. Regarding the question 

Except of the purely descriptive aspect, "elastic demand", or more accurately, regions of the demand schedule where demand elasticity with respect to price is higher than unity, in absolute terms, is linked to the basic monopoly theory, since the monopolist maximizes profits at a point of the demand schedule where "demand is elastic". Define the demand point-elasticity with respect to price as $$\eta = \frac {\partial Q }{ \partial P}\cdot \frac {P}{Q} \Rightarrow \frac {\partial Q }{ \partial P} = \eta \cdot \frac {Q}{P} \tag{1}$$ Note that algebraically, the elasticity is a negative number, with the sign indicating the direction of influence, since $\partial Q / \partial P <0$. The profit function of a monopolist is $$\pi = P\cdot Q(P) - C(Q(P)) \tag{2}$$ The first-order condition for a maximum with respect to price is $$\frac {\partial \pi}{\partial P} = 0 \Rightarrow Q + P\frac {\partial Q }{ \partial P} - MC\cdot \frac {\partial Q }{ \partial P} = 0 \tag{3}$$ Inserting $(1)$ into $(3)$ we have $$Q + P\cdot \eta \cdot \frac {Q}{P} - MC\cdot \eta \cdot \frac {Q}{P} = 0$$ $$\Rightarrow 1 + \eta - \eta \cdot \frac {MC}{P} =0$$ $$\Rightarrow - \eta \cdot \frac {MC}{P} = -\eta -1 $$ $$\Rightarrow |\eta| \cdot \frac {MC}{P} = |\eta| -1$$ $$\Rightarrow P^* = \frac {|\eta|}{|\eta|-1} MC \tag{4}$$ $(4)$ is essentially an implicit relation since $\eta$ is a function of price also, but it provides a specific insight: Since we naturally expect that price will be positive, we see that we must have $|\eta| >1$: the price will necessarily be set at a level where "demand is elastic", i.e. at a point on the demand schedule where the point price elasticity of demand is higher than unity, in absolute terms. 

The short answer is "No", if by "small number" we mean something no more than "five". The two characteristics you mention are rather different: "high growth" describes a rate of evolution. Now, it is standard corporate speak to say "we are in an excellent position to grow" to express in a diplomatic way the fact that you have hit rock-bottom. Given the unprecedented fall in Greece's GDP, to obtain some positive growth rate it is not that hard, since the base has shrunk so much. As for "high employment", if by that we mean reverting back to the country's "natural rate of unemployment" (which was $7-8\%$ for decades), to do that in $10$ years, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that one would need $50$ billion euros additional investments yearly for $10$ years in a row to achieve that. This represents a $128\%$ increase in yearly investments from current level, or almost "two times and a half more" than now. Yearly. From a structural point of view, what is required is a massive increase in Greek exports, or a massive increase in import-substituting economic activities. These things do not happen "in a small number of years". The first has to deal with international competition, the second requires extended geographical and sectoral relocation of productive resources. But Greece returning to "high growth-high employment" was not and is not the main concern of the creditors -not unsurprisingly, and perhaps rightfully, since it should be the main concern of the Greeks and their (our) political system. As to whether the approach taken by the creditors do indeed serve their own interests, is a totally different question, and a very complex to answer -because we would have first to clearly identify "their interests". 

A bit more intuitive formulation of a sufficient condition for the (weak) law of large numbers to hold(which is the one associated with the consistency property), for the average of a collection of non-independent, non-identically distributed random variables with finite variances and covariances, is the following (the "Markov condition"): $$\text {Var}\left (\frac 1{n}\sum_{t=1}^n x_t\right) \rightarrow 0 $$ This simply says that it is sufficient that the variance of the average goes to zero, which has intuition. Decomposing, $$\text {Var}\left (\frac 1{n}\sum_{t=1}^n x_t\right) = \frac 1{n^2}\sum_{t=1}^n \text {Var}(x_t) +\frac 1{n^2}\sum_{t\neq s} \text {Cov}(x_t,x_s) \rightarrow 0$$ Since all variances are finite, the first sum goes to zero. As regards the second sum, if each element is correlated with all others irrespective of how many there are, then this (double) sum has $n^2-n$ strictly non-zero elements, i.e of order $O(n^2)$. If this is the case, then it doesn't go to zero, and the sufficient condition does not hold. The easiest way to see this is to assume that all rv's are equicorrelated: if $$\text {Cov}(x_t,x_s) = c\;\forall t,s \implies \text {Var}\left (\frac 1{n}\sum_{t=1}^n x_t\right) = \frac 1{n^2}\sum_{t=1}^n \text {Var}(x_t) +\left(1-\frac 1n\right) c\rightarrow c$$ By the way this is how one can glimpse why, with "everybody with everybody" correlation, the sample mean remains a random variable irrespective of the sample size. So what it takes to obtain the weak $\text{LLN}$? We may assume $m-$dependence, namely that each rv is correlated only with $m$ others, with $m$ being a fixed number. This will send the variance of the sample mean to zero. We may assume that as the sample size increases, the number of non-zero covariances increases with it, but not at the same rate: $m(n)/n \rightarrow 0$. If we want to maintain that each rv is correlated with every other (which is the case of the OP since it deals with estimation residuals), then we arrive at the condition stated in @Oliv's answer: it has intuitive meaning (and justification) as "covariance diminishes as distance increases" only when there is a natural ordering of the sample (temporal or spatial). When the sample is bona-fide cross-sectional and one can re-order the rv's at will, the condition is just mathematical. 

Lancaster initiated what has come to be called "Hedonic Demand Analysis", or "Hedonic Price Analysis". This field of analysis has been rigorously housed in microeconomic theory in the seminal paper Rosen, S. (1974). Hedonic prices and implicit markets: product differentiation in pure competition. Journal of political economy, 82(1), 34-55. It has also entered in a very important way applied economics and policy, since, for example, for many years now USA calculates the official Consumer Price Index using the "Hedonic" framework (mainly in order to accomodate changes in quality). There is, as one can understand, a vast literature on the matter.
