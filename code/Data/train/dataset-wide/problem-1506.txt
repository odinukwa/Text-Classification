Rogue planets can be designated as rogue planets due to one of two possible scenarios: 1) the "rogue planet" formed as a sub-brown dwarf, or 2) the planet was ejected from its home star system. I want to make it clear that here, I'm interested in objects of the second category - objects that are similar to the planets we find in our solar system. Could a rogue planet, having been ejected from its home star system, be gravitationally re-captured by another star system? If so, would it be likely to disrupt other bodies in the stellar system (I know this depends on size; let's say that the rogue planet is a "Hot Jupiter")? I realize that we don't know a whole lot about these objects (let's face it, we only know of a handful), so I'm not looking for examples, but any logical answers would be pretty helpful. 

Pollux is $\sim10\text{ pc}$ away from the Solar System, which is about 1% of the thickness of the thick disk (Capella is barely farther). Essentially, it's in the same plane as the Solar System; that's an insignificant distance. There are stars in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo, which compose different populaitons based on metallicity. In the thin disk are Population I stars, which are high in metals. In the halo (and thin disk, to some extent) are Population II stars, which are lower in metals and on average older than Population I stars. The Sun is a Population I star in the disk. There may also be a sub-population of Population II stars in the thick disk. Halo stars certainly do not compose the majority of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Most stars are contained within the thin disk, thick disk, and bulge. 

Thermal equilibrium Thermal equilibrium relies strongly on the idea of equipartition of (kinetic) energy. In a stellar system, this means that the total kinetic energy is divided evenly amongst all the stars. This doesn't imply that the velocities are all the same; they can't, because not all the masses are the same. Dynamical equilibrium Dynamical equilibrium means that over dynamical timescales, the system is stable - basically, it will not succumb to core collapse due to a gravothermal instability. Note that it may not be possible for a system to reach thermal equilibrium, even if it is in dynamical equilibrium. In a system with two main types of stars, it must satisfy the Spitzer stability condition (see Fregeau et al. (2001) and these results): $$\left(\frac{M_2}{M_1}\right)\left(\frac{m_2}{m_1}\right)^{3/2}<0.16$$ where $M_1$ and $M_2$ are the total masses of types 1 and 2. Virial equilibrium Virial equilibrium comes about when the system satisfies the virial theorem (see Meylan (2000)), i.e. $$2\langle T\rangle+\langle V\rangle=0$$ where $T$ and $V$ are kinetic and potential energies. 

That's the great thing about outer space. There normally aren't many particles around that could slow down a spacecraft via drag or friction. If you give something a push in outer space - somewhere that unrealistically is free from any gravitational interaction with other objects - it will travel forever. Objects travel through the ISM via Newton's first law - an object in motion tends to stay in motion. 

A proposal for the minimum mass of a gas cloud before collapsing to become a star was made by James Jeans; because of this, it was termed the Jeans mass. It is calculated as $$M=\frac{4 \pi}{3} \rho R^3$$ where $\rho$ is density and $R$ is the radius of the cloud - one half of the Jeans length, which is dependent on the speed of sound and the density of the cloud. It was originally thought that any mass above the Jeans mass would not be in hydrostatic equilibrium, and would collapse. But Jeans didn't realize that any regions outside this radius would also collapse. So his arguments were flawed, though they're still sound in many applications. 

This circumplanetary disk is likely a leftover from the system's original protoplanetary disk. It may also be leading to the formation of an exomoon. 

Notice that there's a prominent region shaped like an inverted U in which there are few detection points, which I have crudely enclosed: 

First, let's talk about size. The Pillars of Creation aren't just "giant gas bubbles"; they're clouds of gas and dust four light-years long. That's enormous, about 36,000,000,000,000 kilometers. Proxima Centauri b, on the other hand, has a diameter of 0.8-1.4 Earth diameters; one Earth diameter is approximately 12,700 kilometers. That's miniscule, in comparison. Let's look at the angular diameters of the objects. The general formula is $$\delta=2\arctan\left(\frac{\text{diameter}}{2\cdot\text{distance}}\right)$$ where the angular diameter is in radians. The Pillars of Creation are 6,500 light-years away, conservatively, giving just them an angular length of $3.52\times10^{-2}$ degrees. Proxima Centauri b is 4 light-years away, with an angular diameter of about $2.02\times10^{-8}$ degrees. 6 orders of magnitude is nothing to sneeze at. Additionally, the Pillars of Creation are located in an emission nebula. Light from the young stars that have just been born ionizes gas in the Eagles Nebula, which in turn emits the light. The dark gas and dust in the Pillars of Creation stands out quite sharply in all of this, making it easy to see. 

It depends on the distance from the central body. This gives the temperature $T$ at a given point as a function of the distance from that point to the center ($R$): $$T(R)=\left[\frac{3GM \dot{M}}{8 \pi \sigma R^3} \left(1-\sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{inner}}}{R}} \right) \right]^{\frac{1}{4}}$$ where $G$, $\pi$, and $\sigma$ are the familiar constants, $M$ is the mass of the central body (and $\dot{M}$ is the rate of accretion onto the body), and $R_{\text{inner}}$ is the inner radius of the disk - possibly (if the object is a black hole) the Schwarzschild radius $R_s$, in which case we can simplify this a little more. So the temperature in the accretion disk is far from constant. Whether or not there is plasma depends on the exact nature of the disk, the central object and the region around it. For example, a supermassive black hole may have different matter in its disk than that of a stellar-mass black hole. I should think, though, that black holes in binary systems accreting mass from a companion should have plasma in their accretion disks, and supermassive black holes might also have plasma from nearby stars. 

Multiple star systems are usually nested like this - binaries and triple systems inside more binaries. I would image it's rare to have any other setup, like four stars orbiting together, because such a system would be highly unstable. You really need to nest the stars, with large separations between components (i.e. the distance between Nu Scorpii AB and CD must be much larger than the distance between Nu Scorpii A and Nu Scorpii B). 

In other words, the spacecraft will be moved so they are on the opposite side of Mars as the comet. They can't be there for long - after all, they orbit Mars extremely quickly. But, fortunately, they don't have to be there for long. As this says, 

For some really interesting results, see the graphs of semi-major axis vs. time from the various four-, five-, and six- planet models of NesvornÃ½ & Morbidelli (2012). There are some incredible oscillation among the orbits of Uranus and Neptune in some of the simulations, which is eventually slowly damped. 

These objects would fill in the space between the Kuiper Belt/scattered disc and the Oort Cloud itself. 

The reason that there isn't more matter in a given stellar system is that the star dominates the surrounding area. It pulls in nearly everything around it during its early life. Much of the region of the collapsing cloud is made of molecular $H_2$, and so it is pulled in and used for fusion. Now the question translates to 'Why isn't the protoplanetary disk more massive'? The answer is that when the disk formed, much of the matter that was in its inner reaches spiraled into the Sun. This is partly due to the Poynting-Robertson effect, where photons from the Sun pull dust grains in. Over billions of years, the star can accumulate much of the matter than was originally close to it in the disk. 

The "% spent" refers to the status of spending at the time. That's not completely helpful, because that's only broken down by instrument sections. For example, "Northrop-Grumman" doesn't tell you the salary breakdown, as you mentioned. 

I wasn't able to find an explicit equation for this, but it's calculable. The frost line is a certain distance from a star in a stellar nebula such that the temperature is about 150 Kelvin. If you know the mass of the star, you can use the mass-luminosity relation: $$\left(\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} \right)=\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \right)^a$$ Re-arrange that to solve for the luminosity. The inverse-square law says that the intensity of power drops off as the distance from the source increases: $$I=\frac{P}{4 \pi r^2}$$ You can solve for $r$ if you can figure out the required intensity: $$r=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{P}{\pi I}}$$ Here, $P \approx L$. Figure out the necessary intensity to heat the nebula to 150 K and you've found the frost line. 

Yes The gravitational field from an object does extend infinitely far out into space, if there is an infinite space for it to fill. There isn't any sort of limit to how far an object's gravitational influence can travel. However, there is a catch: Gravity travels at a finite speed (the speed of light). If gravity propagated infinitely fast, any two objects would be guaranteed to be affected by each other. However, because it is not infinitely fast, two objects that have never been less than 13.8 billion light-years apart (the universe is only 13.8 billion years old) could only now be feeling each other's influence. If the Sun were to suddenly explode, it might not feel the influence of an object 13.8 billion that has never been less than 13.8 billion light-years away. 

They also suggest that encounters with other planets could be responsible for some cases of this (although an angle of 90Â° makes this seem rather improbable); a related idea that has been applied to Kuiper Belt Objects is the Kozai mechanism. The companion to this theory is that the star was perturbed by an encounter, possibly with a companion (as I discussed earlier). Xue et al. discuss similar scenarios, focusing in part on "dynamic" interactions between planets. Direct tidal interactions between the star and the planet are also a possible scenario. 

We can calculate the semi-minor axis, $b$ from the equation $$e=\sqrt{1-\frac{b^2}{a^2}}\to b=0.379\text{ AU}$$ We can also calculate the distance to the focus from the center of the ellipse, $f$, as $$f=ae=0.078\text{ AU}$$ I used Mathematica's to plot Mercury's orbit using these parameters, along with Earth's. Earth's semi-major axis is 1 AU, and with an eccentricity of 0.016, its semi-minor axis is about 1 to three significant figures; I've treated it as a circle. Mathematica gives 

The NRAO has another article on it, which goes slightly more in-depth into the subject. The official site of the Messenger mission is slightly more cautious: 

I came across this gif showing supernova discoveries from the late 19th century to 2010. Here's the data in 2010: 

Yes, Pluto is still a dwarf planet. According to the IAU website, it still fits the criteria for a dwarf planet, fails to meet the criteria for a planet, and still carries the "dwarf planet" label, whatever its future status may be. I'm sorry I can't provide a longer or more detailed answer, but this is really a yes-or-no question. 

Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics The distribution of masses can be quantified in an initial mass function, typically given in the form $$\xi(m)=km^{-\alpha}$$ When you integrate this over a range of masses, you can find how many stars are within that range. Not surprisingly, this number gets lower and lower as you slide the endpoints to more massive stars. You can see this decrease from the fact that $\xi'(m)<0$, so long as $k>0$ and $\alpha>0$ - which is assumed by the model, according to empirical data. 

Ahh, I see you've met our friend, the hypothetical star known as Nemesis. I don't know which scientist(s) you're referring to, but the idea goes back quite a while. The original theory was created by Raup and Sepkoski way back in 1984. Their paper analyzed mass extinctions in the past and concluded that there was a pattern. Note, though, that the paper does not specifically say that a star orbiting the Sun is the cause; it merely favors general impacts of "extraterrestrial" origin. However, two more teams analyzed the data and posited that there was a celestial body responsible. Whitmire and Jackson and Davis, Hut, and Muller (Regrettably, you must pay to see the papers, which I have not done) suggested that the Sun had a companion in the far reaches of the solar system, and it was perturbing comets and other bodies, which came towards Earth. Honestly, I (and quite a few others) don't think there's much truth to the idea. Why? Because we haven't found any evidence of its existence. As Wikipedia explains, 

If you're thinking about how close planets can be, you should probably consider each planet's Hill sphere, the region in which it can retain satellites. Fang & Margot (2013) did an analysis of Kepler data and found that planets had mean values of $\Delta = 21.7$, where $\Delta$ is a parameter given for two adjacent planets by $$\Delta=\frac{a_2-a_1}{R_{H1,2}}$$ where the $a$s are the semi-major axes and $R_{H1,2}$ is the mutual Hill radius. One system the authors consider is Kepler-11, which has 6 planets, all with semi-major axes $\leq0.466\text{ AU}$ and with only one semi-major axis greater than $0.25\text{ AU}$. The smallest $\Delta$ there is approximately $5.7$, although all the other $\Delta$s are quite small. Kepler-36, with only two planets, still has a $\Delta$ of $4.7$. According to the Nature paper about TRAPPIST-1, all seven planets have semi-major axes within $\sim0.063\text{ AU}$. They have mean $\Delta$s of $10.5\pm1.9$ - not much different from the Kepler-11 planets, because they have smaller Hill spheres. They may be closer together, but they can be much closer together without having stability problems. Additionally, they are in a "near-resonant" configuration. How close planets can be depends strongly on their masses, then, which in turn determines their mutual Hill radii, which determines stability. 

Picture the Earth as a small ball suspended in midair, not moving, although it's rotating on its axis. Unless forces are applied to it, absolutely nothing will happen. That's conservation of energy (or momentum; you can work with it either way). Earth will not spontaneously start moving in one direction because that would violate conservation of translational energy and conservation of linear momentum. If that did happen, energy would be gained out of nowhere. For the same reason, Earth will not start tilting to one side. This is conservation of rotational kinetic energy and conservation of angular momentum at work. Savvy? So, yep, Keith is spot-on. You'd need some sort of torque to turn the Earth's axis like that. So why does the Earth's axis move over 26,000 years (it does, by the way, just not one cycle per year)? Just like with the tides, as well as how Earth's rotation is slowing down, it's primarily the tidal forces of the Moon and the Sun at work, although the other planets do make some contributions to the overall changes. I can add in some math if you want, but be warned, I'm learning it myself, so it won't be explained as well as you might like. The other planets obey the same laws as the Earth, so their axes should point in the same direction throughout the year, ignoring the effects of axial precession.
