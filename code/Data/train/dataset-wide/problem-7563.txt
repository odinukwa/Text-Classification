The curve $$(X-16)^3=XY\tag{1}\label{1}$$ is essential to Heegner's approach to the class number one problem for imaginary quadratic fields. We have the following “modular” parametrization \begin{equation}\tag{2}\label{2}(X,Y)=\left(2^{12}\Phi(\tau),j(\tau)\right),\end{equation} where $\Phi(\tau)=\frac{\Delta(2\tau)}{\Delta(\tau)}$. Note that the function $\Phi(\tau)$ is a Hauptmodul for the group $\Gamma_0(2)$. My questions are: 

Thus if $0\neq z \in \mathbb C$ is a root of $\Psi_n(x,x)=0$ then we must have for some $\omega$ and $M=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} r & s \\ 0 & t \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in S(n,3)$ \begin{equation} z=\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(M\omega) \end{equation} and consequently by the fourth paragraph \begin{equation} \frac{a\omega+b}{c\omega+d}=\frac{r\omega+s}{t} \end{equation} where $a,b,c,d$ are integers such that $ad-bc=1$ and $ab-ac+cd-a^2cd \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$. Hence $\omega$ is a root of a quadratic equation with integral coefficients, and if $n$ is suitably chosen, then the middle coefficient will be divisible by $3$. Conversely if we can find $\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$ and $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} r & s \\ 0 & t \end{smallmatrix} \bigr) $ with these properties, $\gamma_2(\omega)$ will be a root of $\Psi_n(x,x)=0$ On the other hand the roots of the equation \begin{equation} x^3-j(\omega)=0 \end{equation} are \begin{equation} \gamma_2(\omega),\ e^{-2\pi i/3}\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(\omega+1),\ e^{2\pi i/3}\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(\omega-1) \end{equation} If we could guarantee that the only common root of $\Psi_n(x,x)$ and $x^3-j(\omega)$ is $\gamma_2(\omega)$, then we would know that $\gamma_2(\omega)$ and $j(\omega)$ had the same degree. But if $A$ is not divisible by $3$, $B$ is divisible by $3$ and \begin{equation} A\omega^2+B\omega+C=0,\ (A,B,C)=1. \end{equation} then it is easy to see that the numbers $\omega + 1$ and $\omega -1$ satisfy quadratic equations whose middle coefficients are not divisible by $3$. Therefore $\gamma_2(\omega)$ is the only common root and we are done. Finally, my question is this: given $\omega\in H$ such that $\omega^2+3\omega+\frac{9-D}{4}=0$ where $D\equiv 5 \ (\textrm{mod} \ 8)$ and $D<0$ is not divisible by 3, how can I find $n\equiv -1 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$ and $M\in S(n,3)$ such that $$A\omega=M\omega$$ holds for some $A=\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in\Gamma$ satisfying $ab-ac+cd-a^2cd \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$? 

I think the following is true, but haven't came up with a proof myself. Thanks in advance! Let $G$ be a semisimple (to avoid more words) algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$. Write $F=\mathbb{C}((t))$ and $\mathcal{O}=\mathbb{C}[[t]]$. Is it true that a maximal solvable Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}(F)$ that is also a finitely generated $\mathcal{O}$-module must be an Iwahori subalgebra? In other words, is it true that all such Lie subalgebras are conjugate? (feel free to replace $F$ by your favorite non-archimedean local field) 

This is an attempt to give a family of counterexamples, somewhat following Victor Protsak's comment. The basic idea is: let $\phi:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4$ be a generic Langlands parameter. Then I think $\phi^{Sp_4}:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4\subset SO_5$ should be usually generic, while $\phi^{GL_5}:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4\subset SO_5\subset GL_5$ is always non-generic as it factors through $GL_4\subset GL_5$. How do we really find such an $\phi$? I am not familiar with the LLC for $Sp_4$ at all, but there are examples that can work. Here is one: let $p\not=2$, $T$ be a two-dimensional unramified anisotropic torus, and $\chi:T\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^{\times}$ a tamely ramified character that is "in general position." By LLC for tori we get $\phi_{\chi}:W_F'\rightarrow {}^LT$. One can embed ${}^LT\subset W_F\times SO_4\subset W_F\times SO_5$, so that $\phi_{\chi}^{Sp_4}$ is generic; it will be a Langlands parameter corresponding to the depth-zero supercuspidals of DeBacker and Reeder. 

There are several theorems in category-theoretic logic which say something like, "any proposition in X logic that is provable in topos logic assuming (the law of excluded middle and) the axiom of choice is provable in X logic itself (i.e. without the law of excluded middle and the axiom of choice)". However, some of these theorems are themselves non-constructive, so one is left wondering whether one really can "obtain" a constructive proof in this fashion. More concretely, consider a geometric theory $\mathbb{T}$, i.e. a theory in a certain fragment of infinitary intuitionistic first-order logic. Topos theory tells us: 

This "tensor product" is also known as the weighted colimit in enriched category theory. The short answer is that all the isomorphisms you are interested in always exist, provided the objects you are interested in also exist – it's just a matter of choosing the right definitions. In general, given a complete symmetric monoidal closed category $\mathcal{V}$, a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category $\mathcal{A}$, a small $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category $\mathcal{C}$, and $\mathcal{V}$-enriched functors $F : \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathcal{V}$ (a.k.a. a right $\mathcal{C}$-module) and $G : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{A}$, the $\mathcal{V}$-enriched weighted colimit $F \star G$ is an object in $\mathcal{A}$ equipped with isomorphisms $$[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}, \mathcal{V}](F, \mathcal{A} (G, a)) \cong \mathcal{A} (F \star G, a)$$ that are $\mathcal{V}$-enriched natural in $a$. Dually, given $\mathcal{V}$-enriched functors $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{V}$ and $G : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{A}$, the $\mathcal{V}$-enriched weighted limit $\{ F, G \}$ is an object in $\mathcal{A}$ equipped with isomorphisms $$[\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{V}](F, \mathcal{A} (a, G)) \cong \mathcal{A} (a, \{ F, G \})$$ that are $\mathcal{V}$-enriched natural in $a$. The $\mathcal{V}$-enriched Yoneda lemma yields: 

So the question is that, over a finite field, does there exist an abelian variety $A$ for which there does not exist a generically one-to-one morphism from a hyperelliptic curve $C$ to $A$. p.s. A result of Oort and de Jong proved that a "generic" abelian variety satisfies this property. However it seems generic means outside a countable subfamily in their result. I'm interested in this question because if we assume all motives over a finite field is semisimple (or just semisimplify it), then by Weil conjecture and Honda-Tate (maybe also Tate's conjecture over finite field), such motive all live in the tensor category of that of abelian varieties, or equivalently that of curves. I am then wondering if there could be any chance that they all actually come from hyperelliptic curves. 

As for your second question: you are quite right in saying that we need some kind of diagonal map $\delta_X : X \to X \otimes X$ in order to even define inverses. But that's OK: we just build that into the definition of a group object in a symmetric monoidal category. More accurately, what we are doing is expressing the axioms for a Hopf algebra in diagrammatic form: so a group object in a general symmetric monoidal category will consist of 

There are a few ways to go about this. First, let us observe that the surjections in $\mathbf{Set}$ are precisely the maps that have the left lifting property with respect to the inclusion $\emptyset \hookrightarrow 1$. Thus, by the usual adjointness argument, the surjections in $\mathcal{V}$ are precisely the homomorphisms that have the right lifting property with respect to the induced homomorphism $F \emptyset \to F 1$. So this weak factorisation system, if it exists, must be cofibrantly generated. If we assume $\mathcal{V}$ is an algebraic variety in the traditional sense, then $\mathcal{V}$ will also be locally finitely presentable (or at least, locally presentable). We can then run Quillen's or Garner's small object argument to get the required factorisation. But in fact it suffices for $\mathcal{V}$ to have finite coproducts (which is automatic if you assume the axiom of choice). Then we can proceed by hand: the factorisation of a homomorphism $f : A \to B$ is $A \to A + F U B \to B$, where $A \to A + F U B$ is the coproduct insertion and $A + F U B \to B$ is defined on $A$ by $f$ and on $F U B$ by the counit. Incidentally, I think this is what Garner's small object argument produces (cf Example 3.11 in [Understanding the small object argument]). 

(Editted: a "weaker" example about $GL_3$ at the end) If I didn't make a mistake in my computation, then the second question doesn't hold for $G=Sp_4$, as it doesn't hold for any $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Allow me to use $F$ as my p-adic field and $k$ its residue field. Let $V/_F$ be spanned by $e_2,e_1,f_1,f_2$ with the symplectic form $(e_i,f_j)=\delta_{ij}$, $(e_i,e_j)=(f_i,f_j)=0$, so that we identify $G(F)=Sp(V)$. The hyperspecial vertices on the building correspond to self-dual lattices of $V$. Let $T$ be the diagonal torus which acts on $V$ by $(c_1,c_2):e_i\mapsto c_ie_i, f_i\mapsto c_i^{-1}f_i$. Let $\pi\in\mathcal{O}_F$ be a fixed uniformizer. Consider the lattices $$\Lambda_{a,b}=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_2+\pi^{-1} e_1+\pi^{-2}af_1+\pi^{-3}bf_2, e_1+\pi^{-1}f_1+\pi^{-2}(a-1)f_2,f_1-\pi^{-1}f_2,f_2\rangle,$$ where we let $a,b$ runs over a fixed set of representatives of $k$ in $\mathcal{O}_F$. One checks that all $\Lambda_{a,b}$ are in different $T(F)$-orbits by essentially showing that they are in different $T(\mathcal{O}_F)$-orbits. Next one compute the stabilizer of $\Lambda_{a,b}$. What's necessary then is to check the following: Claim. (1) $\text{Stab}_{T(\mathcal{O}_F)}(\Lambda_{a,b})\supset T_3=T(1+\pi^3\mathcal{O}_F)$. (2) If $ab+b-a+1\not\in\pi\mathcal{O}_F$, then $\text{Stab}_{T(\mathcal{O}_F)}(\Lambda_{a,b})\subset T_2=T(1+\pi^2\mathcal{O}_F)$. However, there are only $q+3$ ($q=\#k$) subgroups between $T_2$ and $T_3$. In other words, we have $q^2-q+1$ such lattices, but only $q+3$ possible choices for stabilizers for them; an open compact subgroup of $T(F)$ have to correspond to about $O(q)$ orbits. Note. I did some brute force (using Iwasawa decomp.) and it seems that such an assertion holds for $GL_3$ in most or all cases of $GL_3$. However it also seems to me that if one fix a (semisimple) split rank, then it will be difficult for similar assertion to holds for larger $\dim(G)$; in other words, I'd say such an assertion probably only holds for $GL_n$ (and not for any other classical groups or non-split groups), if it does. -- Editted: Here is an example about $GL_3$ where things fail. Let $T$ again be the diagonal torus. Let $a>0$ be any integer. Consider the two lattices in $F^3$ $$\Lambda_a=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_1+\pi^{-a}e_2+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_2,e_3\rangle$$ $$\Lambda_a'=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_1+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_2+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_3\rangle$$ These two lattices correspond to two hyperspecial vertices which are not in the same $T(\mathcal{O}_F)$-orbit and thus $T(F)$-orbit. But they have the same stabilizer $Z(F)\cdot T(1+\pi^a\mathcal{O}_F)$. This is however a weaker example because in this case a stabilizer correspond to $2$ orbits. It's probably the case that for $GL_3$ every possible stabilizer corresponds to at most $2$ orbits, but I have no good intuition about why it should be true. (Note that the number of orbits with distant $r$ from the apartment no longer have a uniform bound independent of $p$.) 

My question concerns rectification theorems for homotopy-coherent structures. As the meaning of this may be unclear, let me list a few examples of what I am thinking of: 

If the hom-categories of $\mathfrak{K}$ are posets (and I mean partially ordered set, not preordered set) then definitions (1) – (4) coincide. This is because the only isomorphisms in a poset are the identities. 

As pointed out, the answer is no – because we cannot hope to have fibrant replacements in general. On the other hand, by following the programme of van Osdol [1977, Simplicial homotopy in an exact category], it is possible to quickly establish a weaker result: Theorem. For any regular category $\mathcal{S}$ (e.g. an elementary topos), the category of internal Kan complexes in $\mathcal{S}$ is a category of fibrant objects where the fibrations are the internal Kan fibrations and the trivial fibrations are the internal trivial Kan fibrations. (By Ken Brown's lemma, this suffices to determine the weak equivalences.) Here, "internal" refers to the internal logic of regular categories: for example, an internal trivial Kan fibration in $\mathcal{S}$ is a morphism between simplicial objects in $\mathcal{S}$ such that the matching morphisms (à la Reedy) are regular epimorphisms. Note however that we are using the "external" notion of simplicial objects. In the special case where $\mathcal{S}$ is a sheaf topos, the internal Kan fibrations and internal trivial Kan fibrations turn out to be the same thing as Jardine's local fibrations and local trivial fibrations. (See Theorem 1.12 in [1987, Simplicial presheaves].) It follows that the weak equivalences in the sense above are the same as Jardine's local weak equivalences. 

Let $\mathcal M_m\subset M(2,\mathbb Z)$ be the set matrices with determinant $n$. The modular group $\Gamma$ acts on $\mathcal M_m$ from the left and we have the following finite set as a set of representatives of the orbits of this action $$\mathcal M_n^*=\bigg\lbrace \begin{pmatrix}a &b\\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix}:ad=m,0\leq b\leq d\bigg\rbrace.$$ Consider the modular equation $$\Phi_m(X,j(z))=\prod_{M\in\mathcal M_m^*}\left(X-j(Mz)\right).$$ It is straightforward to prove that this is actually a polynomial in two variables $\Phi_m(X,Y)$. Zagier shows in his notes, p. 71, that the leading coefficient of $\Phi_m(X,X)$ is invertible if $m$ is not a square. He also demonstrates that $j(z)$ is a root of $\Phi_m(X,X)$ if and only if $z$ is fixed by some matrix $M$ with determinant $m$. Zagier proceeds to show that for $z\in\mathfrak H$ a complex multiplication point of discriminat D, i.e. $Az^2+Bz+C=0$, $D=B^2-4AC$, $(A,B,C)=1$ the folowing two statements are equivalent: 

Let $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ be continuous maps (between topological spaces). Assume these hypotheses: 

It is well known that the underlying simplicial set of a simplicial group is a Kan complex. However, the underlying simplicial set of the canonical simplicial resolution (call it $F_\bullet G$) you describe has an extra degeneracy, so it is really just a disjoint union of contractible Kan complexes. In particular, the homotopy groups of $F_\bullet G$ are all trivial, and we recover the original group as $\pi_0$. But we haven't really used the fact that we have a simplicial group. To get back group homology, we apply the abelianisation functor to $F_\bullet G$. The homology of the associated chain complex is then $H_{* + 1} (G, \mathbb{Z})$ (this seems to be folklore), and the 0th homology is the abelianisation of $G$. I suppose this should be expected, since the abelianisation of $G$ is $G \otimes \mathbb{Z}$, where $\otimes$ here is defined to be universal with respect to bihomomorphisms. 

Lusztig defined (in Sec. 5, also Sage) a Springer action of the affine Weyl group on the homology of affine Springer fibers (Iwahori one, i.e. in an affine flag variety). In the regular semisimple unramified case, Goresky, Kottiwtz and MacPherson had a formula (14.4) for this action assuming the homology is pure, for example in the equal valuation case, where they said 

In response to Anton for a uniform proof of your formula: note that $K\backslash KaK\cong(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)\backslash K$. Let $\pi:K\rightarrow G(\mathbb{F}_q)$ be the natural quotient map, $K_1:=\ker(\pi)$ and $P:=\pi(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)$. Then $P$ is the $\mathbb{F}_q$-points of the parabolic subgroup of $G$ determined by the walls that $a$ lies on. We have $$|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K)\backslash K|=|P\backslash G(\mathbb{F}_q)|\cdot|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash K_1|.$$ Let $\mathfrak{K}$ be the Lie algebra of $K$ and likewise for $\mathfrak{K}_1$. Choose Haar measures for the group and Lie algebra so that $\mu(K_1)=\mu(\mathfrak{K}_1)$. Since $a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1$ and $K_1$ are open compact, we have $|(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash K_1|=\mu(a^{-1}Ka\cap K_1)\backslash\mu(K_1)=\mu(a^{-1}\mathfrak{K}a\cap\mathfrak{K}_1)\backslash\mu(\mathfrak{K}_1)=|(a^{-1}\mathfrak{K}a\cap\mathfrak{K}_1)\backslash \mathfrak{K}_1|$. Identifying $a$ as an element in the positive Weyl chamber in the cocharacter lattice, the last term is $q$ to the power of $\sum_{\alpha\in\Phi^+}\max(\langle a,\alpha\rangle-1,0)$, while the roots of $P$ are those $\alpha\in\Phi$ with $\langle a,\alpha\rangle\le 0$. 

This is just a straightforward generalisation of the definition appearing in [Leinster, Higher operads, higher categories, §3.1]. The reason why this even makes sense is that ordinal addition is associative – if it weren't, we'd be stuck. This leads us to our first easy example: Example. The category of small ordinals (and monotone maps) is a infinitary strict monoidal category under ordinal addition. Less tautologically: Example. Any (co)complete category is an infinitary unbiased monoidal category under (co)products. (Though, in some sense we assumed this in our definition...) Conjecture. Martin's third example probably works if we assume that $X \otimes (-)$ preserves sequential colimits, and that the chosen morphisms $I \to X$ are sufficiently nice. First, by the Mac Lane–Kelly coherence theorem, we can make a finitary biased monoidal category into an unbiased one, and we can use the colimit construction to define the infinitary monoidal products. We use the assumption on $X \otimes (-)$ to prove that, e.g. $$A_0 \otimes (A_1 \otimes A_2 \otimes \cdots) \cong A_0 \otimes A_1 \otimes A_2 \otimes \cdots$$ The universal property of colimits should be enough to ensure the coherence of the infinitary associators – but I haven't checked. We need to assume something about the choice of morphisms $I \to X$ so that $$I \otimes I \otimes I \otimes \cdots \cong I$$ holds. (For example, choosing a non-isomorphism for $I \to I$ is a bad idea!) Non-example. Take $\mathcal{C}$ to be the category of small ordinals, and take $T_\alpha$ to be ordinal addition for all finite ordinals $\alpha$, and $T_\alpha = 0$ for all infinite ordinals $\alpha$. This is not an infinitary unbiased monoidal category, because $$T_\omega \circ (T_1 \times T_1 \times T_1 \times T_0 \times T_0 \times \cdots ) \ncong T_3$$ and so we see that there is some form of continuity required. Also, a reminder about a famous trick: Remark. Suppose we define infinitary monoids to be discrete infinitary strict monoidal categories. There are non-trivial small infinitary monoids: for example, take any complete small semilattice with $\sup$ as the monoid operation. However, any infinitary monoid that is also a group must be the trivial monoid: after all, for any element $x$, $$x^{-1} \cdot (x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cdots) = (x^{-1} \cdot x) \cdot (x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cdots) = x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cdots$$ and then cancel $x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cdots$ on both sides of the equation to obtain $x^{-1} = \textrm{id}$. (EDIT) Non-example. The tensor product of modules doesn't give an infinitary monoidal product. To be precise, if we define $$\textrm{Hom}_R (A_0 \otimes_R A_1 \otimes_R A_2 \otimes_R \cdots, B) \cong \textrm{Multi}_R(A_0, A_1, A_2, \ldots ; B)$$ where by $R$-multilinear we mean that $f(\ldots, r a, \ldots) = r f (\ldots, a, \ldots)$, then I don't see how $R \otimes_R R \otimes_R R \otimes_R \cdots$ can be isomorphic to $R$. (A multilinear map $R \times R \times R \times \cdots \to B$ is not necessarily determined by just what it does to $(1, 1, 1, \ldots)$, unlike the finite case.)
