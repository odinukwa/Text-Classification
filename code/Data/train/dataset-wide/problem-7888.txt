Wireless networks are typically modeled as random geometric graphs. The number of nodes $N$ in the network is drawn from a Poisson distribution with intensity $\lambda$ $$P(N = n) = \frac{\lambda^n e^{-n}}{n!}.$$ Once this number has been chosen, the $N$ nodes are placed uniformly at random over a circular (or squared) area of radius $R$. Two nodes are then connected by an edge if their euclidean distance is less than some predefined range, say $r_0$, where $r_0 << R$. As a result of Penrose's Theorem to ensure that the graph is $k$-connected, it is sufficient to show that the minimum degree is at least $k$, i.e., $d_{\rm min} \geq k$. This holds true asymptotically for a geometric random graph. I came across two papers dealing with connectivity in (wireless) networks (this is one, and here is another one, but there are others by different Authors in the literature). When posing the condition that the minimum degree is at least $k$, I often find this approximation: $$ P(G{\rm ~is~k~conn}) \cong P (d_{\rm min} \geq k) \cong P(d \geq k)^n$$ where $P(d \geq k)$ is the probability that the degree of a node (any node) is at least $k$. The first approximation is essentially true when the number of nodes is at least of a few hundreds. The second approximation is not true since the nodes degrees are correlated. What people say when using it, is that they assume almost statistical independence of the nodes degrees. In practice there is an excellent match between simulation results and the approximation above. Since I need to use the very same approximation, I was wondering if someone had a better argument to justify its use, rather than assuming its validity from the very beginning. 

If the theory $T$ proves (for some natural number $n \in {\mathbb Z}_+$) the sentence $$(\forall y_0) \cdots (\forall y_n) \bigvee_{0 \leq i < j \leq n} y_i = y_j$$ then every mcodel of $T$ will be an interpretation with a finite domain. Otherwise, the compactness theorem in the language ${\mathcal L}(\{ c_i : i \in {\mathbb N} \})$ where ${\mathcal L}$ is the language of $T$ and the $c_i$'s are new constant symbols applied to the set of sentences $$T \cup \{ c_i \neq c_j : 0 \leq i < j \in {\mathbb N} \}$$ shows that there must be infinite models of $T$. 

As you point out, one cannot hope that the Witt ring, up to isomorphism, be an elementary invariant of a field. The strongest statement which I might conjecture would be that if $K \preceq L$ is an elementary extension of fields, then $W(K) \to W(L)$ is an elementary extension of rings. If this statement were true, then the theory of the Witt ring would be an elementary invariant as any two elementarily equivalent fields have a common elementary extension. It is true that if $K \preceq L$ is an elementary extension of fields, then map $W(K) \hookrightarrow W(L)$ is an inclusion [Why? Being zero in the Witt ring is defined by an existential condition.] One might try to prove that $W(K) \hookrightarrow W(L)$ is elementary by induction where the key step would be to show that if $W(L) \models (\exists x) \phi(x;a)$ where $a$ is a tuple from $W(K)$, $x$ is a single variable, and $\phi$ is a formula in the language of rings, then $W(K) \models (\exists x) \phi(x;a)$. The witness in $W(L)$ would be represented by a quadratic space of some finite dimension $n$. One would like to argue that the set defined by $\phi(x;a)$ in the space of $n$-dimensional quadratic forms is definable in the field language in $K$ in which case a witness could be found in $K$ via elementarity. This last part of the argument is delicate as it would require knowing bounds for checking equalities in the Witt ring. The Witt ring construction is an example of an ind-definable set modulo an ind-definable equivalence relation. These are discussed in some detail in Hrushovski's paper on approximate groups ( arXiv:0909.2190 ). With Krajiceck, I considered similar issues (how does the Grothendieck ring of a first-order structure depend on its theory) in Combinatorics with definable sets: Euler characteristics and Grothendieck rings. Bull. Symbolic Logic 6 (2000), no. 3, 311--330. 

Is there any result that relates the minimum degree of a geometric random graph to its k-vertex connectivity? I read papers where they pose the condition $$d_{\rm min} \geq k$$ to imply that the graph is k-connected (vertex connectivity). Is that an approximation or an asymptotic result? In my case, I need, if not an exact result, a lower bound $$P({\rm graph~is~connected}) \geq f(d_{\rm min}).$$ I could not find references so far. 

Hi All, I'd like to solve some math puzzles, especially in the context of probability theory, but I'm open to other areas too. The kind of problems that does not require much knowledge of mathematics, except, perhaps, for a basic background. I found this one helpful $URL$ but I was wondering if you folks could recommend others. Thank you 

I'm not quite sure about how to define a good measure of the quality of a communication channel with fading and interference. Let us assume the simplest case, where a node in a network receives the following quantity: $$ y = s + w $$ where $s$ is the amplitude (positive real) of the signal and $w$ the noise (gaussian with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$). A simple measure of the channel quality is simply given by ${\rm SNR} = s^2 / \sigma^2$, i.e., the ratio of the power of the signal vs the power of the noise. Now, suppose the received signal is $$ y = h_s s + w$$ where $h_s$ and $w$ are complex gaussian with zero mean and unitary variance. A measure of the SNR that makes sense could be derived by looking at the power of the received signal $$ |y|^2 = y y' = |h_s|^2 s^2 + 2{\rm Re}(h_ss~w') + |w|^2$$ now, since for practical applications the noise process is much faster than the fading (represented by $h_s$) what people normally do is to average over $w$, obtaining $$ E[|y|^2]_w = |h_s|^2 s^2 + \sigma^2 $$ hence, a measure of the signal strength that makes sense would be $ {\rm SNR} = |h_s|^2 s^2 / \sigma^2$. What I am interested about is the case with interference. Suppose there is an extra term that takes into account for interfering signals $$ y = h_s s + h_{\rm I} s_{\rm I} + w $$ where $h_I$ is complex with zero mean and unitary variance. How could I possibly define the SNR in this case? By taking $|y|^2$ there are cross terms, i.e., products of $h_s$ and $h_{\rm I}$ that do not disappear even if I average over the noise $w$. So it seems not obvious to me how to decouple $|y|^2$ into two different pieces, one for the signal and the other for the noise. The final goal would be determining a good measure of the SNR in order to be able to compute probabilities like $$ P({\rm SNR} \geq \gamma_0).$$ 

As far as I understand, no, Vaught's Conjecture has not been resolved. We held a reading seminar on Robin Knight's proposed counter-example closely following each of his drafts and simplified presentations here at Berkeley some years ago and were ultimately convinced that the draft of January 2003 does not contain a correct disproof of Vaught's Conjecture and requires more than minor emendations to produce a complete proof. We did not discover any essential error, though there were important points in the argument where it seemed to us that even the author had not worked out the technical details. That said, it is possible that revisions he has posted since then are sufficient, though in view of how much time it would require to enter into the details of the argument, I am not willing to work through the later papers until the basic architecture of the proof is certified by some other expert. To be fair to Robin Knight, his work in set theoretic topology is well-respected and his construction takes into account the relevant features required for a counter-example to Vaught's Conjecture. If you would like to know whether or not he believes that his proof works, you should ask him directly. If he says that he does believe the proof to be valid, then you can attempt to check the proof yourself. The difficulty in reading his manuscript is not the amount of background material one must know in order to follow it, but exactly the opposite: almost everything is developed from scratch so that one must hold the entire construction in one's mind without having the usual anchors of established theorems. 

Let us define $A_n, f_n, {\frak a}_n, k(n), \iota_n, {\frak b}_n$ and $l(n)$ by the followings$\colon$ $A_n \colon= K[[X_1,...,X_n]]$, i.e. a $n$-variable formal power series ring over a field $K$. $f_n \colon= f_n(X_1) = c_n + c_{n-1}X_1 + ... + c_1X_1^{e-1} + X_1^e \in K[[X_2,...,X_{n}]][[X_1]]$. ${\frak a}_n \colon= (f_n, g_1, ... , g_{k(n)-1})$, an ideal of $A_n$. $k(n) \colon= {\mathrm{the ~number~ of~ generators~ of}}\,{\frak a}_n$. $\iota_n \colon K[[X_2,...,X_n]] \to K[[X_2,...,X_n]][[X_1]]/(f_n) = A_n/(f_n)$, a finite ring extension. ${\frak b}_n \colon= \iota_n(K[[X_2,...,X_n]]) \cap \overline{{\frak a}_n} \quad \!\! {\mathrm{in}}\,A_n/(f_n)$. $l(n)\colon= {\mathrm{the~ number~ of~ generators~of}}\,{\frak b}_n$. 

We shall define the infinitely-many-variable formal power series ring $A = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_{\infty}]]$ over a finite field ${\Bbb F}_q$ as the following$\colon$ $A \colon= \underset{n \geq 1}{\varprojlim}\, {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]$. For example, $\Sigma_{n = 1}^{n = \infty} X_n = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots \in A$. The ring $A$ is a non-noetherian local ring with the unique closed maximal ideal. I would like to pose the following theorem on which please let me know the correctness$\colon$ Theorem. $A$ is coherent. Proof. Let us fix a positive integer $l \geq 1$ and for an arbitrarily chosen elements $a_1,\ldots,a_l$ consider the linear equation $(*) \quad a_1Y_1 + \ldots + a_lY_l = 0 \quad (a_1,\ldots,a_l \in A).$ We shall define ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as the set of the whole solutions of $(*)$ in the ring $A$. We shall show the finiteness of the number of generators of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as an $A$-module. We define ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as the image of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m} \colon= A/((X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m,X_{n+1},X_{n+2},\ldots)$. We have simply $A_{n,m} = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]/(X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m$. Lemma. For sufficiently large $n, m$, the $A_{n,m}$-module ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ has generators whose number is less than or equal to $l$. Proof. Obviously, ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ can be viewed as the subset of the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$. But the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$ has its cardinality less than or equal to $|A_{n,m}|^l$. Consequently we have $|{\mathrm M}_{n,m}| \leq |A_{n,m}|^l. $ When we view ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as a $A_{n,m}$-module and set the number of the generators of ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ to be $\delta_{n,m}$, the following inequality holds$\colon$ $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |{\mathrm M}_{n,m}|. $ In short we have $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |A_{n,m}|^l.$ We can see the equality $|(A_{n,m})^{*}| = \frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|$ because $A_{n,m}$ can be divided into $q$ disjoint cosets as $c + {\frak m}$ with $c \in {\Bbb F}_q$ and ${\frak m}$ being the maximal ideal of $A_{n,m}$. Thus we obtain ${\delta_{n,m}} {\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|) \leq l\,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)$. So, we have ${\delta_{n,m}} \leq l \,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)/{\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|)$. When $n,m \to \infty$, we have $|A_{n,m}| \to \infty$, which ensures that the positive integer ${\delta_{n,m}}$ must be less than or equal to $l$ for sufficiently large $n, m$. Q.E.D. Now, by Lemma we can conclude that ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ has the set of generators with its cardinality less than or equal to $l$ as $A$-module because we have the equality ${\mathrm M}_{\infty} = \underset{n,m \geq 1}{\varprojlim} {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$, where all natural transition maps ${\mathrm M}_{n',m'} \to {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ with $n' > n, m' > m$ are surjective. Q.E.D. 

There are several rich theories of analysis on non-archimedian theories. Neal Koblitz' book on $p$-adic analysis is a good introduction. Non-archimedian analysis by Bosch, Güntzer and Remmert is more encyclopedic. Berkovich's Spectral Theory and Analysis over Non-archimedian Fields introduces his beautiful theory of analytic spaces allowing for a reasonable algebraic topological theory. In Goss's book Basic Structures of Function Field Arithmetic there is a good introduction to analysis in positive characteristic. Your suggestion that this subject might have something to do with model theory is apt. As the above references show, the theory may be developed without model theory, but it has been studied intensively via model theory giving interesting results about quantifier elimination, uniformity across the $p$-adics, and establishing a basis for motivic integration. You might want to look at the paper by van den Dries and Denef, $p$-adic and real subanalytic sets. Ann. of Math. (2) 128 (1988), no. 1, 79--183. 

As you point out, it follows on general grounds that there is an extension of $v_p$ to a valuation on ${\mathbb R}$ (in fact, there are uncountably many such extensions), but it is impossible to give an "explicit" description. Indeed, not only will any such extension by discontinuous with respect to the usual Euclidean topology on the reals, but it will not be a measurable function. 

I think that the simplest explanation has nothing to do with schemes: the first-order theory of algebraically closed fields of a fixed characteristic is complete. The assertion that the group of $k$-points $G(k)$ of the algebraic group $G$ has $n$ orbits on the set of $k$-points $X(k)$ of the algebraic variety $X$ may be naturally expressed as a first-order logical formula and hence is true in one algebraically closed field of characteristic $p \geq 0$ just in case it is true in every such algebraically closed field.
