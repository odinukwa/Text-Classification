There are features in the CMB, the distance and size of which can be derived from cosmological models (6-parameter Lambda CDM model). The expected size of the features can be predicted in terms of angles in the sky, depending on how curved large-scale space-time is. (The features are a statistical property of tiny temperature fluctuations in the CMB indicating the largest scale of causal connection - kind of sound waves - in the baryon-photon plasma before recombination 380,000 years after the Big Bang, called first acoustic peak of the CMB power spectrum. The angle should be about 1 degree for a flat space-time, in accordance with observation.) Things aren't quite straightforward, e.g. due to the way the universe has been expanding, therefore it's done with simulations. Angles look larger in a positively curved space-time (e.g. a sphere) than in a flat space-time (e.g. a plane) than in a negatively curved space-time (e.g. a saddle). The curvature of space-time follows the same principles as curvature of 2-dimensional surfaces. A triangle in an Euclidean plane has an angle sum of 180 degrees, while a triangle on a sphere has an angle sum of more than 180 degrees. Hence an object of a fixed size and a fixed distance looks larger (takes a larger angle) on a sphere than on a plane. Here a sketch of a triangle on a sphere (may be interpreted as an observer looking to an object) and a triangle of the same size - meaning the same lengths of the sides in this case - in a plane: 

In the image you are now refering to the only significant brightness difference is between the mare and the "highlands". The retina enhances edges. So you'll see edges enhanced, even if they aren't. By image processing edges can also be enhanced to make contours clearer. This is not the case for the referred image. To better assess, which part of the perception is real, and which is illusion, here the illusion part: 

This answer is to some degree opinion-based. I share your scepticism about the existence of strict mathematical singularities as General Relativity would predict. This is mainly, because the assumption of a strict singuarity ignores quantum theory. One approach to overcome the singularity is a Gravastar. Related is a Planck star. Both approaches try to overcome the paradoxes near the singuarity. A full answer might eventually be provided by a still to be defined quantum gravity. Another difficulty for "real" black holes is rotation. The Schwarzschild solution is not to be expected to occur in real-world black holes. Instead a Kerr solution (or might be a Kerr-Newman metric) will get closer to real astronomical objects, hence including at least rotation, and might be some residual electric charge. A massless particle travelling with the speed of light results in an undefined energy according to Special Relativity. Nature opens a physics dedicated to massless particles by allowing them to take any energy to resolve this undefined range. In a similar way nature may open a new kind of physics inside black holes to resolve the paradox between General Relativity and quantum theory. 

The overall geometry and topology of the universe has been investigated by the Planck mission. Some results are described in this paper. Final results are not yet available. An excerpt: 

The current supernova is a supernova of type Ia. Supernovae of type Ia are used as standard candles for distance estimates, especially used to determine the Hubble constant. Hence by a better calibration of this kind of supernovae, more about the reliability and accuracy of distance estimates can be learned. The expansion rate (in relation to the distance) of the universe, expressed by the Hubble constant, is an important incredient for the estimation of the fate of the universe. 

If we take 6371.0 km as the mean radius of Earth, an apogee of Moon of 405503 km, and a perigee of 363295 km, we get ratios of 6371.0 km / 405503 km = 0.01571 = sin 0.9002° resp. 6371.0 km / 363295 km = 0.01754 = sin 1.005°. So on both sides of Earth between $$40030\mbox{ km}\cdot 0.9002°/360°=100\mbox{ km}$$ and $$40030\mbox{ km}\cdot 1.005°/360° =112\mbox{ km},$$ with an average circumference of $2\pi\cdot 6371\mbox{ km}=40030\mbox{ km},~$ get lost of the 20015 km of the half circumference of Earth as zone of visibility. The calculation is simplified to the simultaneous visibility of a point at the distance of the center of moon. More precisely one part of the moon can be visible from one observer, while an other part of the moon is visible from a second observer. This adds between 29.3 and 34.1 arc minutes or between 54.3 (apogee) and 63.2 km (perigee) to the diameter of the zone of visibility. The visibility of the Moon is influenced by additional factors like air temperature, height of the observer above sea level or the geographic position by Earth's flattening. But this applies also for the visibility of the sun. The corresponding calculations for the sun: With aphelion of Earth of 152098232 km and perihelion of 147098290 km, we get ratios of 6371.0 km / 152098232 km = 0.000041887 = sin 0.0024000° resp. 6371.0 km / 147098290 km = 0.000043311 = sin 0.0024815°. So on both sides of Earth between $$40030\mbox{ km}\cdot 0.0024000°/360°=0.26686\mbox{ km}=266.86\mbox{ m}$$ and $$40030\mbox{ km}\cdot 0.0024815/360°=0.27780\mbox{ km}=277.80\mbox{ m}$$ get lost of the 20015 km of the half circumference of Earth as zone of visibility. (For a rough estimate you may take the 100 km loss of the moon visibility, and multiply it by the quotient of the distances Earth-Moon and Earth-Sun roughly equal to 400,000 km / 150,000,000 km = 0.002667, to get 266.7 m visibility loss of the sun.) This is again simplified, and applies to the center of the sun. The appearent diameter of the sun varies between 31.6 and 32.7 arc minutes, adding between 58.6 (aphelion) and 60.6 km (perihelion) to the diameter of the zone of visibility for observers looking at different parts of the sun. Depending on which scenarios to be compared, the lost area varies. As an example, a loss of a radius of the visible zone of the moon in comparison to the sun of 100 km corresponds to a roughly cylindrical area of $$100\mbox{ km}\cdot \pi\cdot 40030\mbox{ km}=12.6 \mbox{ million square kilometers}.$$ How far can two observers be apart at maximum, to see two differnt parts of the moon at the same time? $$20015 \mbox{ km} - 2\cdot 100 \mbox{ km} + 54.3 \mbox{ km} = 19869.3 \mbox{ km}$$ (apogee) for the average Earth radius. For the same part of the moon it's $$20015 \mbox{ km} - 2\cdot 100 \mbox{ km} = 19815\mbox{ km}.$$

This allowed the protogalaxy to recede almost with the speed of light, although it was just about 2.5 Gly away from us (proper distance) in the time, when it emitted the light we detect now. Nevertheless distant objects in this space accelerate away from us, since their increasing distance is multiplied with the expansion rate of space. 

Yes, Vulcanoids larger than 5.7 km diameter are considered to be ruled out: A Search for Vulcanoids with the STEREO Heliospheric Imager. An object sufficiently large to be called "planet Vulcan" would change Mercury's orbit in a detectable way by gravity. So, there are two lines of evidence, that such a planet doesn't exist.

The brightness of the spaceship follows (almost) the inverse square law, meaning twice the distance from the star, the brightness will be a quater. In the middle of nowhere, but within a galaxy, it would look like in a moonless, and cloudless night, far away from any artificial light source. It wouldn't be pitchblack, but much too dark to read a newspaper. You would see the stars in the background, and the fuzzy band of the Milky Way. The starship would occult the stars; that way you would see the black silhouette of the starship. At 630.1-fold the distance of the Earth from the Sun (about 3.65 light-days), it would look like at full moon (derived from apparent magnitudes of full moon and Sun) But maybe the starship is illuminated artificially. 

It would look very similar, but tiny differences are suspected, see e.g. this LHC experiment. Here a list of more antimatter experiments at CERN. See also CP violation on Wikipedia hinting towards tiny differences between matter and antimatter. Immediate consequence: The CP violation parameter of the CKM matrix in this Wikipedia article would be different, because of different quark generation probabilities. If you also reverse time, you'll get to the CPT theorem (Charge, Parity, Time). Matter and antimatter are thought to be symmetric in this sense. Or to state it with simpler words: Antimatter behaves like matter travelling backward in time. 

That's a lot of not quite trivial questions! I'll try to answer part of it. First, the red-shift can be composed of relativistic Doppler-effect and gravitational red-shift. When neglecting the gravitationl part, we get a higher radial velocity. The radial velocity can be used to calculate a distance estimate via the Hubble "constant". So for low velocities the gravity part is not negligible in respect to relative errors. Stars are moving more or less randomly. Therefore it's necessary to look at a sufficiently large population of stars or galaxies to get a distance estimate that way. For low red-shifts this doesn't work reliably. For larger red-shifts, the gravity part plays a minor relative role, as long as one looks at usual stars. A region of high gravity can be detected by gravitational lensing effects. So this source of error can be avoided by working properly. Einstein's "blunder" was the assumption, that the universe needs to be static on large scales. Therefore he induced a non-zero cosmological constant to avoid the universe to expand or collapse. He could have predicted the big bang by assuming the constant to be zero. Looking further away means looking into the past, when the universe has been denser. A hollow-world scenario with a dense shell, heavy enough to cause the observed redshift would probably collapse rapidly to the shell. If the shell as a whole doesn't collapse, kind of anti-gravity provided by a cosmological constant or function would have to be provided. But this would probably also annihilate the red-shift, thus not consistent with observation. In a collapsing universe objects would look blue-shifted instead of red-shifted. The degree of blue-shift would be dependent of the way the collapse would take place. These things are relevant to be considered to exclude an option of an alternate spacetime which could explain observations. I could recommend reading more about the Planck results, that many options are actually considered, e.g. starting with this blog, then continuing with the original Planck papers.
