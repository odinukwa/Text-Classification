An undirected graph with $n$ nodes could be referred to as an adjacency matrix $A$. $A=[a_{ij}]_{n×n}$ with $a_{ij}=a_{ji}=1$ standing for there being an edge between node $i$ and node $j$, and no edges when it is $0$. Shortest distance matrix: A shortest distance matrix of an undirected graph with $n$ nodes is $B=[b_{ij}]_{n×n}$ where $b_{ij}=b_{ji}$ stands for the shortest distance between node $i$ and node $j$. There are already many algorithms to obtain the shortest distance in a graph, such as Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm or Floyd–Warshall algorithm. My Question How to restructure $A$ from $B$, where $B$ is given by $$B=\begin{bmatrix} T&\star\\ \star&\star \end{bmatrix}.$$ Here, $T$ is a $m\times m$ submatrix of $B$ which is a given, and can be regarded as the shortest distances between any two of the first $m(m<n)$ nodes in the graph. The $\star$ is a wildcard standing for matrixes with nonnegative integers. How to find a $A$ such that from $A$ we can get $B$. There are many $A$’s satisfy with the conditions above. For simplicity(Maybe), we can can some constraint condition on $A$. we can assume that the number of $1$ in $A$ is minimal. It is also welcome not to minimize the number of $1$ in $A$. The only thing I want is the method of find $A$ s.t. $B=\begin{bmatrix} T&\star\\ \star&\star \end{bmatrix}$.Thanks in advance! 

Let $a_1,\dots,a_n$ be positive numbers, does the following inequality holds? $$\frac{a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n}{n}-\sqrt[n]{a_1a_2\cdots a_n}\geq\sqrt[n]{a_1a_2\cdots a_n}-\frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_1}+\frac{1}{a_2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{a_n}}$$ For $n=2$, it is trivial. For $n\geq3$, some numerical computation suggests that the inequality also holds. Could anyone prove it or disprove it? 

I asked the following question on Math Stack Exchange, but no people reply. I know MO is more professional and it is for mathematicians to discuss research problems. Maybe this question is unsuitable for here. I truly appreciated if someone who could give me an explanation. Let $A\in\operatorname{M}_n(F)$. How to prove the following identity. $$\bigcap_{X\in C(A)}C(X)=F[A]=\frac{F[x]}{(m_A(x))}.$$ Here $m_A(x)$ the minimal polynomial of $A$ and $C(A)$ is the centralizer of $A$ and $C(X)$ is the centralizer of $X$. We can view $F^n$ as an $F[x]$-module via $A$, which is well known, denote this module by $F^n_A$, we have $$C(A)=\operatorname{End}_{F[x]}(F^n_A,F^n_A)$$ Since $$F^n_A\simeq\bigoplus_{i=1}^t\frac{F[x]}{(d_i(x))},\quad d_1\mid d_2\mid\cdots\mid d_t\quad\text{(invariant factors)}.$$ We have $$C(A)=\bigoplus_{i}\bigoplus_{j}\operatorname{Hom}_{F[x]} \left(\frac{F[x]}{(d_i(x))},\frac{F[x]}{(d_j(x))}\right) \simeq\bigoplus_{i=1}^{t}\left(\frac{F[x]}{(d_i(x))}\right)^{2(t-i)+1}.$$ For $X\in C(A)$, what is $C(X)$? Can we write the structure of $C(X)$ explicitly(using the above isomorphism)? I saw one proof of this result, but the proof is over algebraic closed field and they use Jordan canonical form. Could anyone explain this for me and give a purely algebraic proof. Use matrix method or the module structrue, but must be on the ground field $F$. Thanks in advance. By the way, are there any relations between this and the double centralizer theorem of central simple algebra? 

This is called a chief series or principal series. The quotients of the terms in the series are called chief factors, and the length of the series is called the chief length. Non-isomorphic groups can have isomorphic chief factors. It depends on your definition of isomorphism of chief series whether non-isomorphic groups can have isomorphic chief series (for instance, if G itself is part of the data of the chief series, then G is obviously determined by its series). The chief length is a group isomorphism invariant. There is a version of Schreier's refinement theorem that applies to chief series. Groups can have many chief series, though some groups have only one, like S4 and SL(2,3) (which have the same chief factors but in a different sort of order). 

That is what I assume you meant. This gives "Runtime error: too much looping" in V2.16-10. Magma agrees that MinP over Z/3Z has Galois group S5, and A5 over the field with four elements (a silly trick you might use if you want to stick with magma). 

Cholesky update Rank one updates, chol(A) to chol(A+xx*), are easy and safe. Rank one "downdates", chol(A) to chol(A-xx*), are easy but require a little care: stable algorithms are given in Stewart's Matrix Algorithms Vol 1, Algorithm 4.3.8, p. 347. Chapter 12.5 of Golub–Van Loan has some similar stuff, and Cholesky down-dating in 12.5.4. This function has been widely implemented, and the cholupdate command in matlab dates back to 1979 code from LINPACK. [0,B*;B,0] is a sum of rank one matrices, and so by updating and downdating those rank one guys, you could probably get what you want, and it might even be faster than chol(Q). However, it can be a lot better to update more ranks at a time. Apparently this is a common request in machine learning, and M. Seeger wrote a technical report on this problem of low rank updates to a Cholesky factorization, and mentions several common pitfalls, especially as regards to actually doing it with existing software. A more scholarly (and older) treatment is in section 3 of this article version of Ch. 12.5 of GvL: Gill, P. E.; Golub, G. H.; Murray, W.; Saunders, M. A. "Methods for modifying matrix factorizations." Math. Comp. 28 (1974), 505–535. MR343558 DOI:10.2307/2005923 Davis and Hager in MR1824053 note that algorithm C1 can be used for a reasonably efficient, multiple rank, single pass, update of a dense matrix (and go on to describe sparse techniques). Note that these mostly do not take advantage of the block structure of [0,B*;B,0], so you might find something better that is more specialized. 

I found a proof and post it here for completeness/further reference. Suppose $f \circ g^{-1}$ is isotopic to a conformal map $h \colon \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_g \rightarrow \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_f$. Abbreviate $g_0 = f \circ g^{-1}$. Let $[g_0]_*$ and $[h]_*$ denote the induced maps $\Gamma_g \rightarrow \Gamma_f$ on the fundamental groups. Suppose the isotopy is realized by homeomorphisms $G_t$. Then the induced maps $[G_t]_* \colon \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_g \rightarrow \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_f$ depend continuously on $t$ and, hence, must be the same for all $t$. In particular, $$[g_0]_* = [G_0]_* = [G_1]_* = [h]_*.$$ Fix a compact fundamental domain $F$ for $\Gamma_g$ in $\mathbb{H}$. Let $g_0^*$ and $h^*$ be lifts of $g_0$ and $h$, respectively. Given any $w \in \mathbb{H}$, take $\gamma \in \Gamma_g$ and $z \in F$ with $\gamma(z) = w$. Then $$ d(g_0^*(w),h^*(w)) = d(g_0^* \circ \gamma(z),h^* \circ \gamma(z)) = d([h]_*(\gamma) \circ g_0^*(z),[h]_*(\gamma) \circ h^*(z)) = d(g_0^*(z),h^*(z)). $$ Since $F$ is compact, we see that $ d(g_0^*(w),h^*(w)) $ is uniformly bounded in $\mathbb{H}$. As discussed in the question, we have $h' \circ \overline{g_0^*} = g_0^*$ on $\mathbb{H}$ for some conformal map $h'$. The uniform bound tells us that $h' \circ \overline{g_0^*}$ and $h^*$ are the same on $\partial \mathbb{H}$. Thus, $\overline{g_0^*} = h'^{-1} \circ h^*$ is a M{\"o}bius transformation on $\partial \mathbb{H}$ that fixes 0, 1 and $\infty$, i.e. it is the identity on $\partial \mathbb{H}$. Lastly, we only need to see that $\overline{g_0^*} = \overline{f^*} \circ (\overline{g^*})^{-1}$. 

Let $\mathbb{H} \subset \mathbb{C}$ be the upper half plane. First recall the following statement: if $f^* \colon \mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$ is quasi-conformal (qc), then there exists an extension $\overline{f^*} \colon \overline{\mathbb{H}} \rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{H}}$ of $f^*$. Note that this is an extension in the following sense: we do not (neccessarily) have $\overline{f^*} = f^*$ on $\mathbb{H}$ but they are conformally eqiuvalent, i.e. they are equal after composing with a conformal map. Now fix a Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ so that $\mathbb{H} / \Gamma$ is a compact Riemann surface. A qc map $f \colon \mathbb{H} / \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_f$ to some other Riemann surface has a qc lift $f^* \colon \mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{H}$. This map has an extension $\overline{f^*}$ in the sense above. After composing it with a conformal map, we can assume that $\overline{f^*}$ fixes 0, 1 and $\infty$. By a version of the measurable Riemann mapping theorem for the upper half plane, this map $\overline{f^*}$ is then unique. I am intersted in the following statement: for two qc maps $f \colon \mathbb{H} / \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_f$ and $g \colon \mathbb{H} / \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{H} / \Gamma_g$ with the same domain but possibly different images we have the following: the composition $f \circ g^{-1}$ is isotopic to a conformal map if and only if the lift extensions $\overline{f^*}$ and $\overline{g^*}$ agree on the real line. I proved the backwards direction but assuming that $f \circ g^{-1}$ is isotopic to a conformal map, I do not know how to deduce equality of the extended lifts on $\mathbb{R}$. Remark: I do not know for sure whether the statement is true but I stronly believe so. Cheers!
