Counter-example for $(1)$: $G = SO(2,2)$ with $V$ the standard four dimensional rep. To be concrete, $G$ preserves the quadratic form $q(w,x,y,z) = w^2+x^2-y^2-z^2$. $U$ is the two dimensional subspace $\mathrm{Span}((1,0,1,0), (0,1,0,1))$ and $W = \mathrm{Span}((1,0,1,0), (0,1,0,-1))$. Geometrically, inside the $3$-sphere $S:=(\mathbb{R}^4 \setminus \{ 0 \})/\mathbb{R}_{+}$, the quadratic $w^2+x^2=y^2+z^2$ cuts out a torus $T$, and $G$ takes this torus to itself. (One can see this by intersecting $w^2+x^2=y^2+z^2$ with $w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2=1$ to get $w^2+x^2=y^2+z^2=1/2$, clearly a torus.) The images of $U$ and $W$ in $S$ are two circles which have intersection number $2$ on the torus, so you can't move them not to intersect. An algebraic geometer would work in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ rather than $S$, and would say that $T$ is a quadric surface and $U$ and $W$ belong to opposite rulings of the surface. 

By Gale duality, the possible arrangements of $16$ points in $\mathbb{R}^9$ are in bijection with the arrangements of $16$ points in $\mathbb{R}^5$. See Ziegler, Lectures on Polytopes, Chapter 6 for background on this. In particular, Corollary 6.20 in Ziegler tells you which configurations of 16 points in $\mathbb{R}^5$ are Gale dual to vertices of polytopes. I don't think you are going to find a listing of all possible combinatorial types of $16$ points in $\mathbb{R}^5$ anywhere. The Oriented Matroid database is collecting this sort of data but, as you can see, the number of isomorphism classes of even 9 points in $\mathbb{R}^5$ is already listed as "unknown". In short, there are tools to analyze this sort of thing, namely Gale duality and oriented matroids, but a complete list is likely to be out of reach. 

Regarding your question about constructing $\bar{\partial}$ in a coordinate free way: Surprisingly, I don't know how to do this. But I can give you a coordinate free axiomatization of $\bar{\partial}$. Let $\mathcal{O}$ be the sheaf of holomorphic functions and $C^{\infty}$ the sheaf of smooth functions. Let $M$ be a locally free $\mathcal{O}$ sheaf and let $C^{\infty}(M)$ be $M \otimes_{\mathcal{O}} C^{\infty}$. 

The key will be to use Theorem 2 in the paper of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer cited by Peter Mueller. Since this result is stated less precisely than we need, and in a slightly incorrect way, we rephrase. Let $f \in \FF_q[x]$ be a separable polynomial of degree $d$, and let $G$ be the Galois group of the splitting field of $f(x)-y$ over $F(y)$. Let $\FF_{q^s}$ be the algebraic closure of $\FF_q$ in this splitting field. Then we get a natural surjection $\pi: G \to \mathrm{Gal}(\FF_{q^s} / \FF_q) \cong \mathbb{Z}/s$. Define the kernel of this surjection to be $G^+$. Note that $\mathrm{Gal}(\FF_{q^s} / \FF_q)$ has a canonical generator, the Frobenius map $\mathrm{Frob}$. Note also that $G$ naturally embeds in $S_d$. We may thus say that an element of $G$ has no fixed points, meaning it has no fixed points under this embedding. Theorem (Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer) There are constants $\lambda_0$, $\lambda_1$, ..., $\lambda_{s-1}$ such that $$|f(\FF_{q^{ms+i}})| = \lambda_i q^{ms+i} + O(q^{(ms+i)/2}).$$ Explicitly, $\lambda_i$ is the probability that a random element of $\pi^{-1}(\mathrm{Frob}^i)$ has a fixed point, and the constant in the big $O$ depends only on $d$, $G$ and $G^+$. The paper does not give an explicit recipe for $\lambda_i$, and does not note the need to use $s$ different lambdas, but this is what I got when I traced through their proof. As a sanity check, let $q \equiv 2 \bmod 3$ and let $f(x)=x^3$. Then $G=S_3$, $G^{+}=A_3$ and $s=2$. We predict that all of the elements in $\FF_{q^{2m+1}}$ are cubes, but only $1/3$ of the elements in $\FF_{q^{2m}}$; this is true. Our actual result will be the following: Theorem Let $\phi(x) = x^{r+1}$ as before and work over the ground field $\FF_r$. When $f=\phi_a$ for $a \neq 0$, then $G=G^{+}=PGL_2(\FF_r)$, acting on $r+1$ elements by the natural action on $\mathbb{P}^1(\FF_r)$. When $a=0$, we have $G=\mathbb{Z}/2 \ltimes \mathbb{Z}/(r+1)$, acting on $r+1$ elements by the dihedral action, and $G^{+} = \mathbb{Z}/(r+1)$. We then must compute the proportion of elements in each case which have fixed points. 

This argument is fairly standard, but it is quicker to repeat it than to find a reference: Let $G$ be a finite subgroup of $GL_n(\mathbb{Q})$. Set $\Lambda = \sum_{g \in G} g \cdot \mathbb{Z}^n \subset \mathbb{Q}^n$. Then $\Lambda$ is a finitely generated torsion free abelian group, hence isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^r$ for some $r$. Since $\mathbb{Z}^n \subseteq \Lambda \subset \mathbb{Q}^n$, we have $r=n$. Clearly, $g \Lambda = \Lambda$ for all $g \in G$. Let $h \in GL_n(\mathbb{Q})$ take the standard basis to a basis of $\Lambda$, so $h \mathbb{Z}^n = \Lambda$ and $\mathbb{Z}^n = h^{-1} \Lambda$. Then $h^{-1} g h$ takes $h^{-1} \Lambda = \mathbb{Z}^n$ to itself for all $g \in G$, so $h^{-1} G h \subset GL_n(\mathbb{Z})$. 

The classic answer to this is Courant and Robbins, What is Mathematics? A bit dated, but certainly worth looking at if you haven't yet. 

Two compatibly oriented triangles $URL$ The image shows two triangle in an oriented surface. An orientation is a compatible choice of "clockwise" everywhere on the surface; observe that both triangles are oriented clockwise. The edges which are glued together point in opposite directions. A triangulated oriented surface looks locally like this picture at each pair of triangles. 

dhy's comment is correct, of course. You can also see that the answer is "no" by dimension counting. Fix a degree $d$. By a Riemann-Hurwitz computation, a degree $d$ cover of a genus $1$ curve by a genus $2$ curve is ramified over $2$ points (or doubly ramified over one point.) Given a positive integer $d$, a genus $1$ curve $E$ and two points $p$ and $q$, there are finitely many covers $X \to E$ of degree $d$ ramified only over $p$ and $q$. (Since each of them comes from one of finitely many maps $\pi_1(E \setminus \{ p,q \}) \to S_d$.) So, for fixed $d$, such covers are described by some finite covering of $M_{1,2}$. Now, $\dim M_{1,2} = 2$. So, for each $d$, we get a surface of such genus $2$ curves and, as $d$ varies, we get countably many such surfaces. Counteably many surfaces can't fill up the three-fold $M_2$. 

For $D=-1$, Landau proved that $$\# S(-1, x) \sim K \frac{x}{\sqrt{\log x}}$$ where $K = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \prod_{p \equiv 3 \bmod 4} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-p^{-2}}}$. This shows that, for fixed $0<a<b$, $$\# S(-1,x) \cap [ax,bx] \sim K \left( \frac{bx}{\sqrt{\log(bx)}} - \frac{ax}{\sqrt{\log(ax)}} \right)$$ and $$ K \left( \frac{bx}{\sqrt{\log(bx)}} - \frac{ax}{\sqrt{\log(ax)}} \right) = K \left( \frac{bx}{\sqrt{\log x + \log b}} - \frac{ax}{\sqrt{\log x + \log a}} \right)$$ $$= K \left( \frac{bx}{\sqrt{\log x}} +O\left( \frac{x}{(\log x)^{3/2}} \right) - \frac{ax}{\sqrt{\log x}} - O\left( \frac{x}{(\log x)^{3/2}} \right) \right) \sim K \frac{(b-a)x}{\sqrt{\log x}}$$ So they are equidistributed in that $\frac{\#(S(-1,x) \cap [ax,bx])}{\#S(-1,x)}$ approaches $b-a$ but, if you ask for the denominator to be $x$, then the limit just goes to zero. I believe the same should be true for any nonsquare $D$. Let $$Z_D(s) = \prod_{\left( \frac{D}{p} \right) = 1} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} = \sum_{D \ \mbox{is a square modulo}\ n} \frac{1}{n^s}.$$ The proof of Landau's theorem in Leveque's "Topics in number theory" comes down to analyzing the behavior of $Z_D(s)$ on $Re(s)=1$. The key facts are that $Z_{-1}(s) = C (s-1)^{1/2} + \cdots$ and $Z_{-1}(s)$ is otherwise bounded on $Re(s)=1$. These results hold for any nonsquare $D$. Let $\zeta_D(s)$ be the zeta function of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$. Then $$\frac{Z_D(s)^2}{\zeta_D(s)} =\left( \mbox{factors for primes dividing}\ 2D \right) \times \prod_{\left( \frac{D}{p} \right) = -1} \left( 1- \frac{1}{p^{2s}} \right) .$$ The right hand side is clearly convergent to the right of $Re(s)=1/2$, and $\zeta_D(s)$ is well known to have a simple pole at $s=1$ and no other poles on the line $Re(s)=1$.
