Consider the following 2x2 game: \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline &C&R\\\hline M&0,0&3,5\\\hline D&4,4&0,3\\\hline \end{array} This game has two distinct pure-strategy Nash equilibria. I recall that in cases like this there is almost always a third mixed NE, and this had to do with the index theorem and having an odd number of equilibria. Can someone provide the idea behind the index theorem and why having two distinct pure strategy NE in 2x2, 2 person game, static, complete information results into a third mixed NE with probability 1? 

I have read the statement below and don't quite understand what it means. This is probably because I don't have full understanding of duality with support function in math, but just to foster understanding... The statement is: 

Could you still argue the limited special edition CD is a substitute for the wireless controller? Maybe. But notice you still desire the wireless controller given it is wireless and limited edition. One of the reasons why you forgo the chance to buy this controller is you are effectively poorer than before. And this is an important distinction to make, because the decrease in the quantity of the controller may be from the direct impact of the increase in the price of the game CD but also the induced effect through your wealth (i.e. thinner wallet). If you want to investigate the true relationship between two goods, you have to take both wealth and price effects into account on top of the given information, say whether the good is Giffen or inferior or both or something else. Hope this helps. 

It depends on whether all the tickets are sold or not. If sold out, all the the tax burden is borne by the buyers. If not, then it's shared. If sold out, buyers pay all the tax. If all 39,000 tickets are sold, then your reasoning holds correct. The revenue the owners receive with the tax will equal the income to the owners without the tax. $$R = P \cdot Q_{max}$$ Where $R$ is the total revenue from ticket sales to owners, $P$ is the average ticket price, $Q(P)$ is the total quantity of tickets sold and $Q_{max}$ is the total quantity of tickets available to be sold (39,000 in this case). $$ Q_{max} = 39,000 $$ The total amount of tax revenue received by the government will equal the total amount of taxes paid by the ticket buyers. $$T_{paid} = T_{received} = \$5 \times 39,000 = \$195,000$$ If not, the tax burden is shared. When the stadium does not sell out, then the price elasticity of demand kicks in and causes both parties to share the tax burden. Keep in mind, the ticket sellers still earn the same amount per ticket, their shared tax burden (economic loss) comes from a reduced number of ticket sales due to the increase in ticket cost paid by the ticket buyers. The reduction in ticket sales represents a cost of lost opportunity of a perishable asset (i.e., the unsold tickets). The amount the buyers, in aggregate, reduce their ticket purchases will be proportional to the price elasticity of demand. The below diagram shows the impact of taxation on ticket sales, price and quantity sold. 

In Econ 101 textbooks, there are lots of examples and emphasis on marginal analysis leading to the greatest equation of all, $MB=MC$. My challenge is the following and wonder if anyone had a similar issue or a way to get over it: One of the textbooks examples use consuming pizza or water. First unit brings you the biggest joy. Then it diminishes. So student would understand each additional unit of pizza wouldn't bring the same amount (e.g. initial v. when you are full) utility. But then there comes a time where you are quite full and feel satisfied. At this point, additional unit of consumption would probably make you feel sick or vomit, so it is not "worth the money" to spend on. 

Here I used $u(.)$ and $\alpha(.)$ interchangeably to represent the utility function. Can somebody elaborate the above claim just little more in detail please? I understand monotonicity implies local nonsatiation, hence, in any given small ball, you always have some bundle that you prefer that to x. Part of my confusion comes from the Figure they present, which is they put the bundle x on the indifference curve ($\{y\in X:y\sim x$}). But isn't $\alpha(x')$ on the diagnoal line Z? Please help. Thank you. 

Consider a static, complete information game with 2 players. Strategy sets are $S_1=\{U,D\},S_2=\{l,m,r\}$. Payoffs are irrelevant to this question as I am trying to get the concept of rationalizability correct. Suppose I want to verify whether $m$ is a rationalizable strategy for player 2. Then, I want to ask the following question: $\exists \sigma_1=(q^*,1-q^*)\in\Delta(S_1)$ such that for $\sigma^*_2=(0,1,0),$ $u_2(\sigma_1,\sigma^*_2)\geq u_2(\sigma_1,\sigma_2)$ for all $\sigma_2\in\Delta(S_2)?$ Now, suppose I have payoff matrix such that I could find $(q^*,1-q^*)$ such that it satisfies both: (1) $u_2(\sigma_1,\sigma^*_2)\geq u_2(\sigma_1,(1,0,0))$ (2) $u_2(\sigma_1,\sigma^*_2)\geq u_2(\sigma_1,(0,0,1))$. This means, I could find a valid range of $q^*$ such that for player 2, choosing $m$ provides a weakly better payoff for her compared to the degenerate (i.e. pure) strategies of $l$ or $r$. My question is: If I could find such $q^*$ that satisfies both (1),(2), then I do not have to check for any other strategy profiles in $\Delta(S_2)$, that is any convex combo of $(1,0,0)$ and $(0,0,1)$? My intuition is that for any $\alpha\in[0,1]$, I could simple have: (1)' $\alpha u_2(\sigma_1,\sigma^*_2)\geq \alpha u_2(\sigma_1,(1,0,0))$ (2)' $(1-\alpha)u_2(\sigma_1,\sigma^*_2)\geq (1-\alpha)u_2(\sigma_1,(0,0,1))$. and show that (1)'+(2)'implies the degenerate strategy $m$ for player 2 is a best response to some belief, $\sigma_1\in\Delta(S_1)$. Hence, the bottom line is (1),(2) is sufficient, and I do not have to check the convex combo of the two other pure strategies. 

If short term rates are positive and long term rates are negative then short term rates must be higher than long term rates. Therefore, the yield curve will be considered inverted by definition. Remember, central banks set the interbank overnight lending rate as a matter of policy. In the U.S., this is called the Federal Reserve Funds Rate. This is the shortest possible maturity. So this is the leftmost point on the yield curve. By contrast, supply-demand equilibrium (i.e., the market) sets long-term bond prices. And, as we know, bond prices are inversely correlated to their yields. So when the market demand increases for long term bonds, their prices rise and their yields fall. 

It would depend a lot on how the debt was "erased." If you are simply suggesting a transfer payment from creditor to debtor, what would force such an event? Or would it be voluntary? If it were forced, then you would have a threat to private property rights and therefore, a disincentive for further lending. Security of capital would be diminished and all investment might stop overnight. This question is very broad. But the answer of what might happen would depend very much on the details of how all this might come about. 

Convenience premium. The market prices in a premium for convenience. This explains why hot dogs cost more inside the ballpark than at the convenience store outside the ballpark. And why convenience store goods cost more than those sold at the supermarket. Put another way: Part of the cost of an item is not just the cost of materials and labor to get it there, but there is also a cost of availability. In other words, when you don't purchase the gas on the highway, the cost of it being available there is still present. Which you pay when you buy. Note: This answer agrees with the price elasticity explanation given by @Ubiquitous but avoids the price elasticity concept in favor of the perhaps more lay concept of convenience premium. 

$p(0)\geq c'(0)$ is assumed so that the inverse demand curve originates above the marginal cost curve. But what is the intuition behind this assumption? The highest willing-to-pay consumer is more than the marginal cost of producing the first unit? Is this going to be the variable cost of producing the first unit? 

In MWG, the authors introduce the consequentialist view of risk by assuming for any risky alternative, only the reduced lottery over final outcome matters to decision maker. From philosophical view, how reasonable and unreasonable is this assumption? Can you provide examples where this assumption is in fact reasonable while it isn't? 

Often in macro pure exchange economy models (sequential trading), authors make the initial period good price $P_0=1$ asserting this set-up is to make the consumption at period $0$ the numeraire. But I don't see any detailed explanation or justification for doing this. Just to add some background story: The usual set-up is that agents are endowed with some units of goods, say oranges. So the unit of their consumptions is oranges. $P_t$ often the price, at $t=0$, of an orange consumption promised for delivery in period $t$. Why make $P_0=1$? 

According to MWG Proposition 6.B.2, it illustrates that the expected utility form is preserved only by increasing linear transformation. What is the significance of this proposition? The part I find challenging in connecting the dots is when right after the proof of this proposition, the authors claim that this proposition allows us to interpret meaning in differences of utilities. How are these two exactly connected? 

We also know that for a competitive market, the supply curve is the sum of the marginal cost curves. Can one make an extension of this idea to having the demand curve being equal to the sum of marginal revenue curves with its slope coefficient doubled? 

Im interested in programming a budget line or PPF which is responsive to changes in relative prices, and income effect. I know the equation for the budget line is $$m\geq p_1x_1+p_2x_2$$ Lets say we have an Income of $m=100$ and prices $p_1=1$ and $p_2=2$. How would I go about programming this into an excel spreadsheet or R? 

In Microeconomics producer surplus is equivalent to profits. However getting a tangible definition of consumer surplus has been difficult for me to ponder. What is the practical use of knowing consumer surplus and what does it tell us? 

I've been thinking about how to answer this question How to econometrically identify perfect complements in production? and may think that multicollinearity has something to do with identifying such a process. If I have a regression such that: $$y=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\mu$$ where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are correlated with each other. does that imply that some function of the nature $\min\{x_1,x_2\}$ is present in the determination of $y$? 

Well you can essentially forecast anything using a VAR/VECM framework. If you're wondering if such estimates will be accurate the answer really depends on the region, as the Okun Coefficent differs depending on where you are. (much like the law of gravity on earth). a working paper released by the IMF titled Do Forecasters Beleive in Okun's Law? its conclusions were rather in favor for the use of Okun's law in forcasting. 

Price elasticity of demand is related (but not equal) to the inverse of the slope of the demand curve. This Wikipedia article defines PED as: 

No need to seek a mechanism because the inverted yield curve occurs by definition in the scenario you describe. This Investopedia video defines inverted yield curve as follows: 

Diclaimer: This is not a homework question. Every word of it was written originally by me. Hypothetical Scenario Alice is shopping for groceries and thinks the current price of bananas at 0.79/lb is a little too high for her budget. Alice calls Bob, her local legislator, and asks Bob to sponsor a bill that regulates the price of bananas to cost no more than $0.50/lb in the grocery store so Alice can afford to buy them. Bob thinks this is a great idea because it will help more people (especially the poor and those on a fixed income) afford to buy more bananas — a very nutritious food. Question Is this bill to regulate the price of bananas really a good idea? What would be the impact of such a law if it were to pass? 

Let's define $P^*$ the price of market equilibrium, $Q_D$ as the quantity demanded and $E_D$ as price elasticity of demand. Then: $$ {slope} = \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q_D} $$ And in mathematical terms, the verbal description of the PED reduces to: $$ E_D = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q_D}{Q_D} \cdot 100}{\frac{\Delta P}{P^*} \cdot 100} $$ $$ E_D = \frac{P^*}{Q_D} \cdot \frac{\Delta Q_D} {\Delta P} $$ $$ E_D = \frac{P^*}{Q_D} \cdot \frac{1}{slope} $$ Edit Constructive comments have been incorporated into this answer. In particular, @Kontorus pointed out: 

How would one go about modelling "supply induced demand" (SID) using the regular supply and demand model and how is SID different from price discrimination? 

The reason why the answers are different is because the way you solved the for marginal revenue on your own includes $P$ in your solution. The reason why this is problematic is because $MR=P$ for a monopolist. You'll end up with some mathematically impossible statements when attempting to find the optimal quantity produced. I.e. 

Budget lines and Cost functions In consumer theory, you have a budget line represented by the formula: $$m=p_1x_1+p_2x_2$$ In producer theory we call it a cost function. $$C(x_1,x_2)=w_1x_1+w_2x_2$$ we either want to maximize consumption given a budget/cost function or minimize costs holding your utility/output level constant. To do this we use another equation: The Lagrangian Multiplier: Though not exclusive to economics tool per say, its the primary tool of all intermediate microeconomics students. $$\mathcal{L}=f(x_1,x_2)\pm\lambda(H-g(x_1,x_2))$$ where $H-g(x_1,x_2)$ is either a budget line/cost function or Utility/Production function when its equal to zero. We use this for calculating utility/profit maximizing consumption bundles/inputs or Minimize Costs holding profit/utility constant. And thats a wrap!* 

In basic intertemporal models the general assumption is that the objective utility function does not change. mathematically it makes the model simple to compute, however it does not reflect the changes in preferences over time. However, if we do allow the individuals utility function to change over time in our model, does this not violate the requirements for a rational consumer ? How do we model an individual with changing preferences over time and is it economically sound to do so?
