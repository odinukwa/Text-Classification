Greenhouse effect - not remotely. The volume of the comet is about 1.4 x $10^9$ cubic meters. The area of Mars is about 1.45 x $10^6$ $km^2$, so each square kilometer will receive about 1000 cubic meters of comet. Comets are primarily water and rock. Let's be optimistic and go for 1% CO2. Solid CO2 has a density of about 1600 kg/$m^3$, so the total CO2 load will be about 0.16 grams of CO2 per square meter of surface. By comparison, a square meter on earth has an atmospheric column about 8.5 km high if converted to sea level density, with a density of 1.3 g/$m^3$ or about 11 kg equivalent. At 400 ppmv, that's about 5 grams/square meter. In other words, whacking Mars with this comet might introduce a carbon dioxide layer totaling about 1/30th that of earth. Even if you make the unwarranted assumption that the comet is 10% CO2, the result is 1/3 that of earth. So, no runaway greenhouse. 

UFOs attacked the ships and did no damage? Good news for us, bad news for the aliens. You'd think that aliens would be able to do some damage, wouldn't you? Pretty wimpy aliens, if you ask me. 

That's pretty straightforward: you can make it as big as you like. Of course, if it gets much bigger than the earth, the earth will be the moon. Since the moon doesn't have an iron core it is less dense than earth, so if the makeup and densities are kept the same, the moon will have to get somewhat larger than earth before it becomes more massive, which is what counts in determining which is primary and which is satellite. Since the current diameter ratio of moon to earth is 0.237, the moon can get about 4 times bigger than it is now, and still be the moon. Of course, if it does get that big it will probably have an atmosphere and won't look at all like it does, but rather more like earth. 

This is an entertaining question, and one with considerable intricacies attached. First, of course, is the problem of production, which has already been mentioned. The low half-life is a real problem, and packaging and distribution must be accomplished very quickly. Now, as to distribution. The obvious way to do this is to produce nanoparticles of PoO2 (polonium dioxide) with a mass on the order of 200 nanograms. Inhaled LD50 is estimated at about 89 ng, so 200 ng seems a reasonable figure. In this case the worst-case lethality of 1 kg of mother polonium is about 5 million people. Of course, as mentioned this requires a very small delay between polonium production and application. At a guess, you'd dissolve the Po in some acid, then do a controlled precipitation of PoO2 to produce the required fine powder. (Drying the powder would be no problem, due to self-induced heating.) The powder would need to be mixed with some sort of anti-clumping agent, but that is left as an exercise for the reader. With a density of about 8.9 g/cm^3, the diameter of such particles would be around 10 um. For nominal dust, the settling rate for such particles is on the order of 30-40 mm/sec, although PoO2 has a greater density and will settle somewhat faster. As a result, the particles will remain airborne for considerable periods if properly dispersed, but are unlikely to drift for long distances in the air. Making a single polonium bomb is not in the cards, either. A gram of Po210 puts out about 140 watts, so a 1.13 kg slug of PoO2 will produce 140 kW, and fuse in a matter of moments. Plus, of course, the dispersal charge will be destroyed as well in very short order. So delivery would be by way of multiple much smaller bombs, each with some mechanism for cooling the things during transport. Since the settling rate for the particles is not terribly low, fairly powerful dispersing charges seem a good idea, and design of such units would do well to unmask the bombs just before detonation in order to prevent the ejecta from being trapped in surrounding material. Weather will play a part in producing a successful operation, since rain will tend to wash the active particles out of the atmosphere. And while contamination of drinking water is nearly as bad as inhalation, there are two mitigating factors. The first, of course, is that existing supplies of water can be used until imported water takes up the slack, and the second is that the problem is "temporary", in the sense that in a few years the activity level will have greatly reduced due to the short lifetime of polonium. In other words, you do have to breathe local air, but you don't have to drink local water. The refugee problem associated with a successful deployment of such a system of devices will be considerable. The problem is that each refugee would need meticulous decontamination (probably including shaving the head) to rid them of any dust which might become airborne and then inhaled by the host community. In broad outline, the refugees would have to be treated as if they are carriers of some really scary disease like Ebola, and the history of such events is not very reassuring. 

At a handwavium level, a reactionless drive is simply explained by a unification theory. Just as mass and energy are not conserved separately (or nuclear reactions wouldn't work), so this advanced theory will explain that momentum and energy are not conserved separately, but can be converted from one to the other. At "normal" levels of experience, of course, the two are separate, just as mass and energy are separate and their conservation laws are considered to be independent. The details are left as an exercise for the reader. In the 50's and 60's, the conditions required for the unification to give practical results were usually described as interacting, opposed magnetic fields which "stress the fabric of space-time", but this has obviously fallen out of favor, and for very good reason - opposed magnetic fields may stress the generators, but the fields themselves really don't care. High energy levels don't seem to do the trick, either, since momentum appears to be conserved in the LHC, and the local energy levels associated with its collisions are getting to within spitting distance of really fundamentally important levels. Introducing such a theory is obviously a challenge for an author, and the best strategy seems to be simply to refer to it in passing. Details can be shrugged off as too abstruse for all but the greatest researchers, or perhaps dependent on such monumental computation levels as to require fabulously powerful computers (with similarly powerful software). 

Assuming a relatively small oxygen supply and a total effective suit density greater than water, the astronaut will need to be able to roughly figure his reentry duration so as not to fall into the middle of the ocean. Since his suit is denser than water he'll sink to the bottom, and although the suit might protect him from high pressure as well as vacuum (handwavium, remember?) it's going to take him a long time to walk to shore. So he'll need his orbital speed and altitude, as well as the delta-v his reentry thrusters will produce. Using these he can calculate his nominal fall deceleration, his fall time, and the lateral distance this fall will cover. The actual distance will be less than this, since his aerodynamic braking will also reduce his lateral velocity, but it sets a limit to how far he has to look ahead before deciding to fire his thruster. 

The most probable event(s) I can think of would be the Iraqis getting lucky in their Scud strikes on Israel. Instead of a few civilian casualties, let's say a day care center was hit, followed closely by the destruction of a synagogue during a service, in both cases with massive loss of life resulting. In this case, Israeli public opinion might well have forced the Israeli government to start attacking Iraq, potentially sucking most of the neighboring countries into the mess. (This, in fact, is exactly what the US worried about.) The resulting massive conflict would engulf much of the mid-East, and the US would, at the least, have been forced to divert forces from the Iraqi effort. Of course, in the worst case (from the Iraqi point of view) the Israelis might have been so threatened that they would have resorted to their (publicly unacknowledged) nuclear option, and they probably would have been sure that Iraq would have received some reward for starting the whole mess. Another possibility would be a decision by the US not to trust GPS, which was untried at the time. With no GPS for navigation, the Coalition would have had to try a frontal assault, and would have played into Hussein's strengths (such as they were). In this case, there is every reason to think that the US losses would have been much higher, although I'm doubtful that the end result would have changed much. Conceivably, US opinion would have been affected to the point of accepting a negotiated peace which would have left Hussein in power. I'm not convinced that this would have happened, but it's an interesting possibility. 

Probably not. On the one hand, your SF6 concentration, about 100 times that of CO2 on Earth, implies a truly fabulous greenhouse effect, since SF6 is about 30,000 times more potent as a greenhouse effect than CO2. This suggests that the planet is far away from the star which it orbits. At the same time, 10% ozone is an astounding level. In the Earth's Ozone Layer, the concentration is on the order of 2 to 8 ppm. So apparently the UV levels are enormously greater than at the earth, at the same time that the visible and IR levels are much lower. This in turn suggests that the "sun" for this planet is something like a neutron star and the emission of that class peaks in the x-ray portion of the spectrum. 

The coilgun specifications are still not making a great deal of sense, since the projectile is 50 mm in diameter and only 90 mm long, making a stubby projectile which is not at all well-adapted to penetrating armor. Nonetheless, we'll go with it. A steel cylinder of these dimensions will weigh about 1.4 kg. Assuming 100% coilgun efficiency this will produce a velocity of about 40 km/sec for 1.1 GJ, since$$\frac{mv^2}{2} = 1.1\times10^9 $$ and $$v=\sqrt{\frac{2.2\times10^9}{m}}=\sqrt{\frac{22}{1.4}}\times 10^4=12.5\times10^4=40,000$$ This site discusses historical formulae for armor penetration of steel armor, and these use Imperial quantities, so D = 2 inches W = 3 lbs V = 132,000 ft/sec A representative formula for the penetration referenced to projectile diameter (T/D) is $$\frac{T}{D}= (0.00005021) D^{0.07144}[(\frac{W}{D^3})(V/C)^2(2Cos^3(Ob)]^{0.71429}$$ where C is in the vicinity of 1.2, and Ob is the incidence angle. Assuming normal incidence, the cos term is 1 and drops out, leaving $$\frac{T}{D}= (0.00005021) D^{0.07144}[(\frac{W}{D^3})(V/C)^2]^{0.71429}$$ Crunching through this gives$$\frac{T}{D}=432.6$$ so $$T = 865\text{ inches} = 22\text{ meters} $$ Of course, this is an unrealistic number, as discussed in the link, since the projectile speed is much greater than the speed of sound in either the armor or the projectile. Nonetheless, it suggests that penetration of a meter of armor should be no problem as long the impact angle is fairly close to normal. Another way to look at the problem is to assume that the projectile creates a hemispherical crater in the armor by vaporizing it. Such a crater will have a volume of $$V = \frac{1}{2}\frac{4\pi r^3}{3} = 2 m^3$$ Assuming an armor density of 8000 kg/$m^3$ this is a mass of 16000 kg. The vaporization energy of steel is about 6.8 MJ/kg, so this worst-case measure of required energy is about 108 GJ. So the question will be, can the projectile maintain its integrity during the penetration process? If yes, it appears likely that it can penetrate a meter of armor. If 1 meter is enough depth to spread out the impact, the answer is no. I suspect that, given the high velocities involved, penetration will occur, with lots of energy left over to produce damage in the target. Making the diameter smaller and the length greater will improve performance. EDIT - It is useful to compare your proposed penetrator to a real one. The M829A1 penetrator weighs 4.6 kg and has a muzzle velocity of 5500 fps. At point blank range it will penetrate 670 mm of steel armor, so something with half the mass but 24 times the velocity would seem a reasonable candidate for 50% better penetration. However, the M829A1 is 2 1/2 times as dense as steel, considerably harder than steel, and is configured as a long slender rod. All of these things will work against your coilgun projectile. Also, just for comparison, the KE of the M829A is about 6.4 MJ.
