However I am yet to find an open source document which explains the derivation of such a law. If anyone knows of a source Id appreciate it. 

Do utility functions imply that if a consumer's income infinite, his consumption should also be infinite? The reason why I'd think this is the case is based on my basic understanding of utility functions. Recall your cobb-douglas style utility function: $$U(x_1...x_n)=\prod_{i=1}^nx_i^{\alpha_i}$$ where $0<\alpha_i<1$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i=1$ If our consumer is utility maximizing he should spend all of his income in a given period or even over multiple periods. A practical application would be to answer the question of whether or not consumption growth in consumption (C) in the GDP equation can grow holding the number of consumers in an economy fixed as argued on the my answer Can an economy grow without its population growing?. Thank you to Kenny LJ for inspiring this question. 

Price discrimination is when a firm charges different prices for a homogeneous product to different consumers. In this example we see no such discrimination among consumers. This is just a case where there is competition between two firms. 

The Diewert cost function (as described in Microeconomic Analysis by Hal Varian 3rd Edition) takes the form of: $$c(w,y)=y\sum_{i=1}^k\sum_{j=1}^kb_{ij}\sqrt{w_iw_j}$$ Varian goes on to say (page 209) 

Most microeconomics problems follow this format: Though leaving out some minor details, if you do enough microeconomics practice sets the problems end up looking the same after a while. This is what I got to share. Production/Utility functions There are three main types of utility/production functions you will be exposed to in an intermediate microeconomics course1. They are: 

There seems to be a lot of misconceptions regarding the use of technology in economics. Its important to remember a two points. 1. Modern economic theory is mostly, just a branch of Applied Math Sure there are lots of fundamental philosophical concepts underlying the economics as a social science, however most practical problems require some calculus or linear algebra. 2. Economists test theories all the time using statistics. Some people don't know how data driven economics is. The utilization of Vector Auto Regressive Models (VAR),Vector Error Correction Models (VECM) and Impulse Response Functions in Macroeconomics tests is common practice. Central Banks use these methods and are constantly testing economic theories all the time. Answering the question: "What level of fiscal stimulus is better for a specific country?" has already been considering these methods for a while and are not a result of the big data revolution. Hope this helps 

Common economic thinking dictates that an increase in price should lead to an increase in supply, and that an increase in supply should then lead to a decrease in price. According to Maarten van Poelgeest, former alderman of Amsterdam, the opposite is happening in Amsterdam and other popular cities. He is quoted in an article in De Groene Amsterdammer as saying: 

Why is railway electrification in North America far less common than in Europe? I suspect that the answer has something to do with the economics of electrification. In Europe, railway electrification varies a lot between countries, ranging from 3% in Ireland to 95% in Luxembourg: 

Current official estimates for the proposed UK railway line High Speed 2 are £42.6 billion for a 192 km line, or around £222 million (€287 million) per km (if my calculations are correct). The French LGV Est total cost is around €4 billion for around 300 km, or €13 million per km — a factor 22 less than the UK price. The German Nürnberg-Erfurt high speed railway line total cost is estimated at around €5.1 billion for 190 km, or around €27 million per km — a factor 10 less than the UK price. The Swedish planned Östlänken line is estimated to cost around 30 billion SEK (€3.2 billion) for 150 km, or around €21 million per km. The French, German, and Swedish high speed railways are all in a range of 10–30 million €/km. Why is the cost for the UK High Speed 2 a factor 10 higher? What makes it so expensive? 

The reasoning by Maarten van Poelgeest appears plausible, but is there any evidence that this is actually happening? Is there evidence that an increase in housing supply leads to an increase in house prices, due to housing in the area becoming more attractive? I'm looking for an answer based on empirical evidence from trends in the past up to the present, in order to present the claim/hypothesis by Maarten van Poelgeest up to the best available measurements. 

Currency substitution is the situation where a country uses a foreign currency. For example, Montenegro and Kosovo unilaterally use the euro, El Salvador and Panama unilaterally use the dollar. In the scenario that a country would be forced to leave an existing currency union (if at all possible), what would be the advantages and disadvantages should this country unilaterally decide to keep using the larger currency? 

One of the main reasons for the general tendency to run deficits is political economy. Governments are elected for a limited period and try to stay in power by benefiting their electorate. An alternative explanation is that high debts reduce the scope for the subsequent government. So there are good reasons to impose some restrictions to the deficit into the constitution. I find the comparison to big companies misplaced. Governments fulfil different purposes than companies. Many of their 'products' are public goods (public infrastructure, education, defense, social security) which cannot be provided by private actors due to external effects. A strictly profit-oriented view of public services therefore falls short of what governments are supposed to do (which does not say there is probably lots scope for efficency-enhancing in most administrations). As a sidenote, running huge deficits is not uncommon to big companies, especially in digital services. As long as creditors are convinced these debts will be paid, companies can be run on losses for quite a while. 

These are not two densities, but one density defined on the interval $[0,1.2]$, taking two different values. The average income is then the integral of the density function, i.e. $$ \int_0^{0.5} 1 x \, dx + \int_{0.5}^{1.25} \frac{2}{3} x \, dx = \frac{9}{16} = 0.5625 $$ In order to obtain the average income, you do the same with the Utility and $\bar{z} = \frac{9}{16}$. 

I guess you are referring to a situation in which abundand supply of high-skilled workers decrease productivity such that individual ? Considering Equation (5) in Acemoglu & Autor, and capture supply of both groups of workers. If becomes sufficiently high, I don't see why the relation between both wages should not become lower than 1. 

Concering the actual 'tax tariff', there is a huge difference between those two. Income taxation usually feature lots of deductions and a progressive tariff, while deductions for payroll taxes are very limited. Beyond, payroll taxes are often defined by a fixed proportion, possibly with some maximum amount, implying an overall regressive distributional impact. A good overview on income taxes are provided in the regular. OECD Taxing Wages publications. To add to nathanwww's Answer: If payroll taxes are associated with higher pension claims in the future, individuals might rather be willing to pay them. Whether everybody does so (i.e. whether everybody has this foresight) is in my view at least debatable. Beyond, if we talk about contributions to public health insurance, payroll taxes work more like an ordinary income tax. Unlike old-age pensions, the benefit I receive from the health insurance is not related to my payments.
