You are judging by country which is prima facie prejudicial. However, there is more to it than that. For every objective injustice, there are available remedies. Apparently you have been either unable or unwilling to avail yourself of them. There are also insurances and/or business associations working from either your country or internationally that may cover things going wrong. I once subcontracted for someone who worked for a company more or less run as a sidejob of some high-ranking manager who employed partly relatives. The subcontractor had been burnt a few times since their engineering was pretty bad and they basically were on the outlook for scapegoats all the time and sue-happy. They had secured contracts through personal relations that were quite well-funded and were clearly going to blow them. But they paid really well, very significantly above industry average. The subcontractor's experience with this company was factored into his offers and he basically considered it equitable remedy. It incurred additional work and cost as every offer and delivery had to be watertight and checked and acknowledged in writing without fail. In addition there was the aggravation because of being a target for scapegoating. Basically we were talking about recording systems to be employed in cars, and they worked with their own switching power supplies on Eurocard PCBs right next to the measuring boards. I've seen their systems crash when you switched on the neon lights in the room (cars are not exactly renowned as the cleanest source of electric power) and you could measure significant AC next to the power supply just by forming a single loop with the cables from a multimeter. The subcontractor's job was the recording subsystem. So this was a system bound for failure and fingerpointing but inundated with money temporarily. And a certain scarcity of subcontractors still willing to work there. He crossed his t's and dotted his i's and cashed his cheques and paid his legal insurance and after all that came out ahead as planned, with his systems provably working as specified and, after initial tussles, certified as that. The project, of course, eventually tanked after being several years overdue and the company probably went into liquidation at some point of time and its company head reverted to his main job. The answer for you to take away here is that you can take on jobs you are sure to fail if you make sure that your payout is ensured at all steps, by advance payments at contractually ensured points of the project and taking out all proper insurances necessary to cover against a malintentioned partner. If you factor everything in into your offer, it's not a cause for worry when it gets accepted, and it's not a cause for worry when it gets rejected. Basically, you have conditions to adhere to when doing business in that country that have been shaped by your previous experience there. If stuff works better than expected repeatedly, you can factor those experiences into future offers conservatively, more likely than not based on who you are doing business with. It's not everybody's idea of fun to work under circumstances felt to be hostile. If you don't find yourself able to put together a working plan where you are secure against the kind of catastrophes you did encounter so far, I do not consider it amiss to tell your prospective business partner that previous experience with that country has shown you that your business models and procedures are a bad match to doing business there and that you currently see no way but to decline. 

Good! They have changed their ways; they have dropped their resistance (you did not tell us what they resisted to, before...). They have learned the roles surrounding a Scrum Team. As you are surely aware, a manager has only very remote responsibility in the context of a Scrum Team; you are neither the Scrum Master, nor the Product Owner, nor one of the Stakeholders, nor part of the Scrum Team itself. I remember when I got my Scrum Master certificate in a 3-day seminar; the role of "manager" was not even on the chart. If your company uses the typical matrix structure of vertical line management vs. horizontal project-related (or product-related) management (i.e. line manager <> project/product managers), then everything seems to be going according to plan. You will still have managerial responsibilities, that is, managing everything that is outside of your team's day-to-day productive work. Let me repeat your key sentence: 

No Nobody would know that you were related to that app, outside the company? As the app is already out there, it is out under the company brand. Unless you transfer official ownership of the app to your own account, nothing will change. Another question is whether it will impact your resume, and again, no. Generally, it is normal to not include the names of apps or other softwares on your resume. You will list your company, with a generic "mobile apps" topic. While commenters noted that some companies indeed ask for individual apps you worked on, a good hiring manager should understand that a single developer working on a large, bad, application, is not necessarily the one to blame. You can always use a line like "I worked on this large app XYZ as a personal challenge, but was not in a position to really change what I thought was needed to get it out of its stagnant state. I learned X, Y and Z from that experience." So, don't fret. The thing you should worry about is whether you are landing in a cesspool; a bad brownfield project with disillusioned colleagues, bad political landmines, etc.; but not whether your app store rating will suffer. 

Yes and no. I don't think you should worry too much about being laid off as engineer, but you should worry that the culture of your office changing. I don't think it's unusual for C-level execs to leave after an acquisition, the acquiring company already has their own C-levels and the C-levels at the acquired company may not want to take demotions to VP or lower positions. That said I do think you should worry that things will change in ways that will make you miserable and prepare for that. Like the other answer said, it is not possible that nothing will change for you. Things will change, the only question is whether they'll change in a way you can live with. If I were you I would start networking / looking for new opportunities now so you can find a new job quickly if it turns out the way things change at your current job doesn't work for you. Good luck! 

Yes, it's a social custom. Somebody who goes to the trouble of buying a nice purse and taking good care of it doesn't want potentially gross floor grit staining it. It's also rude to move other people's things without asking permission. 

Obviously, I am assuming that since you quoted the word "fire", they did not literally send a mail to HR to exclude you from the payroll, but they told you that they want to live Scrum to its full extent (and intent). Obviously, I am assuming that they don't actually want to cut the lines on the organizational chart of your company. Even a pure Scrum Team still needs to be rooted somewhere in the company, i.e., be part of line management, and that is you. You just are not involved in the day-to-day work anymore. 

Note: this answers the quoted question, specifically. It does not pretend to solve all problems of any company ever. It used to include something about KPIs, but that aspect was rather off-topic and removed later (hence the many comments related to KPIs...). 

And so on and so forth. In short, your higher-up role complicates the issue, and you absolutely don't want this kind of complication. Finally, what if they get hurt in some way... If it is a bookcase at work, you surely have someone who does all this stuff (move furniture, fix broken lamps and such). Rather ask them. If your colleagues actually do regularly do these kinds of things at work because you have no dedicated guy, then go ahead with your bookcase as well, but be very conscious about safety. But in this case you probably would not have asked us... 

Could mean anything, I don't think it's worth worrying about. You clearly have enough experience to get first interviews, so it could be that the employers found someone else with more experience or it could be a little while lie that HR tells you when they just liked the other candidate better. The thing with interviews is that they're fundamentally a crapshoot. To quote an excellent article about technical interviews (the whole thing is pretty long but well worth reading): 

You kind of can't, you're going to get turned down for all sorts of reasons. That said, it will never hurt your career to network more. By networking I don't mean acting like some awful slimy stereotype of a salesperson, I mean going to stuff like meetups and user groups and trying not to be a jerk. If you're especially lucky you'll directly meet a manager looking to hire, but even if you don't it's quite likely that you'll meet people who know someone who is looking to hire and can put in a good word for you. It's not necessarily fair but people just trust a friend of a friend more than they do a total stranger. 

This leaves you with the reason "taking care of personal/private matters". Do not say "family matters". Looking for a new job is a personal matter, and "personal matter" is open enough to include almost everything else you could possibly do. "Family matters" would be a lie. If someone keeps nagging, stick with it but not so that it gets aggressive or defensive. "Which personal matters?" - "Well, personal ones!". If they do not get the point after that flippant answer, your next escalation would be "I really do wish to keep this private." Be friendly while delivering that line. Do not say something like "I do not want to tell you" (whenever you use the "you" word you open yourself up for attack, or sound overly defensive - invoking the impression that you have something to hide). For me, it would be inconceivable that someone keeps nagging after that. You can repeat the last line ad nauseam if they do (well, obviously not..., but you get the gist). If they keep asking then there is something else going on and you are beyond the scope of a cookie cutter answer like this; you'll have to find out how to weasel out of it yourself. But what you said before does not put you in any attackable position. 

Yes, I think it would be better if you talked about learning new technologies. Your example answer isn't very strong unless you can spin it as you being the last line of defense against poor quality software who carefully read the specs, figured out that they didn't account for all of the edge cases, came up with suggestions for handling those edge cases, and sent the specs and suggestions back to the product manager as many times as it took to get them right. 

Don't. Nothing good will come of telling your boss that he killed your motivation. You can tell him that you feel frustrated or that you're disappointed that someone else was chosen to lead the latest project, but you will not accomplish anything by telling him he quenched the last bit of your motivation. What he's likely to take from a statement like that is that you've given up on this company and that there's nothing he can do to make you happy so he shouldn't bother. If you do leave, I personally recommend staying neutral in your exit interview. Why burn bridges if you don't need to? Save the venting for your friends, stay professional while you leave. 

While RichardU's answer is fine with me (i.e., nothing seems to be wrong with you), I would still suggest that you try to change something. Your company is quite typical; it does very laissez-faire development. It's not a problem now, but if you stay there for a few more years, you may end up getting so used to it, that it could be problematic for you to catch up. If you will be happy like this until the end of your life (who knows), then fine. But if there should arise the day where you are fed up with this kind of work (for example, if you want to become more involved with larger projects, maybe as a lead developer etc.), it may just be a little too late. So, in your situation, I would slowly try to change something, step by step. Try to introduce some semblance of a more professional development process (at least marginal amounts of peer review - think "truck factor"). If you just cannot achieve that, then put out your feelers for another job. I am not suggesting that you should put yourself under pressure; just have an open mind. I would definitely not suggest to lean back, pat yourself on the back, tell yourself that you have "impostor syndrome" and keep hacking like this forever!
