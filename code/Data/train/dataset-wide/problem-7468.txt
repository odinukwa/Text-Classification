Let $V$ be a extension closed pseudovariety. The pro-$V$ topology on a group $G$ is the unique group topology such that the set of normal subgroups $N$ with $G/N$ in $V$ is a fundamental system of neighborhoods of the identity. Let $K$ be a finitely generated subgroup of finite index of free group $FG(A)$ which is dense respect to pro-$V$ topology on the free group. Is it true that $K$ contains a subgroup of rank n(=rank of free group) which is $V$-dense? 

James Howie in the paper "The p-adic topology on a free group:a counterexample" showed that in the free group $F$ generated by $x$ and $y$,if $a=xy^2$, $b_1=x^{-2}y^{-3}$ and $b_2=x^{-2}(xy)^5$, then the equation $a=v_1^{-1}b_1v_{1} v_2^{-1}b_2v_{2}$ has not solution in the free group but it has solution in the free pro-p group where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are variables. I need to know what is the solution in the free pro-p group but I do not know how. I appreciate any idea. 

If an edge $\{x_i, e_x\}$ shows up in a perfect matching of $\hat{G}$, then also an edge $\{y_j, e_y\}$ must show up. This corresponds to have the edge $e = \{x,y\}$ as part of a $d$-factor in $G$. If the edge $\{e_x,e_y\}$ occurs in a perfect matching of $\hat{G}$ this corresponds to the edge $e = \{x,y\}$ not being part of a $d$-factor of $G$. Edit: I was able to track down the references to Tutte's reduction from the article linked in the question. The reduction above is essentially the same as the reduction in Lovász and Plummer's Matching Theory. If one has access to this book see 10.1, the reduction is slightly different because it is done in two steps ($f$-factor to $f$-matching to perfect matching). Figure 10.1.1 on page 386 in a nice example. The original Tutte paper "A short proof of the factor theorem for finite graphs" can be found online. In this paper the reduction is complementary to the one above. If we want a $d$-factor and $v$ is a vertex of degree $d_v$ we create $d_v - d$ vertices. Again each edge is replaced with a length 3 path, but this time selecting to middle edge of the path corresponds to choosing the edge in the matching rather than omitting it. 

Actually, in your case, this construction gives you a fiber bundle, as notices Johannes Ebert in next answer. So, for finite dimension fiber bundle, it is really overkill. Sorry. 

What is the canonical circle ? Ce circle in ${\bf R}^2$, centered at $(0,0)$ with radius $1$. I know two numbers $0$ and $1$, the radius cannot be $0$ because it is not a (true) circle, so the radius is $1$, now the center could be $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$ or $(1,1)$ ? I prefer $(0,0)$, $0$ is simpler than $1$. How do you fit this example with category arguments? BTW I have nothing against category theory, I like it. But I'm curious to see if this example fits general categorical arguments. 

It is a difficult problem to find the minimum distance of an LDPC. Vardy shows in The Intractability of Computing the Minimum Distance of a Code that it is NP-hard to find the minimum distance. Looking around one can find papers with various algorithms for minimum distance, but there won't be anything nice like for RS codes. For example, there is a randomized algorithm in On the Computation of the Minimum Distance of Low-Density Parity-Check Codes by Hu and Fossorier. 

I am not an expert (far from), but have done some reading on this myself a while back. So, I will share what I have found. I will summarize a few things below. Though the one of the best resources I have found is the webpage for a workshop at the University of Oregon on Cluster Algebras and Lusztig's Semicanonical Basis led by David Speyer from 2011. In particular the references page gives a great outline/overview/history along with specific references if one wants more detail. Reading the above link is probably best, but I'll highlight a few points to make the answer a bit more self-contained. As usual we have a Lie group and Lie algebra $G$ and $\mathfrak{g}$ with maximal unipotent $N$ and $\mathfrak{n}$. The canonical basis $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis of $U(\mathcal{n}).$ The semicanonical basis $\mathcal{S}$ is another basis of $U(\mathfrak{n}).$ They are constructed in different ways and $\mathcal{B}$ comes from a $q \to 1$ specialization of a basis of $U_q(\mathfrak{n})$ while $\mathcal{S}$ does not come from a quantized version. The graded Hopf dual of $U(\mathfrak{n})$ is the coordinated ring $\mathbb{C}[N].$ The dual canonical basis $\mathcal{B}^*$ and dual semicanonical basis $\mathcal{S}^*$ are bases of $\mathbb{C}[N]$ obtained by this duality. These bases have many nice properties I will omit (but can be read about them in the link). The bases $\mathcal{B}^*$ and $\mathcal{S}^*$ are different in general (though they have elements in common). In fact we have the following theorem [GSL, Theorem 1.2] which states that $\mathcal{B}^*$ and $\mathcal{S}^*$ are the same only when $\mathfrak{g}$ is of type $A_n$ with $n < 5.$ [GSL] Geiss, Leclerc, and Schröer, Semicanonical bases and preprojective algebras 

Let $B$ be a group and let $A_1$ and $A_2$ subgroups of $B$ with $\phi :A_1\rightarrow A_2$ an isomorphism. Let $\left<t\right>$ be the infinite cyclic group, generated by a new element $t$. The $\mathbf{ HNN}$- extension $H$ is formed by adjoined to the free product $B* \left<t\right>$ the relations $ta t^{-1}=\phi(a)$ for all $a\in A_1$. Hence, $H$ has presentation $$H=\left<B,t\mid ta t^{-1}=\phi(a), \ a\in A_1\right>.$$ The group $B$ is called the base of $H$, $t$ is called the stable latter, and $A_1$ and $A_2$ is called the associated groups. An $\mathbf{HNN}$-extension $H$ is called an ascending $\mathbf{HNN}$-extension, if at least one of the subgroup $A_1$ and $A_2$ is equal to the base $B$. Bieri and Strebel showed that if $N$ is a normal subgroup of a finitely presented solvable group $G$ and $G/N$ is infinite cyclic, then $G$ is an ascending $\mathbf{ HNN}$-extension with a finitely generated base $B$. My question is: if we have an ascending $\mathbf{ HNN}$-extension $H$ with a f.g. base $B$, then When $H$ is finitely presented group? 

On a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$, we usually call polarization a Lagrangian foliation when the space of leaves is a manifold. And we call Liouville 1-parameter group a 1-parameter group of diffeomorphisms $\varphi_t$ such that $\varphi_t^*(\omega) = e^t\omega$. The infinitesimal action of the Liouville group is a (complete) Liouville vector field, it satisfies ${\cal L}_\xi(\omega) = \omega$. Every Liouville vector field on a symplectic manifold gives a primitive of the symplectic form: $\alpha(\cdot) = \omega(\xi,\cdot)$, that is, $d\alpha = \omega$. We have then two necessary conditions for the symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ to be a cotangent space: 

Addendum: I am not sure that the process of simplification can help in anything. But I'll try to clarify what I have in mind. Imagine that the bold black curve is the path of minimal length (I didn't draw the ambient polygon). You go from $a$ to $b$ etc. The point $b$ is the first point of "inflection", means that the turning changes sign. If you don't touch the first and last segments on $(a,b)$ you will not change the total turning angle on this piece of path. You have then (on the picture) the choice of three simplifications (thin lines marked with circles at rupture points), two of them gain 1 segment count, and the other one gains 2. If some of them fit in the ambient polygon, it's fine, and you continue that way, on the next part, until the next inflection point. You would like to simplify also by shortcutting along the green dashed line, but you cant since the bold curve is assumed to be the shortest, it must be an obstacle there. So, this way starting with a short curve you may improve the straightness. As I am really not an expert on this kind of geometry, I am not sure this way leads somewhere. It seems that there is still a long way from here to a proof of the existence of what you are looking for. 

Yes, the chromatic number of a Hasse diagram can be arbitrarily large. Bollobás shows in the following article that for any $k$ there exists a finite lattice whose Hasse diagram is not $k$-colorable. 

In ScrewBox: a Randomized Certifying Graph-Non-Isomorphism Algorithm by Kutz and Schweitzer it is stated that "It is generally accepted that the incidence graphs of finite projective planes confront graph isomorphism algorithms with great challenges." Also the PhD Thesis of Schweitzer discusses difficult graphs (including incidence graph of projective planes) in section 2.8. I do not know any repository of adjacencies of these graph, but Moorhouse has data online for known projective planes of order 27 online. Also the paper of Kutz and Schweitzer as well as the thesis of Schweitzer both cite data that Royle has on projective planes on order 16 but that link seems to broken for me right now. 

Concerning orbifolds there are a lot of misunderstandings. The original definition is due to Ishiro Satake in two papers: [Sat1] On a generalization of the notion of manifold, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 42 (1956), 359–363. [Sat2] The Gauss-Bonnet theorem for V-manifolds, Journal of the Mathematical Society of Japan, Vol. 9., No. 4 (1957), 464–492. After this papers Thurston decided to change the (not very sexy) name of V-Manifold for (the more sexy) Orbifolds, and he got some success. Fact is that the notion of orbifold is still, with Satake and Thurston, a space equipped with a smooth structure: Thurston didn't change original Satake definition, he just changed the name. As spaces with a smooth structure, these orbifolds [are naturally integrated in the category of diffeological spaces][IKZ] and inherit that way all the differential environment. Later, the concept of orbifold has changed, and has been associated with a groupoid defining in some sense the underlying orbifold structure. [It is like if you wanted to remind the structure of $S^3$ in the smooth structure of $S^2$ because of the Hopf fibration.] That is the direction taken by Haefliger, Moerdijk and his school. Of course then, the various notions of diffeomorphism, homotopy etc. diverge. The notion of orbifold changed (or refine) again then with the apparition of stacks (but here I'm not familiar enough to have an opinion). But: diffeologically speaking, if you want to isolate the internal structure of the diffeological orbifold you can consider its structural groupoid (the germs of the automorphisms of an admissible generating family). Therefore, you can recover what people consider to be the homotopy of the orbifold as the isotropy groups of this structural groupoid. For example, the cone orbifold ${\cal Q}_m = {\bf C}/({\bf Z}/m{\bf Z})$ is clearly contractible, since the retraction $(t,z) \mapsto tz$ is ${\rm SO}(2)$-equivariant, therefore its homotopy is trivial but the structural groupoid has ${\bf Z}/m{\bf Z}$ as isotropy group at the origin and $\{{\bf Id}\}$ elsewhere, that is the information you were looking for. It is not contained in the homotopy group but in the structural groupoid. Now, it's up to you to choose which direction fits more your needs. ------ Edit March 2017 Coming back to the heart of the question, the legitimacy of this question on morphisms between orbifolds comes from Satake's construction in [Sat2, p.469], where he said, and I cite: 

At the beginning of the section in the paper they let $G$ be a hypergraph. The size of a (hyper)edge is the number of vertices it contains. 

I don't know of any "simple" algorithms, but algorithms are known. See for example Using Sparsification for Parametric Minimum Spanning Tree Problems or Parametric and Kinetic Minimum Spanning Trees. If we assume $b_e = 1$ for all edges, then the situation does simplify. In this case it is just the usual minimum spanning tree problem with weights $a_e$ only. For a graph with $n$ vertices any spanning tree will have exactly $n-1$ edges. So, for any $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ the weight of any spanning tree $T$ is $\mathrm{wt}\, T = \sum_{e \in T} a_e + (n-1)\lambda$. It follows for any $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ the minimum spanning tree is just the minimum spanning tree gotten by weighting all edges with the weights $a_e$. 

That's because of the required property of equivariance of the local lifting of maps between orbifolds. This problem disapears in Diffeology. Indeed, there exist smooth maps between orbifolds (as diffeologies) that have no local equivariant liftings at all. This is shown in the example 25 of our paper on orbifolds [IKZ]. The function $f \colon \mathbf{C} \to \mathbf{C}$ defines by projectioon a well-defined smooth map between $\mathcal{Q} =\mathbf{C}/\mathbf{Z}_m$ to $\mathcal{Q}_n$ that has no equivarian local liftings on the neighborhood of $0$, any small you take the neighborhood: $$ f(x,y) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{ if } r > 1 \text{ or } r = 0 \\ e^{-1/r} \rho_n(r) (r,0) & \text{ if } \frac{1}{n+1} < r \leq \frac{1}{n} \text{ and $n$ is even } \\ e^{-1/r} \rho_n(r) (x,y) & \text{ if } \frac{1}{n+1} < r \leq \frac{1}{n} \text{ and $n$ is odd}, \end{cases} $$ Here $r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, $z=x+iy \in \mathbf{C}$, and $\rho_n$ is a function vanishing flatly outside the interval $]1/(n+1),1/n[$ and not inside. What is interesting is that, a contrario, a local diffeomorphism between orbifold has always a local equivariant lifting, in any local representation. This is the Lemma 21 of [YKZ]. So, maybe now, I made the point clearer, at least considering the diffeology point of view on orbifolds. 

I don't think your diagram is coming from a skew-symmetrizable matrix. Let $B$ be a skew-symmetrizable matrix and assume $Q = \Gamma(B)$ so your quiver is the diagram of $B$ as defined in Definition 7.3 of the linked paper. Then we must have $$B = \begin{bmatrix}0 & x & y \\ \frac{-1}{x} &0 & z \\ \frac{-1}{y} & \frac{-2}{z} &0 \end{bmatrix}$$ with $x,y,z > 0$. There also must exist a diagonal matrix $D = \mathrm{diag}(r,s,t)$ with $r,s,t > 0$ so that $$DB = \begin{bmatrix}0 & rx & ry \\ \frac{-s}{x} &0 & sz \\ \frac{-t}{y} & \frac{-2t}{z} &0 \end{bmatrix}$$ is skew-symmetric. So, $rx = \frac{s}{x}$, $ry = \frac{t}{y}$, and $sz = \frac{2t}{z}$ or equivalently $x^2 = \frac{s}{r}$, $y^2 = \frac{t}{r}$, and $z^2 = \frac{2t}{s}$. But this leads to a contradiction since $\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^2 = \frac{y^2}{x^2} = \frac{t}{s}$, but also $z^2 = 2\left(\frac{t}{s}\right)$. All the variables above aren't completely necessary. Since all entries of $B$ are integers we see $x = y = 1$ and $z = 1$ or $z = 2$. Then then follows $r = s = t$ and the contradiction is $z^2 = 2$.
