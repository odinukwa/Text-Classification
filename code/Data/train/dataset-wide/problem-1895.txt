The colon could be problematic as its function is not directly clear in this context. Maybe you could try: 

As mentioned in the comments, the air temperature is the deciding factor. In the Troposphere, until ca. 15 km, the temperature decreases by about 6 °C per km altitude (more info on the lapse rate here). As an additional factor, the air temperature on ground levels is generally higher in urban environments, like Paris. Therefore, the natural outer conurbation area could provide lower temperatures, while it is warmer in the city due to the anthopogenic heating (cars/engines, house heating, ...). 

To answer the second part of the question: as the indices show, the latitude needs to be considered. Currently I do not have the original publication by Gorczynski or Iwanow here, however there are some papers comparing different indices (there are several more), for example this one. Furthermore, the indices can be looked up in the most climatology basic literature and encyclopedia. At least, it is needed to mention that Gordon Stanger hits the point in his answer in the last sentence: The continentality is just one variable - there are several more. Look for climate classifications, like those from Köppen & Geiger or Schultz. Edit: Original reference Gorczynski, L. (1920): Sur le calcul du degre de continentalisme et son application dans la climatologie. Geografiska Annaler 2, 324-331. 

In which other ways can I use raw temperature data to analyze the correlation between different habitats(i.e., stopovers) used by a bird during its migration? For example I can use the temperature data to estimate the mean value, the maximum, the rate of change, any other ideas of how to use temperature data? thanks a lot! 

I want to analyze how the environmental conditions along the migratory route of a bird are related to the environmental conditions found at the breeding ground (which it is at high latitudes and we assume the rate of change is faster than at the stopovers). The environmental conditions are the NDVI, temperature, growing degree days. Is it enough with a simple correlation analysis or is there's another approach to make the analysis more robust? thanks a lot in advance for your answers! 

I have air temperature data from reanalysis that I want to analyze. The reanalysis data is in Kelvin, so I'm wondering why they use Kelvin. Is there any advantage or difference in analyzing temperature data as Kelvin? or is it the same as Celsius? Which one would be better if the temperature range goes from -35 to 20? thank you! 

I can not really find a definition, not even in a geologic dictionnary: What are articulate (resp. inarticulate) shells? To be more specific, the term is related to tsunami deposits (tsunamite). 

The borders are fluent between continentality and maritimity. However, there are several indices, aiming to clarify this question. For instance, the probably earliest one is from Gorczynski (1920): $$K_{Gorczynski} = 1.6 \cdot \frac{A}{\sin \varphi} - 14$$ where $A$ is the annual temperature amplitude of the location and $\varphi$ the latitude of the location. Another one, which is more often used, is from Iwanow (1956): $$K_{Iwanow} = 260 \cdot \frac{\Delta T}{\varphi}$$ where $\varphi$ is the latitude again and $$\Delta T=T_\mathrm{max} - T_\mathrm{min}$$ where $T_\mathrm{max}$ is the temperature maximum and $T_\mathrm{min}$ the temperature minimum. The results are characterized as following: 

Does your question go into the direction how the water gets 'onto the mountains'? Here is a meteorological-hydrological answer on this: Of course water, in its liquid form,is strongly determined by the gravitation. However when dissolved as water vapour, it is transported in the atmosphere (atmospheric water transport). Mountains do have an 'orographic effect' on the precipitation distribution in a landscape. This could, very very simplified, be described as follows: When air masses are horizontally moved, mountains represent barriers. The air has to rise onto along the mountains surface. In this upwards movement, the air expands. It gets thinner and can therefore contain less water vapour. In one point, it is oversaturated and begins to rain. In the Encyclopaedia Britannica, there is a brief explanation with a good explaining figure: $URL$ 

I have some data (GRIB layers) about wind components u and v, which I would like to use to estimate wind magnitude and direction. But the model says it is for 10 m altitude. Is there a way to extrapolate this value for higher altitudes? lets say 600 m. If yes, how? which other variables should I consider that can bias this calculation? Thanks a lot! 

I have temperature data from a weather station, but there are missing data (not more than 80% of the daily temperature observations). The World Meteorological Organization has some rules to validate estimations of monthly temperatures, etc. (for example to have 80% of the data). But since my periods of time are related to the lifecycle of the migratory species I am studying, for example: 1) arrival to the breeding ground and egg laying is from 20-May to 20-Jun (31 days) 2) incubation is from 21-Jun to 15 July (24 days) 3) brood rearing is from 16-July to 15-Aug (30 days) Do you know if there are some other rules? for example when my period of time is <30 days? Does the same rule would apply for the incubation period, even if it is shorter than one month? thanks a lot for your advice/suggestions 

The way you created it should not be problematic. However, especially if you make it possible for users to chose the unit, the unit should always be displayed. Here, the standard way in meteorology is to use meters per second [m/s], which is also complying to the SI units (more info here). The wind direction is often divided into two directional vectors, $u$ and $v$. However this is more science standard than industry standard as the ouput in degrees is more intuitive to interprete. In meteorology and climatology, the direction is only expressed in direction charcters (N, NE, E, ...) if the measurement or model output is not accurate enough to express it in directional degrees or if very exact values are not required, as for example in popular weather forecasts. (Notice that you can make it more exact by dividing the scale into smaller steps: Between N and NE, there is NNE, NEE, and so on).
