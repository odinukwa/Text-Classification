I think one of the reasons for using different units is how you take the measurements for the other variables in the equation. For example, let's say you have two marbles, and you want to calculate the gravitational force between them (not a lot!). You place them a certain distance apart, and measure it with your meter stick. You find the distance between them to be $0.146 \text{ meters}$. Now you weigh them, and find their masses to be $0.00156 \text{ kilograms}$ apiece. You decide to use the value of $G$ with units including meters and kilograms. Now let's say you have two stars far, far away. You take measurements based on parallax and find that they're roughly $35,400 \text{ light-years}$ away from each other. Your instruments can't measure this to any greater accuracy. You measure their masses by calculating how much they deflect light, and come up with a figure of $10 \text { solar masses}$ apiece. You therefore decide to use some form of $G$ that, for some reason, has solar masses and light-years as some of its units. Basically, you choose different forms of a constant depending on the units you're able to measure with your instruments. You won't be able to figure out exactly how many meters your stars are apart from each other, but you can figure out just about how many light-years apart they are, with less than a light-year of uncertainty. 

Also, some near-Earth asteroids used to be comets. Extinct comets have lost a lot (if not all) of their ice and so may be classified as asteroids. This blurs the lines between the two groups. Some extinct comets have become near-Earth asteroids. This explores the issue pretty well. So if you include extinct comets as "comets," you may have comets that have come even closer to Earth. 

I was fortunate enough to spend the past week at a workshop held at the Green Bank Observatory (GBO), so I can give you a partial answer based on how the Breakthrough Initiatives affects it in particular. Telescope time The GBO actually operates a selection of telescopes, of which the most widely-known (and largest) is the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The GBT is the main instrument used by Breakthrough Listen at the observatory. During the second half of 2016, the GBT was oversubscribed by a factor of 2.6, meaning that only about one in every 2.6 proposals was approved outright (“filler” proposals will be accepted if short periods of time are available). This doesn’t mean that for every hour of telescope time, 2.6 hours worth of observations were proposed, although the ratio is close (2.3), but it does mean that the GBT is very much in demand - and those numbers have increased this year. The telescope is not in use on only two days annually, Thanksgiving and Christmas, although there are blocks set out each week for maintenance. The answer to your first question, then, is yes - there is approximately indeed a zero-sum redistribution, because the telescope is extraordinarily busy. The actual data-gathering proportion may be slightly different because overhead times vary by the type of observations, and things like changing receivers or pointing at a different source do take time. However, it is true that Breakthrough Listen, like any other set of observations, takes time away from other scientists - about 20% of the GBT’s annual total observing time. (As an aside, Breakthrough Listen operates a “backend” in the GBO computer room - a set of GPUs that analyze incoming data. There are plenty of backends for various receivers and instruments, and they do take up space - and power. We were told that the room the Breakthrough Listen computers are in wasn’t actually designed to hold that many computers, which did cause some initial cooling issues (which were quickly rectified) when these new units were installed. So it’s important to realize that the project takes up more resources than just observing time!) Money The financial system at Green Bank is actually a little complicated. In 2012, it was recommended that the GBT and the Long Baseline Array be removed from the NRAO, and this was implemented in 2016. In some ways, the transition is still happening - much official GBO information is still on the NRAO’s website - but the relevant point here is that in the 2017, the GBO only received about 66% of its funds from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The current agreement is that the NSF will gradually defund the GBO over the next few years. This is why Breakthrough Listen is so financially crucial, and why it is getting so much publicity at the GBO. Without sources (and currently, without non-governmental sources) of funding, the observatory simply cannot operate. That said, the GBO is not beholden to people like Yuri Milner (the man behind the Breakthrough Initiatives) who have specific projects in mind - and indeed, that type of donor is quite the outlier. It does seek out donors and philanthropists who are willing to give money to simply ensure that the facility keeps going.1 If it can be guaranteed that these sources will continue giving without setting limits on what types of observing should be done, then things can progress as close to normal as possible. The exact details of funding for the GBO are not (as far as I know) public, and I don’t want to speculate too much. However, I can say that the observatory is almost certainly not going to push ordinary astronomers out of the way for the sake of big projects - in the short-term. Long-term funding is uncertain, true, but that does not mean that it will be renamed the Breakthrough Listen Observatory any time soon. The number of people who have operated the GBT number in the thousands, and they don’t pay to use it. It was built using public funds and has operated largely using public funds for quite some time now. I think the GBO intends to keep operating like this, and will not turn to the alternative - subject to the interests of only a select few projects - unless matters become extraordinarily desperate. It’s possible, but not something to be immediately worried about. 

Addressing (2) and (3) first: In a case like this, your best option is to go straight to the source. In this case, that would be Blandford & Znajek (1977), the originators of the proposed mechanism. they have several figures regarding different magnetospheric structures depending on different magnetic fields. However, the most important one is Figure 1, the general case: 

10,000 kilometers a year, though, is nothing to sniff at. Over the course of an orbit, that can be quite a lot - although keep in mind that longer orbits involve much larger semi-major axes - and I'd argue that it should be observable, given the correct calculations of how the orbit should evolve over time. 

Let $n$, $T$, and $x_i$ be the number density of hydrogen, the temperature of the gas, and $n_i/n$, where $n_i$ is the number density of the $i$th component of the interstellar medium. We can then write the criteria for thermal equilibrium as $$n^2\Lambda(n,T,x_i)-n\Gamma(n,T,x_i)\equiv n^2\mathcal{L}=0$$ where $\Lambda$ and $\Gamma$ and the heating and cooling functions, respectively, and $\mathcal{L}$ is defined through those functions and $n$. If the equilibrium is unstable, $$\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial S}\right)<0$$ for entropy $S$. This leads to different instability conditions, termed the isochoric and isobaric instabilities (Field (1965), $\text{Eq } 4a,4b$). These can be determined from the temperature, pressure, and density of the gas (also assuming that the gas can be approximated as an ideal gas). In general, $\Lambda$ and $\Gamma$ are complicated to determine, although combinations of power-law and exponentially decaying factors may often be sufficient. An example curve that seems to pop up a lot as an example was calculated by Dalgarno & McCray (1972), Figure 2: 

One of the tricky things about testing this model is that the authors say that there would not necessarily have been drastic composition changes, meaning that it would be hard to analyze the planet's surface and see if there is evidence supporting the double impact hypothesis. So far, there have not been tests. It is certainly true that Venus could have suffered other impacts - the model does not preclude that. There are a couple problems with Mercury arising from such a collision: 

"Backward-facing" implies looking in the opposite direction, away from Earth and in the opposite direction to that of the spacecraft's velocity vector: 

Now, these particles are technically of interstellar origin, even though they are accelerated to great speeds only at the boundary of the Solar System. However, a related population may have been found in the Kuiper Belt (see Schwadron et al. (2002)), formed from grains there after collisions between objects. While these are not necessarily - or even likely - the dominant source of anomalous cosmic rays, they do exist, and thus constitute another source of cosmic rays inside the Solar System.
