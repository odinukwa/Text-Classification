In order to make the construction of the quotient, it seems that it would be helpful to have at hand some quotients of the group $G$, described in some way other than formally via cosets. Here is one possible approach: Generalizing the regular action of $G$ on itself, we have the action of $G$ on its power set (given by translating a set). If $S \subset G$ is any subset, we can look at the orbit of $S$ under $G$, which is some subset $\mathcal O_S$ of the power set of $G$, and we are given a homomorphism $G \to Perm(\mathcal O_S)$ (the group of permutations of $\mathcal O_S$). Let $G'$ be the image of $G$ under this homomorphism. If we now take $S$ to be a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$, then $G' = G/N$. I wonder how hard this is to show directly, in terms of the universal property? It is easy to see at least that $G \rightarrow G'$ has the property that $N$ is in its kernel. Can one show directly in this set-up that any map $G \rightarrow G''$ having $N$ in its kernel factors through the explicitly constructed quotient $G'$? I don't see a pithy argument straight away, but it doesn't seem too unfeasible to me. 

As Pete Clark intimates in his comment: If you have a category $\mathfrak C$ in which the Hom sets are $R$-modules, and composition is $R$-bilinear, and if $S$ is an $R$-algebra, then you can form the category $\mathfrak C \otimes_R S$ in which you tensor all Hom sets by $S$ over $R$. If $\mathfrak C$ is the category of abelian varieties, then taking $R = \mathbb Z$ and $S = \mathbb Q$, this construction leads to the category of abelian varieties "up to isogeny", or "isogeny category" of abelian varieties, hence the name in general. 

It might be relevant that no-one has trouble well-ordering a countable set. Added in response to the comments: My somewhat flippant answer has gotten me in trouble; let me see if I can extricate myself. I think that everyone agrees with finite choice: if we have a finite collection of non-empty sets $S_1,\ldots,S_n$, then we can surely choose an element $s_i$ from each $S_i$ Now suppose we have a sequence of non-empty sets $S_i$. Then, if you can imagine the set of natural numbers in its entirety (in my mind it is laid out as a set of stone, one following the other), then you can image passing step by step through the natural numbers, choosing an element from each $S_i$ in turn. Although personally I don't have any particular objection to full choice, I can see why the consideration of a general infinite process (choosing an element from each of an infinite collection of sets) could seem much more unreasonable then choosing an element from each of a sequence of sets. Although this is not the direct logical relation of well-ordering with the axiom of choice (which involves well-ordering the union of the sets, not the indexing set), I nevertheless maintain that an infinite process seems more reasonable if you can imagine it being taken one step at a time, rather than if you imagine it being indexed by some amorphous, unstructured infinite set. 

The theory of Shimura varieties was begun by Shimura, and further developed by Langlands (who introduced the name), and is now a central part of arithemtic geometry and of the theories of automorphic forms, Galois representations, and motives. Shimura varieties are certain moduli of Hodge structures; but that is perhaps not the best point of view to understand why people study them. Rather, the primary motivation is the following: Shimura varieties are attached to (certain) reductive linear algebraic groups over $\mathbb Q$, and the geometry of the Shimura variety is closely linked to the theory of automorphic forms over the corresponding reductive group. Thus Shimura varieties make a natural test-case for investigating the conjectural relations between motives and automorphic forms, since they are geometric objects with a direct link to the theory of automorphic forms. (I'm not sure that it's useful to be more specific about this in this particular answer, but for those to whom it is meaningful: on the one hand, one has an analogue, for any Shimura variety, of Eichler--Shimura theory, relating the cohomology of modular curves to modular forms; and on the other hand, by thinking of cohomology as being etale cohomology, one obtains Galois representations which one would like to show (and in many cases can show) are related to automorphic forms in a manner analogous to the relationship between the Galois representations on the etale cohomology of modular curves and Hecke eigenforms that was established by Deligne.) 

In each case you can compute the stalk you asked about directly from the definition, and I recommend that you try to do so. Added: If $f: X \to Y$ and $\mathcal F$ is a sheaf on $X$, then for any $x \in X$ there is a canonical map of stalks $(f_*\mathcal F)_{f(x)} \to \mathcal F_x,$ given as follows: if $V$ is a n.h. of $f(x)$, then $f^{-1}(V)$ is a n.h. of $x$, and by definition $f_*\mathcal F(V) = \mathcal F(f^{-1}(V)).$ If $V$ runs over all n.h.s of $f(x)$, then $f^{-1}(V)$ will range over some (but typically not all) n.h.s of $x$, and so there will be an induced map $(f_*\mathcal F)_{f(x)} \to \mathcal F_x$, but this will typically not be an isomorphism (exactly because $f^{-1}(V)$ typically doesn't range over all n.h.s of $x$, but just certain ones). In the case of a morphism $f:X \to Y$ of ringed spaces, the given map $\mathcal O_Y \to f_*\mathcal O_X$ then induces maps of stalks $(\mathcal O_Y)_{f(x)} \to (f_*\mathcal O_X)_{f(x)}$ (by functoriality of the construction of stalks) and $(f_*\mathcal O_X)_{f(x)} \to (\mathcal O_X)_x$ (via the above construction). Their composite is the morphism $(\mathcal O_Y)_{f(x)} \to (\mathcal O_X)_x$ that Hartshorne uses when he makes the definition of a morphism of locally ringed spaces. 

If you want to go further in understanding this point of view, I would advise you to begin learning class field theory. It is a deep subject, it can be understood in a vast variety of ways, from the very concrete and elementary to the very abstract, and although superficially it appears to be limited to describing abelian reciprocity laws, it in fact plays a crucial role in the study of non-abelian reciprocity laws as well. The texts: Ireland and Rosen for basic algebraic number theory, a Galois-theoretic proof of quadratic reciprocity, and other assorted attractions. Cox's book on primes of the form x^2 + n y^2 for an indication of what some of the content of class field theory is in elementary terms, via many wonderful examples. Serre's Local Fields for learning the Galois theory of local fields Cassels and Frolich for learning global class field theory The standard book at the graduate level to learn the arithmetic of non-abelian (at least 2-dimensional) reciprocity laws is Modular forms and Fermat's Last Theorem, a textbook on the proof by Taylor and Wiles of FLT. But it is at a higher level again. I don't think that you will find a single text on this topic at a basic level (if basic means Course in arithmetic or Ireland and Rosen), because there is not much to say beyond what you stated in your question without getting into the theory of elliptic curves and/or the theory of modular forms and/or a serious discussion of class field theory. Also, as basic suggests, you could talk to the grad students in your town, if not at your institution, then at the other one down the Charles river, which as you probably know is currently the world centre for research on non-abelian reciprocity laws (maybe shared with Paris). Certainly there are grad courses offered on this topic there on a regular basis. 

Dear Najdorf, In light of Victor Prostak's comments, it might be good to remark that the correspondence you are thinking of is between nilpotent Lie algebras and unipotent algebraic groups (over a field of characteristic zero). It is then true that you can identify $\mathfrak n$ with $N$, and use the Cambell-Hausdorff structure to define the group law on $N$. As Victor notes, the answer to question (1) is yes: one direct way to see it is that the image of $\mathfrak n$ in $End(V)$ is again nilpotent, and then to note that the construction of $N$ from $\mathfrak n$ is functorial (since it is just a matter of using the CH formula). As for (2), if $\mathfrak m$ is an ideal in $\mathfrak n$ (equivalently, if $M$ is normal in $N$), then the answer is yes. (The quotient $\mathfrak n/\mathfrak m$ is again a nilpotent Lie algebra, and the associated unipotent group is canonically identified with $N/M$.) If $\mathfrak m$ is just a Lie subalgebra, then I'm less sure: without the ideal assumption, it doesn't seem that cosets under adding $\mathfrak m$ and cosets under multiplying by $M$ are the same, and so it's not clear (to me) how one would make this identification. 

I believe the answer should be yes, by some version of the following sketch of an argument: (Note: by restriction of scalars, I regard all groups as being defined over $\mathbb Q$, and I write ${\mathbb A}$ for the adeles of $\mathbb Q$.) We are given $V_{\pi} \subset Cusp(G(F)\backslash G({\mathbb A}_F)).$ Let $\tilde{C}$ denote the maximal $\mathbb Q$-split torus in the centre of $\tilde{G}$ (this is just a copy of $\mathbb G_m$), and write $C = \tilde{C}\cap G$. (I guess this is just $\pm 1$?) Now $C(\mathbb A)$ acts on $V_{\pi}$ through some character $\chi$ of $(\mathbb A)/C(\mathbb Q)$. Choose an extension $\tilde{\chi}$ of $\chi$ to a character of $\tilde{C}(\mathbb A)/\tilde{C}(\mathbb Q)$, and regard $V_{\pi}$ as a representation of $\tilde{C} G$ by have $\tilde{C}$ act through $\tilde{\chi}$. Since $\tilde{C} G$ is normal and Zariksi open in $\tilde{G}$, we should be able to further extend the $\tilde{C} G(\mathbb A)$-action on $V_{\pi}$ to an action of $\tilde{G}(\mathbb Q)\tilde{C}G(\mathbb A).$ Now if we consider $Ind_{\tilde{G}(\mathbb Q)\tilde{C} G(\mathbb A)}^{\tilde{G}(\mathbb A)} V_{\pi},$ we should be able to find a cupsidal representation $V_{\tilde{\pi}}$ of the form you want (with $\tilde{C}(A)$ acting via $\tilde{\chi}$). The intuition is that automorphic forms on $G(\mathbb A)$ are $Ind_{G(\mathbb Q)}^{G(\mathbb A)} 1,$ and similarly for $\tilde{G}$. We will consider variants of this formula that takes into account central characters, and think about how to compare them for $G$ and $\tilde{G}$. Inside the automorphic forms, we have those where $C(\mathbb A)$ acts by $\chi$; this we can write as $Ind_{G(\mathbb Q)C(\mathbb A)}^{G(\mathbb A)} \chi$, and then rewrite as $Ind_{\tilde{G}(\mathbb Q)\tilde{C}(\mathbb A)}^{\tilde{G}(\mathbb Q)\tilde{C}G(\mathbb A)} \tilde{\chi}.$ This is where $V_{\pi}$ lives, once we extend it to a repreresentation of $\tilde{G}(\mathbb Q)\tilde{C}G(\mathbb A)$ as above. Now the automorphic forms on $\tilde{G}(\mathbb A)$ with central character $\tilde{\chi}$ are $Ind_{\tilde{G}(\mathbb Q)\tilde{C}(\mathbb A)}^{\tilde{G}(\mathbb A)} \tilde{\chi},$ which we can rewrite as $Ind_{\tilde{G}(\mathbb Q) \tilde{C}G(\mathbb A)}^{\tilde{G}(\mathbb A)} Ind_{\tilde{G}(\mathbb Q)\tilde{C}(\mathbb A)}^{\tilde{G}(\mathbb Q)\tilde{C}G(\mathbb A)} \tilde{\chi}.$ This thus contains $Ind_{\tilde{G}(\mathbb Q)\tilde{C}G(\mathbb A)}^{\tilde{G}(\mathbb A)}V_{\pi}$ inside it, and so an irreducible constituent of the latter should be a $V_{\tilde{\pi}}$ whose restriction (as a space of functions) to $G(\mathbb A)$ contains $V_{\pi}$. What I have just discussed is the analogue for $G$ and $\tilde{G}$ of the relation between automorphic forms on $SL_2$ and $GL_2$ discussed e.g. in Langlands--Labesse. Hopefully I haven't blundered!
