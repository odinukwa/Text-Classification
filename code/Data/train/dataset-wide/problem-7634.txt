Mike has given a good answer (basically - bubbling), but perhaps I can elaborate/add. In general, due to disk bubbling one gets a curved or obstructed A-infinity category. The reason that's bad is that in this case m1 does not square to zero - no Floer homology. In the case when m0 is a multiple of fundamental class, then for CF(L,L) the A-infinity relations still say m1 squares to zero, and more generally for L_1 and L_2 if it's the same multiple \lambda. So you get completely disjointed categories for each \lambda. This happens for fibers of toric symplectic manifolds, for example (and on their mirror Landau-Ginsburg model we get the categories of singularities D^b sing, \lambda corresponding to the value of the superpotential). As Mike said, the business of bounding cochains is understanding when A-infinity relations can be modified to get m0 to be zero (unobstructed L) or multiple of fundamental class (weakly unobstructed L). As for finding the "right" definition of Fukaya category, my understanding it is tricky business. Form the point of view of mirror symmetry, the current definition is a cheat, where we use passing to derived category to sweep under the rug all the problems - one of which is not dealing with immersed Lagrangians, and another is perhaps ignoring the suggestion of Kapustin-Orlov to include coisotropics. As I understand people are studying ways to do Floer theory for both of these new types of objects. This is however, a somewhat different question from the one you asked. 

So here are some examples: When X has no continuous families of automorphisms (H^0(X, TX)=0), complex deformations of X to first order are given by H^1(X, TX). For compact Calabi-Yaus this is H^{(n-1, 1)} and moreover by Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov the deformations are unobstructed. Symplectic deformations as Ben noted are controlled by H^2(X, R) by Moser's trick. If we want to deform while staying Kahler, then in H^{(1,1)}(X, R). In mirror symmetry (where this discussion is stolen from) one allows a B-field and correspondingly a complexified space of deformations H^{(1,1)}. Then for mirror manifolds these two spaces of deformations are switched. This is discussed in Denis Auroux's notes on mirror symmetry ($URL$ any misinterpretation is my fault). Mirror symmetry is cool and all, but if we just stay on the same Calabi-Yau the deformation spaces for symplectic and complex structures can have different dimensions - with either one bigger, giving examples for both 1 and 2. 

Taking tori in symmetric products and "miraculously" proving that the Floer homology is independent of choices always seemed, well, miraculous. Some time ago Max Lipyanski explained to me the origins of this construction from gauge theory on surfaces, a la Atiyah-Floer conjecture, which I have then forgotten. What is the origin of Heegard Floer? 

For a (complex, connected, simply connected, simple) Lie group $G$, a parabolic subgroup $P \subseteq G$, and a $\mathfrak g$-integral $\mathfrak p$-dominant weight $\lambda$, we can construct homogeneous vector bundle $G \times_P E_{\mathfrak p}(\lambda)$ over $G/P$ (here $-\lambda$ is lowest weight) and its sheaf of holomorphic sections $\mathcal O_{\mathfrak p}(\lambda)$. On the algebraic side, we can construct generalized Verma module $M_{\mathfrak p}(\lambda)=U(\mathfrak g) \otimes_{\mathfrak p}F_{\mathfrak p}(\lambda)$ (where $\lambda$ is highest weight). It us well known and that there is $1-1$ correspondence between $G$-invariant differential operators $\mathcal O_{\mathfrak p}(\lambda) \to \mathcal O_{\mathfrak p}(\mu)$ and $\mathfrak g$-homomorphisms $M_{\mathfrak p}(\mu) \to M_{\mathfrak p}(\lambda)$, which is functorial. See e.g. Eastwood-Rice: Conformally invariant differential operators... or section 11.2 from the book Baston-Eastwood: The Penrose transform.... 

Hello, I have found different definitions of Čech complex for sheaf $F$ od abelian groups on topological space $X$ with respect to the cover $\mathcal U$. One in Gelfand-Manin says to take product of $F(U_{i_0} \cap \ldots \cap U_{i_n})$ for all $n$-tuples of indices $(i_0, \ldots ,i_n)$, and one in Hartshorne says that one considers only stricly increasing indices $i_0 < \ldots < i_n$. How can I see that cohomologies of these "two different" Čech complexes coincide? 

For example BGG resolutions of Verma modules correspond to the generalized de Rham sequences, which are locally exact (and of course, exact over an affine set). Sketch of the correspondence: Invariant differential operator $\mathcal O_{\mathfrak p}(\lambda) \to \mathcal O_{\mathfrak p}(\mu)$ is given by a bundle morphism $J^k({\mathcal O}_{\mathfrak p}(\lambda)) \to {\mathcal O}_{\mathfrak p}(\mu)$, where $J^k$ denotes the $k$-th jet bundle. By restricting it to a fibre, and taking duals, we get a $\mathfrak p$-homomorphism $F_{\mathfrak p}(\mu) \to U^k({\mathfrak u}^-) \otimes_{\mathfrak p} F_{\mathfrak p}(\lambda) \subseteq M_{\mathfrak p}(\lambda)$, where $U^k({\mathfrak u}^-)$ denotes the $k$-th filtered piece of the universal enveloping algebra of the opposite nilpotent radical of $\mathfrak p$. By Frobenius reciprocity (adjoint functors), we get $\mathfrak g$-homomorphism $M_{\mathfrak p}(\mu) \to M_{\mathfrak p}(\lambda)$. This process is reversible. 

Hi. In his Algebraic Geometry, Hartshorne proves that for any ringed spaces $(X,\mathcal O_X)$, category $Mod(X)$ of sheaves of $\mathcal O_X$-modules has enough injectives. If we tako $\mathcal O_X$ to be constant sheaf of rings $\mathbb Z$ (i.e. sheaf associated to a constant presheaf $\mathbb Z$), Hartshorne claims that $Mod(X)=Ab(X):=$ category of sheaves of abelian groups on X. Why does this last claim hold? Of course, if one takes open subset $U \subseteq X$ that is connected, then section $\mathcal O_X(U)$ actually is ring isomorphic to $\mathbb Z$. But, for more 'complicated' open subsets $U \subseteq X$, sections $\mathcal O_X(U)$ become more complicated rings than $\mathbb Z$. So generally, many sections of a sheaf of $\mathcal O_X$-modules have more complicated structure than merely abelian group (i.e. $\mathbb Z$-module). So, why is it obvious, according to Hartshorne, that $Mod(X)=Ab(X)$? I can only see that $Mod(X)$ is subcategory of $Ab(X)$.
