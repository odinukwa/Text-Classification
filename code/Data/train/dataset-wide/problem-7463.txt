A proof can be found in Sinclair and Smith's book "Finite von Neumann algebras and masas" doi:10.1017/CBO9780511666230. I believe Chapter 4 will be what you're looking for. 

There is a $g\in G$ with $|\mathcal{O} _{gH}|\neq |\mathcal{O} _{g^{-1}H}|$, $|\mathcal{O} _{gH}|=\infty$ if and only if $|\mathcal{O} _{g^{-1}H}|=\infty$, and There is a constant $M>0$ such that $\displaystyle \frac{|\mathcal{O} _{gH}|}{|\mathcal{O} _{g^{-1}H}|} \leq M$ for all $g\in G$ with $|\mathcal{O} _{gH}|,|\mathcal{O} _{g^{-1}H}|\neq \infty$. 

In general, the universal group $C^*$-algebra $C^*(G)$ and the graph algebra $C^*(E)$ of its Cayley graph with respect to a generating set may be very different. For example, let's consider a finite group $G$. If $S$ is a generating set, $E$ is strongly connected. If $G$ is not a cyclic group, then the adjacency matrix for $E$ is not a permutation matrix. In this case, $C^*(G)$ is isomorphic to the group algebra, but $C^*(E)$ is purely infinite. I think the relationship you might be looking for is the relationship between $G$ and $C^*(E)$. Since $G$ acts on $E$, by the universal property of $C^*(E)$, we have that $G$ acts on $C^*(E)$. Kumjian and Pask ($URL$ showed that the reduced crossed product $C^*(E)\rtimes_\lambda G$ is isomorphic to $C^*(E/G)\otimes \mathcal{K}(\ell^2(G))$. 

Cartwright and Kucharski give a generalization of Jackson's inequality for an arbitrary compact connected Lie group. I only need the uniform norm, rank 1 case for the canonical torus, so I state here this special case. Theorem Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then there is $M_n >0$ s.t. for any $r > 0$ there is $K_r \in C^\infty(T^n, \mathbb{R})$ s.t. its Fourier transform satisfies $\operatorname{supp} \hat{K}_r \subseteq \{\vartheta \in \mathbb{Z}^n \mid \lVert \vartheta \rVert \leq r\}$ and for any $f \in C(T^n, \mathbb{C})$ we have $$\lVert f - K_r * f \rVert_\infty \leq M_n \sup_{d(z,w) \leq \frac{1}{r}} \lvert f(z) - f(w) \rvert$$ 

The Lebesgue differentiation theorem says that for certain metric spaces $X$ (see below), any Borel measure $\mu$ that is finite on bounded sets and any $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ locally $\mu$-integrable, there is $A \subseteq X$ s.t. $\mu(X \setminus A)=0$ and $$\forall x \in A: \lim_{r \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\mu(B_r(x))} \int_{B_r(x)} f(y) \mu(dy) = f(x)$$ Here, $B_r(x)$ is the ball of radius $r$ with center $x$. This holds for $X$ a Riemannian manifold or $X$ a locally compact separable ultrametric space. I'm interested to understand how it fails on somewhat more general spaces. In particular: 

I don't know about necessary conditions, but here are some results concerning sufficient conditions: 

As an operator algebraist, I think the space of continuous functions to $\mathbb{C}$ which vanish at infinity is my preferred choice. Let me tell you why. One of the basic ideas of noncommutative topology/geometry (and probably algebraic geometry, but I don't know much about that) is that we can trade the space for algebras of functions on that space. This is afforded by the Gelfand transform. The spectrum of a commutative $C^\ast$-algebra is the space of characters, i.e., $\ast$-algebra homomorphisms to $\mathbb{C}$. 

It depends on the conventions that you pick, but if you pick them correctly, you'll get what you want. First, for a normal linear functional $f$ on $B(H)$, there is a unique partial isometry $v\in B(H)$ and positive normal linear functional $|f|$ such that $f=v|f|$ and $v^*v$ is the support projection of $|f|$, where we use the convention that $v|f|(a) = |f|(av)$ for all $a\in B(H)$. See Theorem 4.3.2 of $URL$ for more details on this. Suppose $x\in B(H)$ is trace class, and consider the induced normal linear functional $f = \operatorname{Tr}(\,\cdot\,x)$ on $B(H)$. Now let's look at the polar decomposition of $x = u|x|$, which satisfies $\ker(u)=\ker(|x|)=\ker(x)$, so $u^*u$ is the support projection of $|x|$, and $u^*x=|x|$. Then $|x|$ induces a positive normal linear functional on $B(H)$, which we'll call $g$. One sees that for all $a\in B(H)$, \begin{align*} ug(a) &= g(au) = \operatorname{Tr}(au|x|)=\operatorname{Tr}(ax) = f(a) \\ u^*f(a) &= f(au^*) = \operatorname{Tr}(au^*x)=\operatorname{Tr}(a|x|) = g(a). \end{align*} Thus $ug = f$ and $u^*f = g$, so we see $$ g(a)=[u^*f](a)=[u^*(ug)](a)=[ug](au^*)=g(au^*u), $$ and $u^*u$ dominates the support projection of $g$. We easily verify that for all $b\in B(H)$, $$ g(b(1-u^*u))=\operatorname{Tr}(b(1-u^*u)|x|)=\operatorname{Tr}(b(|x|-u^*u|x|))=\operatorname{Tr}(b0)=0, $$ so $u^*u$ is exactly the support projection of $g$. This means that if $f=v|f|$ is the polar decomposition of $f$, then by the uniqueness of the polar decomposition, we must have that $|f|=g=\operatorname{Tr}(\,\cdot\,|x|)$ and $v=u$. 

Shahn Majid presents in section 9.4 of "Foundatations of Quantum Group Theory" a Tannaka-type reconstruction theorem for producing a $k$-bialgebra out of its $k$-linear monoidal category of modules $\mathcal{M}$. The theorem depends on the presense of a fiber (fogetful) functor $F: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow Vect_k$ and monoidal structure on $F$. The question is: 

Given an algebraically closed field $k$ and a finitely generated commutative $k$-algebra $A$, all simple modules over $A$ are 1-dimensional 

Consider $\phi(A)$ a formula of second-order arithmetic with one free variable $A$ of type "set". Suppose $\exists A : \phi(A)$ is a true sentence. Does it follow (not in second order arithmetic itself, but in a stronger theory of your choice, e.g. ZFC) that there is a formula of second-order arithmetic $\psi(n)$ with one free variable $n$ of type "number", such that $\phi(\lbrace n | \psi(n)\rbrace)$ is a true sentence? 

Your guess is correct. You can only say $e$ and $f$ have the same trace if your $M$ is a factor. To see this, any finite dimensional $M$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of full matrix algebras, say $$ M = \bigoplus_{j=1}^k M_{m_j}(\mathbb{C}). $$ By uniqueness of the normalized trace on $M_n(\mathbb{C})$, we see that normalized faithful traces on $M$ are in bijective correspondence with vectors $(t_1,\dots, t_k)$ with strictly positive entries such that $$ (m_1,\dots, m_k) \cdot (t_1,\dots, t_k) = \operatorname{tr}(1) = 1. $$ Note that $t_j$ is the trace of a minimal projection in the summand $M_{m_j}(\mathbb{C})$ of $M$. (Here, I've used the notation from Jones' Index for subfactors [MR696688], Section 3.2.) So now we can build a concrete counterexample. Let $M = M_2(\mathbb{C}) \oplus \mathbb{C}$, with trace vector $\vec{t} = (3/8,1/4)$. Let $e$ be a minimal projection in the $M_2(\mathbb{C})$ summand, which has trace $3/8$, and let $f$ be the minimal projection in the $\mathbb{C}$ summand, which has trace $1/4$. 

The antisymmetry of $\pi$ imposes the following additional condition: Note that $i(X) \hat{\otimes} Y \cong X \otimes Coker \space h_Y$ which follows by observing that $h$ annihilates $i(X) \hat{\otimes} Y$ due to $k[h]$-linearity of $\hat{\otimes}$, applying $Coker \space h$ and using its tensor functor structure We have the short exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow X \xrightarrow{Ker \space h} X[h] \xrightarrow{Coker \space h} X \rightarrow 0$$ We apply $\hat{\otimes} Y[h]$ and use its exactness to get the short exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow X \otimes Y \rightarrow X[h] \hat{\otimes} Y[h] \rightarrow X \otimes Y \rightarrow 0$$ This sequence yields an element $\epsilon(X, Y)$ of $Ext^1(X \otimes Y, X \otimes Y)$ Due to $b$, $\epsilon(X, Y)$ and $\epsilon(Y, X)$ belong to canonically isomorphic spaces. We demand $$\epsilon(X, Y)+\epsilon(Y, X)=0$$ The problem is I need the case in which $\otimes$ is merely right exact. What currently confuses me is that in the bialgebra picture the last sequence is still exact for general $k$ but I can't prove it in the category-theoretic language 

I had never heard of table algebras before, but it seems to me that a subset of the table algebras is the abelian unital based rings in the sense of Section 2 of Ostrik's "Module categories, weak Hopf algebras and modular invariants" (MR1976459). Classifying abelian unital based rings is extremely difficult. For example, there are infinite families of rank $n$ abelian unital based rings for all $n\geq 2$ (e.g., near group fusion rings for $|G|=n-1$), and we don't know which rank 4 unital based rings (which are automatically abelian) are categorifiable. In more detail, a unital based ring consists of: 

It is not always the case that the composite of two operators is nice. In general, the composite of $S$ and $T$ is defined by $$ D(ST)=\{\xi\in D(T) | T\xi\in D(S)\}. $$ There is no reason to expect this space to be dense. I agree with @Yemon. You want the affiliated operators. Here's an interesting parallel for finite measure spaces that I heard in a mini-course from Ozawa. Just as $$L^\infty(X,\mu)\subset L^2(X,\mu)$$ which is a subset of all measurable functions, if $(M,tr)$ is a finite von Neumann algebra, $$M=L^\infty(M,tr)\subset L^2(M,tr)\subset \eta(M),$$ the affiliated operators. The inclusion for $L^2(M)$ into $\eta(M)$ is given by $$ \xi\mapsto (L_\xi\colon m\mapsto \xi m), $$ (be careful - you need to take the closure of $L_\xi$. Clearly $L_\xi$ commutes with right multiplication by $U(M)$) and the image of $L^2(M)$ is the set of all $T\in \eta(M)$ such that if $$ |T|=\int t dE(t) $$ is the usual spectral measure, then $$ \int t^2 d tr(E(t)) <\infty. $$ About your comment in response to @Yemon: Indeed the trace works. If you have a positive function, use indicator functons to show the trace is semi-finite and faithful (see Takesaki I). Normal is clear. If you have a measurable function $f$ on $(X,\mu)$, construct a multiplication operator by letting $$ D(M_f)=\{\xi\in L^2(X,\mu)| f\xi \in L^2(X,\mu)\}. $$ If $\mu$ is finite, and $f$ is a measurable, real valued, a.e. finite function, then $M_f$ is self-adjoint, and the spectrum is the essential range of $f$. Reed and Simon have a good introduction to unbounded operators, in particular the spectral theorem. Somehow the brackets aren't showing up for the sets above, but I hope it's legible. 

We can assume the category is Abelian and the product functor is right exact in both variables I expect something of the sort "any simple (in some sense) module category is equivalent to $Vect$", although I have no idea how braided and symmetric are different in this repsect 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be Polish spaces and $K$ a Markov kernel from $X$ to $Y$. That is, $K$ is a mapping $X \times \mathcal{B}_Y \rightarrow [0,1]$ (where $\mathcal{B}_Y$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of Borel sets on $Y$) s.t. 

This is an agglomeration of several questions, linked by a single observation: SAT is equivalent to determining the existence of roots for a system of polynomial equations over $\mathbb{F}_2$ (note though that the system is represented in non-trivial manner). The reason it is OK to consider more than one equation is because the conjunction of the conditions $f_i(x_1 ... x_n) = 0$ is equivalent to the single condition $\prod_i (f_i(x_1 ... x_n) + 1) + 1 = 0$. 

I am looking for a reference for a complete list of 3-cocycle representatives for $H^3(D_{2n},\mathbb{C}^\times)$, where $$ D_{2n}=\langle a, b\mid a^2=b^2=(ab)^n=e\rangle $$ is the dihedral group of order $2n$. Here's what I believe so far, but I do not know much group cohomology. First, I believe there are isomorphisms $$ H^3(D_{2n},\mathbb{C}^\times)\cong H^4(D_{2n},\mathbb{Z})\cong H_3(D_{2n},\mathbb{Z}). $$ I calculated these groups in GAP for $2\leq n\leq 10$, and I got the following formula: $$ H_3(D_{2n},\mathbb{Z}) \cong \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z}/2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/n & \text{if $n$ is even}\\ \mathbb{Z}/2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/n & \text{if $n$ is odd.} \end{cases} $$ Are these formulas correct? Is there a reference for this, or does it follow by some spectral sequence calculation? Why is there an extra factor of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ when $n$ is even? Second, I believe I have a formula for 3-cocycles representing the $\mathbb{Z}/n$ factor, which is the factor I most care about. To give this formula, I use the following notation. First, represent the elements of $D_{2n}$ by the alternating words in $a,b$ with length at most $2n-1$ which always start with $a$. For such a word $w$, let $|w|$ be its length. If $\zeta_n=\exp(2\pi i / n)$, then for $k=0,\dots, n-1$, I believe the maps $$ \lambda_k(x,y,z) = \begin{cases} (\zeta_n^k)^{(-1)^{|x|} \lfloor (|x|+1)/2\rfloor } & \text{if $|y|$ is even and $|y|+|z|\geq 2n$}\\ (\zeta_n^k)^{(-1)^{|x|+1} \lfloor (|x|+1)/2\rfloor } & \text{if $|y|$ is odd and $|z|>|y|$}\\ 1 & \text{else} \end{cases} $$ give a complete list of normalized 3-cocycle representatives for the $\mathbb{Z}/n$ factor of $H^3(D_{2n},\mathbb{C}^\times)$. Certainly the $\lambda_k$ act like $\mathbb{Z}/n$ under multiplication, but is there an easy way to see they are not cohomologous? Is there an easier way to express these formulas, perhaps by choosing a different presentation of $D_{2n}$? Finally, the formulas above yield the trivial 3-cocycle when restricted to the two copies of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ generated by $a$ and $b$. To see this, just note $\lambda_k$ is normalized, $\lambda_k(a,a,a) = 1$, and if $w=(ab)^{n-1}a$, which is equal to $b$, then $\lambda_k(w,w,w) = 1$. (In both cases, $|y|$ is odd and $|y|=|z|$.) I believe any 3-cocycle representatives for the other cohomology classes should not restrict trivially to at least one of these copies of $\mathbb{Z}/2$. Partial answers would be greatly appreciated as well! 

EDIT: I think I figured out the answer in case $k$ is a field. In this case the tensor product functor is exact (rather than just right exact) Introduce $h$ a formal parameter satisfying $h^2=0$. $\pi$ defines a "deformed" coproduct on $H[h]$ given by $$\Delta'(a):=\Delta(a)+h\pi(a)$$ Thus the category of left $H[h]$-modules becomes a tensor category Denote $\mathcal{M}$ our symmetric tensor category. The tensor product functor is $\otimes$ and its symmetric braiding is $b: X \otimes Y \rightarrow Y \otimes X$ We construct the Abelian category $\mathcal{M}[h]$. An object $X$ in $\mathcal{M}[h]$ is an object in $\mathcal{M}$ equipped with an endomorphism $h: X \rightarrow X$ s.t. $h^2=0$. A morphism in $\mathcal{M}[h]$ is a morphism in $\mathcal{M}$ which commutes with $h$ $\mathcal{M}[h]$ comes with the following functors of interest: 

The answer is no. In fact, the group planar algebra has no non-trivial planar ideals. If $P_\bullet$ is a spherical planar algebra with non-zero modulus, and if $P_{0,\pm}$ are one dimensional, then every planar ideal is contained in the planar ideal $N_\bullet$ of negligible elements, i.e., those $x\in P_{n,\pm}$ for which tr$(xy)=0$ for all $y\in P_{n,\pm}$. (See Proposition 3.5 of the extended Haagerup paper of Bigelow-Morrison-Peters-Snyder MR2979509.) Now the group planar algebra is a subfactor planar algebra. In particular, the negligible ideal is the zero ideal, since the form $\langle x,y\rangle = \text{tr}(y^*x)$ is positive definite. I'll think about the followup question.
