Surely the answer to Q1 is negative. If you found such a graph, then by joining two copies together (joining $u$ in one copy to $u$ in the second, and the same for $v$), would this not give a 3-regular uniquely hamiltonian graph? 

This is an easy problem for an orderly algorithm, which can generate the independent sets without isomorphs with no direct isomorphism checks between different independent sets. It takes a couple of minutes on a recent computer and concludes that there are there are 519195 independent sets in the 6-cube up to isomorphism. The numbers of each size (from 0 to 32) are: 1, 1, 5, 11, 56, 182, 742, 2323, 6714, 15233, 29200, 44870, 58711, 64916, 64902, 58982, 51064, 40835, 30884, 21145, 13511, 7631, 4058, 1859, 839, 316, 133, 42, 19, 5, 3, 1, 1 

Use Brinkmann & McKay's program "plantri"... You will discover that there are 3 on 16 faces (as you said), 4 on 17 faces, 12 on 18 faces, 23 on 19 faces, 73 on 20 faces and then going to Sloane's online encylopaedia you discover $URL$ So in short, the answer to your question is "yes, the sequence is fairly well known". 

Some problems in graph theory can be solved most elegantly by appealing to matroid theory; good luck in trying to explain matroid theory to undergraduates though. 

The simplest source of cospectral graphs is lists of strongly regular graphs, lots of which are easily available from Ted Spence's web page at $URL$ Otherwise you can use Sage to generate small graphs (up to 10 or so vertices) and then filter out cospectral pairs or groups. I expect the built in Sage function for cospectral pairs just wraps this up. I don't know what you are doing with them, but I'd probably recommend choosing the computational tool based on what you need, rather than specifying Matlab in advance. If you're working with 64 vertex graphs you'll need full symbolic computation with arbitrary length integers and you'll want to avoid, or be very very careful, in finding eigenvalues numerically. 

Our program "tutte" ($URL$ can compute the TP of $K_{18}$ in 160s (on a recent machine with an i7). However you wouldn't want to do it with this sort of program that works on general graphs, because the complete graph is special and by tackling it symbolically you can go much further. I can do $K_{40}$ in under a minute with Maple. Just FYI, some quick checks on consistency can be done by evaluating $T(1,1)$ and making sure it is equal to the number of spanning trees, and then $T(2,2)$ and making sure it is equal to $2^{n(n-1)/2}$. 

Three programs so far meet these criteria - my own program developed with Haggard/Pearce, a program based on tree decompositions by the statistical physicists Bedini/Jacobsen and a third by Bjorklund et. al. The first has its own webpage, while the latter two are on GitHub hence meeting the "availability" criterion. In addition, there are implementations in Sage and Maple and also a couple of other programs that can be downloaded from the web, but which (AFAIK) do not have papers describing them. I know that there are lots of other people who have written their own programs for their own personal use, but have no intention of distributing them. However I do not wish to offend anyone by omitting their program due to my lack of knowledge, and I want the chapter to give an accurate overview of the available resources. Thus, finally, my question: Are there other widely available, general purpose, implemented algorithms for computing the Tutte polynomial (partition function of the $q$-state Potts model) for an input graph with no particular structural constraints? 

Consider the following property of a graph $G$: The graph $G$ has no independent cutset of vertices, $S$, such that the number of components of $G-S$ is more than $|S|$ (the size of $S$). (That is, cannot delete 1 vertex and leave 2+ components, cannot delete 2 independent vertices and leave 3+ components etc.) For some as-yet-unexplained reason, this property has arisen in a couple of questions relating to chromatic roots; needing a name we called this property $\alpha$-1-tough, which uses the notation from graph toughness plus the adjective $\alpha$ to indicate "independent". Basically we believe that $\alpha$-1-tough graphs are well-behaved with respect to chromatic polynomials; the evidence is that various small graphs that violate certain reasonably well-founded and natural conjectures are very clearly NOT $\alpha$-1-tough. Having failed miserably at all attempts to prove anything sensible using this property, I wondered if anyone anywhere has seen this, or a similar, graph property appear anywhere. (I have posted a longer article about this on my (shared) blog, but am not sure of the policy about posting links to your own stuff so I won't do so just in case.) Edit: The blog entry is $URL$ 

There is an extensive theory of the real and complex roots of the chromatic polynomial of a graph, a substantial fraction of this being due to the connections between the chromatic polynomial and a particular limit of the partition function of the $q$-state Potts model. More generally we can consider the full Tutte polynomial $T(x,y)$ which is now a bivariate polynomial, and now precisely equivalent to the partition function of the $q$-state Potts model. Much work has been done on the values that this function takes and the theoretical difficulty of computing the values both for individual points and curves on the $xy$-plane. An obvious thing that one might try in order to get a different angle on the roots of the chromatic, flow etc. polynomials is to consider the level curves of the Tutte polynomial in the $xy$-plane, particularly the curves corresponding to $T(x,y) = 0$. If we do some computation, say for the Petersen graph, then a superficially interesting plot emerges, especially the zero curve. 

My computer tells me that there 195291625 graphs on 20 vertices with minimum degree at least 3 and maximum degree at most 6 and girth at least 5. Sadly none of them have chromatic number 4, I just get 48 bipartite ones and the remainder being 3-chromatic. Independent verification would be useful. Added Here's a 21-vertex graph that is not the Brinkmann graph, but is 4-chromatic and has girth equal to 5, also in graph6 format for direct input to Sage. It has the same number of edges as a 4-regular graph but has two vertices of degree 3 and two of degree 5. I bet that it is obtained from the Brinkmann graph by some small edge-swap move. 

For the sizes you have presented, this is an easy problem to solve in practice. Convert your design into a bipartite graph, with vertices being the points and the blocks of the design and making a "point vertex" adjacent to a "block vertex" if the point is in the block. Run a graph canonical labelling program - I recommend Brendan McKay's "nauty" program (Google 'bdm nauty page") - and then two designs are isomorphic if and only if the canonically labelled graphs are the same. (If you have designs with the same number of points as blocks, you will want to use the feature of nauty that permits you to partition the vertices of a graph - this avoids points getting mixed up with blocks!) 

And in the graph theory corner we have the famous Harary/Read paper "Is the null-graph a pointless concept?" 

Ok, since it is close enough for the OP (as evidenced by the comments) I will transfer my comment to an answer so that the question can be neatly wrapped up. So a Halin graph (named after Rudolf Halin) is built from a tree with no vertices of degree 2 that is embedded in the plane and whose leaves are then connected in a cycle determined by the embedding. So the OP's class of graphs (which permits vertices of degree 2) is a Halin graph with some tree-edges subdivided. 

Here are some additional facts about my matrix that may or may not be of importance. Things I feel are probably good 

I don't think that there are known families of graphs with (real) chromatic roots converging to particular Beraha numbers. Alan Sokal and Jesus Salas wrote a series of papers, the first of which is titled "Transfer Matrices and Partition-Function Zeros for Antiferromagnetic Potts Models I. General Theory and Square-Lattice Chromatic Polynomial" ($URL$ where they claim evidence that certain families have roots converging to $B_2$, $B_3$, $\ldots$, $B_5$. One intriguing leftover from their paper is that they can show that despite the likelihood that they are accumulation points of roots, no Beraha numbers are actually chromatic roots themselves - except possibly $B_{10}$. (I've looked quite hard to find a chromatic polynomial with $B_{10}$ as a root, but with no luck.) The graphs that I used in the paper of mine that you quoted were actually just modifications of the original family of graphs used by Beraha-Kahane in their famous paper "Is the four-color conjecture almost false?" So while I am not sure what you mean by periodic, I'm pretty sure that if the graphs they used are periodic, then so are the graphs that I used. (One problem is that statistical physicists working with strips of lattices have to make some decision about the "edges" of their lattice; if they "wrap-round" so that the left-hand edge is identified with the right-hand edge, then they call that "periodic boundary conditions." But I don't think that that is the meaning you had in mind?) 

Eulerian graphs with $e$ edges cannot be cordial unless $e$ is a multiple of $4$ so don't bother looking at $4$-regular graphs with an odd number of vertices. (This is in Cahit's original paper that is freely available online). 

Actually, the two graphs both have chromatic number 3 and have triangles, so it is easy to see that they are homomorphically equivalent (simply use the colour classes to map each one into one of the triangles of the other). But it is not trivial to see that the two linegraphs do not have homomorphisms between them. Or at least, I couldn't find a slick one-or-two line reason for it, and rather than start to write out a case analysis (suppose vertex 1 is mapped to vertex 2, then vertex 2 must be mapped to either 3 or 4, and in the first case...), the Sage code is easier to understand and more reliable. 

Use Brendan McKay's program geng, which is distributed with the nauty/Traces package and is available from $URL$ There are about 165091172592 graphs on 12 vertices, so it might take you a while. 

The Thompson group Th of order $90745943887872000$ is one of the sporadic simple groups occurring in the classification of finite simple groups. Its maximal subgroups are known (see $URL$ and they are all remarkably small, which has the consequence that any permutation representation of Th has very large degree. In particular, the permutation representation of Th of lowest possible degree has degree $143127000$. Question: Has anyone explicitly determined two permutations of this degree that generate Th, and if so, are these two permutations available online? Google reveals that some CS researchers have previously used this group as a test case for developing, refining and testing algorithms for high-degree permutation groups. For example, the paper $URL$ explicitly mentions the Thompson group, and more generally algorithms for manipulating permutation groups of degree higher than 100 million. They comment that each permutation needs about 1/2 Gb to store, and that as the usual algorithms need to store $\Omega(\log n)$ permutations ($n$ is the degree) space is a major problem. But this was over ten years ago, and nowadays storing even a few hundred permutations of this size would be no particular problem. I have emailed one of the authors of this paper (Cooperman) but after waiting a reasonable time (a week or so), I have not had a reply, so I'm now asking this list.
