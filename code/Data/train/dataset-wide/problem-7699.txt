If $X_0$ is projectively embedded, we can use a Gr\"obner basis for its defining ideal to make a Rees family over ${\mathbb A}^1$ most of whose fibers are $X_0$, but whose central fiber is a monomial scheme. So $X_0$ must already be a monomial scheme. Since you said it's a variety, it must be a projective space. If you then allow me to reembed (by a Veronese), I could break that projective space, too, unless it's a point. So my answer: $X_0$ must be a point. 

For a toric variety, such as this cone over the 3rd Veronese of $\mathbb P^1$, the complement of the open torus orbit is an anticanonical divisor (indeed, that is the one given by the unique $T$-invariant section of the anticanonical bundle). Correspondingly, the canonical module is the submodule of $\mathcal O$ given by functions vanishing off that orbit. In coordinates (given by $T$-weight sections), it has a basis given by the lattice points in the interior of the moment polytope. In the case at hand, this polytope is a sector $S \subset \mathbb R^2$, the cone over the interval with lattice points $\vec u,\vec x,\vec y,\vec w$ (why'd you use that weird order???), and the lattice points in the interior lie inside $S+\vec x, S+\vec y$. So $M = \langle x,y\rangle \leq A$, or $M \cong (A\oplus A)/\langle (y,-x)\rangle$. 

The answer may be something like "every H-C quotient of $V\otimes W$ has the wrong Gel$'$fand-Kirillov dimension for it to again have that associated $K$-orbit," in which case I'd appreciate references that make that most clear. (I will be sad, but not overly surprised, if that is the case.) EDIT: For consistency of notation, let's take $G,K$ to be the complexifications of $G_0,K_0$, where $K_0$ is a maximal compact in $G_0$. 

Pull back the equation $[W] = [H]^{codim\ W} \in \mathbb P^N$. This cohomological pullback is computable set-theoretically, as $[W\cap G]$, if the intersection is transverse. 

You apparently mean the action on the set of components is free, not just faithful. For $C$ a component of $X$, the composite map $C \to X \to X//G$ is a finite map, and (by the freeness assumption) birational. From there you need only that $X//G$ is normal to infer that this map is an isomorphism. (You don't need any assumption on $C$ nor do you need smoothness of $X//G$.) 

$I = \langle (c_i) \rangle$ is generated by Casimirs $c_i$, i.e. each $c_i\in Z$ $I$ is a Poisson ideal, i.e. $\{I,R\} \leq I$. 

Check out Almost commuting elements in compact Lie groups by Borel, Freedman, and Morgan. "We describe the components of the moduli space of conjugacy classes of commuting pairs and triples of elements in a compact Lie group. This description is in terms of the extended Dynkin diagram of the simply connected cover, together with the coroot integers and the action of the fundamental group." 

Let $X$ be a normal, projective complex variety with an anticanonical divisor $D$. Do the virtual Hodge numbers of the noncompact Calabi-Yau variety $X$ \ $D$ enjoy some sort of positivity property? Being virtual, defined by inclusion-exclusion from complete varieties, they're not individually positive. What I'd most like is to hear "The Euler characteristic is nonnegative". But that's not true for $X$ a quintic 3-fold, $D$ empty. 

The natural map is rather from $TV \to U(FreeLie(V))$: consider the forgetful functors $Assoc \to Lie \to Vec$ and compose their left adjoints to get the left adjoint $T$ of the composite. Then, as Alex Suciu comments, your question is a special case of the comparison of $U\mathfrak g$ and $S\mathfrak g$, accomplished by PBW. 

Start with $Spec(A)$ being a vector space $V$, and let $V'$ be the subspace $V\times 0$ complementary to the diagonal $V_\Delta$. Then the ideal $I$ is functions on $V\times V$ vanishing on the diagonal, which we can think of as functions on $V'$ vanishing at $0$, indexed by points of $V_\Delta$. As Anton Deitmar explained, $I/I^2$ is then linear functions on $V'$, indexed by points of $V_\Delta$. Identifying $V' = V = V_\Delta$ we get $V \times V^*$. Then this analysis works locally at smooth points of a general $Spec(A)$. 

Let $k$ be a field, $A$ a $k$-algebra (probably noncommutative), and $M$ an $A$-module that's finite-dimensional as a vector space over $k$. Let $Gr(M;k)$ denote the set of all $k$-subspaces of $M$, i.e. the disjoint union of Grassmannians, and $Gr(M;A) \subseteq Gr(M;k)$ denote the subscheme consisting of $A$-submodules. If $V < M$ is an $A$-submodule, let $gr\ M := V \oplus (M/V)$, the associated graded. There's a natural constructible (i.e. discontinuous) map $Gr(M; A) \to Gr(gr\ M; A)$ taking $W \mapsto ((W\cap V), (image: W\to M\twoheadrightarrow M/V))$. 

I don't know if this qualifies, because like Daniel Litt, I'm not sure I understand the question. Nonetheless... Frequently in algebraic geometry to show $\chi_0$ has some open niceness property, e.g. being Cohen-Macaulay, we make a family $\chi$ all of whose fibers are isomorphic to $\chi_0$ (perhaps by being translates under a group action), except for one "bad" one, $\chi_\infty$. Then show that $\chi_\infty$ is good, thereby indirectly inferring that $\chi_0$ must be good. (Niceness properties seems to almost exactly be the ones that are open in families. A counterexample is given by "normal crossings divisor", a deformation of which may not have normal crossings.) 

The connected double cover of $S^1$ (boundary of the Möbius strip) is an $S^0$ bundle that is not the double of the unique $0$-disc bundle over $S^1$. 

First let's revisit the usual case. The $\mathbb N$-grading on $R$ says that $Spec\ R$ is a cone, and there is a map $R \to R_0$. We can rip out $Spec\ R_0$ from $Spec\ R$, take the quotient, and get a reasonable space $Proj\ R$. If we grade instead by say $({\mathbb N})^k$, then there are $k$ analogous quotients of $R$, and $k$ closed subschemes to rip out before we divide by $({\mathbb G}_m)^k$. This comes up if e.g. $R = Fun(G/N)$, with the torus acting on the right (through the maximal unipotent group $N$), and the corresponding quotient is $G/B$. Some of the things I would look up here are "Cox coordinate ring of a toric variety" and "Mori dream space", but I don't know the references well enough to suggest a best place. 

As far as I can tell, Noether normalization uses the term "normalization" in the English sense, that something has been given a standard form. And as such it's not intrinsically related to normalization in the sense of "take the integral closure in the ring of fractions". I would leave the matter at that, except that in book after book, the two are introduced and studied in very close proximity. Am I missing something? 

Think of the group $E$ as degenerating to the group $C_{reg} \cong {\mathbb G}_m \times {\mathbb Z}/2$. In that group, the $2$-torsion is ${\mathbb Z}/2 \times {\mathbb Z}/2$, where one generator rotates each component of $C$ by $-1$, and the other one switches the two components. EDIT: I'm very disturbed by the fact that $E$ can first degenerate to a one-nodal elliptic curve, whose group is only ${\mathbb G}_m$, i.e. with $2$-torsion only ${\mathbb Z}/2$. I retract my claim that one should think of $C_{reg}$ as a group, instead of a $({\mathbb G}_m \times {\mathbb Z}/n)$-space, as in S. Carnahan's answer. In that version, it becomes clear that the ${\mathbb Z}/n$ does indeed permute the nodes. 

Let's start with the case of a torus. Since you don't require $X$ to be smooth, we can reduce to this case by replacing $X$ by $X//N$. (Though actually inferring results about the nonabelian case from the abelian looks a bit hard.) Since the DH function is piecewise continuous (even polynomial) on polyhedral chambers, we can test continuity along all straight lines. If we replace $X$ by $X//_\lambda T'$ where $T'$ is codimension $1$ in $T$, we get the DH function restricted to the line $\lambda + ({\mathfrak t}')^\perp$, which is the DH function for $S := T/T'$. So we can reduce to the case of a circle action, with moment polytope an interval in the line. Now, the more general question is how the DH function, a piecewise polynomial of degree $\dim X - 1$, changes as one passes through the point $\lambda \in {\mathbb R}$. The answer is, there's a contribution from each component $C$ of $X^S$ with moment value $\lambda$, of a polynomial vanishing to order $(\dim X - 1) - \dim C$. In particular, the function can only be discontinuous if $\dim C = \dim X - 1$, and in that case, $C$ must be either the source or sink of the Bialynicki-Birula decomposition for $S$. Put another way, $\lambda$ must be at an endpoint of the interval. So for the general $T$ case, we learn that the DH function is continuous on the interior, and will only be discontinuous on a boundary facet of the moment polytope when the preimage of that facet is codimension $1$ in $X$. EDIT: For an example, take the circle acting on $\mathbb A^3$ with weights $0,1,1$, and projectivize. The result has $DH(x)=x$ on $[0,1)$, and $DH(x)=0$ outside $[0,1]$. The fixed points are the point $[*,0,0]$ and the line $\{[0,*,*]\}$, with moment values $0,1$ respectively. 

Disclaimer: I am far from expert in the topics under discussion. Let $A \subseteq V$ be a closed affine cone in a vector space, defined by polynomial equations. In classical "projective duality", one takes the conormal bundle to $A_{reg}$ (the smooth points) inside $T^* V \cong V\times V^*$, takes the closure, and projects to $V^*$ to get the "projectively dual cone" $A' \subseteq V^*$. The same construction applied to $A'$ gives $A$ back. Alternatively, one can start with the constant sheaf on $A_{reg}$, take its perverse extension on $V$, then the Fourier transform of that on $V^*$ (again an IC sheaf), and finally take the support of that. 

My recollection of the Gröbner engine of Macaulay 2 is that it's rather black-boxed. Surely others here know better than I how to access its parts directly. The first step is to extend to a Gröbner basis $G$. But without reimplementing the Buchberger algorithm I don't know how to express the new generators in terms of the old. Then, you can $\rm scan()$ through ${\rm flatten\ entries\ generators}\ G$, replacing p by p%G, and if they're different print out (G, (p-p%G)/G). Continue cycling through until $p=0$. 

If you throw in "compact", so that the space is $G/P$ for some parabolic $P$, here's an alternate characterization: the unipotent radical of $P$ should be abelian. Equivalently, $P$ should be maximal, hence correspond to a simple root, and the coefficient of that simple root in the highest root should be $1$. The number of such simple roots is $|Z(G)|-1$, where $G$ is simple simply connected. One way these "cominuscule" flag manifolds show up is as the closed $G(O)$ orbits on the affine Grassmannian $G(K)/G(O)$, where $O = {\mathbb C}[[t]]$ and $K = {\mathbb C}((t))$. Their homology gives the corresponding "minuscule" representation of the Langlands dual to $G$, this being the nicest case of the geometric Satake correspondence. 

The composite of Poisson maps is Poisson The action map $G\times G\to G$ is Poisson Your choice of $T,U$ should be Poisson submanifolds of $G$. You didn't say which Poisson structure you're using so theoretically I can't tell, but I'm sure you're interested in the standard one in which case, they are. 

I'm having trouble distinguishing these geometrically: both seem to be about subschemes of $Spec\ R$ that are unions of symplectic leaves. But that seems too good to be true (or I would hope someone would have told me already). Still, I will ask: 

The set of such $\mu$ form a rational polytope lying inside $L$'s positive Weyl chamber. The vertices of this polytope strictly inside $L$'s chamber ("regular vertices") are exactly those of the form $w\cdot \lambda$ that are lucky enough to be in there. The vertices of this polytope lying on $L$'s Weyl walls are very likely to be very complicated. In particular they may not be integral weights of $L$. As I recall this already happens for $GL(3) \supset GL(2)\times GL(1)$. 

This is only a slight modification of the argument already given, but I liked it enough to type it in. Since $W$ acts with no stabilizer on the open Weyl chamber $K$, for $K$ to contain a root $\beta$, this $\beta$ cannot be perpendicular to any other root. In particular the Dynkin diagram $D$ has to be a complete graph (but the triangle $K_3 = \widehat A_2$ is already infinite type, so as a graph $D$ has to be $K_1$ or $K_2$), and by inspection of $B_2,G_2$ we see that every root is perpendicular to some other root. So the only possibilities are $A_1,A_2$. 

I think I understand, though I haven't checked in great detail, nor attempted a naive proof. (So perhaps this doesn't count as an answer.) Given a Schubert polynomial, consider the terms containing $x_m$ with the largest $m$, then of those terms the ones with $x_m$ to the largest power, then of those terms the ones with $x_{m-1}$ to the largest power, and so on; eventually you get to a unique term I'll call the leading term. The exponents on this term are the $v$ that Lascoux is using; I believe this is also the Lehmer code of the permutation. Personally, I like to find this by making the Rothe diagram of the permutation [Lascoux, p300], with $v_i$ the number of boxes in the $i$th row. If you shove the boxes to the left, you get the lowest pipe dream for this Schubert polynomial; see [Bergeron-Billey]. They show that all the other pipe dreams can be obtained by upward "chute" and "ladder" moves. I believe those moves will preserve the inequalities Lascoux states. 

Use the Haar measure on $G$ (compact!) to average a metric, obtaining a $G\times G$-invariant metric, and thus an identification $\mathfrak g \cong \mathfrak g^*$. Also, the geodesic spray $\mathfrak g \to G$ defined using this metric is $G$-equivariant. Hence a $G$-orbit in $\mathfrak g^*$ near enough $0$ is $G$-isomorphic to a conjugacy class in $G$. Now take a topological generator $t$ of $T$, i.e. $\overline{\langle t\rangle} = T$. Then the conjugacy class $G\cdot t$ of $t$ is $G/Z_G(t) = G/Z_G(T)$. Now you need to know the standard fact that for $G$ connected, tori are self-centralizing. (Personally, I prove that by using the Bruhat decomposition of $G\cdot t$ to show it's simply-connected, and therefore the covering map $G/T \to G/Z_G(T)$ must be trivial.) 

For example, the polytope $hull([123,321] \cdot (1,2,3))$ is a hexagon, and the strong Bruhat cover $231 > 132$ defines an edge through the middle of this hexagon, so not a weak cover. Whereas the polytope $hull([132,321] \cdot (1,2,3))$ is a trapezoid, one edge of which connects $231$ and $132$. EDIT: perhaps I should admit the geometry here. If $\Gamma$ is a Weyl group of a Lie group $G$ -- and I am happy to make this assumption, albeit I want $G$ Kac-Moody -- and $V$ the corresponding weight lattice, and $\lambda$ a dominant weight, then $hull(W\cdot \lambda)$ is the moment polytope for $G/B$ bearing the Borel-Weil line bundle ${\mathcal L}_\lambda$. Within $G/B$ we have the Richardson variety $\overline{BuB}/B \cap \overline{B_- vB}/B$, and $hull([u,v]\cdot \lambda)$ is the moment polytope of that.
