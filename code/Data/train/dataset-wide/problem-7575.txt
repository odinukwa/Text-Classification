The only partial result to the above question I have so far is that every Lindelof scattered P-space of pseudocharacter less than $\aleph_\omega$ is pseudoradial (the pseudocharacter at a point $x$ is defined as the minimum $\kappa$ such that $\{x\}$ is a $G_\kappa$ set, and the pseudocharacter of the space is obtained simply by taking the supremum over all points). See my paper with Bella and Costantini "P-spaces and the Whyburn property", Theorem 19. The following question suggests a possible path to a counterexample. 

Fréchet-Urysohn means that for every non-closed set $A$ and point $x \in \overline{A} \setminus A$ there is a countable sequence inside $A$ converging to $x$. Fréchet-Urysohn is the same as every subspace is sequential. Malykhin's problem asks for an example of a countable non-metrizable Fréchet-Urysohn topological group. The consistency of a positive answer to it has been known for some time, and recently Hrusak and Ramos-Garcia came up with a proof of the consistency of a negative answer, thus establishing its independence from ZFC. 

I'm asking whether it is a $D$-space in its weak topology of course, because the strong topology is metrizable and it's easy to see that every metric space is a $D$-space. 

Joel showed you how to get infinitely many non-$T_0$ non-homeomorphic spaces as you want. But you can even get infinitely many $T_0$ non-homeomorphic spaces as you want just by isolating points $0$ through $k$ in your topology ($k \geq 1$). The resulting space will have exactly $k$ many isolated points and every $\{j\}$, for $j \geq k$ can be generated from the finite set $\{0,1, \dots, k-1\}$ by closure, complement and union. You cannot wish to get a Hausdorff, not even a $T_1$ space as you want because a space is $T_1$ if and only if singletons are closed. So, a finite set in a $T_1$ space will only generate finitely many sets under the operations of closure, complement and union. 

Moving Off Property means that if $\mathcal{K}$ is a collection of compact subsets of $X$ such that every compact subset of $X$ is disjoint from some member of $\mathcal{K}$ (such a collection is called "Moving Off"), then $\mathcal{K}$ contains an infinite subcollection with a discrete open expansion. (1) --> (2) is easily seen to be true, even without the assumption that $X$ is locally compact or first-countable (hint: if $\mathcal{K}$ is a moving off collection then $O_n=\{f \in C_k(X): (\exists K \in \mathcal{K}) (f(K)>n)\}$ is a dense open subset of $C_k(X))$), but it is an open problem whether the above characterization holds for every (completely regular) space $X$. In the last section of their paper, Gruenhage and Ma offer an example of a locally compact space $X$ such that $C_k(X)$ is Baire but not weakly $\alpha$-favorable. Since every Cech-complete space is weakly $\alpha$-favorable, their example solves your Problem 1. 

(It's easy to prove that in a perfect space where closed discrete sets are countable, it's even true that every discrete set is countable. So from the above statement it follows that every Lindelof $T_1$ perfect space has cardinality at most the continuum, something that was proved by Alexandroff and Urysohn in their Memoire, at least for compact Hausdorff spaces, if I'm not mistaken). On the other hand: 

First of all let me note that a first-countable space of density $2^\omega$ has cardinality $\leq 2^\omega$, so a counterexample $X$ to your question must satisfy $c(X) \leq 2^\omega < d(X)$. That leads us naturally to higher Suslin Lines. A continuous linear order $X$ (endowed with the order topology) is called a $\kappa$-Suslin line if $c(X) \leq \kappa < d(X)$. The existence of a $\kappa$-Suslin Line is equivalent to the existence of a $\kappa$-Suslin tree and since higher Suslin trees are consistent with ZFC (Jensen proved they exist under $V=L$ for example), the existence of higher Suslin lines is also consistent with ZFC. A higher Suslin line is not necessarily first-countable but we can get something similar to a Suslin Line which is first-countable using an idea of this paper of Juhasz, Soukup and Szentmiklossy: $URL$ Assume the existence of a $\mathfrak{c}$-Suslin Line $X$. Let $Y$ be the set of all points of countable cofinality in $X$. The continuity of the linear order implies that $Y$ is dense in $X$ and hence we can fix a dense subset $Z \subset Y$ of cardinality $\mathfrak{c}^+$. On $Z$ consider the topology $\tau$ generated by intervals of the form $(x,y]$, for $x < y \in Z$. Note that $(Z,\tau)$ is a first-countable space of cardinality $\mathfrak{c}^+$ and $c((Z, \tau))\leq \mathfrak{c}$, so that provides a consistent counterexample to your question. Let me finish by noting that although it's not true that the continuum is a bound on the cardinality of first-countable spaces of cellularity $\leq 2^\omega$, the Hajnal-Juhasz inequality $|X| \leq 2^{\chi(X) \cdot c(X)}$ implies that $2^{2^\omega}$ is a bound on the cardinality of such a space (I'm assuming this is what originally motivated your question). 

Here´s a ZFC answer to your question. All spaces are assumed to be Hausdorff. Recall that the tightness $t(x,X)$ of a point $x$ in the space $X$ is defined as the least cardinal $\kappa$ such that for every set $A \subset X$ such that $x \in \overline{A}$ there exists a $\kappa$-sized subset $B$ of $A$ such that $x \in \overline{B}$. The tightness $t(X)$ of the space $X$ is then defined by taking the supremum of the local tightness over all points $x \in X$. Arhangel´skii proved that the tightness of a compact space can be characterized by means of a special kind of discrete set called "free sequence". Although we´re not gonna need to use its definition directly, let me recall you what it is. A set $F \subset X$ is called a free sequence of length $\kappa$ if there exists a well-ordering $\{x_\alpha: \alpha <\kappa \}$ of $F$ such that $\overline{\{x_\alpha: \alpha < \beta \}} \cap \overline{\{x_\alpha: \alpha \geq \beta \}}=\emptyset$, for every $\beta < \kappa$. The freeness $F(X)$ of a space $X$ is the supremum of the cardinalities of its free sequences. 

Juris Steprans's article in the Handbook of the History of Logic: "History of the Continuum in the 20th century". $URL$ 

Thickness serves to guarantee no transfinite uncountable sequence of regular length converges to the added point in the one-point compactification of the corresponding locally compact scattered space, and avoiding smallness serves to guarantee the added point in the one-point compactification of $(A, \tau_A)$ does not have countable character. Summing it all up, a yes to Question 3 implies a yes to Question 2 (just take the one point compactification of the resulting locally compact scattered space $(A, \tau_A)$), which in turn implies a yes to Question 1. Not every locally compact scattered space arises in the way described above, so there may well be other ways to answer Question 2 in the positive. And there may well be other ways to answer Question 1 as well. 

Two additional examples of Tychonoff separable spaces with a $G_\delta$-diagonal which are not submetrizable have been constructed by Buzyakova. The main advantage of her examples over the Mrowka-Isbell space is that they have some additional compactness-type properties (for example, they don't contain any uncountable closed discrete sets). However, her spaces are not normal: the second one is not normal because it's a pseudocompact non-countably compact space and she explains why the first one is not normal in the Remark at the end of page 16, adding that she has tried to make it normal. 

Here is why. The $G_\delta$-modification of a topological space $X$ is simply the topology generated by all countable intersections of open sets of $X$. Since the $G_\delta$ modification of compact scattered spaces is Lindelof (see Arhangel'skii's function spaces book), the $G_\delta$ modification of a space positively answering QUESTION 2 would be a Lindelof scattered $P$-space where no non-trivial sequence converges to $p$. I wonder if to answer Question 2 one could use a general construction of locally compact scattered spaces described in Juhasz, Shelah, Soukup and Szentmiklossy's paper "A tall space with a small bottom" Let $A$ be a family of sets, and consider the coarsest topology $\tau_A$ on $A$ making $P(a) \cap A$ clopen, for every $a \in A$. Call a family of sets $A$ well-founded, if the containment relation on $A$ is well-founded. Call a family of sets $A$ $\cap$-closed if $a \cap b \in A \cup \{\emptyset\}$ for every $a, b \in A$. Well-foundedness of $A$ guarantees that the resulting space $(A, \tau_A)$ is scattered, and along with $\cap$-closedness it makes each $P(a) \cap A$ compact, so that $(A, \tau_A)$ is also locally compact. To state my final question concisely I need the following definitions. Call a family of sets $A$ thick if for every subfamily $E \subset A$ having regular uncountable cardinality $\kappa$, there is $a \in A$ such that $P(a) \cap E$ has cardinality $\kappa$, where $P(a)$ is the powerset of a. Call a family of sets $A$ small if there is a countable subfamily $C \subset A$ such that $\bigcup \{ P(c) \cap A: c \in C \}=A$. 

This question has been already answered thoroughly. I just wanted to address the OP's comment "I am not sure if there is anything special about $\aleph_\omega$". Actually, there is nothing special about $\aleph_\omega$ other than the fact that it's a singular cardinal. Let $\kappa$ be a cardinal and let $S(\kappa)$ be the following statement: 

Let $c(X)$ denote the cellularity of the topological space $X$, that is the supremum of the cardinalities of its families of pairwise disjoint non-empty open subsets. In the early 60's Kurepa asked: 

Yes, such an example can be obtained using the Pixley-Roy hyperspace construction. Given a topological space $X$, the Pixley-Roy hyperspace on $X$ ($PR(X)$) is defined as the space of all non-empty finite subsets of $X$ with the topology generated by sets of the form $[F,U]:=\{G \in PR(X): F \subset G \subset U \}$, where $F \in PR(X)$ and $U$ is an open subset of $X$ which contains $F$. It is easy to see that $PR(X)$ is Lindelof if and only if $X$ is countable. Indeed, when $X$ is uncountable, the family $\{[\{x\}, X]: x \in X \}$ provides an open cover without countable subcovers. It's also easy to see that if $X$ has countable weight then $PR(X)$ is ccc. Eric van Douwen proved that $PR(X)$ is always metacompact (provided $X$ is $T_1$) and that $PR(X)$ is a Moore space when $X$ is first-countable. So for every uncountable set of reals $Z \subset \mathbb{R}$, the space $PR(Z)$ is not Lindelof, but it's Tychonoff, metacompact, ccc and a Moore space (you didn't ask for the latter, but it's a nice bonus to have! ;-)). Only missing is normality. To get it we can use a standard trick, originally due to Bob Heath, which goes back to the Normal Moore Space Problem. Let $Y$ be a $Q$-set (that is an uncountable subset of the reals whose every subset is a relative $G_\delta$) with the additional property that $Y^n$ is a $Q$-set, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (the existence of such a set of reals is consistent with and independent from ZFC). Then we can prove that $PR(Y)$ is normal. For the proofs see the survey Lutzer, David J., Pixley-Roy topology, Topology proceedings, Vol. 3, No.1, Proc. Topol. Conf. Univ. Okla. 1978, 139-158 (1979). ZBL0435.54007.). 

A space has a $G_\delta$-diagonal if its diagonal can be written as the intersection of countably many open subsets of the square. A space is submetrizable if it has a weaker metrizable topology. Every submetrizable space has a $G_\delta$-diagonal, but the converse is not true. The simplest example of a space with a $G_\delta$-diagonal which is not submetrizable is the Mrowka-Isbell space $\Psi(\mathcal{A})$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is a maximal almost disjoint family of subsets of $\omega$ (see this post by Daniel Ma for details). However $\Psi(\mathcal{A})$ is not normal, for example because $\Psi(\mathcal{A})$ is a pseudocompact space which is not countably compact. 

Given an example of a space $X$ with property $P$, let $Y$ be the topological sum of $X$ with any countable non-second countable space. Then $Y$ has property $P$ but is not second-countable. 

For $\kappa \geq \omega$, $I^\kappa$ is homeomorphic to $(I^\omega)^\kappa$, and product of homogeneous spaces is homogeneous, so $I^\kappa$ is homogeneous for every infinite $\kappa$. 

Let $X$ be a set and $u$ be a free ultrafilter on $X$. We can consider a topology on $X$ by declaring every element of $u \cup \{\emptyset \}$ to be open. El'kin's original motivation for looking at this topology is that $X$ is a space without isolated points which can't be split into disjoint dense subspaces. Another quirky feature: if $X$ is say $\mathbb{R}$ then translations are not continuous. This last fact makes me wonder: are there any periodic-point free continuous self maps at all on $X$ with this topology? In other words: 

How about Parovicenko's Theorem ? Assume CH. Let X be a compact zero-dimensional space without isolated points such that: 1) X is an $F$-space (that is, disjoint open $F_\sigma$ sets have disjoint closures). 2) $X$ is an almost $P$-space (that is, every non-empty $G_\delta$ set has non-empty interior). 3) $X$ has a base of cardinality continuum. Then $X$ is homeomorphic to $\beta \mathbb{N} \setminus \mathbb{N}$ Parovicenko's characterization of $\beta \mathbb{N} \setminus \mathbb{N}$ is actually equivalent to CH by a result of van Douwen and van Mill. It's interesting that Parovicenko's theorem is equivalent to a boolean-algebraic statement which uses only two essential hypotheses... 

Then $C(\aleph_n)$ is true for every $0< n< \omega$, $C(\aleph_\omega)$ is false for essentially the same reason that $S(\aleph_\omega)$ is false, but the truth value of $C(\aleph_{\omega+1})$ depends on your set theory. Namely, if there is an $\aleph_{\omega+1}$-sized family of countable subsets of $\aleph_\omega$ which is cofinal in $([\aleph_\omega]^\omega, \subseteq)$ then $C(\aleph_{\omega+1})$ is true, while if $cof([\aleph_\omega]^\omega, \subseteq) \geq \aleph_{\omega+2}$ (which is consistent with ZFC, modulo large cardinals) then $C(\aleph_{\omega+1})$ is clearly false... 

None of the standard separation axioms is enough to guarantee $nw(X) \cdot \chi(X)=w(X)$. In fact, in the exercise section of Engelking's chapter on compactness, you can find this construction of a perfectly normal space, known as the Bow-tie Space. Define a topology on the plane by leaving neighborhoods of all points off the x-axis untouched and declaring that a neighborhood of a point $x$ on the x-axis consists of $x$ plus the intersection of the ball of radius $\epsilon$ centered at $x$ with the region bounded by the two lines passing through $x$ and having slopes $\epsilon$ and $-\epsilon$ respectively, for $\epsilon>0$. The Bow-tie Space is first countable and has a countable network because it's the union of two spaces with a countable base: indeed, the topology induced by this space on both the x-axis and its complement in the plane is the Euclidean one. But its weight is continuum. To see that, let $\mathcal{B}$ be any base. For every $B \in \mathcal{B}$, let $S(B)$ be the set of all points of the x axis such that the vertical line passing through them intersects $B$ in exactly one point. $S(B)$ is a discrete subset of the x-axis (with the Euclidean topology), and hence it's countable. But the $S(B)$'s cover the x axis and hence there have to be continuum many distinct $B$'s. Ramiro's observations that network weight coincides with weight for compact and metric spaces can be generalized to locally compact and developable spaces, respectively (a "developable space" is a topological space having a sequence $\{\mathcal{U}_n: n < \omega \}$ of open covers such that $\{st(x, \mathcal{U}_n): n < \omega \}$ is a local base at $x$, for every point $x \in X$, where $st(x, \mathcal{U})=\bigcup \{U \in \mathcal{U}: x \in U \}$. The importance of this class lies mainly in a famous topological problem which turned out to be independent of the usual axioms of set theory: does there exist a normal developable non-metrizable space?). I think it would be interesting to know whether your equality is true for homogeneous spaces. 

The obvious thing to try would be the free topological group over a Suslin continuum, but that doesn't work because it's a $\sigma$-compact group and, by a result of Tkachenko, $\sigma$-compact groups are ccc (and the square of a $\sigma$-compact group is clearly a $\sigma$-compact group). 

A space $X$ is discretely generated (DG) if for every non-closed set $A \subset X$ and for every point $x \in \overline{A} \setminus A$ there is a discrete set $D \subset A$ such that $x \in \overline{D}$. For being a convergence-type property (note that Fréchet-Urysohn and even radial spaces are DG) discrete generability is pretty weak: every scattered space is DG, every compact space of countable tightness is DG in ZFC and every monotonically normal space is DG (see Dow, A.; Tkachenko, M.G.; Tkachuk, V.V.; Wilson, R.G., Topologies generated by discrete subspaces, Glas. Mat., III. Ser. 37, No.1, 187-210 (2002). ZBL1009.54005.). There are examples of DG spaces with a non-DG square (see Murtinová, Eva, On products of discretely generated spaces, Topology Appl. 153, No. 18, 3402-3408 (2006). ZBL1107.54006.), but in a few notable special case discrete generability is indeed preserved in box products:
