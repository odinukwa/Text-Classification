Yes, definitely. Galaxies grow through smooth accretion of matter (both dark and baryonic), and through mergers with other galaxies. Minor mergers (i.e. where one galaxy is much larger than the other) simply disrupt the smaller one without changing the shape of the larger (but may increase its star formation rate for a while). Major mergers, where galaxies are of comparable size, can completely "wreck" the galaxies. If the merging galaxies are spirals, they can sometimes settle down into a larger spiral galaxy, possibly with an enhanced central bulge. But sometimes, depending among other things on their orientation prior to merging, they become ellipticals instead. Since the Universe is expanding, galaxies were closer together in the past, and thus most of the growth has already taken place. Small galaxies which undergo intense star formation, may blow out their gas due to stellar feedback, in this way getting rid of most of their gas and thus decrease a little in size and "extinguish" themselves. Galaxies have their origin from the clumps in the almost smooth primordial soup of gas and dark matter (and radiation). These clumps have a size distribution — the halo mass function — which is a power law at small masses and with a exponential cut-off at large masses. Thus, the size of galaxies follow a similar distribution. The figure on the left below (created with this tool) shows the distribution of dark matter halos, i.e. number per volume at a given mass today (redshift $z=0$, solid line) and when the Universe was only two billion years old ($z=3$, dashed line). You can see that in early times, the large halos hadn't formed yet. The figure on the right (from my own cosmological simulation) shows how many stars there are in a (simulated) dark matter halo of a given mass. You can see that it follows an approximate power law, but with quite some scatter. 

All galaxies other than those in the Local Group show red-shift (Doppler shift towards longer wavelengths which for optical frequencies is towards the red end of the spectrum, hence red-shift). This is due to the expansion of space from which we initially inferred the Big-Bang. Galaxies within the Local Group and stars in the Milky Way (the Galaxy) may show either red or blue Doppler shifts depending on their motion with respect to the Earth. 

The diffraction limit of telescope optics, for apertures large compared to the wavelength of light, is inversely proportional to the diameter of the aperture. See the relevant Wikipedia page. For moderate to large telescopes with simple optics this resolution limit is usually not realisable due to seeing. The seeing limit is due to thermal inhomogeneity and turbulence in the atmosphere between the telescope and the target. See this Sky at Night page. To some extent the seeing limit can be overcome using adaptive optics. See the relevant Wikipedia page. 

The Milky-Way does not orbit the Andromeda galaxy, they both move under the influence of all the members of the local group. Even if one were orbiting the other the orbit need not be near circular but could be a very eccentric (elongated) ellipse. The projected merger is because the tangential component of Andromeda's velocity with respect to the Milky-Way is small compared to its radial component That is Andromeda galaxy appears to be moving almost directly towards the Milky-Way (which is what it says in the Wikipedia page you link to, but it is not too difficult to find primary sources using Google, here is an arXiv paper reporting a proper motion study of Andromeda and reporting such). 

$^\dagger$Note that since large distances also means looking back in time (since the light has spent a long time traveling), we actually don't see galaxies this far away, as they hadn't formed this early in history. We do however see the gas from which the galaxies were born, as far back as 380,000 years after Big Bang. 

Note that this time dilation is what a distant observer (i.e. the guy with the $t_\infty$ time) would measure for an observer at the distance $r$. The person at $r$ would just measure his/her own time as usual. For instance, according to point 5 above, if you were hovering 1 km from the surface, waving your hand every second, then I, choosing to stay at a safe distance of 1 lightyear but with a magically powerful telescope, would see you wave approximately once every hour. And when you run out of fuel and plummet into the BH, then when you cross the surface you wouldn't notice anything particular, but I would see you frozen in time. This is the concept of relativity. Finally, let me use this chance to clarify something that people, including myself, often have gotten wrong: Sagittarius A (without an asterisk) is a radio source in the center of the Milky Way. It consists of three parts: Sagittarius A East (a supernova remnant), Sagittarius A West (dust and gas clouds), and Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A*, which is a very bright and compact radio source believed to be formed by a supermassive BH. Sgr A* isn't actually the BH itself. I think the BH doesn't really have a name, so I'll call it $\mathrm{BH}_\mathrm{Sgr\,A^*}$. Maybe that's a bad name… 

Can they see the stars? If not then motion is undetectable in a closed environment as it would constitute an inertial frame. But even if they could see the "stars" presumably these would be generated by some form of display technology and behave consistently with the supposed mission profile. However acceleration is detectable, it would manifest as a gravity like force. The way gravity varies withing the environment could indicate that this was a planetary field rather than an artificial one (depending on how the artificial gravity is supposedly generated). I would expect the payload will have been told some story that would explain this away though. 

It is a co-incidence. The units are what you need to look at, in both the speed of light and the distance of the Sun the units of length are the same (m) (your ratio is $\approx 0.002 s^{-1}$ when you use metres as the unit for the distance to the Sun). The definition of the second is in a sense arbitrary and is a consequence of how we have chosen to sub-divide the day into smaller units of time (there is nothing cosmic in dividing the day into 24 units each subdivided into sixtieths which are again subdivided into sixtieths). If we had chosen to take as our basic unit of time $1/100000$ of a day rather than $1/86400$ the nice round answer vanishes (if my calculations are right the $\approx 0.002$ becomes $\approx0.0023$) 

The latter is closest to the truth, although I wouldn't use the phrasing "stretch". The "mouths" of the wormhole are (more or less) fixed in comoving coordinates (i.e. the coordinate system that expands with the Universe, and in which galaxies lie approximately still). But the bridge is sort of outside our three-dimensional space, and doesn't necessarily follow the same expansion. If the mouths retained a fixed physical distance, they would accelerate in comoving coordinates beyond bound, eventually moving through space at superluminal velocities, which is forbidden. For example, consider the Milky Way and the galaxy GN-z11 which today lies at a distance of 32 billion lightyears from us. Roughly 13.3 billion years ago, the size of the Universe was 1/10 of today's value; that is $a=0.1$, and the distance to GN-z11 was only 3.2 billion lightyears. If at that time you created a wormhole$^\dagger$ bridging MW and GN-z11, and if the distance between the mouths were fixed in physical coordinates, then today, at least one of the mouths would have moved so far outside its host galaxy that it must have traveled superluminally. 

It all depends on what you are trying to do. For some purposes 6H might correspond to an adequate vacuum for others not. The density is not low enough to ignore its effects on a space craft (we are talking of $\approx 48$ km in the case of the Earth). Indeed $48$km is less than the altitude record for an unmanned balloon, though greater than the altitude records for air breathing aircraft. 

The idea of magnification is not relevant to astro-photography, what is relevant is the image scale. The image scale depends on the focal length of the objective and the size of the sensor. The Barlow effectively modifies the focal length, so if you have a $B\times$ Barlow and an objective of focal length $f_O$ the effective focal length is $f_e=B\times f_O$. If your sensor has side of length $l$ then the field of view that corresponds to that side is (in radian) $\theta_{rad}=l/f_e$ or in degrees $\theta_{deg}=(l/f_e)\times(180/\pi)$ So if your sensor has a short side length of $\approx 0.015 \mbox{m}$ and a the telescope has a focal length of $1.2 \mbox{m}$ and you are using a $\times2$ Barlow you have the short side of the image corresponds to a field of view of $\approx 21$ minutes of arc. 

The ecliptic still passes through the original 12 constellations, although Earth's precession has shifted the Sun's apparent position by roughly one constellation. That is, if your birthday is today, May 2, an astrologer would claim you were Taurus, whereas in reality the Sun is currently positioned in Aries. Additionally, the ecliptic now passes through the constellation Ophiuchus (The Serpent Bearer). You can see the "historical" and the "true" constellations e.g. here. 

The paper describing this finding is van Dokkum et al. (2018). In a galaxy, the ratio of the stellar mass $M_\star$ to dark matter mass $M_\mathrm{DM}$ is normally very small, increasing with mass until Milky Way-sized galaxies where it reaches $\sim1/30$, then decreasing again. But the dwarf galaxy NGC1052–DF2, seems to contain little or no dark matter. Galaxies of that mass ($M_\star\sim2\times10^8\,M_\odot$) typically has several hundred times more DM than stars. How the galaxy was formed is not known, but the authors speculate on a few different mechanisms that all have to do with the fact that gas, in contrast to DM, may cool and condense and thus form clouds of very high $M_\mathrm{gas}/M_\mathrm{DM}$ ratios: 

The deflection you are looking for is $\sim 1.7$ arc seconds, which should be within the seeing limits at a good site. It should also be within the resolution limits of a telescope with $\ge200$mm diameter primary. Having said that you will not be able to see it with the naked eye, you will need to be able to photography the star field during the eclipse and again when it is visible at night and then do some arduous plate measuring and data reduction to detect the shifts of stars in the field. So amateur equipment is up to detecting the bending of light around the Sun in a total eclipse, but if by witness you mean see the stars move with the naked eye the answer is almost certainly no. 

The atmoshere on Pluto will have very little effect on the apparent size of the Sun, It is negligable compared to that on Earth ($\sim 0.3-1.0 \mbox{ Pa}$ compared to $\sim 10^5 \mbox{ Pa}$, approximately the air pressure at 100 km on the Earth). Now angular size is proportional to the ratio of the objects diameter to its range. At the Earth's distance ($1 \mbox{ AU}$) the Sun subtends about $30'$ of arc. So at Pluto (as it is at a distance from the Sun of between $26.7 \mbox{AU}$ and $49.3 \mbox{AU}$ depending on where in its orbit it is) the Sun will subtend between $30/26.7\approx 1.1'$ and $30/49.3\approx 0.6'$ of arc. Which is close to the resolution of the human eye corresponding to 20/20 vision. 

So, in the figure above, showing observed flux as a function of time, the light in the line increased in luminosity roughly 1.5 days later than the light in the continuum. This means that the BLR is roughly 1.5 lightdays (or ~250 AU) in radius. 

A blackbody spectrum is continuous. As Dean comments, there are no true blackbodies. But this is not really the issue here: It's true that most emitted photons from, say, a star, which is quite close to a blackbody, is the result of some discrete process. E.g. an electron is brought to an excited state by a collision, the atom de-excites, and a photon with the wavelength corresponding to the given transition is emitted. But two mechanisms make the total spectrum of the star truly continuous: 

Here's a drawing that may help understand (edited to take into account the fact that the Universe expands not only along the line of sight, but in all directions — thanks to @Ed Shaya): 

You'll see that galaxies look smaller and smaller the farther there are away, until at a distance of roughly 15 billion lightyears, after which they look larger again. The most distant galaxy observed, GN-z11, is so far away that its light was emitted less than half a billion years after the Big Bang. With a radius of $0.6\pm0.3\,\mathrm{kpc}$ (Oesch et al. 2016) it still spans 0.15 arcsec, which is resolvable by HST. Decreasing surface brightness Unfortunately, this effect also makes distant galaxies more difficult to detect. A galaxy only emits so much light, so distributing its light over, say, twice the angular diameter, makes it four times less bright. Thus, the problem of observing very distant galaxies is not that they're small, but that they're dim. 

You are comparing apples and oranges. The CMB is like the light from a distant galaxy, which while the galaxy is receding the light approaches us. CMB is the light emitted by universe at recombination. The matter that emitted the CMB is/was receding from us with a very high red-shift. 

The Moon, Mars, Venus are seen against a dark sky using an eye whose aperture is adjusted to the average brightness of the visual field. So bright small sources are over-exposed and so appear bright. Photographs of planetary surfaces are taken with aperture and exposure set for proper exposure. So appear closer to how they would look if they filled your eye's field of view and so the aperture would be set to properly expose the surface. 

We measure the aggregated red-shift of galaxies not single stars, which averages out the motion of the stars within the galaxy. This leaves us with the proper motion of the galaxy to deal with, which can be estimated from the red-shifts of other galaxies in the same group/cluster/super-cluster and their distribution. But this is all moot at high red-shift since proper motions become small compared to the Hubble flow.
