What has not been said is that if $X$ is path connected and has a universal cover, then the fundamental groupoid $\pi_1(X)$ can be given a topology so that the source map $s:\pi_1 (X) \to X$ is a bundle over $X$ with fibre over $x \in X$ the universal cover of $X$ based at $x$: see Chapter 10 of Topology and Groupoids. This has been known for a long time. 

An action of a groupoid on another groupoid was defined in my paper "Groupoids as coefficients" Proc LMS (3) 25 (1972) 413-426, available here, which also uses methods of fibrations of groupoids. The term "coefficients" refers to nonabelian cohomology. This paper uses the term "split extension" instead of semidirect product. The more modern term is used given an action of a group on a groupoid in the book Topology and Groupoids, where it is relevant to the explicit description of orbit groupoids. Note that if a group acts on a space $X$, then it has an induced action on the fundamental groupoid $\pi_1 X$, and also on the groupoid $\pi_1(X,A)$ for any set $A$ of base points which is a union of orbits. 

This question is related to the notion of proper map, of which there is quite a lot in Bourbaki and also in my book `Topology and groupoids'. Note the elegant Bourbaki definition: a map $f: X \to Y$ is proper if for all spaces $Z$ the map $$f \times 1_Z: X \times Z \to Y \times Z$$ is a closed map. Once I was teaching a second year course in analysis and realised how nice were the proofs involving sequences. So I started looking at questions like `what is the one point sequential compactification?' (add an extra point to which the non convergent sequences converge!). It all worked out quite well and was published as [12]. ``Sequentially proper maps and a sequential compactification'', J. London Math Soc. (2) 7 (1973) 515-522. 

The more general question is whether pullbacks and colimits commute. This is true if the category $\mathcal C$ is locally cartesian closed, i.e. every slice category $\mathcal C /c$ of objects over a given object $c$ of $\mathcal C$ is cartesian closed. For then pullback has a right adjoint. These ideas are of interest in the topological case, though even if $\mathcal C$ is a convenient category of spaces, the categories $\mathcal C/c$ are not always cartesian closed. Nonetheless, the use of such categories was initiated by R. Thom and continued by Peter Booth, see for example: Booth, Peter I. A unified treatment of some basic problems in homotopy theory. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 79 (1973), 331–336. and his related papers: these ideas were also taken up by Ioan James under the term "Fibrewise topology", see Crabb, Michael; James, Ioan; Fibrewise homotopy theory. Springer Monographs in Mathematics. Springer-Verlag London, Ltd., London, 1998. There is a paper Johnstone, P. T. On a topological topos. Proc. London Math. Soc. (3) 38 (1979), no. 2, 237–271. giving a locally cartesian closed category, in fact a topos, with sequential spaces as a reflective subcategory, but this has not yet been used in algebraic opology, to my knowledge. August 19, 2014 A doctoral thesis in this area, "Topos Theoretic Methods in General Topology" by Hamed Harasani, Bangor 1988. is available here. 

I'm not sure the literature is entirely consistent on the use of these terms. Here are some ideas I learned from Jean Pradines' explanations in 1981 in Toulouse of his note 

Here are some references: Theorem 4.4 on p.40 of: Giraud, Jean Méthode de la descente. Bull. Soc. Math. France Mém. 2 1964 which is available from Numdam. The result was rediscovered by F. Conduché, F. Conduché, Au sujet de l'existence d'adjoints à droite aux foncteurs "image réciproque" dans la catégorie des catégories, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 275 (1972), A891–894. and developed for crossed complexes in Howie, James Pullback functors and crossed complexes. Cahiers Topologie Géom. Différentielle 20 (1979), no. 3, 281–296. See also Bunge, Marta; Niefield, Susan Exponentiability and single universes J. Pure Appl. Algebra 148 (2000), no. 3, 217–250. Update: I'd like to add an amusing application of the result on fibrations of groupoids and pullbacks. An epimorphism of groups, say $p: E \to B$, is a special case of a fibration of groupoids. So the pullback functor $p^*$ from groupoids over $B$ to groupoids over $E$ preserves colimits. Now the inclusion of categories $\mathbf{ Groups} \to \mathbf{ Groupoids} \;\;$ preserves colimits of connected diagrams. It follows that the pullback functor $p^*: \mathbf{ Groups}/B \to \mathbf{ Groups}/E\;\; $ preserves colimits of connected diagrams. In particular, it preserves pushouts. (This was published with P.R. Heath in "Lifting amalgamated sums and other colimits of groups and topological groups'', Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 102 (1987) 273-280.) 

the first of his 4 notes introducing the relation between Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids. The ideas for the first note were written up in detail in various work by research students at Bangor, with the full knowledge of Pradines. (Kirill Mackenzie worked quite independently on the succeeding theory of Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids, published in his 1987 book.) Intuitively, non trivial holonomy may be explained as an iteration of local procedures which return to the starting point with a change of phase. This idea is related to hysteresis, and shows the nice relation with physics. The problem is to define rigorously all the terms used in this explanation! A Monodromy Principle is enunciated in Chevalley's famous book ``Lie groups"; the Principle may be explained as giving an extension of a restriction of a local morphism to a morphism on a simply connected cover. In foliation theory, it is usual to define a monodromy groupoid as the disjoint union of the fundamental groupoids of the leaves, with a topology reflecting the local structure of the foliation; and to define the holonomy groupoid as a quotient of the monodromy groupoid. However this does not easily yield a Monodromy Principle. Pradines' idea for his Th\'eor`eme 2 in the Note was to use the Monodromy Principle as guiding the construction of a Monodromy Groupoid of a Lie groupoid, generalising the universal cover of a connected Lie group. So, given a neighbourhood $W$ of the identities of a Lie groupoid, one forms the groupoid $M(W)$ which is universal for all local morphisms of $W$ into groupoids. The problem is to define an appropriate topology on $M(W)$ and Pradines solves this using a notion of holonomy groupoid, although in this case the holonomy is trivial (!). In the case of a Lie group $G$, the topology on $G$ is defined by a neighbourhood of the identity satisfying some reasonable conditions given in, for example, Bourbaki. Now one can define a local Lie groupoid to be a groupoid $G$ with a set $W$ containing the identities and satisfying a number of reasonable conditions. However it is no longer true that the topology of $W$ extends to a topology on $G$ making it a Lie groupoid. Instead there is, under reasonable conditions, a Holonomy Groupoid $Hol(G,W)$ which projects to $G$ and which has a Lie groupoid structure locally like $W$. The construction of Pradines is written up in: 

Of course covering morphisms of groupoids are special cases of fibrations. I thought homotopy colimits are put together from various kinds of colimits; if so that ought to do the job. Arguments of this type are used in R. Brown and R. Street, `Covering morphisms of crossed complexes and of cubical omega-groupoids are closed under tensor product', Cah. Top. G\'eom. Diff. Cat., 52 (2011) 188-208. 

Such a $T$-complex is of rank $\leqslant n$ if all elements of dimension $>n$ are thin. Keith showed that simplicial $T$-complexes of rank 1 are equivalent to groupoids, and those of rank 2 are equivalent to crossed modules (over groupoids). The story was completed by Nick Ashley in 1978 who showed that simplicial $T$-complexes are equivalent to crossed complexes. Full references are given on the nlab. The corresponding result for groupoids had an earlier airing in the paper: Levi, F. W. Darstellung der Komposition in einer Gruppe als Relation. Arch. Math. (Basel) 8 (1957), 169–170. Update: I recommend you draw a diagram of a 3-simplex, label all the edges, interpret "thin" for a 2-simplex to mean "commutative boundary", and then consider the third axiom for thin elements in relation to associativity. This connection of the tetrahedron with associativity is well known in homological algebra. 

The question reminds me of the idea behind David W. Jones's 1984 Bangor thesis on "Poly-T-complexes" available here, as follows: we have globular sets, simplicial sets, cubical sets, but what is wrong with pentagons, and why is there a prejudice against rhombic dodecahedra? Also the part of geometric group theory known as "van Kampen diagrams" uses complicated 2-dimensional diagrams to deduce consequences of relations. There are also families of polyhedra such as Stasheff polyhedra. David defined quite general "cone complexes" with a shelling criterion to avoid some wild examples. In order to model some group theory, and to define polyhedral sets, he also defined "marked cone complexes"; this allows the modelling of the relations $ x^3=1 $, $ xyx=yxy $, for example. It turned out recently that the notion of marked complex is equivalent to that of the later defined "discrete vector field" on a complex, for which a web search shows many publications. See the published version Jones, D.W. A general theory of polyhedral sets and the corresponding $T$-complexes. Dissertationes Math. (Rozprawy Mat.) 266 (1988) 110. 

I think there is a subquestion, or related (!) question, namely why is there little functional analysis of partial functions? Teaching real analysis to students makes it clear that it is all about partial functions $\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ , each of which has a domain and range, which we often want to know. Now the solutions of differential equations with a parameter are often regarded as smooth in the parameter, but usually only with fixed domain. For example it is reasonable to suggest that the family of partial functions $f_y: x \mapsto \log(x+y)$ varies continuously with $y$, but of course the domain varies with $y$, so the answer is not so clear, especially if you suggest, why not?, that $f_y$ is, or should be, a smooth function of $y$. Actually a web search on "partial functions" gives quite lot of hits, but I am not sure of anything definitive. 

I would just like to mention that this question has topological relevance, as shown in R. Brown ``Coproducts of crossed $P$-modules: applications to second homotopy groups and to the homology of groups'', Topology 23 (1984) 337-345. Denote the classifying space of a group $G$ by $BG$. Given normal subgroups $M,N$ of $G$ one can form the space $X$ as the homotopy pushout (i.e. double mapping cylinder) of the two maps $BG \to B(G/M), BG \to B(G/N)$. Then the second homotopy group of $X$ is isomorphic to $$(M \cap N)/ [M,N] . $$ Actually the result of the paper says more, namely that the homotopy 2-type of $X$ is described by the crossed module $M \circ N \to G$ where $\circ$ is the coproduct of the title of the paper. It is feasible that the question asked could be helped by an analysis of this coproduct. (Note that normal subgroups of a group are special cases of crossed modules.) 

The book partially titled Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAT) (pdf available) has an extensive treatment of crossed modules and their role in cohomology and in homotopy classification. A main difference from standard homological algebra texts is the use of crossed complexes and of free crossed resolutions of groups. In particular, some seemingly complicated cocycle conditions turn out to be related to a boundary rule in a standard free crossed complex; so the rule you give does, with the appropriate conventions, become $c\delta =0$. Background is given in the exposition `Groupoids and crossed objects in algebraic topology',Homology, homotopy and applications, 1 (1999) 1-78, available here. This contains some calculations of the $k$-invariants of some crossed modules. Further calculations are available in the paper G. Ellis and Le Van Luyen, "Homotopy 2-types of low order", available from the preprint list of Graham Ellis. 

suggest that the making of mathematics is a natural human activity, part and parcel of the usual methods by which man has explored, discovered, and understood the world; present each item with a purpose and context, and not just because it was something that could be shown or demonstrated; convey an impression of some of the key methods by which mathematics works; show mathematics in the context of history, art, technology and other applications. 

It may be useful to note in relation to the work of Forman that his notion of discrete vector field on a complex is equivalent to the notion of marked cone complex in David W. Jones' 1984 PhD thesis on Poly T-complexes available from here, also published as "A general theory of polyhedral sets and the corresponding $T$-complexes" Dissertationes Math. (Rozprawy Mat.) 266 (1988) 110. So it would be interesting if this is related also to Skoldberg's work. 

I used pullbacks and pushouts, or pushforwards, for years (decades!) before realising the nice context in terms of fibrations and cofibrations of categories, and so this context got written up in the paper "Algebraic colimit calculations in homotopy theory using fibred and cofibred categories", with general matter based on notes of Thomas Streicher, and so Benabou, but with a few new simple results. Thus I find it helpful to see the adjointness result you give as Thm and ask about as a special case of a standard and more general result, when you have, in essence, pullbacks and pushouts, see Proposition 3.6 of our paper. This should illustrate the principle that a more general result may be easier to prove, because one is not confused by the special situation. I have not checked this in your case and would like to hear if it is so! 

You might like to look at the article "Making a mathematical exhibition" $URL$ With regard to content we agreed that the aims were to: 

I mention this paper "Groupoids and Faa di Bruno formulae for Green functions in bialgebras of trees" which uses groupoids and homotopy orbits. @Qiaochu : Another aspect of the last example given in your answer is that the fundamental groupoid on two points of the orbit space comes out nicely from the notion of orbit groupoid $\Gamma//G$ given by the action of a group $G$ on a groupoid $\Gamma$, as discussed in Chapter 11 of Topology and Groupoids. An older version of this chapter is available as arXiv:math/0212271. One example computed there is the fundamental group of the symmetric square of a space $X$: under reasonable conditions, it is the fundamental group of $X$ made abelian. 

Just an idle thought: could involutive bases be relevant to this area? See for example papers by Gerdt available on the arXiv. 

Have a look at the exhibition on knots on $URL$ . I have used this and other material for talks advertised as "How mathematics gets into knots" for ages 8-80: I was then criticised for suggesting one should stop at 80! The material I used in a recent general lecture in Kansas (see my my preprint page) on the Dirac string trick, and the related belt trick and Phillipine wine trick, and on the pentoil, can be done for any age; it is essential to involve the audience in doing the tricks, or demos. One can also do addition of knots, and analogies between knots and numbers, getting over the point that while knots and numbers are quite different, the relations between knots can be analogous to the relations between numbers. Note also that my apparatus for the Dirac String Trick was home made: two piece of board, coloured ribbon, bulldog clips to attach the ribbon (in case it gets too tangled). My pentoil was made in a science workshop from copper tubing. In giving such a presentation to children and teachers once, a teacher came up to me afterwards and said:"That is the first time in my mathematical career that anyone has used the word "analogy" in relation to mathematics!" Thus a real concern is that there is so little discussion about mathematics, and its context.
