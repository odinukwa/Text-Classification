Given a monoid $C$ acting (from the right) on a set $M$, there is a bar construction giving a simplicial set or equivalently a translation/action category, $$ N_\bullet (M\rtimes C)= \cdots M\times C^2 \Rrightarrow M\times C ⇉^s_t M, \quad \text{with } s(m,c)=mc, t(m,c)=m. $$ There is a natural morphism of simplicial sets $N_\bullet (M\rtimes C)\to N_\bullet (*\rtimes C)$. One may argue that the correct quotient of $M$ by the $C$ action is this bar construction (cf. Thomason’s homotopy colimit theorem). Now consider weak monoidal category $C$ coherent action on a category $M$. That is, there is an action functor $M\times C\to M$, unit and associative up to coherent invertible natural transformations. We imitate the bar construction $$ \cdots M\times C^2\Rrightarrow M\times C ⇉^s_t M. $$ But in this case simplicial identities hold up to invertible natural transformations. Jardine's supercoherence theorem implies that we obtain a pseudo-simplicial categories, that is a pseudo functor $\Delta^{op}\to Cats$. Applying then the Grothendieck construction, we obtain a category which is a pseudo colimit of this simplicial diagram. This may be regard as the (homotopy) quotient of $M$ by the $C$ action. There is another construction like the geometric nerve of a bicategory. Viewing $C$ as a one object, say $*$, bicategory. Imaging the object of $M$ as arrows $0\leftarrow *$, arrows of $M$ as 2-cells. Then the action functor works like composition in a bicategory. Now form a simplicial set with $X_0=M_0$, that is arrows $0\leftarrow *$. Let $X_1$ be the set of 2-commutative triangles with vertex $(0,*,*)$, that is the set of $(m, c, \alpha)$, where $m\in M, c\in C$ and $\alpha$ is an arrow in $M$ with target $mc$. Let $X_2$ be 2-commutaitve 3-simplex $(0,*,*,*)$, and so on. We obtain a simplicial set $X$. (It is clear that if $M$ is a set and $C$ is a monoid, $X$ is the bar construction.) My question: whether $X$ and the one given by Grothendieck construction have the same homotopy type? They both have a map to (the nverve of one obect bicategory) $C$, thus a commutative triangle up to homotopy? Possible relevant result, it is shown that the geometric nerve and pseudo-nerve of a bicategory has the same homotopy type. However this does not answer the question directly. 

Let $G$ be a finite abelian $p$-group. What is known about the minimal number of generators of a $p$-sylow of $Aut(G)$? is it bounded in terms of $d(G)$ the minimal number of generators of $G$ (and perhaps $p$)? 

Let $G$ be a group of odd order. It is known that if every central automophism of $G$ acts trivially on the center, then $G$ is purely non-abelain, this amounts to saying that every central endomorphism $u$ of $G$ (an endomorphism such that $x^{-1}u(x) \in Z(G)$, for all $x \in G$) is an automorphism. I could generalize this (using some ring theory) to the case of the automorphisms acting trivially on a quotient of an abelain normal subgroup: Let $A$ be an abelian normal subgroup of $G$. If every automorphism of $G$ acting trivially on $G/A$ leaves $A$ elementwise fixed, then every endomorphism of $G$ acting trivially on $G/A$ is an automorphism. I wonder if one can see a straightforward purely group theoretic proof of this result. Thanks in advance. 

If such a $G$ exist, then clearly $q$ should be greater than $p$. Less trivial, $q \mod p$ should not generate $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$. 

Let $G$ be a group. Let us say that $G$ satisfies a generalized identity of degree $n$ if there exist $a_1,a_2,\dots a_n \in G$ such that $$x^{a_1}x^{a_2}\dots x^{a_n}=1,$$ for all $x\in G$. 

Could you point where did I make mistake(s)? I think the second is wrong, but I can not tell why. Thanks in advance. 

I got a proof, slightly modified after talking to a friend. Thanks @Tim and @Harry. We prove a stronger statement: any inner horn $\Lambda^n_i$ can be retracted to $\Delta^{n-1}\cup_{\{n-1\}} \Delta^1\{ n-1, n \}$, then by induction the statement follows. To this end, we claim that $\Lambda^n_i$ admits an inner horn retraction to $\Delta^{n-1} \cup_{ \Delta^{n-2}\{1,\cdots,n-1\} } \Delta^{n-1}\{1,\cdots n \} $, then the stronger statement follows also by induction. To prove the claim, noticing that $\Delta^{n-1} \cup_{ \Delta^{n-2}\{1,\cdots,n-1\} } \Delta^{n-1}\{1,\cdots n \}\hookrightarrow \Lambda^n_i$ is a trivial cofibration, therefore $\Lambda^n_i$ admits a retraction to $\Delta^{n-1} \cup_{ \Delta^{n-2}\{1,\cdots,n-1\} } \Delta^{n-1}\{1,\cdots n \} $. But each step is retracting a horn containing $ \{0 ,n \}$, thus an inner horn retraction. 

It was J.F. Jardine established the so called supercoherence theory in Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra Volume 75, Issue 2, 18 October 1991, Pages 103–194. The result can be roughly stated as follows: 

I can show it by hand, the question is how to show this assertion more abstractly? (It seems related to decent theory?) Thanks a lot. 

To put it in another way. Let $M$ be a manifold and $D=\{x\in R| x^2=0\} $ be the infinitesimal line in synthetic geometry, then $Map(D, M)$ is the tangent bundle, where $Map$ denotes the internal hom. Applying twice we get $Map(D^2, M)$, which is the twiced tangent bundle. The second argument translate to 

First of all, please excuse my English. I'm not native Englsih speaker, so you will see so many grammer mistakes, I just only hope that my mistkae wouldn't effect what I want to mean. Hi, recently I'm taking graduate course Algebraic Topology, with text Bott and Tu, "Differential Forms in Algebriac Topology." I think this text is really great, but I'm having hard time with some minor (I think) problems and details. By background in this field is just first two chapter of Hatcher's Algebraic Topology book. So I'm studying cohomology first time with this book. 

On page 63p. Can anyone give me the construction of homotopy operator $$K : \Omega^\ast_{cv}(M \times \mathbb{R}^n) \rightarrow \Omega^{\ast-1}_{cv}(M\times \mathbb{R}^n)$$ For type (II) case I found that $$\pi^\ast \phi f(x,t) dt_1\cdots dt_n \mapsto \pi^\ast \sum_i (-1)^{i-1} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{t_i} f(x,t) dt_i\right) dt_{1\cdots \hat{i},\cdots n} - \pi^\ast\phi\sum_i (-1)^{i-1} \left(\int_{-\infty}^{t_i}e(t)dt_i\right) \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}f(x,t)dt_{1\cdots n} \right)dt_{1\cdots \hat{i}\cdots n} $$ But I don't know how to define this kind thing to Type (I). On page 75 Example 6.44.1, Finding transition function was not hard, But I don't know how to directly use equation (6.38). Isn't this equation only valid only when we reduced the structure group into $SO(2)$?. I cannot see how the function $g_{01} = z$ means rotating angle. I also want to know what dose integration of euler class over base space means. I think this is only possible if the rank of bundle is equal to the dimension of base space. Well, actually I found something in wikipedia and lecture notes that it is related with self intersection number, but I cannot find any published text book. Last question is about the motivation of compact vertical cohomology and its Poincare duality. When I first saw definition of deRham cohomology was not weird, which means, it as natural enough for me. But deRham cohomology with compact support was not to natural at first time. After I see Poincare duality on this book, the assumption 'compact support' seem to assumed to make interal well defined. I think this conclusion is fair enough because, at least until now, everytime when I faced with function with compact support, there was integral with it. When I first saw a definition of compact vertical cohomology, I thought we are trying to integrate a form in fiber direction, and that was exactly the flow of this book. But still, the definition was not clear to me. If we want to integrate a form in a direcion of fiber, why do we need a assumption that the form should have compact support on the preimage of compact set? So with this kind of view, the definition of compact vertical cohomology looked like we want to do integrate a form over preimage of compact set i.e. for a rank $n$ vector bundle over $m$-manifold $\pi : E \rightarrow M$ with compact submanifold $K^k \subset M$, let me denote $i: \pi^{-1}(K) = E|_K \rightarrow E $. Then with compactly supported in vertical direction form $\omega \in \Omega^{k+n}_cv (E)$ the integral is well defined, $$\int_{E|_K} i^\ast \omega.$$ While, the Poincare duality tells us there is some kind of duality between submanifold and cohomology. In this book, I felt that deRham cohomology let me know what kind of submanifold does the manifold have, in this moment let me assume the manifold is finite type and let me use the word effective submanifold. (I mean, circle in the sphere is not interesting one) Similarly, compact cohomology tells us what kind of effective compact submanifold the manifold have. Hence with natural generalization I thougth I can do this kind things with compact vertical cohomology. Above integral gives us an element in $(H^{n+k}_{cv}(E))^\ast$, so I guess there should be something about this kind of Poincare duality. 

Given a finite nilpotent group $G$ and let us denote by $L_n(G)$ the set of left $n$-Engel elements in $G$. Assume that $n$ is the smallest positive integer such that $L_n(G)=G$. Is it true that $G$ is always generated by $G-L_{n-1}(G)$? 

Given a finite group $H$, How can one prove that the equation $Aut(X)=H$ has only finitely many solutions in the class of finite p-groups. (This would be the case if the divisibility conjecture is true : that is the order of a p-group divides the order of its automorphism group) 

Let be $G=F/F^p[F,F,F]$, with $F$ denotes the free group on $n$ generators. Then $G$ satisfies $Z(G) = \Phi (G)=G'$. If $x \in G-Z(G)$ then $C_G(x)= \langle x, Z(G) \rangle$ which is abelian as $C_G(x)/Z(G)$ is cyclic. Now we have your condition (1). For (2) observe that $C_G(x)$ has index $p^{n-1}$ in $G$, whenever $x \notin Z(G)$. You can also consider any non-abelian $p$-groups (of order $>p^3$) with a center of index $p^2$. Clearly, for such a group the centralizer of any non-central element $x$ is a maximal subgroup, so has index $p$. 

Let $G$ be a finite minimally $d$-generated $p$-group. If $G$ is relatively free, that is $G$ is a quotient of the free group $F$ on $d$ generators by a fully invariant subgroup of $F$, then the order of $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ reaches its maximal value $|\Phi(G)|^d|\operatorname{GL}(d,p)|$. I thaink this holds also if $G$ is a quotient of $F$ by a characteristic subgroup. Is the converse true? that is, is true that if $|\operatorname{Aut}(G)|=|\Phi(G)|^d|\operatorname{GL}(d,p)|$, then $G$ is a quotient of the free group on $d$ generators by a characteristic subgroup? Thanks in advance.
