Here's how I explain Steenrod squares to geometers. First, if $X$ is a manifold of dimension $d$ then one can produce classes in $H^n(X)$ by proper maps $f: V \to X$ where $V$ is a manifold of dimension $d-n$ through many possible formalisms - eg. intersection theory (the value on a transverse $i$-cycle is the count of intersection points), or using the fundamental class in locally finite homology and duality, or Thom classes, or as the pushforward $ f_*(1) $ where $1$ is the unit class in $H^0(V)$. Taking this last approach, suppose $f$ is an immersion and thus has a normal bundle $\nu$. If $x = f_*(1) \in H^n(X)$ then $Sq^i(x) = f_*(w_i(\nu))$. This is essentially the Wu formula. That is, if cohomology classes are represented by submanifolds, and for example cup product reflects intersection data, then Steenrod squares remember normal bundle data. 

I have been trying to make sure that my daughter hears me say with some frequency "I don't know (but I'm curious)" and "I'm wrong (but I'd like to know what's right)," since that's the best way for her to learn to say these things when appropriate. Looking in the big picture well beyond math, the world would be a better place if people would say those things more frequently. But math is one of the best places to come to terms with these sentiments (which is one of the many reasons some people dislike it). Children are sometimes OK with not knowing, but hate being wrong. I don't want my daughter to have the impression that I know everything, so I'm really happy when she asks science questions I don't have good answers for. That's not going to happen in math for a while, but I will sometimes intentionally lead her astray and push along until she catches me - that has a big element of fun to it (she gives me these looks when she starts to suspect me) and catching me being wrong is a step, I think, in her developing the ability to catch her own mistakes. 

John, your question is an advertisement for Johann Sigurdsson's thesis and our book ``Parametrized homotopy theory'', $URL$ which is where the results of his thesis appear. Section 6.1 there explains many of the pitfalls of the obvious model structure that you start with in your question, which we call the q-model structure. Following James, we call your retractive spaces "ex-spaces''. Johann's thesis gives a new model structure which we call the $qf$-model structure, starting with a $qf$-model structure on spaces over the given base space $X$, rather than the $q$-model structure on spaces, and going from there to ex-spaces. The rest of Chapter 6, pages 100-108, is devoted to proofs and explanations of that model structure and its properties. That is probably too lengthy to summarize here. The model structure does have the same weak equivalences, and it is cofibrantly generated. As you expect, the subtlety is in the precise definition of the generating cells, and that is really subtle and entirely due to Johann. Of course, you must restrict to quite special generating cells, and this does raise problems, forcing us to introduce some variant model structures in Chapter 7. The identity functor is a Quillen equivalence from the $qf$-model structure to the $q$-model structure, so the homotopy category is what you want. Incidentally, we generalize to the equivariant context in Chapter 7. Edit: In light of the comments, here are my grounds for skepticism, from first principles. Given an adjunction $(L,R)$ between categories $\mathcal C$ and $\mathcal D$ and a cofibrantly generated model structure on $\mathcal C$ with generating sets of cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations $I$ and $J$, the natural way to try to construct a model structure on $\mathcal D$ is to let $R$ create the weak equivalences and fibrations and to take $LI$ and $LJ$ as generating sets. Formally, the maps that satisfy the RLP wrt $LI$ are then the acyclic maps that satisfy the RLP wrt $LJ$. I know of no examples where the same conclusion holds defining acyclicity in terms of a different class of weak equivalences. The relevance is that (modulo basepoint details) John starts with the adjunction $(r^*,Sec(X,-))$ between ex-spaces over $X$ and based spaces. His proposed fibrations are created by $Sec(X,-)$, and his proposed generating sets are $r^*I$ and $r^*J$. However, his proposed weak equivalences are not the weak equivalences created by $Sec(X,-)$ but rather the maps that are weak equivalences on total spaces. 

Parallel to the OP's two examples, if a cohomology class is defined through intersection with a submanifold (or subvariety with fundamental class in locally finite homology) then the pushforward is defined through intersection with the image of this subvariety. Note how immediate it is to see the change in codimension ( while codimension is constant when taking preimage, which corresponds to the natural map). As others have said, collapse maps can be used to define pushforwards in general. But having models for pushforwards counts towards understanding a particular cohomology theory geometrically. So for example if you can find a good model for the pushforward of tmf then "you'll win a prize" 

First an important distinction: "Each element in $\pi_3(\vee S^2)$ has description in terms of linking number of point preimages (circles in $S^3$) of map $S^3 \to S^2$" is not a fully correct statement. What has a description in terms of such linking numbers is $Hom(\pi_3(\vee S^2), Z).$ As you say, $\pi_3(\vee S^2)$ itself is described as generated by Whitehead products and $\pi_3(M)$ is a quotient of this. Dually, $Hom(\pi_3(M), Z)$ will consist of a sub-module of these linking numbers, and if you want you can make it more geometric. For any collection of closed two-dimensional cochains $\{ \alpha_i, \beta_i \}$ such that $\sum \alpha_i \smile \beta_i= d \theta$ one can form the generalized linking number which to some $f : S^3 \to S^2$ evaluates the "integral" $\int_{S^3} [ \sum f^* \alpha_i \smile d^{-1} f^* \beta_i - f^* \theta]$. Here $\int_{S^3}$ is evaluation on the fundamental class of $S^3$ and $d^{-1} f^* \beta_i$ indicates a choice of $1$-cochain which cobounds $f^* \beta_i$. If the $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ are Poincare dual to codimension two submanifolds of $M$ this will be a linking number (with "correction" by the $\theta_i$) of the preimages of those submanifolds. So far, this is just addressing $\pi_3$. But in recent work Ben Walter and I generalize such "linking numbers" and show that the resulting collection yields a finite-index subgroup of $Hom(\pi_n(X), Z)$ for all $n$ for simply connected $X$. One can take the formulae there - in this case one will need to go to "weight two" - and translate them into geometric terms as I did for $\pi_3$ above. We give a number of examples, and I'd be happy to provide closer analysis for simply connected $M^4$ if you think what we do is relevant and I understood better what you're looking for. The caveats are that we are representing functionals on homotopy groups rather than homotopy groups themselves, and what we can do about torsion is very limited (but is likely to suffice in this case). 

This is really just a comment, but a bit too long. Thanks Tyler. Ulrich, that is a good question. I once worked hard to understand the zeroth space of MU (and more simply BP), one prime at a time, calculating Dyer Lashof operations. I threw away my notes because the answers I was getting seemed unhelpful. I seem to recall a paper of Steve Wilson that considers the Hopf ring of BP_0, but my memory may be failing me. The problem is that these spaces are very large and seem to have nothing like the economical and intuitive description of their K-theory analogues. It could be a good problem to try to understand what these infinite loop spaces really look like and what they mean geometrically. A short modern summary of early work on GL_1(R), alias FR, in general is in [114] on my web page. There is work in progress by John Lind that makes honest the idea that BGL_1R is a classifying space for a reasonably concrete kind of ``principal GL_1R-bundle''. 

Ben Walter and I make the functors $\Gamma$ and $A$ more explicit, by using an explicit model for the cofree Lie Coalgebra functor, in this paper. We do not discuss the application to $\infty$-algebras as Bruno does in much greater generality. (We were interested in using explicit models to be able to compute, in particular in the long exact sequence of a fibration as we do in a sequel to this paper on Hopf invariants.) 

Here's how I explain Steenrod squares to geometers. First, if $X$ is a manifold of dimension $d$ then one can produce classes in $H^n(X)$ by proper maps $f: V \to X$ where $V$ is a manifold of dimension $d-n$ through many possible formalisms - eg. intersection theory (the value on a transverse $n$-cycle is the count of intersection points), or using the fundamental class in locally finite homology and duality, or Thom classes, or as the pushforward $ f_*(1)$ where $1$ is the unit class in $H^0(V)$. Taking this last approach, suppose $f$ is an immersion and thus has a normal bundle $\nu$. If $x = f_*(1) \in H^n(X)$ then $Sq^i(x) = f_*(w_i(\nu))$. This is essentially the Wu formula. That is, if cohomology classes are represented by submanifolds, and for example cup product reflects intersection data, then Steenrod squares remember normal bundle data. 

I haven't thought about this hard (no time) but here are quick observations. Your homotopy colimit is the bar construction $B(\ast,K,X)$, the geometric realization of the simplicial space with $n$-simplices $B_n(\ast,K,X)$, as you state. The map $X(k) \to B(\ast,K,X)$ you are interested in is the geometric realization of the map from the constant simplicial space at $X(k)$ to $B_*(\ast, K, X)$ that identifies $X(k)$ with the subspace of $B_n(\ast,K,X)$ that sees only identity maps of the object $k$. Homotopy pullbacks of diagrams one leg of which is a (Hurewicz) fibration are equivalent to actual pullbacks, so one approach might be to try to prove that $B(\ast,K,X) \to B(\ast,K,Y)$ is a fibration. It is standard that geometric realization of simplicial spaces preserves pullbacks (takes levelwise pullbacks to pullbacks). A variation on the theme of replacing maps by fibrations should convince you that geometric realization also preserves homotopy pullbacks (takes levelwise homotopy pullbacks to homotopy pullbacks). So you would like your map to be the realization of a levelwise homotopy pullback. However, your stated hypothesis feels wrong to me, since it does not take the topology on the category K into account. Your hypothesis presumably should say that the evident square with upper left corner $K(\ell,k)$ and lower right corner $Map(X(k),Y(\ell))$ is a homotopy pullback. Assuming that, you should be able to prove that your map of simplicial spaces is a levelwise homotopy pullback, and then you would be done. Hope that helps a bit. 

Consider a bipartite graph of order $2n$ with equal bipartitions $C_1$ and $C_2$, where, $$C_i = \{v_{i,1}, v_{i,2}, v_{i,3} \dots v_{i,n}\}; i = 1, 2.$$ Given two vertices $v_{i,p}$ and $v_{i,q}$, $Nbd(v_{i,p}, v_{i,q})$ denotes set vertices adjacent to both $v_{i,p}$ and $v_{i,q}$ with $1 \le p,q \le n$. Indexes $p$ and $q$ may or may not be equal. We denote cardinallity of $Nbd(v_{i,p}, v_{i,q})$ by $\#(Nbd(v_{i,p}, v_{i,q}))$. I want to calculate number of bipartite graphs, such that, $$\#(Nbd(v_{1,p}, v_{1,q})) = \#(Nbd(v_{2,p}, v_{2,q})) ~\forall~ p,q ~\text{with}~ 1 \le p,q \le n.$$ To construct all these graphs, I am also looking for an existing algorithm, if available. 

I am trying to calculate the Laplacian and Adjacency matrix of a graphs for positive and negative weights. If a graph be simple with only non-negative weight it is easier. But in my graph I have some negative weights and loops. Please give me some references and hints if available. Thank you for your help. 

ps: I really don't like ``if you really must ...''. There are serious advantages to working in a model category in which every object is fibrant, and, related to that, both for theory and computations it is very helpful to have a clean zeroth space functor from spectra to highly structured spaces. 

The general question is indeed hard, but in view of Anton's side question to Dylan about compact Lie groups, I feel compelled to advertise a beautiful old result of John Hubbuck that everyone should know: If $X$ is a connected finite CW complex and a homotopy commutative $H$-space, then $X$ is homotopy equivalent (as an $H$-space) to a torus. The reference is: J.R. Hubbuck. On homotopy commutative H-spaces. Topology 8 1969 119–126. Thus the original question trivializes unless $X$ is infinite dimensional. 

Why would anything computationally useful be obsolete? Massey products and Toda brackets are intrinsic to stable homotopy theory. It is guaranteed in advance that every element of $E_2$ of the classical Adams spectral sequence (for the homotopy groups of spheres, a similar statement holds more generally for the ASS computing maps between spectra) above the $s=1$ line is decomposable in terms of matric Massey products. Similarly, every element of the stable homotopy groups of spheres is decomposable in terms of matric Toda brackets built from the Hopf invariant one elements. Drew's comments are on the mark: few people nowadays do these kinds of calculations, or know how to do them, which is a pity. We still know relatively little about concrete calculations of stable homotopy groups. These operations are complementary to, not in competition with, Steenrod operations and their related homotopy operations (see e.g. Bruner's contributions to $H_{\infty}$ ring spectra and their applications''). 

For a given number of nodes how many non-isomorphic graphs are available? Might be this is an open problem. For less number of vertices some computational statistics available. I want to get all non-isomorphic graphs of order $5, 6, \dots 12$. Is there any complete list of all non isomorphic graphs available for a given number of nodes? If possible please give me its links or some references. If I wish to calculate it myself, which software package may be useful? 

Two graphs are said to be cospectral if they have same eigenvalues wrt adjacency matrix, Normalised or Signless laplacian matrix. How many graphs has cospectral mates for a given number of nodes? We know answer to this question when number of nodes is less than $12$. I did not see any research paper till now where author has shown any algorithmic approach to compute those statistics. Either it is too simple to say or they do not wish to disclose it. For a given number of nodes I like to compute number of graphs with at least one cospectral mate. Is there any algorithmic way to do so? If available please give me some references. Thank you for your help. 

The definition of a fibration by Serre is by far my favorite example. There, if I recall correctly, leaders in the field were actively looking for the right definition and knew that it would "quickly lead to the lifting property." Serre's definition was the lifting property - "quickly" became in no time, by definition! (Sorry, I don't recall and now can't find the exact reference for that approximate quote.) 

Bott and Tu do this completely, in the de Rham theoretic setting of course. Here's an alternate proof I plan to use in singular theory next time I teach this material, which I find slightly more direct than using Thom classes (which require the tubular neighborhood theorem, etc): Definition: Given a collection $S = \{W_i\}$ of submanifolds of a manifold $X$, define the smooth chain complex transverse to $S$, denoted ${C^S}_*(X)$, by using the subgroups of the singular chain groups in which the basis chains $\Delta^n \to X$ are smooth and transverse to all of the $W_i$. Lemma: The inclusion ${C^S}_*(X) \to C_*(X)$ is a quasi-isomorophism, for any such collection $S$. Now if $W \in S$ then "count of intersection with $W$" gives a perfectly well-defined element $\tau_W$ of ${\rm Hom}(C^S_*(X), A)$ and thus by this quasi-isomorphism a well-defined cocycle if the $W$ is proper and has no boundary. It is immediate that this cocycle evaluates on cycles which are represented by closed submanifolds through intersection count. It is also not hard (but takes a bit to work out all the details) to show that the cup product of these cochains (when the submanifolds intersect transversally) is given by the intersection class of their intersection - we compute on the chains which intersect all of $W$, $V$ and $W \cap V$ transversally and reduce to linear settings. Consider for example $W$ the $x$-axis in the plane, $V$ with $y$-axis, and then various $2$-simplices can contain the origin (or not) and have various faces which intersect the axes (or not) all consistent with the formula for cup product. 

The question as asked has been answered, but to understand where bounded below enters the picture, it is helpful to think model categorically (as in Dwyer and Spalinsky or, more recently, chapter 18 of More Concise Algebraic Topology, by Kate Ponto and myself). With the usual model structure (there are others in the latter reference), a chain complex is acyclic and cofibrant if and only if it is a projective object. If it is cofibrant (not necessarily acyclic) then it is degreewise projective. If it is degreewise projective and bounded below, then it is cofibrant. However, it can be acyclic and degreewise projective and yet not cofibrant if it is not bounded below. There is a nice example in the paper [K] that TJ refers to: work over the ring $Z/4$ and take all $P_n$ to be free on one generator, with all differentials given by multiplication by $2$: $P$ is acyclic and degreewise free, but it is not cofibrant and not a projective object. Split exactness rules out such examples and is automatic when $P$ is exact, degreewise projective, and bounded below. Incidentally, the role of $R$-split exactness becomes really interesting model theoretically when $R$ is commutative and not a field and one considers model structures on DG modules over a DG $R$-algebra. There are (at least) six different interesting projective type model structures, and the usual one is arguably not the most useful one (this is a shameless advertisement for a paper in the writing stage by Tobi Barthel, Emily Riehl, and myself).
