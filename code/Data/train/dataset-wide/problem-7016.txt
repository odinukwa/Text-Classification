According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 35% of adults in the United States are obese. I have done much research on the topic of economic policies to reduce obesity (I did a fat tax simulation for my undergraduate capstone thesis). I have run into three proposals: 1) Fat Tax: A fat tax is a tax on fatty foods or on fats themselves. Various papers I read on the topic simulated a tax on certain fatty foods. However, one paper proposed an ad valorem tax on saturated fats which seems like the most effective way to target fats. The biggest problem found with fat taxes is that fatty foods are very inelastic. This means that a tax won't change consumption much, so this doesn't seem like an effective option. 2) Thin Subsidy: A thin subsidy is pretty much the opposite of a fat tax. It subsidizes foods that are considered healthy. In the literature, this option by itself doesn't change behavior much, but a thin subsidy can also be paired with a fat tax. Basically, the government would use all of the revenues from the fat tax to subsidize healthy foods. When paired together, they are more effective than they are separately, but they still are not very effective in reducing calorie intake. 3) Gym Membership Tax Credit: This is a tax credit you can receive if you have a gym membership. I have not seen as much literature on this topic. Intuitively, if the tax credit is equal to or close to being equal to the cost of the membership, then people may have more incentive to get a gym membership. However, if the credit isn't very close to the cost of the membership, it may not cause people to go get memberships. Another problem with this method is that someone may get a membership and simply not go to the gym. I know most gyms have scanners now, so one remedy could be that the tax credit amount could depend on how many days you scan in. Other than these three policies, are there any other policies being discussed to slow the trend of obesity? How effective can a policy be in reducing obesity rates? 

It sounds like you could simply use the Cost Minimization Problem: $$\underset{z_1,...z_N}{min}\sum_{i=1}^N q_iz_i$$ $$s.t.\quad f(z_1,...,z_N)\geq \bar{y}$$ $$z_1,...z_n\geq0$$ Where $z_i$ and $q_i$ are the quantity and price of input $i$, respectively, $\bar{y}$ is some predetermined level of output, and $f(\frac{}{})$ is the production function. A production function relates physical output of a production process to factors of production. Of course, it seems to me that it may be a challenge to characterize a production function for your case. However, the production function can be any function which satisfies the following: 1) Strict Monotonicity: If $ z'>z$ then $f(z')>f(z)$ 2) Quasi-concavity: $V(y)=\{ z:f(x)\geq y\}$ is a convex set 3) $V(y)$ is closed and non-empty 4) $f(z)$ is finite, nonnegative, real valued, and single valued $\forall z\geq 0$ 5) $f(z)$ is a $C^2$ function To be more specific to your case (data is the input and output) the problem reduces to: $$\underset{d_i}{min}\; d_iq+wl+rk$$ $$s.t.\quad f(d_i)\geq \bar{d_o}$$ $$d_i,l,k\geq 0$$ Where $d_i$ is the data used as input, $d_o$ is the data output, $q$ is the price of input data, $w$ is wage, $l$ is labor hours, $r$ is the rental price of capital and $k$ is quantity of capital. Again, this type of production process is foreign to me, so I cannot make an informed suggestion regarding specification of the production function, but maybe someone who is more apt on this site may offer a suggestion. I hope this helps! 

Q.Consider an economy producing a single good by a production function $$Y = min [K, L]$$ where Y is the output of the final good. K and L are input use of capital and labour respectively. Suppose this economy is endowed with 100 units of capital and labour supply is Ls is given by the function Ls = 50w where w is the wage rate. Assuming that all markets are competitive find the equilibrium wage and rental rate. Actually I am having doubt in assessing if the economy would use its full capital endowment. Also how we are going to calculate marginal product of labour and capital for finding wage rate and rental rate. I think if we use isoquants and isocost lines, then optimal solution should come where $$K = L = Y$$. But I think I am missing something, please help. 

While I was studying eighth edition of Mankiw's Macroeconomics, in chapter 9 on Economic Growth(pg. 245), the author mentions : "Some economists have proposed increasing the incentive to save by replacing the current system of income taxation with a system of consumption taxation." Here, the book was discussing on the topic of government policies that affect rate of saving and spur growth. My question is that doesn't this finding contradicts with Second Welfare Theorem in Microeconomics, according to which, the taxation should be on endowments and not on consumption goods so that we can have Pareto Efficient allocation(refer Varian's Intermediate Microeconomics eighth edition Ch. 31, pg 605)? Or am I wrong in superimposing the micro concept over macro? 

Earlier I studied macroeconomics from Blanchard. But now while reading Mankiw's Macroeconomics I found different definition for natural rate of unemployment. According to Blanchard, "the rate of unemployment (and by implication the level of output) that prevails if the price level and the expected price level are equal." (pg. 135, sixth edition) and "The natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment required to keep the inflation rate constant." (pg. 170, sixth edition) But according to Mankiw, "The natural rate is the rate of unemployment toward which the economy gravitates in the long run, given all the labor-market imperfections that impede workers from instantly finding jobs."(pg. 177. eighth edition),i.e., where unemployment rate reaches steady-state, it neither increases or decreases, where rate of job finding is equal to rate of job separation. What is the common ground between all these definitions? Are they different or essentially the same? If so, then how? 

The question basically boils down to whether the inequality below is true or not. $$\bigg|\Delta G\bigg(\frac{1}{1-MPC}\bigg)\bigg|>\bigg|\Delta T\bigg(-\frac{MPC}{1-MPC}\bigg)\bigg|$$ If $\Delta G=\Delta T$, we can divide by either and get $$\bigg|\bigg(\frac{1}{1-MPC}\bigg)\bigg|>\bigg|\bigg(-\frac{MPC}{1-MPC}\bigg)\bigg|$$ If we multiply each side by $1-MPC$ and we evaluate the absolute value, we get $$1>MPC$$ This statement is true, so that implies that the first inequality is true. By this inequality, we know that $\Delta GDP_G>\Delta GDP_T$. Since $\Delta GDP_G<0$ and $\Delta GDP_T>0\implies \Delta GDP<0$ 

My understanding of local non-satiation is that increasing your allocation of one good by a marginal amount increases utility. Suppose your utility takes the following form: $$U(x,y)=x^\alpha y^\beta$$ and your initial endowment is $(0,0)$. Now, if you increase either good without increasing the other, your utility does not increase. Does this mean that your utility is not locally non-satiated? 

Well, when considering the minimal conditions necessary for an allocation to be Pareto optimal we must go to the primitives. First, we need the fact that all agents have rational preferences. What this means is that preferences are complete and transitive. Another thing we need is for preferences to be strictly convex. Let $\succcurlyeq$ be the preference relation "weakly preferred to": $\textbf{(A) Transitivity:}$ Given allocations $x,y,z \in X$, if $x\succcurlyeq y$ and $y\succcurlyeq z$ then $x\succcurlyeq z$ $\textbf{(B) Completeness:}$ Given allocations $x,y\in X$, either $x\succcurlyeq y$ or $y\succcurlyeq x$ or both $(x\sim y)$ $\textbf{(C) Strict Convexity}:\forall\, x,y \in X$ and $\forall \lambda\in[0,1]$ we have: $$\lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda) f(y)>f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y)$$ Also, let $X$ be the set of goods. We need $X$ to be finite. These four axioms are sufficient for the existence of a competitive equilibrium. Now, we must build a bare-bones theoretical market. What we need is the following: $\textbf{(1) Complete Market:}$ Everyone has complete information and there are no transaction costs. $\textbf{(2) Price Taking:}$ There is one price which everyone pays (and by the above statement, everyone knows this price). $\textbf{(3) Locally Non-Satiated Preferences:}$ Basically, giving an agent more of any good will always increase their utility. If we have $(A)-(C)$ and we have a finite number of goods, we will have a competitive equilibrium, and if we have $(1)-(2)$, we have a competitive market. Using these two and $(3)$, we can use the First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics to say that our equilibrium is Pareto optimal. 

Government spending is the spending by the government on goods and services (non-capital goods). This means that the government buying physical capital would not be included in government spending, and would be included in investment spending. 

Assuming the 'correct' salary for an employee is 70k, there's an incentive to offer slightly more. 'Slightly more' because there's some error in estimating the market rate and the costs of getting this wrong are high. I've added a staff churn costs of Â£20k/yr for getting this wrong based on loss of knowledge, morale, recruitment costs and what I refer to as a 'change incentive' for the replacement employee. The change incentive is the amount you must offer a new employee beyond their current rate (market rate?) to discount the loss of familiarity and to take on the risk of joining a new employee. Belief 1 - Underpaying employees is much more costly over the long term once staff churn is taken into account. Belief 2 - the employee has better information about their value - based on them being nearer the information about their skills, positive contributions and self interest in the literal sense. Belief 3 - salary expectation in job adverts are positively skewed to discount against the risk and transaction costs to the employee of change. Nobody switches to an identical salary unless it's a sideways move. Anecdotally, I've heard advice to change jobs every few years in order to raise your salary faster. Humans tend to be unnecessarily risk adverse and you can give yourself a competitive edge by overcoming this bias. Belief 4 - primary information source for market value are job adverts and job offers. These overvalue for the reasons in belief 3. Belief 5 - Protracted and/or aggressive salary negotiation is costly in itself. If there's a big discrepancy it can create feelings of being undervalued. Belief 6 - Employees will be content and thus likely to remain with the company if they feel they are receiving the market rate. Assumptions: the company is otherwise a pleasant place to work. In my particular industry, I'd consider low staff churn rates and high staff morale as being a distinct and powerful competitive advantage. The figure of 20k churn cost is probably conservative. In England, where I live, the cultural norm is for the company to either start the negotiation or more commonly simply state what the pay rise is going to be. This is followed by a period of watching how much they squeak squirm with dissatisfaction. Given the beliefs above and an industry where staff churn is costly, I'm inclined to lean in the other direction and either let them begin the negotiation or even more radically, simply request what their salary should be; as is common for sellers of other types of good. Salary negotiation seems to me to be unique in that the buyer of the good (their labour) dictates the price and then watches to see if the supply vanishes (resigns). Is it an optimal strategy in salary negotiations to let the employee decide?
