I'm playing around with SÃ©rsic profiles, and would like to retrieve the effective (half-light) radius that I put in by integration of the profile. I'm not managing to, so perhaps someone can help me out. I create the profile using astropy: 

This should be a straightforward exercise, but I'm struggling. Help is much appreciated I would like to parameterize a Navarro-Frenk-White profile with one parameter, using the correlation between total mass and the concentration. As a starting point, I have the density in terms of two parameters: the total dark matter mass inside the virial radius $r_{vir}$, and the concentration parameter $c=r_{vir}/r_{s}$: $\rho_{DM}(r) = \frac{M_{DM}}{4\pi A(c)}\frac{1}{r(r_{s}+r)^{2}}$ where the function $A(c)$ is given by $A(c) = \ln{(1+c)} - \frac{c}{1+c} $ Using the correlation between $M_{DM}$ and $c$ (from e.g. Napolitano et al. 2005) $c(M_{DM}) \approx 9.195 \left(\frac{M_{DM}}{h^{-1}10^{12} M_{\odot}} \right)^{-0.094}$ it should then in principle be possible to parameterize $\rho_{DM}$ as a function of $M_{DM}$ only. This is how they do it in e.g. Williams et al. 2009. However, I'm not managing to reproduce that. Sure, given the correlation above, $M_{DM}$ determines $A(c)$, but won't $\rho_{DM}$ still depend on $r_{s}$? 

My question about this is the following: If we know the PSF of a system, and use this to deconvolve the raw image (purpose 1 from the quote above), why would we convolve a model with the PSF to compare it to an image (purpose 2 from the quote)? That is, can't we just compare the original, unconvolved model, with the deconvolved image? In terms of maximizing the information that seems like the way to go. 

I have a 6000px x 4800 px version of this image (reduced & rotated to 480x600 here) that I use for an image slide show. I would like to add the description of each image into the slide show software. On this system the file name is but I suspect I coined that title (it was a long time ago it was downloaded). The original image is 5,150,779 bytes in size. Searching on the smaller, rotated version of the image points to pages like Astronomy Printshop, but there is nothing closely related to NASA in the first pages of the search, and the pages listed did not have much detail (certainly no legend). It might possible to search on the clipped, individual images, but I was hoping to avoid having to do that 88 times.

I'm in doubt whether I should put this in the astronomy or rather the coding exchange, but since my interest goes out to the former I will try my luck here. Suppose I have an image with a certain pixel scale $x$. I would like to rebin this to a larger pixel scale, $y$, but this is not an integer multiple - so I can't say, for instance, that every group of 4 pixels in the original grid will now be one big pixel in the new grid, and average their flux. Rather, I'd like something like i.e. $y=2.3\cdot x$. Is this routinely done in the astronomical community -- and if so, how? 

Crucially to your question I think, you must remember that photons do not experience time and their speed is equal to $c$, the speed of light. Photons are not unaffected by their movement through a gravitational field, mind you: but this shows up as a gravitational redshift (for a time-varying potential), rather than a time delay (other than the slightly elongated path, perhaps). Besides that, the age of the Universe is typically not quite measured as you say, but rather through parameter estimation in e.g. the cosmic microwave background. The effect of gravitational lensing needs to be taken into account for that, but not in the way you presume. Also, remember that an extreme gravitational field such as that of a black hole is relatively rare, and even if it did delay the photon for a 1000 years that is still a tiny fraction of the age we would, according to your way of thinking, infer; the photon would have to encounter a LOT of such black holes for this 'effect' (which does not occur) to have a huge impact. As a general point, you seem to have some (Interstellar-induced?) misconceptions about the universe, but I think that's not for me to address here. 

To answer my own question: no, not that I can find. Here is an attempt to identify them by image search. Let me know if there is an image/legend match that seems wrong. I can upload a higher resolution (466x426 px) version of the image. The images were cropped from the original image when it was oriented so the the 'HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE' message read from the bottom to top of image, and I will try to identify them in the same order. As such, we do 1 column at a time from top to bottom, starting from the right most. The column is marked in red above/below. But first, here is the captioned video created from combining the captions with a video slideshow of the images! Column 1

It's not that oxygen should not be in this state, but rather we had not discovered it (e.g. on other comets). One of the reasons for this is that interstellar O2 is very reactive and quickly reacts to form e.g. H20 and O3. Current models also favoured O2-less comets. Interestingly, the paper you're referring to also mentions the O2 abundance was rather constant over the half year of observation, which hints to the O2 actually being primordial, i.e. from when the solar system condensed. To reconcile these observations with models, a couple of possible solutions are offered: a slightly warmer primordial cloud (from which the solar system formed), or reactions with ices. 

Angular momentum, and in particular the conservation of angular momentum, is of course very relevant in many processes in astrophysics, such as e.g. star- and planet formation, and disk formation in galaxies. The concept of objects spinning up upon collapse is straightforward enough to understand, but this begs the question: where does the primordial angular momentum come from? Tidal interactions between haloes, I suppose? 

In general, better refrain from using 'inflation' unless you're talking about the early Universe-inflation. Rather, the Universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. The crux of this question seems to be in what you call 'the' time. There is no such thing as 'the' time, and I'm not sure what definition of time you're expecting to stop. Time is perfectly well defined in any restframe and will not be affected by the overall expansion of the Universe, at whatever rate.

is there a way to infer the luminosity in X (or Y)? I'm think not because any information on units has fallen out through this definition, but I could be wrong. I'm just not sure how to compute the luminosity straightforwardly otherwise, as this color index is the only output (along with the distance modulus) from an interpolation scheme of stellar templates. Help would be much appreciated. 

This is typically a bit tricky to show because (1) some phases (e.g. the main sequence) are much, much longer lived than other phases and (2) a number of phases are spaced very close together in HR-space. Be that as it may: any elementary text book on stellar structure will guide you through the path of a star through the HR diagram, usually accompanied by pictures. The book by Prialnik on this subject matter, or Ostlie & Carroll, are both excellent. Here is a very crude version of the temporal path through the HR diagram I made some time ago. Numbers show the different phases (2 is MS), colorcoding shows the ages. 

Whimsical question. Similarly, you could reason that someone on a planet far, far away would be holding up a mirror, such that we could see our own reflected past again. Unfortunately, both options are practically infeasible, even if the light would be undistorted and redirected perfectly towards us. Remember that (1) Earth is small, (2) the reflected signal is weak as it is, (3) any object capable of reflecting this back towards us would be a black hole, the closest of which is further away than most known exoplanets, and the signal falls of with $r^{2}$ with $r$ twice (!) the distance to the object doing this lensing. Now, if we somehow were able to observe it anyway, it would be straightforward enough to estimate the look back time - the distance to the lens would presumably be fairly well known. How bright it would have to be is not really a sensible question - there are too many variables in play for that (which (hypothetical future) telescope are we using, what are the observing conditions, how far away is the source, what kind of source are we talking about...). And at the end of the day, the brightness of your source is not even the biggest problem; finding a suitable lens is.
