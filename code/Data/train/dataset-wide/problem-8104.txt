I have to simulate independent draws from a very complicated distribution. They only feasible way appears to be using MCMC. I was considering running thousands of chains in parallel, but that would slow things down from me considerably. So I am running one long MCMC chain. Assuming that MCMC chain run did converge nicely ( I realize even determining this is practically impossible in general). . Can I argue that the thinned sample obtained from selecting every 100th observation (or at a sufficiently high lag at which the observed autocorrelation function is close to 0) effectively approximates ,in some sense, a i.i.d draw from the desired distribution. If yes, any references would be greatly appreciated. 

I have two questions about the behavior of the Gaussian Kernel matrix at small scales. I had asked a similar question in math.stackexchange but did not get any response. $URL$ Let $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_p$ be distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in general position where $p \geq 2$. Let $K(\lambda) = ( \exp(-\lambda\|x_i - x_j\|^2) )_{1\leq i,j \leq p}$ denote the Gaussian kernel matrix for $x_i$'s with scale parameter $\lambda > 0$ and let $\Delta(\lambda) := \det K(\lambda)$. For a general $p$: 

We have the bound $$ |fg|_{H^{0.5}}\leq C |f|_{H^{0.5+\delta}}|g|_{H^{0.5}}. $$ So, if you have a Lipschitz function, due to the compactness of the domain, the function is $H^1$. 

The question: Let's consider $f\in L^\infty(\mathbb{T})$ and $g\in BMO(\mathbb{T})$. I'm trying to figure out if the following inequality is true $$ \|fg\|_{BMO}\leq C\|f\|_{L^\infty}\|g\|_{BMO}. $$ My approach: I tried using the duality with $H^1$. I get $$ \|fg\|_{BMO}\leq \sup_{\|h\|_{H^1}\leq 1} 2\|f\|_{L^\infty}\|g\|_{BMO}\||h|\|_{H^1}. $$ So, if in the periodic case we have $h\in H^1\rightarrow |h|\in H^1$, I'm done. In the real line, in order $H h\in L^1$ (H is the Hilbert transform) one needs $h$ with zero mean (this implies that $h\in H^1\rightarrow |h|\in H^1$ isn't true). However, this restriction seems like it might be bypassed in the periodic setting. For instance let's take $h(x)=c$ with $c$ a constant. Then $h\in H^1$ and $|h|\in H^1$. I'm not very familiar with harmonic analysis, so, this question could be quite trivial for an expert. 

Well, I'm not sure if I got your question correctly. If I understood apropriately, you are asking for real life models where the test functions have restrictions as being divergence/curl free. Fluid dynamics is one of the fields where this restriction appear, not only on the solution, but also on the test function. Check the book "Navier-Stokes Equations and Turbulence" by Foias, Manly, Rosa and Temam for instance. Let me also copy the link to the appropriate page (the page is in google books) $URL$ 

Given a spherical fusion category $\mathcal C$, the Levin-Wen model constructs a lattice field theory: to each oriented surface with a triangulation, it assigns a state space $\mathcal H$ and a Hamiltonian $H$, whose space of ground states is independent of the choice of triangulation; and the Turaev-Viro model uses $\mathcal C$ to construct a (2+1)-dimensional oriented TQFT $Z_{\mathcal C}$. Kirrilov (2011) showed that for any spherical fusion category $\mathcal C$ and oriented surface $\Sigma$, the space of ground states of the Levin-Wen model for $\mathcal C$ on $\Sigma$ is canonically isomorphic to the state space $Z_{\mathcal C}(\Sigma)$ in the Turaev-Viro TQFT. Is there an analogous result in one dimension lower? Presumably this construction would, given a semisimple commutative Frobenius algebra $A$, define a lattice model on the circle whose space of ground states can be canonically identified with $A$. Someone's probably worked on this, but I haven't found any references. 

I'm trying to find generating manifolds for the cobordism group $\mathit{MO}_5(K(\mathbb Z/2, 2))\cong (\mathbb Z/2)^4$, which can be represented as the cobordism group of closed 5-manifolds $M$ together with a class $B\in H^2(M;\mathbb Z/2)$. I've found three of the four generators; the fourth should be a 5-manifold $M$ such that $w_1(M)w_2(M)\in H^3(M;\mathbb Z/2)$ is nonzero, and here I've gotten stuck. Such an $M$ cannot be a product of lower-dimensional manifolds, nor can it be the total space of a fiber bundle over the circle. I'm happy to hear general approaches or ideas as well, such as ways of modifying a manifold to change its cohomology or Stiefel-Whitney classes in useful ways. 

If {c(n)} is an arbitrary sequence of irrational numbers converging to 0 then Q + c(n), the set obtained by adding c(n) to the set of rational numbers Q, is clearly disjoint from Q for each n. Is there an uncountable dense set of the real numbers, say D, for which a sequence {c(n)} converging to 0 exists such that D + c(n) does not intersect D for all n? If such a set exists, and is borel, then it must have measure 0 since D - D would contain an interval if D had a positive measure. 

$\Delta(\lambda)$ is an analytic function of $\lambda$, and its first $p-2$ derivatives vanish. What is the smallest value of $k$ for which $\Delta^{(k)}(0) \neq 0?$ We can see $k=1$ when $p=2$. Is there a $t$ such that $\lim_{\lambda \to 0^+} \lambda^t (K(\lambda))^{-1}$ exists and is not zero? We can see $t=1$ when $p=2$. 

I asked this question in math.stackexchange but got no response; Are there any interesting examples of second order stationary processes on ${\mathcal R}^2$ or ${\mathcal R}^3$ that are not isotropic? The book I am looking at has no such examples. Update: Processes with anisotropic variograms are examples of non-isotropic stationary processes. 

In dimension 4, the Todd genus does not depend on the choice of a symplectic structure or even on an almost complex structure. If $M$ is an almost complex 4-manifold, then $\langle c_1(M)^2, [M]\rangle = 2\chi(M) + 3\sigma(M)$ (see here, p. 9), and $\langle c_2(M), [M]\rangle = \chi(M)$; here $\chi(M)$ is the Euler characteristic of $M$ and $\sigma(M)$ is its signature. Thus any orientation-preserving diffeomorphism preserves the Todd genus, and the orientation-preserving assumption is necessary, because the signature depends on the choice of orientation. This is also mentioned at the end of §2 of this paper by Łukasz Bąk. 

This is one of those calculations which is easier with the general formalism of homology, rather than just Betti numbers. Using the Mayer-Vietoris theorem a few times, one can show that if $M$ and $N$ are connected $n$-manifolds and $k\ne n-1,n$, then $$H_k(M\mathbin{\#}N)\cong H_k(M)\oplus H_k(N).$$ (For a proof and explanation, see this Math.Stackexchange answer.) Hence, when $n > 1$, $$H_2(\mathbb{CP}^n\mathbin\#\mathbb{CP}^n)\cong H_2(\mathbb{CP}^n)\oplus H_2(\mathbb{CP}^n)\cong \mathbb Z\oplus\mathbb Z,$$ so its Betti number is $$b_2(\mathbb{CP}^n\mathbin\#\mathbb{CP}^n) = \dim H_2(\mathbb{CP}^n\mathbin\#\mathbb{CP}^n) = 2.$$ (When $n = 1$, $\mathbb{CP}^1\cong S^2$, so $\mathbb{CP}^1\mathbin\#\mathbb{CP}^1\cong S^2\mathbin\# S^2\cong S^2$, and $b_2(S^2) = 1$, so to get $b_2 = 2$ one must assume $n > 1$.) 

For the sake of simplicity, let me pick $f(u_x)=\frac{1}{2}u_x^2$ and $u_0\in H^5$. We have that, in the new variable $f=u_x$, the equation reads $$ f_t-\alpha f_{xx}-\beta f_{xxx}=ff_x $$ We have that $$ \frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dt}\|f\|_{L^2}^2+\alpha\|f_x\|_{L^2}^2=0, $$ so $$ \|f(t)\|_{L^2}^2+2\alpha\int_0^t\|f_{x}\|_{L^2}^2ds\leq \|f(0)\|_{L^2}^2. $$ If we test the equation against $-f_{xx}$, then $$ \frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dt}\|f_x\|_{L^2}^2+\alpha\|f_{xx}\|_{L^2}^2\leq \frac{1}{2\alpha}\|ff_x\|_{L^2}^2+\frac{\alpha}{2}\|f_{xx}\|_{L^2}^2. $$ Using that $$ \|ff_x\|_{L^2}^2\leq \|f\|_{L^4}^2\|f_x\|_{L^4}^2\leq C\|f\|_{H^{0.25}}^2\|f\|_{H^{1.25}}^2\leq C\|f\|_{L^2}^{3/2}\|f_{x}\|_{L^2}^{1/2}\|f_x\|_{L^2}^{3/2}\|f_{xx}\|_{L^2}^{1/2}, $$ thus, $$ \|ff_x\|_{L^2}^2\leq C\|f_{x}\|_{L^2}^{4}+\frac{\alpha}{2}\|f_{xx}\|_{L^2}^{1/2}. $$ Using Gronwall and the finiteness of $\int_0^t\|f_{x}\|_{L^2}^2ds$, we conclude. In this way, you can get a priori estimates for any Sobolev norm. After that you can just mollify your equation appropriately and pass to the limit in the approximate problems. 

There is a huge literature in free boundaries. Here I collected some papers (in no particular order) addressing different physical systems (coming mainly from fluid dynamics) and questions (so, not only well-posedness). Hopefully you find these papers interesting. First of all a very nice, in my opinion, review: $URL$ 1) Stefan $URL$ $URL$ 2) Water waves $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 3) Hele-Shaw & Muskat $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 4) Vortex sheet $URL$ 5) SQG $URL$ 

There's an interesting application of stable homotopy theory to condensed-matter physics, and it makes heavy use of integral and torsion information, contradicting your 4th assumption. Within the general program of understanding topological phases of matter, condensed-matter theorists are interested in symmetry-protected topological phases (SPT phases). Approximately speaking, these are systems which have interesting topological behavior in the presence of a symmetry, but become trivial when that symmetry is broken. Their classification has gradually gotten more homotopical: 

The manifold $P(m,n) := (S^m\times \mathbb{CP}^n)/(\mathbb Z/2)$, where $\mathbb Z/2$ acts by the antipodal map on $S^m$ and by complex conjugation on $\mathbb{CP}^n$, is called a Dold manifold. In "Erzeugende der Thomschen Algebra $\mathfrak N$", Dold computes the mod 2 cohomology, Steenrod module structure, and Stiefel-Whitney classes of $P(m,n)$. The calculations are fairly straightforward, and I found them to be a good example when I was learning Stiefel-Whitney classes and wanted more examples than projective spaces. The paper is in German, but it's nonetheless quite readable, especially with a dictionary. 

René Thom proved that two closed $n$-manifolds $M$ and $N$ are (unoriented) cobordant iff their Stiefel-Whitney numbers agree: for any partition $i_1 + \dotsb + i_k = n$, $$[M]\frown w_{i-1}(M)w_{i_2}(M)\dotsm w_{i_k}(M) = [N]\frown w_{i-1}(N)w_{i_2}(N)\dotsm w_{i_k}(N).$$ The mod 2 Euler characteristic is a Stiefel-Whitney number: $\chi(M)\bmod 2 = [M]\frown w_n(M)$. Thus, if $M$ and $N$ are unoriented cobordant, then their Euler characteristics differ by a multiple of 2. (There might be a more direct proof of this using handles.) You can get rid of the mod 2 assumption if you work with (stably almost) complex cobordism, equipping all manifolds and cobordisms with a complex structure on the stable normal bundle. (In particular, this determines an orientation of your manifold.) Milnor and Novikov showed that $M$ and $N$ are complex cobordant iff their Chern numbers agree: these are defined in the same way as Stiefel-Whitney numbers, but for Chern classes. The Euler characteristic is a Chern number: $\chi(M) = [M]\frown c_n(M)$ if $M$ is $2n$-dimensional, and $\chi(M) = [M]\frown 0$ if $M$ is odd-dimensional. Thus in any dimension, the Euler characteristic is a cobordism invariant for stably almost complex cobordism.
