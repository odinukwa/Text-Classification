A solid ring is a ring $R$ such that the multiplication $R\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} R \to R$ is an isomorphism. These were classified by Bousfield and Kan; they are 

There is a fourth way: give the Lemma a name out of the given numbering scheme, e.g., call it Lemma A. 

My advisor (Sufian Husseini) wrote a book where something like this is done, based on the work in some of his first papers. Husseini, S. Y. The topology of classical groups and related topics. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, New York-London-Paris 1969 viii+128 pp. His idea is to generalize the James construction to replace all of the usual fibration constructions with cellular maps, products and actions, using constructions of "reduced product type" (RPT). The main theorems have the general flavor of: "the standard theory of fiber bundles works for vibrations". I think a more thorough modeling of fibrations by RPT methods was done by his Ph.D. student Hans Mathews in his thesis (University of Wisconsin, mid 1990s), but not published as far as I know. 

My view is that there are essentially two strands in a first calculus course. The first is not really concerned with a rigorous presentation; rather it tries to get the main ideas, their interrelations, and uses across. The second is concerned with the technicalities, showing how abstract mathematics can lead to very useful, interesting, and important results. This means that we are really working with two different definitions of the derivative. The first is to draw the tangent line and measure its slope. The second is to compute a certain limit. To be sure, the limit is motivated by the tangent approach, but no attempt is ever made to show that the two approaches give the same answer (indeed this can't be proved using the usual definitions, since ultimately the definition of tangent line is based on the derivative). The MVT is the basis for all proofs that geometric intuition about slopes of tangent lines holds for the limit definition. That is, the metamathematical content of the MVT is that the intuition definition matches the formal definition. When I realized this, I decided that this point was so subtle that I either have to make a big point of explaining the question or else drop it. This choice varies from class to class. EDIT: You use the MVT to show that positive derivative corresponds to increasing function. This is obvious from the intuitive point of view, but not from the formal point of view. 

If I understand your question properly, you're asking for the minimum number of open subsets of a wedge of seven circles such that you have unambiguous planning to get from point to point in each subset. I think you can do this for any finite wedge of circles with two sets: divide each circle into two arcs that contain both the wedge point and its antipode--I'll refer to these as the $A$-arcs and a $B$-arcs. Then let $$ A = \fbox{small open set around the wedge point} \cup \fbox{all $A$-arcs} $$ and $$ B = \fbox{small open set around the wedge point} \cup \fbox{all $B$-arcs}. $$ Each of these is an open `asterisk' and with a well-defined and continuous motion-planning rule (shortest path). 

You only need integration by parts to prove the irrationality of $\pi$. I'm having my Calculus 2 students do it as a long-term group project starting Monday. Then when you've done partial fractions, you can have them derive the quickly-converging BBP formula for $\pi$. And you can have them do the "18th Century Style" Euler argument for evaluating $\sum_{n=1}^\infty {1\over n^2}$. Here's a link to two of these: $URL$ 

A finitely generated infinite simple group. J. London Math. Soc. 26, (1951). 61--64 It is shown that G is infinite and has no proper normal subgroups of finite index, except G. It is easy to see that this group is perfect: it has trivial abelianization. I have heard through the grapevine that the space $X$ with four one-cells and four two-cells (corresponding, respectively, to generators and relations) is the classifying space of the group (I don't have a reference). 

Sure. The basic point is that for simply-connected spaces, you can determine the connectivity of a map by looking at the connectivity of the cofiber instead of the connectivity of the fiber. In homology, you determine the connectivity of the cofiber by looking at $H_*(C;\mathbb{Z})$, because of the Hurewicz Theorem. In cohomology, you appeal to: if $X$ is simply-connected, then $X$ is $n$-connected if and only if $[ X, K(G,m)] = *$ for all $m \leq n$ and all abelian groups $G$. This is because (by basic obstruction theory) if $X$ is $(n-1)$-connected, then $[X, K(G,n)] \cong \mathrm{Hom}(\pi_n(X), G )$. This results in a long list of groups to check, admittedly; but it can be whittled down by Universal Coefficients theorems if you like. 

When I work out the James construction for a discrete pointed space, it appears that the induced map $\pi_0 (J(X)) \to \pi_0( \Omega\Sigma X)$ is the inclusion of the free monoid on $\pi_0(X)$ into the free group on $\pi_0(X)$, so $J(X) \to \Omega\Sigma X$ is not a homotopy equivalence; and it seems clear that the same phenomenon holds for other disconnected spaces (which is why I made the distinction between $X$ and $\pi_0(X)$). I also think that $J(X) \to \Omega \Sigma X$ will induce isomorphisms on $\pi_n$ for $n \geq 1$, which would mean that the restriction to the basepoint components, which I'll denote $J_0(X) \to \Omega_0 \Sigma X$, should be a (weak) equivalence. But I don't recall having seen this claim anywhere, so: is this written up somewhere? 

The existence of the maps $g_i$ is only possible if $G_i$ is abelian, and so what you are missing is that each $G_i$ must be abelian. It's been a while since I looked at that book, but it very well may be that their definition of an Eilenberg-MacLane space included the assumption that $G$ is abelian. 

derives the relevant properties using the Cube Theorems (which are about the mixing of homotopy pushouts and homotopy pullbakcs) of an earlier paper of Mather's. 

I've written a paper (or two) about collection $\mathcal{R}$ of all pointed topological spaces $Y$ satisfying the property $\mathrm{map}_*(X,Y) \sim *$ (for fixed $X$). The interesting fact is that if $\mathcal{R}$ contains $S^{2n+1}$ for all sufficiently large $n$, then $\mathcal{R}$ contains all finite-dimensional simply-connected CW complexes. My proof works by induction on the cone length of $Y$ with respect to the collection of all wedges of spheres, and the passage from spaces of cone length $n$ to those of cone length $n+1$ requires information about a huge array of spaces with cone length $n$ (or less), and not just the ones in the given cone decomposition. So: knowing that $Y$ has a finite cone decomposition leads to the apparently unrelated conclusion that $\mathrm{map}_*(X, Y)\sim *$; and the proof requires the collection approach. 

I was involved in such a case. My thesis advisor (S. Husseini) and his coauthor (E. Fadell) defined the "category weight" of a cohomology class in a way that allowed them to prove the theorem they wanted. But when I started looking at it, I noticed that it was not homotopy invariant, and all the applications were homotopy invariant. So I introduced the homotopy invariant version and called it "essential category weight." At roughly the same time Y. Rudyak made the same observation, and also defined a homotopy invariant version, calling it "strict category weight." After a few years of using competing terminology for the same concept, and not using the original "category weight" at all, everybody agreed to call the homotopy invariant version "category weight." 

Let $L$ be a free Lie algebra (over $\mathbb{Q}$) on generators $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, and let $V_k$ be the subspace spanned by the $k$-fold brackets. Let $U_1 = \mathrm{span}\{ x_i | i< n\}\subseteq V_1$ and let $W_n \subseteq V_n$ be the span of the $n$-fold brackets that involve $x_n$ at least once. The bracket defines a function $V_k\otimes V_\ell \to V_{k+\ell}$ (which is what I think of as bracketing and rewriting in terms of a chosen basis, but actually it's just bracketing). Question: Is the composition $$ U_1 \otimes W_m \to V_1\otimes V_m \to V_{m+1} $$ injective? ($m$ has no particular relation to $n$) I have asked MAPLE to compute the dimensions of these vector spaces and it seems that the dimension of the target is generally large enough to accommodate such an injection (though I haven't proved a dimension inequality yet). 

By taking the pullback in your square, you may assume that $B_1 = B_2$. Then your question becomes: are the "equivalent" fibrations fiber homotopy equivalent? The answer to this is yes: you can find it at the very beginning of Chapter 5 in May's "A concise course..." (p. 52); or indeed, the result you want is the next proposition on the following page. 

Suppose I have a pullback square, which I think of as a map from the fibration $q:X\to A$ to the fibration $p:Y\to B$. Then there is an induced map $m: M \to N$ from the mapping cylinder $M$ of $X\to Y$ to the mapping cylinder $N$ of $A\to B$. Is $m$ a fibration? Here's what I know: if we pull $p$ back by the canonical quotient $N \to B$ (which is a homotopy equivalence), we obtain a fibration $P \to N$, and the map $M\to N$ in question factors as $M \to P \to N$; the comparison map $M\to P$ is both a bijection and a homotopy equivalence; and I can show that if the image of $A\to B$ is a closed subset of $B$, then $M\to P$ is a closed map, and hence a homeomorphism. Motivation: I'm reading the proof of Mather's First Cube Theorem. Mather proves that a certain map can be compressed (over the base) into such a mapping cylinder and concludes that the map is a weak fibration (satisfies the weak CHP), citing a Lemma to the effect that if a map deforms, over the base, into a fibration then it is a weak fibration. I can make this work by converting to a cofibration twice (!), but it feels artificial, and I thought maybe it was common knowledge to some people that these mapping cylinders are fibrations. So, I would like honest Hurewicz fibrations. 

I'm interested in collections $\mathcal{C}$ of tuples $\mathbf{t} = (n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_r)$ of positive integers satsifying 

Now we have a copy of $K$ embedded in $Y$. The nice thing about this is that we can encode this knot as a list of points with three families of "joining curves". Thus we can draw an $n$-crossing knot $K$ using $2n$ points to anchor the hoops, $n$ points between the anchor pairs and $3n$ points to act as turnaround points for the "joining curves" (a total of $6n$ points). So now I think we can replicate this using general position points. 

Fibrations are defined as target-type concepts -- they have good formal homotopy properties when you map into them, for example, if you apply the functor $\pi_n(-) = [S^n,-]$. Now I'll subject you to my point of view on homology. Dually, cofibrations are a domain-type concept, so they behave well when you map out of them, say if you apply (represented) cohomology: $\widetilde H^n(-;G) = [-, K(G,n)]$. Homology is a bit of a monster: it is a covariant functor that works well with domain-type input. It is a small miracle that such functors exist at all; this is why they are hard to construct. But the answer for homology has to be: homology works well with cofibrations because we built it to work well with cofibrations, and a more informative answer to your question would depend on the construction you use.
