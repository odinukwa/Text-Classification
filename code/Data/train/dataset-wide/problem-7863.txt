The Torelli theorem states that the map $\mathcal{M}_g(\mathbb{C})\to \mathcal{A}_g(\mathbb{C})$ taking a curve to its Jacobian is injective. I've seen a couple of proofs, but all seem to rely on the ground field being $\mathbb{C}$ in some way. So: 

If $C$ is a smooth, 1-dimensional variety over an algebraically closed field $k$,, then $S^nC$ is smooth. If $X$ is a smooth variety over an algebraically closed field $k$, and $S^nX$ is smooth, then $X$ is one dimensional. 

One of the big problems you run into is localization. Not all rings can be localized. You'll almost certainly need to restrict to rings satisfying the Ore Conditions. However, lots of natural rings do satisfy them, for instance "almost commutative" rings do. These are filtered rings whose associated graded ring is commutative. Among the rings of this form is the ring of linear differential operators on an open subset of a variety, and localization works out, so you get a sheaf, and you can look at modules, etc, they're called D-modules. But anyway, the first few things to do are to decide on a class of rings where you can localize (or if you can't, you REALLY need to rework things from the bottom), and then you need to decide if you're looking at left, right or bimodules, including whether you're going to look at prime left/right/two-sided ideals, etc. CAVEAT: I am a nonexpert in noncommutative AG, I just know a few places where the standard things in commutative AG break down a bit. 

There is a quantum Leray-Hirsch Theorem, do to Maulik and Pandharipande here. It relates the Gromov-Witten theory of the projective line bundle to that of the base. 

Here's an example stolen blatantly from wikipedia. Let $R=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-3}]$, let $a=4=2*2=(1+\sqrt{-3})(1-\sqrt{-3})$ and $b=2(1+\sqrt{-3})$. Now, $2$ and $1+\sqrt{-3}$ are both maximal among divisors, but are not associates, thus, there is not GCD. 

Pressley's Elementary Differential Geometry isn't so bad. It's similar to Do Carmo in many ways. It's part of Springer's UTM series. 

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety and let $D$ be an effective divisor on $X$. Is there a natural way to describe the tangent space to $|D|$ (or $|D|^\vee$, of course) at a divisor $D'$? Preferably as some sort of cohomology group, again ideally on $X$. I would prefer to avoid using the fact that the linear system is a projective space, and do things naturally. 

Well, I'll take a stab at it. I think you're going to want properties $P$ of functors $F$ of the form $F$ has property $P$ if and only if $\forall X$, $F(X)$ has property $P'$ as you'd suggested above. I think we can avoid $P'$ being a natural isomorphism with $h_X$ by making sure it's a property of all of these sets, rather than something we say about it as a functor (on the other hand, if we want to define Yoneda and CoYoneda properties of morphisms, this becomes a problem, and so this is really bothering me philosophically...) But this definition handles "is a group", "is initial", "is terminal" by "every $F(X)$ is a group", and statements that for a contravariant or covariant (as appropriate) we have a single element. We're going to want to allow products as well to be Yoneda, presumably. Now, $X\times Y$ is a product if for any $Z\to X, Z\to Y$ we get $Z\to X\times Y$ commuting with projection. So I guess here we might want to have the property "There exist functors $G,H$ such that for all $X$, we have $F(X)=G(X)\times H(X)$" perhaps? It avoids quantifying over the category in question, but instead does so over the category of functors, which I haven't thought through terribly well. Mostly I'm just thinking aloud here, but no one else had much, so I thought I'd throw my two cents in. 

One thing that I rather like (though I'm biased, and mentioning old work by my advisor...) is the theory of Prym varieties, which can be mentioned immediately after discussing Jacobians. In particular the $n$-gonal construction (see Donagi "Fibers of the Prym Map") has a lot of nice geometric consequences, including a proof that the intermediate Jacobian of a cubic threefold isn't the Jacobian of a curve (though that's not really a Riemann surface thing), but generally, Prym varieties are rather nice (as well as Weil pairing and theta characteristics) but aren't mentioned in most courses...I think they've got short appendices towards the end in Arbarello-Cornalba-Griffiths-Harris, and they leave out most of the details. 

Is there a good reference for the structure of the Chow ring of $\mathcal{A}_g$, the moduli space of complex principally polarized abelian varieties? More generally, references for the intersection theory, enumerative geometry, and vector bundles on $\mathcal{A}_g$ would be nice. 

I actually think that the Hilbert scheme should be mentioned (and, if possible, proved to exist and discussed) as early as possible. It serves as a good example of a moduli space, and it exists! Plus, the infinitesimal study of the Hilbert scheme allows some deformation theory to be discussed (at least, the deformations of projective schemes inside projective space) which also helps explain, algebro-geometrically, what the normal sheaf really controls. Add to this the fact that a lot of research relies on moduli spaces these days (In particular, I know that people care about Hilbert schemes of points, and, if some GIT for PGL can be covered, it'll let you actually construct $\mathcal{M}_g$, which finishes the classification of curves that's given in chapter 1 of Hartshorne, though this is a bit more.) Because you'll be wanting things fundamentally scheme theoretic, the first part of Koll√°r's "Rational Curves on Algebraic Varieties" might be a good reference for this stuff. 

I know that Stillwell's book "Mathematics and its History" claims that Galois introduced the word "group", though doesn't explain why he chose it. 

Look at flabbier objects. This seems to be especially useful in complex algebraic geometry. Hard to prove something for varieties? See if there's a version that's true for schemes. Or maybe Kahler manifolds. Or worse: stacks. Vector bundles giving you trouble? Try coherent sheaves. Try quasi-coherent sheaves. In fact, try complexes of them. This is really just a special case of "Generalize the question as far as you can" but in this specific case, it's rather clarifying, here are some examples in algebraic geometry: 

I've always seen it as a generalization of the fact that every function on a space defines a distribution. That is, $C^\infty(M)\subset \mathcal{D}(M)$ (don't know if that's standard, I know very little about distributions except what was covered in a first year course) generalizes to $\mathcal{C}\subset Func(C^{op},Sets)$. And then it lets you talk about whether a functor solution is representable, like whether a distribution solution is a function, etc. 

On a smooth complex projective variety of $\dim X=n$, we have $n$ complex tori associated to it via $J^k(X)=F^kH^{2k-1}(X,\mathbb{C})/H_k(X,\mathbb{Z})$ (assuming I've got all the indices right) called the $k$th intermediate Jacobian. If $k=1$, we have $J^1(X)=H^{1,0}/H_1$, and so $J^1(X)\cong Jac(X)$ is an abelian variety (the bilinear form is a polarization because it has to be definite on each piece of the Hodge decomposition (I think) ) and is in fact isomorphic as PPAV's to the Jacobian of the variety. If $k=n$, we have $H^{2n-1,1}/H_{2n-1}$, which is also a PPAV, and is in fact the Albanese of $X$. The ones in the middle, however, the "true" intermediate Jacobians, are generally only complex tori. One example of an application is that Clemens and Griffiths proved that cubic threefolds are unirational but not rational using $J^2(X)$ for $X$ a cubic threefold. So, what information do the intermediate Jacobians contain? I've been told that we don't really know much about that, but what is known, beyond Clemens/Griffiths? 

Not an answer for individual curves, necessarily, but a related fact is that for large $g$, the moduli space of curves is not unirational. So that means that we can't do anything nice like write down a system of equation with $3g-3$ parameters such that a generic curve of genus $g$ is in that system for specified values. It doesn't quite answer the above question (which seems like it's the desire for a map from the appropriate space of groups to the moduli space of curves, or perhaps into the tricanonical embedding of the curve $\mathbb{H}/\Gamma$, and I don't know how to do that, though it seems like the lack of unirationality will just make this harder, if we have any chance at all. 

If your system is algebraic, then you bet! More generally, you can get abelian varieties as the fibers for many interesting integrable systems. Google the following for more: algebraic complete integrable Hamiltonian system, Calogero-Moser System, Hitchin System. As for elliptic curves, they'll only pop out in low dimensional cases, because otherwise, the fibers have to have larger dimension. As for the latter, it depends what you might want. I've seen the definition of integrable given by "can be solved by a sequence of quadratures" and in this terminology, you can check that an algebraic system you're always working with the global section of the theta function on the abelian variety, which is the unique (up to scaling) global section of the theta divisor on the abelian variety, which for an elliptic curve, is just the Weierstrass function. 

Ok, I might be missing something (I often am) but I believe that this does it. Scroll up to page 452, line 3.9. The book is Effective Methods in Algebraic Geometry by Rossi and Spangher. 

If I'm not mistaken, it's just linear algebra. Because you're looking in the kernel, you have $\lambda\mu_1+\eta\mu_2=0$, which can be solved to $\lambda\mu_1=-\eta\mu_2$, and then the question is about $\mu_2$ dividing $\lambda$ and $\mu_1$ dividing $\eta$. Well, $\mu_1,\mu_2$ are linearly independent differentials, so they don't divide each other and are prime in the ring of monomials in the differentials. Thus, $\mu_1|\eta\mu_2$ implies that $\mu_1|\eta$ and similarly $\mu_2|\lambda$. 

One thing to keep in mind is that if there is no one at your school, you can often either have a local advisor and an advisor elsewhere, just an advisor elsewhere, or have a local advisor who will sign things while you're really talking to someone else. As far as finding an advisor at your school, go to talks! Professors (at least here at U. Penn) give talks fairly regularly about what they're working on, and if they aren't, you can often email them to ask if they can talk to you about what they do, and then if what they do is like what you're interested in, you can talk to them about being your advisor. Another way to do it is to talk to professors who've taught classes that you've taken, and try to do a reading course with them. 

For the purposes of this question, let the Hodge bundle $\lambda$ be the bundle on a fibration of abelian varieties $X\to B$ with fiber over $b\in B$ the space of 1-forms on $X_b$, or the pullback to $B$ along the zero section of the sheaf of relative differentials. The most interesting examples are when $B$ is $M_g$ or $A_g$, and the fibrations are the Jacobian fibration or the universal family of abelian varieties. Is there a good reference for the properties of this bundle? And for the determinant line bundle on these spaces? Things like self-intersection numbers, cohomology (in particular global sections) are particularly of interest. 

My favorite, which is on the wikipedia page for "homeomorphism", is $\phi:[0,2\pi)\to S^1$, by $\phi(\theta)=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$, which is continuous and bijective, but not a homeomorphism. 

Not an expert, but the idea is that there should be some "thing" over which we can define functors which, after base change, are schemes. Over this "thing", rings of integers should be literal curves. The big example of things that I know is that a vector space over F_1 (or F_un, if you're the sort who likes fun notation) is a pointed set. For more info, there have been some "This Week's Finds" posts about them, and also this series at neverendingbooks. 

Yes. Any group homomorphism fixes zero. Now, look at the set of things greater than zero. If the homomorphism is order preserving, then it must take the least thing there to the least thing in the image. However, as the image is surjective, it must then be fixed. Then, inductively, everything larger than zero is fixed. A similar argument works for things less than zero. In fact, this proof appears to merely require a totally ordered group, and not the lexicographic ordering, so this should work for any monomial ordering (that is, total order on Z^n. 

I don't have my copy of Griffiths and Harris in front of me, but regarding Grothendieck's theorem, there's a nice elementary argument by Michiel Hazewinkel & Clyde F. Martin. Here is a link to ScienceDirect. It's only five pages, and mostly consists of linear algebra (and really, is closer to 3 pages, ignoring abstract, intro, and white space at the end). 

Is algebraically closed necessary? Characteristic zero? It is known if there are any other base rings/schemes over which it is true? 

At least in some locations in the US, the problem is summed up in this video. Students in some places aren't being TAUGHT arithmetic anymore. At all. Add to that the general lack of computational repetition that's been trending upwards these days, and I think that this sort of thing explains a large fraction of the problem. 

We won't be able to do it for varieties, at least, because a cusp is topologically the same as a smooth point (cuspidal cubic and $\mathbb{P}^1$ are homeomorphic, even over $\mathbb{C}$ in the analytic topology).
