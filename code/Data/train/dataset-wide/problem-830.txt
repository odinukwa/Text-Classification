some 0.418 astronomical units from the star, which would itself be a K3 or K4 class star and exhibit a slightly orange glow. Note: The original version of this answer calculated the distance from the Sun, without having accounted for a dimmer and therefore, less massive, star. This version has been updated to constrain all variables onto the mass. Other answers already show the relation given that the Sun would stay in place. Mathematically, the orbital radius for a 4 month orbit would be somewhere around 0.48075 AU, slightly higher than the orbit of Mercury, where the Sun's heat can melt lead. The Earth, without accounting for a dimmer star, would be sterilised. 

Having a shorter orbital period of four months (assuming Earth months) will require you to solve a set of equations. First, you have the generalised form of Kepler's law: $$p^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G M}$$ Where $p$ is the period, $r$ is the distance from the centre of gravity, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and to simplify from $M_1 + M_2$, I will use $M$ because planetary masses are negligible compared to stars. Then, I have the equations for extraterrestrial solar irradiance, holding the Earth value of 1367 $\textrm{Wm}^{-2}$ constant. $$1367 = \frac{L}{4 \pi r^2}$$ Where $L$ is the luminosity of the light source. Now, because I can relate luminosity to mass, I am going to use the mass-luminosity relation with the general approximate value for low-mass main sequence stars of around 4: $$\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{4}$$ Substituting all of these equations together, starting with the solar radiation equation, then substituting the mass-uminosity relation for $L$ and then Kepler's law, solved for $r$, I get: $$1367 = \frac{\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{4} L_{\odot}}{4\pi \left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{p^2 G M}{4\pi ^2}}\right)^2}$$ I then substitute in the appropriate value for your four month year and come up with some mass value $M$ necessary for that star. Using Wolfram Alpha (because I really don't want to solve that by hand), with this query, 

In a world of humans who undertake rational economic behaviours, I would say no, at least in the long-run. For this question, I will also be interpreting 'tech' on the lines of productivity, economic production, and military technologies. Any technologically advanced nation will require large amounts of economic output to support that technology, that society, and the consumption which made that technology possible. In a world where there are lots of people everywhere, i.e. the technologically advanced nation does not have a monopoly on the world population, there are two major mechanisms, which I feel, would be rational to pursue, and which would lead to the diffusion of technology. Colonialism and imperialism The first would certainly fit into a 1890-1912 period. Colonialism and imperialism are results not out of evil persons and character, but rather, the technological, economic, and military domination of a certain society over another. I would argue that something like European imperialism was not caused by Europeans being horrible people, but rather, by the fact that Europeans had a massive technological advantage over their neighbours. Colonisation would lead to the diffusion of productive technologies as the primary purpose of empire is economic and political. Empires cost money to maintain, thus, the metropole will want to extract economic value out of it. Or, they will do so due to political concerns (e.g. British invasion of the Sudan in the 1890s to check French expansion into the same area). This means that railroads and other pieces of infrastructure will be built. This will necessarily diffuse technology, because railroads have to be maintained. Military or political networks require logistics. All of these will require employ of the native population, which will require that they assimilate technological advances from the metropole. Furthermore, as colonialism and imperialism will also be resisted by indigenous populations, those populations will also likely assimilate technologies necessary to strengthen their societies, expanding their economic production and war-making powers. This means that such technologies would also diffuse to nations willing to reform. Foreign investment The second major mechanism would be foreign direct investment. Today, the surplus of labour in developing countries and low productivity means that wages are low. This gives strong incentives for corporations or organisations from the metropole to invest in foreign nations, and therefore, spread production technologies, which would allow for massive expansions in economic production, as we see in places like China and south-east Asia today. Even if there is no foreign direct investment, entrepreneurs from one nation will almost certainly steal or copy technologies from abroad. The production of silk was heavily regulated in China. It travelled to India anyway. The technology of water and steam-powered looms was heavily regulated in Britain. It travelled to the United States anyway. This is simply because a market opportunity exists, and it will be filled in time. Real-world examples The real-world examples of massive technological gaps, like Britain and Afghanistan circa 1912, have to do with the fact that places like Afghanistan are effectively unconquerable and unable to support Industrial age technologies (for various reasons). It would probably break the wilful suspension of disbelief for the rest of the world to basically be such a place. 

This is actually a rather interesting idea. The strategic and economic worth of the Rhineland is too high for any nation to give up. Thus, the only cause of this would be a war. Pick a time when Germany, the German Federation, or the North German Federation is weakest, distracted, and France is comparatively stronger. This time is clearly not the Franco-Prussian War or later, as the demographics will have moved against France. In 1866, the German Federation collapsed as tensions mounted between Austria and the North German States, resulting in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War. Before this, the German Confederation is still a working entity, and therefore, would trigger retaliation from all German states in the former Holy Roman Empire. If you want something based off the actual timeline, I think this is the only time for France to strike. From a demographic standpoint, you want the conflict to happen sooner rather than later, as Prussia gains more people relative to France every year, and you want Germany disunited. This is the only time to strike. 

I get a value for the mass around $1.28 \cdot 10^{30}$ kg, or, 0.643722 $M_{\odot}$. The distance from the star, therefore by Kepler's law, would be somewhere around (using the expression substituted for $r$ and the query string below) 

The Roche limit is the minimum distance some gravitationally bound object can orbit another one without being pulled apart by tidal forces. For the Earth, and fluid satellites, the following approximate equation for the Roche limit is used: $$d \approx 2.44 R \left ( \frac{\rho_m}{\rho_M}\right )^{1/3}$$ For two Earths, because the densities will be the same, this would be 2.44 times the Earth radius, or around 12.6 million metres. Next, one wants to calculate the distance at which there would be atmospheric sharing. One would have to find the radius at which there is an equipotential surface connecting one atmosphere with another. But I am going to ignore that. This is because any atmospheric sharing is going to generate large amounts of friction which would sap orbital velocity. This would reduce the energy in the orbit and then lead to an in-spiral which then leads to the two planets colliding and destroying themselves. If you want a binary planet system, however, they have to be at least 12.6 million metres apart. However, if you want a stable system, further is better, as there would be less chance of anything going wrong and causing an in-spiral. 

You want your moon to orbit outside the Roche limit and inside sphere of influence. A number of issues, (1) you would have to calculate the orbital parameters of the Earth clones and (2) you would have to calculate the orbital parameter of a moon orbiting a mass the size of two Earths given a certain orbital period. It is impossible to calculate (2) without knowledge of the time taken for this Moon to orbit. The first, however, can be done. One day is 86400 seconds. The mass of the Earth is 5.972 Ã— 1024 kg. $$T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot R^3}{G \cdot 2 M}}$$ Since we know T, the gravitational constant G, and M, solve for R. The answer is 42109.77324 kilometres. So you'll have to put it further than that. Now, the Roche limit of each Earth can probably be approximated from the Roche limit of the actual Earth by itself. That is 18,470 km. So, put it further than 26165.8 + 18470 km, or 44 000 kilometres. Whatever it is, you can put it where the Earth is now with stability. Naturally, this is a complicated three-body problem now, so that issue applies. 

In 1889, the South Fork Dam, a few miles north of Johnstown, collapsed, releasing the entire reservoir into the town. It released 20 million tons of water into the valley, which hit the town, killing 2209 people and causing damage worth around 450 million 2015 dollars. 

Ion engines? Absolutely not. The thrust generated by an ion engine is so ridiculously low, it would be impossible to get something off the ground. Even the ion engine in KSP is overpowered, since a burn doesn't last upwards of a year... However, in the future, there is an alternative: pulse-detonation engines. The big difference is that right now, jet engines are burning fuel, which releases gas and smoke and all that. But doing so releases all that energy over time and in an inefficient manner, burning things uncleanly. What make a PDE so helpful though, is its use of many many (thousands per second) small explosions rather than the burning of petrol. Using a pulse detonation engine, your craft can travel significantly faster (upwards of Mach 6), use significantly less fuel, and unfortunately, make a ridiculous amount of noise. Basically, the concept of the PDE is that you take small amounts of fuel, drop them into a cavity, and explode the fuel, generating thrust. Due to the adiabatic expansion curve of the explosion, it is much more efficient than conventional turbine-based engines today. The catch though, is making each explosion small enough and the explosions fast enough that the vibrations caused by a discernable pulse are gone. With a cycle speed in the 1000s of hertz, the problems of having a pulse then a wait and another pulse go away quickly. The fuels which an engine such as this would use are likely to be the same kinds of petrol used today. An experimental flight was undertaken in 2008 using octane fuels travelling at low speed. However, many aeronautic engine companies, NASA, and the government are attempting to develop these engines due primarily due to the efficiency gains and the ability for them to maintain speeds in excess of Mach 6. Within 200 years, this should absolutely be developed, especially since prototypes already exist. Beyond the timeframe of 100 years, however, the technology would likely be obsolescent due to something as of yet unknown. 

Until around the end of the 19th century, with the completion of modern sanitation projects and the development of modern medicine, more people died in cities than were born in them. This was the case in Ancient Rome, in 16th century Paris, in industrial London, etc. It is still the case in third-world countries today. The only reason cities were populated was because of the massive number of people who immigrated into those cities at rates far higher than replacement. Depopulation from disease Halifax in the early 19th century isn't going to be an exception to this. It is still an Industrial Age city. It doesn't have modern hospitals. It doesn't have the infrastructure to fight cholera, typhoid, typhus, plague, etc. It probably doesn't have the public health system to adequately inoculate its population from smallpox. These diseases depopulate empires. Hill tribes don't have this problem though (well, to a much lesser extent). Plagues spread when there are many people which it can infect. That requires density. Hill tribes don't live densely. Food issues Cities also require massive amounts of food. This is the case today. If you live in the developed world, look into a supermarket. Every single gramme of food was shipped from someplace else. Cities are buildings, they are not farms. This was the case in every Industrial Age city as well. Food has to be imported. There is a maximum to the size of any city, simply from to the fact that (1) food rots and (2) every kilo must be transported from a farm to the city market. London was fed by southern England. Rome was fed by importing massive amounts of grain from the Italian countryside and having the efforts of an empire manage its import from Sicily and Egypt. Moving a city from 1800 into mediaeval times is going to run into this food problem. The productive capacity of land was lower in mediaeval times. Similarly, there was less transportation technology as well. There must be a lower limit on the size of any city. Any chance of survival is going to require Halifax to develop extremely strong trade ties with food producers within the season. Scottish and Gaelic hill tribes, however, don't suffer from this problem. They grow their own food. 

1.87 astronomical units from the star, which would be very much like our Sun, just brighter and a third more massive. Thus, because the orbital parameters fit and such a star has very similar properties to the Sun, life can certainly exist. Note: For those who are familiar with Kepler's law, the generalised Newtonian form of the equation shows that the mass of the central object is inversely proportional with the square of the period, which is why the doubled period has a not-so-large effect on the mass of the central object. This means that the increased time leads to a higher mass. I wanted to constrain the distance variable by providing some energy per square metre requirements, which therefore, could also have been solved by substitution of $r$ from the second equation here. 

No. Let's talk about money. The main purpose of money is to serve as a medium of exchange. Basically, if I am a farmer and you are a butcher, but you want clothes today, we can't do business through the barter system. Instead, we do business by paying each other in money and then we can purchase whatever we want from third parties. Money does nothing more than make transactions easier. The value of money, therefore, is not based on what that money is made of, but rather, what you can buy for your money. That doesn't change in this situation. Foremost, most simplistic economic models which people learn in introductory and intermediate economics assume perfect information. This is basically that. Issues with adverse selection, used-car salesmen hiding information from others, and swindlers would go down dramatically, because people will know exactly what they are buying. Money secured by computers and combination locks might be less secure, but quite a lot of money (circulating currency) is secured not by those computers, but rather, 'rough men [who] stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm'. If you want to steal someone's wallet, you will still have to wrestle that wallet away from them. 

From a diplomatic point of view, I could see that governments would have more access to other nations. This would allow for diplomacy to be conducted more quickly. But you have caveated that only the civilians are not going to be able to access them. The only use for teleportation which is entirely restricted to the government is conflict. The fact that teleportation occurs without any kind of controls means that military mobility is massively increased. With teleportation abilities, if a government wanted to mobilise huge forces, it could do so immediately. For example, if there is a military base in Arkansas which needs to fight the French (for some reason), they can simply teleport to London. However, the more insidious thing here is the use of teleports to entirely bypass the concept of a front line. All teleportation systems, because they lack authentication protocols other than shooting the person who comes through the door, is necessarily a security risk. Each teleportation transceiver, therefore, would be heavily defended. Wars would be conducted extremely quickly with control of cities being the primary goal of warfare, because connection to such cities directly entails the control of vital military infrastructure that can be used to reinforce, regroup, and reorganise forces. However, because there is a near infinite amount of resources available to any city, it would very hard to organise a successful siege. Taking cities, the only worthwhile military goal because of their infrastructure, would also be nearly impossible because any attacker would be repulsed by massive retaliation from the garrison and any reinforcements it could gate in. Though, one could also consider that the fact teleportation creates an extremely fast way of moving about. This would mean that having large conventional armies is mostly unnecessary. As long as you can teleport your rapid-response defence forces everywhere they are needed, you do not need to actively defend many areas at once.
