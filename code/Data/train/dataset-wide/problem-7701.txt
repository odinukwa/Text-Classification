Propp redoes, clarifies and generalizes domino shuffling in the following lovely paper: Propp, James. "Generalized domino-shuffling." Theoretical Computer Science 303, no. 2 (2003): 267-301. $URL$ The redone explanation is a way of thinking of the domino shuffle map locally, using a graph transformation called urban renewal; these days people also call it the spider move. The move replaces a 4-cycle in a graph (the "square", we might call it) with an 8-vertex graph made of a 4-cycle with a pendant edge on each vertex (the "spider"); the feet of the spider get attached where the vertices of the square were. Spider moves, when combined with a suitable reweighting of the edges in the graph, preserve the generating function for perfect matchings up to an explicit constant. The argument is much like the one in Elkies-Kuperberg-Larsen-Propp which you're asking about, but it is substantially streamlined because you only have to think about the square and the spider. In answer to your question: once you understand this point of view, odd-deficiency is obvious. When you reconstruct the domino shuffle using spider moves (which Propp explains how to do in the same paper), the squares and the spiders comprise the odd blocks, and all the action happens within them. The even blocks do not enter into the picture at all. As further evidence that the spider move is the correct point of view, Kenyon-Goncharov $URL$ recently used the spider move to define a certain cluster integrable system for the dimer model. 

If $\kappa$ is a singular cardinal, a scale for $\kappa$ consists of an increasing sequence $\langle \kappa_i : i < \mathrm{cf}(\kappa) \rangle$ converging to $\kappa$ and a sequence of functions $\langle f_\alpha : \alpha < \kappa^+ \rangle$ that is linearly ordered and dominating in the partial order of $\prod_{i<\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)} \kappa_i$ by $f \leq g$ iff $|\{ i : f(i) >g(i) \}| < \mathrm{cf}(\kappa)$. Shelah proved that scales exist for every singular cardinal. A point $\alpha < \kappa^+$ is called good for a scale on $\kappa$ if there is an unbounded $A \subseteq \alpha$ and an $i < \mathrm{cf}(\kappa)$ such that for all $j > i$, $\langle f_\beta(j) : \beta \in A \rangle$ is a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals. The following seems to be folklore: Theorem (ZFC): For every scale $\vec F$ for $\aleph_\omega$, there is a club $C \subseteq \aleph_{\omega+1}$ such that every point in $C$ of cofinality at least $\aleph_4$ is good. Question 1: Is there a proof of this in the literature? Or can one neatly construct a proof from some lemmas stated in the literature? Question 2: How does this generalize to larger singular cardinals? 

Pick a spanning tree of the ski trail map, e.g. by depth-first search or something. You can traverse it by always turning left at a junction. As you're doing this, walk out and back along each edge that's not in the tree. This uses each edge exactly twice. 

I doubt there's a completely standard definition. It seems like this is elementary -- an undirected edge is a size-$k$ subset of $[1,n]$, and a directed edge is an undirected edge together with one of the possible $2^k$ labellings of it with "T" and "H". So the number of different edges is (if, say, empty head- and tail-sets are allowed) $\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^k = 3^n$ Presumably a directed hypergraph consists of any collection of such edges, so there are $2^{3^n}$ of them. If this isn't the precise question you were wondering about, I'd wager that the one you're interested in is just as easy to count. 

where v is the vector [0, 0, ... 0, 1]. I'm pretty sure it'd be easy to prove this inductively, as A itself has a similar block structure - though I confess I haven't done it. EDIT: Here's the sage code that produces the matrix. Obviously it's not the smartest way to go about doing things, but it was adequate. If anyone knows a smarter but equally terse way of iterating over the power set than converting it to a list, let me know! 

Is the following consistent? $2^\omega > \omega_2$, and there is a normal precipitous ideal $I$ on $[\omega_2]^\omega$ such that every $X \subset [\omega_2]^\omega$ of size $< 2^\omega$ is in $I$? Note: (1) It is a theorem of Baumgartner-Taylor that every club subset of $[\lambda]^\omega$ has maximal size, $\lambda^\omega$, if $\lambda > \omega_1$. (2) It is a theorem of Gitik that if $V \subset W$ are models of set theory in which $\kappa$ is regular in both and $\geq \omega_2$, and $r \in W \setminus V$ is a real, then $([\kappa]^\omega)^W \setminus ([\kappa]^\omega)^V$ is stationary in $W$. (3) It is easy to get non-examples by adding reals with ccc forcing to a model with a precipitous ideal on $[\omega_2]^\omega$. (4) One can show that the smallest normal ideal on $[\lambda]^{<\kappa}$, which makes every non-maximal-cardinality set have measure zero, is a proper ideal. If this can be answered negatively for properties strengthening precipitousness, that would be interesting. 

It's consistent that the answer is no. Bartoszynski and Judah prove the following on page 26 in their book, Set Theory: On the Structure of the Real Line: 

Alexander the Great is staring at the Gordian Knot, bewildered. Absentmindedly he fingers the hilt of his trusty sword. On the sword is inscribed the words: "Change the order of summation". Mathematics is full of multiple-sum computations in which the crucial step is to change the order of summation. Unlike Alexander, though, I often see no conceputally clear reason why it ought to make the answer fall out. It is so unreasonably effective that I am tempted to do it without even thinking. Is there some unifying reason why one should try changing the order of summation? Or, to put it another way, maybe this is confirmation bias talking. Are there interesting computations where it's possible to change the order of summation, but the correct approach is not to change it? 

You probably know the following already. Oh, well. Anyway, Eric Nordenstam and I answered exactly this problem. It is a special case of Theorem 1 in our preprint, $URL$ and it also appears in the proceedings of FPSAC 2012. Our method was inspired (and suggested) by Krattenthaler: We guessed the answer from empirical data, and then proved our guess was right by multiplying the matrices out and confirming that the answer was the identity matrix. 

Axiom: $0^\sharp$ exists. $0^\sharp$ is a pivotal principle in the large cardinal hierarchy, but it is actually a set of natural numbers. If it exists, it is unique. 

Say that a partial order $P$ is forcing-rigid in a model $V$ if whenever $G \subseteq P$ is generic over $V$, then in $V[G]$, $G$ is the only filter which is $P$-generic over $V$. This implies there are no nontrivial automorphisms of $P$. If $P$ is forcing-rigid and $P$ forces "$\dot Q$ is forcing-rigid," then is $P * \dot Q$ forcing-rigid? 

I put this on stack exchange over a week ago with no answer, so let's try here. Consider a model of the form $\mathfrak{A} = (H_{\omega_2}, \in, \lhd, f_0, f_1, ...)$, some expansion of $H_{\omega_2}$ in a countable language, with $\lhd$ giving a well-order. Does there exist an infinite set $z$ of uncountable ordinals, such that for every $y \subseteq z$, $Sk^{\mathfrak{A}}(y) \cap z = y$? Perhaps the following observation will be useful. Note that the following are equivalent for a given infinite $z \subseteq \omega_2$. 

Theorem 2.65 in Woodin's book shows that a saturated ideal on $\omega_1$ exists after Levy-collapsing a Woodin cardinal $\delta$ to $\omega_2$. I am confused about the part of the argument where he shows that ideal he defines is a proper ideal. Claim (2.2) on page 50 says we can find a countable structure $X \prec H_{\delta^+}$ and an $X$-generic condition $p$ such that for all inaccessible $\gamma \in X \cap \delta$ and $Col(\omega_1,<\gamma)$-names $\tau \in X$ for a semi-proper subset of $\mathcal P(\omega_1)/NS$, there is a $\sigma \in X$ such that $p \Vdash \sigma \in \tau$ and $p \Vdash X \cap \omega_1 \in \sigma$. He says we construct this pair $(X,p)$ by an elementary chain. Suppose $X_0 \prec H_{\delta^+}$ and $p_0 \restriction \gamma \in X_0$. By definition of semi-proper, if $\tau \in X_0$ is as above, then $p_0 \Vdash_\gamma (\exists y \in \tau) Sk(X_0[G_\gamma] \cup \{ y \}) \cap \omega_1 = X_0[G_\gamma] \cap \omega_1$ and $X_0[G_\gamma] \cap \omega_1 \in y$. The problem I have is: How do we choose a name for $y$ with a similar property? There is a name $\sigma$ such that $p_0$ forces $\sigma^G$ witnesses the above property of $y$ in $V[G_\gamma]$, but could it be that $Sk(X_0 \cup \{ \sigma \}) \cap \omega_1 \not= X_0 \cap \omega_1$? Or perhaps there is a quite different strategy for building the elementary chain. Thanks for your help! 

You could symmetrize an arbitrary function by averaging it over the symmetric group. Explicitly: take your favourite function $h$ in $n$ variables, and set $f(r_1, ..., r_n) = \frac{1}{n!}\sum_{\sigma} h(r_{\sigma(1)}, ..., r_{\sigma(n)})$ where the sum is taken over all permutations $\sigma$ of the numbers $1,...,n$. I'd love to hear of an example which isn't obtained by symmetrization! edit: heh. Any such example would be its own symmetrization. So I guess in some sense this is a complete, if overly glib, answer. 

None of the other obvious statistics that describe this map are in the OEIS yet. Here are naive python implementations of $B_L, B_R, B_L^{-1}, B_R^{-1}$ if you want to check these assertions. 

I think it's a typo. It's probably rather more common than other typos, because the letters "t,h,g" are very close to each other on a standard keyboard. As a result, it actually does appear in the literature rather more often than you'd expect, and always without definition. (As such, I believe this post qualifies as a legitimate research question and shouldn't be closed, despite the fact that it's about a trivial typographical error. Hilarious!) For instance, here it is in a google books search result. It appears in the second page of an article in a collection of proceedings of a conference, without any definition. Elsewhere in the article it seems to be talking about orthogonality. Of course I'd be happy to be proven wrong - probably the best thing to do is to contact someone who's used the word in print. Maybe they know what it means. Edit: More evidence: compare the title to that of the pdf link, Also this: where the previous sentence uses the word "orthogonal") 

It is claimed that if there are two weakly compact cardinals, then there is a generic extension in which $\aleph_2$ and $\aleph_4$ have the tree property. Assuming one knows Mitchell's forcing, what is the argument? If you just iterate Mitchell's forcing twice, then why does the second stage preserve the tree property at $\aleph_2$? The second stage is $\aleph_2$ directed closed, but having the tree property be indestructubile under such forcings seems to require larger cardinals. 

A countably complete ideal $I$ on a set $Z$ ideal is c.c.c. when there is no uncountable family of pairwise disjoint $I$-positive subsets of $Z$. If such an ideal exists, then there exists a weakly Mahlo cardinal $\kappa$ and a $\kappa$-complete, c.c.c. ideal $J$ on $\kappa$. An example of such an ideal is the collection of measure zero subsets of a real-valued measurable cardinal. The existence of such an ideal, which is nowhere maximal ("ultra"), requires a large continuum. The standard proof of this is as follows. Build a tree of subsets of $\kappa$, with root $\kappa$. Suppose by induction that each level of the tree up to level $\alpha$ is a partition of $\kappa$. For every $J$-positive member of the partition, partition this into two disjoint $J$-positive sets. For members in $J$, don't split them. This gives you level $\alpha+1$ and a finer partition. At limit stages, take intersections. By the c.c.c., we must have all members of the partition in $J$ at level $\omega_1$, and no cofinal branches. There are $2^{<\omega_1} = 2^\omega$ many measure zero sets at that stage, so we have $\kappa$ equals a union of continuum many sets from $J$, so $2^\omega \geq \kappa$. My questions is: Does this process of building the tree terminate before $\omega_1$? If it does not, then by the c.c.c., some subtree of what we've constructed is a normal Suslin tree. So in some cases, we know the process does halt at a countable stage: (a) If we start with a measurable $\kappa$ and force MA$_\kappa$ with the Solovay-Tennenbaum forcing, we get no Suslin trees, and a c.c.c. ideal on $\kappa$. (b) By a result of Laver, we can start with a model of MA$_{\omega_2}$ and a measurable above, and then force a real-valued measurable cardinal by random real forcing, keeping SH. So the obvious question is, is there any way to get a c.c.c., $\kappa$-complete ideal $J$ on $\kappa$, where we can find a Suslin tree embedded in the algebra of $J$-positive sets? Can this be done by adding measurably many Cohen reals? 

It seems to me you should be able to work out a formula for $p_{ij}$ explicitly, by solving that system of linear equations you wrote down. More to the point, you can do this before deciding on what algorithm you're going to use to assign the ranks. For this solution to correspond to a real-world solution to your problem, it seems to me that the matrix $P = (p_{ij})$ ought to be doubly stochastic (its rows and columns should sum to 1), because everyone should get a rank, and every rank should get a person. If this doesn't happen, you're out of luck. Once you've done this, your doubly stochastic matrix $P$ can be expressed as a convex combination of permutation matrices (this is the Birkhoff-Von Neumann theorem). Each of these permutation matrices corresponds to a rank assignment. You should be able to come up with your algorithm, then, by finding a constructive proof of Birkhoff-Von Neumann and realizing it with code. I sort of doubt that this would be efficient without further cleverness, but it might be a place to start. 

This may be an easy question. Are the cardinals below the critical point of a precipitous ideal embedding always absolute between the generic ultrapower and the generic extension? To focus on the simplest case, suppose $I$ is a precipitous normal ideal on $\omega_2$. Let $G$ be generic for $\mathcal{P}(\omega_2)/I$. Let $j : V \to M$ be the generic ultrapower. Then $\omega_1^V$ is not moved by $j$, but could it be the case that $\omega_1^V$ is countable in $V[G]$? Of course the answer is no if $I$ has enough presaturation. Edit: As a subproblem towards a consistent negative answer, can we find (from some large cardinal assumption) a measurable $\kappa$ with measure $U$, and a $\kappa$-c.c. forcing $\mathbb{P}$ such that $\mathbb{P}$ preserves $\omega_1$, but $j_U(\mathbb{P})$ collapses $\omega_1$? (Not in $Ult(V,U)$ of course, but in $V$.) 

The character of an ultrafilter $U$, denoted $\chi(U)$, is the minimal size of an $A \subseteq U$ such that $(\forall x \in U ) (\exists y \in A) y \subseteq x$. This cardinal characteristic has been studied for ultrafilters on $\omega$. For all nonprincipal $U$, $\omega_1 \leq \chi(U)$, and it is known that, consistently, there exists nonprincipal $U$ with $\chi(U) < 2^\omega$. My question is, for normal ultrafilters $U$ on a measurable cardinal $\kappa$, is it possible that $\chi(U) < 2^\kappa$? Here are some relevant papers about ultrafilters on $\omega$, by Shelah, Brendle, and Hart: MR1686797, MR0987317, MR2365799, MR2847327 (available through $URL$
