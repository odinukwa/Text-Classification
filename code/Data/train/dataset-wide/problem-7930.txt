Tilting Peter Mueller's image by -18° as suggested by Noam D. Elkies and coloring the interior of certain orbits shows again the 5-fold symmetry, self-similarity and the closeness to Penrose tilings. 

It seems like there are no $C_d(n,2)$ for $n>d+1$ unless $n=2^d$. Is there an easy way to prove that? Now for $k>2$, apart from the rainbow construction, it is much harder to find general constructions. I wonder if it is possible to tweak certain combinatorical designs in order to obtain a suitable $D$ or, for dimension $d=2$, to build one from an appropriate set of latin squares. Or is there a construction for $k=3$ based on the above simplex constructions? As $k$ grows, searching for small $D$'s by hand feels a bit like solving a sudoku. While a $C_2(6,3)$ is still quite easy to find (e.g. $D= \pmatrix{ 0 & 1 & 2 & 0\\ 1 & 2 & 1 &3 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 0\\ 4& 3&4&5 }$), I have the impression that no $C_2(n,3)$ exists for $n>6$, except of course $n=9=3^2$. The following question seems well motivated: 

I am quite sure the answer to the initial question is no, and it may even be interesting to restrict it to the following: 

(too long for a comment) I think there is nothing happening modulo 5, at least not in a number-theoretical sense. It is first of all the visual impression because of the fact that most of the segments linking a point $P_n$ to $P_{n+5}$ have a slope close to 0 (about $-.06$), so they are geometrically closer than, say, $P_n$ and $P_{n+6}$, meaning that we easily perceive those patterns as "almost horizontal" lines (depending on the scaling), slightly descending. IMO what is more striking is the fact that the real parts show a "very close to linear" progression of about 1/17 from $P_n$ to $P_{n+1}$, and that every 5 of them (from time to time 6), the imaginary part, usually increasing, "jumps" back to the bottom. The top points (11, 32, 53, ...) are 21 apart (from time to time 26), with the points 116, 184, 231..., which "should" be on top but cause a distance 26 instead of 21, jumping even lower. This reminds me a lot of what happens when projecting a sinusoidal curve wrapped around a cylinder (Lissajous curves): If you choose points on the sinus curve with linearly progressing x-coordinates, their projections will behave very similarly as the $P_n$'s here. There should be some constant $\approx 5.2$ for the average period of the jumps, and so the main question would be how to find this constant, which does not seem to be related to $\frac{\pi e}2$. 

It is striking that some q-analogs of functions, operators, identities and especially whole theorems seem quite "canonical", e.g. 

In particular for $d=-7$, we have by the Carlson symmetric form $$\frac12\int\limits_0^\infty\dfrac{dt}{\sqrt{t(t+1)(t+\frac{8+3\sqrt 7}{16})}} =K(k_7)=\dfrac1{7^{1/4}4\pi}\Gamma\left(\dfrac17\right)\Gamma\left(\dfrac27\right)\Gamma\left(\dfrac47\right),$$ on the other hand I have seen somewhere (I can't remember the reference) $$\int\limits_0^\infty\dfrac{dt}{\sqrt{t(t^2+21t+112)}} =\dfrac1{4\pi\sqrt{7}}\Gamma\left(\dfrac17\right)\Gamma\left(\dfrac27\right)\Gamma\left(\dfrac47\right)=\frac{K(k_7)}{7^{1/4}}.$$ I would like to get it straight at least for this example: 

I wouldn't be surprised if this kind of problem has already been examined somewhere. Pointers welcome. 

$\qquad$ The right picture shows one of those pyramid-like tiles (more precisely, a triangular and a quadrangular pyramid with a common face). There are two for each vertex of the truncated octahedron, and they have obviously all different orientations. They are cut off by the $6+3$ perpendicular bisector planes of the edges and the 3 planes of the octahedron's squares. This realizes $p(T)=48$ and generalizes quite directly the plane construction with a regular hexagon as fundamental unit, subdivided by the 3 main diagonals and the 3 "heights" into 12 triangles with angles $30°,60°,90°$. 

More generally now, define $$J(m,n,k)=J(n,m,k):= \int_0^1\frac{x^m(1-x)^n}{\sin^k\pi x}dx.$$For this to converge, we need $m,n\geqslant k$. Experimentally, the situation for $k=2$ is quite similar to the $k=1$ case in that $J(m,n,k)$ is a rational combination of values $\dfrac{\zeta(i)}{\pi^{i+1}}$ with $i$ running over all odd numbers between $\min(m,n)$ and $m+n-1$, e.g. $$J(7,4,2)=\dfrac{105}2\left(-\dfrac{\zeta(5)}{\pi^6}+51\dfrac{\zeta(7)}{\pi^8}-405\dfrac{\zeta(9)}{\pi^{10}}\right).$$ This leads to new possibilities of representing odd zeta values as integrals, this time with $\sin^2\pi x$ in the denominator. Writing as a shortcut $h_m:=J(m,m,2)$, we can for example express $\dfrac{\zeta(2n-1)}{\pi^{2n}}$ as a rational combination of $h_2,\dots,h_n$, i.e. as an integral $$\dfrac{\zeta(2n-1)}{\pi^{2n}}=\int_0^1q_n(x-x^2)\frac{x^2(1-x)^2}{\sin^2\pi x}dx,$$ where $q_n$ is a unique polynomial of degree $n-2$. The first of them are: $$\begin{align} \zeta(3)&=\frac{\pi^4}{6}h_2 \\ \zeta(5)&=\frac{\pi^6}{90}(h_2 +2h_3),\qquad \text{ i. e. } q_2(z)=\frac{1}{90}(1+2z) \quad \text{ etc. }\\ \zeta(7)&=\frac{\pi^8}{1890}(2h_2 +4h_3+3h_4)\\ \zeta(9)&=\frac{\pi^{10}}{28350}(3h_2 +6h_3+5h_4+2h_5)\\ \zeta(11)&=\frac{\pi^{12}}{935550}(10h_2 +20h_3+17h_4+8h_5+2h_6)\\ \zeta(13)&=\frac{\pi^{14}}{638512875}(\color{blue}{691}h_2 +1382h_3+1180h_4+574h_5+175h_6+30h_7)\\ \end{align}$$ Experimentally, in $\dfrac{\zeta(2n-1)}{\pi^{2n}}$ the last coefficient (i.e. the one of $h_n$ and the leading term of $q_n$) is $\dfrac{2^{2n-2}}{(2n)!}$ and the one preceding it is $\dfrac{n(n-2)}6\dfrac{2^{2n-2}}{(2n)!}$, while for the first coefficient (equally, the constant term of $q_n$), the occurrence of $\color{blue}{691}$ in the expression for $\zeta(13)$ suggests that it involves the Bernoulli number $B_{2n-2}$. 

I'm astonished that nobody has mentioned I. G. Macdonald's classic Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials. It is more than 50 years old but fun to read, compact, self-contained, elegant, deep. 

This is not an answer but too long for a comment. It is a heuristical argument that $\frac{k+1}2$ should be best possible. It is easy to see that for an optimal arrangement, $1$ and $k^2$ must both occupy corners. Supposing opposite corners, consider the (monotone) lattice paths between them. Each path covers $2(k-1)$ of the differences we are looking for, so the average difference of those is at least $\frac{k^2-1}{2(k-1)}=\frac{k+1}2$ for each such path (equal if the numbers on the path are strictly increasing, greater otherwise). This is not a proof because summing over all those paths, the differences are not counted equally often. But maybe it can be made into a proof. Problem: if the corners of $1$ and $k^2$ are not opposite, such an argument won't work. The torus case seems harder, it looks like optimal constuctions may be different for even and odd $k$. 

It is well-known that if ${\{{F_n}\}}$ is a random Fibonacci sequence then we have almost certainly $\lim \limits_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{|F_n|}=\tau$ where $\tau\approx 1.554682275$ is Viswanath's constant. There is also a simplified version of Viswanath's proof with some more motivation. Now, the Khinchine-Lévy constant $\gamma=e^{\pi^2/(12\ln2)}$ (sometimes also called Lévy constant) is obtained in a quite similar way as $\lim \limits_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{q_n}$ for almost all reals $x$, where $\frac{p_n}{q_n}$ is the $n$th convergent of the continued fraction of $x$. (Note that we might as well take $\lim \limits_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{p_n}$.) So the question: 

Thinking at it again: Even more simply, for the general case, it can be done with 7 non-congruent isosceles triangles as in the picture, using 3 right triangles $CDE, ABF, BEF$. Segments of same color have same lengths. $E$ is the midpoint of $BC$, and $BF$ is the height in $ABE$. 

Note that in those quadruples, a few primes do occur. And among the eigenvalues... the first prime ($-19$) only appears at $d=133$. So far, all prime factors of the eigenvalues divide at least one of $a,b,c,d$. Moreover, if the two eigenvalues have a common prime factor, it divides most often (but sadly not always) three of $a,b,c,d$. This all is intriguing and raises the following question, which is certainly interesting on its own (whether or not integral graphs exist):
