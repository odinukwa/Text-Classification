The Schoof-Elkies-Atkin (SEA) algorithm (for counting points on elliptic curves over a finite field) performs computations over polynomials modulo some modular polynomials. Originally the "classical" modular polynomials (the minimum polynomial of the modular function $\tau \mapsto j(\ell \tau)$ for a given prime $\ell$). It turns out that the coefficients of this polynomial increase very fast with the prime $\ell$, so in practice other polynomials should be used. In the Handbook of Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (Cohen and Frey), they present the "canonical" modular polynomials, and apparently people also use the Weber modular polynomials (Genus 1 point counting records over prime fields), which have even smaller coefficients, but I cannot find any reference on how to use them. And people also talk about other polynomials (Atkin polynomials ?). In all the descriptions of SEA I could find, they just use the classical version and add a side note "in practice we would use other polynomials". So here is the question: is there any literature dealing with those alternatives of the classical modular polynomials? (comparing them, which one is the best in the context of SEA, and how to use them even though they don't give as much information as the classical one). Which ones are used in the state-of-the-art implementations of SEA and why? (e.g. in Magma). 

@Todd Trimble is correct; a strict fusion category is just a fusion category that is strict as a monoidal category. (Being strict or being fusion is just a property of a monoidal category that can either hold or fail.) In particular, the pentagon axiom holds, where the associators are identities on the nose. Moreover, there is a version of MacLane's theorem for pivotal fusion categories, see Section 2 of arXiv:0503167v2. As someone who studies planar algebras, at one time I was very confused about this, and I think I know where the confusion lies. Let's focus on the fusion category $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$ where $\omega\in Z^3(G,\mathbb{C}^\times)$ is a cohomologically nontrivial 3-cocycle. The discussion below comes from a conversation I had with Scott Morrison which cleared up my confusion. We will give two realizations of the fusion category $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$. The first has only one representative for each isomorphism class of simple objects. There are exactly $|G|$ many 1-dimensional simple objects denoted $V_g$ for $g\in G$, with fusion rules given by $V_g \otimes V_h = V_{gh}$, and associator given by $$ (V_g\otimes V_h) \otimes V_k \xrightarrow{\omega_{g,h,k}} V_g\otimes (V_h\otimes V_k). $$ The associators are easily seen to satisfy the pentagon axiom because of the 3-cocycle condition. Now there's also a planar presentation of $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$. Usually, when we talk about a planar presentation, we're working with strict categories, because drawing strings next to each other in the plane is associative on the nose. (One can get around this by bending strings closer or further from other strings, or by drawing coupons for associators, but let's not do this here.) The category $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$ has a planar presentation via oriented strands labelled by group elements (considering an oriented label the same as the reverse orientation with the inverse label), trivalent vertices 

Let $K$ be a finite field, and $\overline{K}$ its algebraic closure. It is well known that two curves are isomorphic over $\overline{K}$ if and only if they have the same $j$-invariant. If two such curves are also $K$-isogenous, I believe we can conclude that they are $K$-isomorphic, but I cannot find any reference or elementary proof of this fact; is it easy to see, or does anyone have a reference? (it seems that this result is implicitly used in the algorithms for isogeny graphs of elliptic curves, like Kohel's, where the isogenous curves are encoded by there $j$-invariant). As a side question, given a $j \in K$, how many curves over $K$ have this $j$-invariant, up to $K$-isomorphisms? For example, a (non-supersingular) curve and its quadratic twist both have the same $j$-invariant, but are not $K$-isogenous, so not $K$-isomorphic, so we have at least two $K$-isomorphism classes; is this it? 

There is a $g\in G$ with $|\mathcal{O} _{gH}|\neq |\mathcal{O} _{g^{-1}H}|$, $|\mathcal{O} _{gH}|=\infty$ if and only if $|\mathcal{O} _{g^{-1}H}|=\infty$, and There is a constant $M>0$ such that $\displaystyle \frac{|\mathcal{O} _{gH}|}{|\mathcal{O} _{g^{-1}H}|} \leq M$ for all $g\in G$ with $|\mathcal{O} _{gH}|,|\mathcal{O} _{g^{-1}H}|\neq \infty$. 

The answer to the second part is also no. That is, $aa^*+bb^*$ could be zero for nonzero $a$ and $b$. Look at the $*$-algebra $\mathbb{C}^2$ with component-wise addition and multiplcation and $*$ given by $(x,y)^* = (\overline{y},\overline{x})$. It's straightforward to calculate that anything of the form $aa^*$ will look like $(z,\overline{z})$ for some $z\in\mathbb{C}$. Conversely, $(z,\overline{z})=(z,1)(z,1)^*$. We see $(z,\overline{z})$ and $(w,\overline{w})$ sum to $(z+w, \overline{z+w})$, so $aa^*+bb^*$ is still of the form $cc^*$. But taking $w=-z$ gives a sum of zero. 

For Galois groups up through degree eight, you can easily provide an infinte number of examples by the function field extensions listed here: Some polynomials over Q(t) and their Galois groups 

It is possible for nonisomorphic fields to have the same discriminant, and even to be arithmetically equivalent, meaning with the same Dedekind zeta function. Previous questions which discussed this are "Number fields with same discriminant and regulator?" and "Are there two non-isomorphic number fields with the same degree, class number and discriminant?". The usual way this comes about involves fields with isomorphic subfields. I would find it useful if the discriminant sufficed to characterize number fields whose splitting field had a simple Galois group, so that there were no subfields. So the question is, can there be two nonisomorphic fields with the same degree, the same discriminant and the same simple Galois group for the splitting field? 

I am interested in the following situation: given a braid $B$, it induces a link $L$ in a pretty straightforward way ("glue" the endpoints, like here). For a braid $B$, we know how to represent it in a normal form, which provides in particular a complete invariant of the braid (two braids have the same normal form if and only if they are equivalent). The computation of a normal form can be done efficiently. But once the link is formed... what can be done? I don't think we know any computable normal form for links... But do we know any good invariant? By "good invariant" I mean: 0) If two links are equivalent, their invariant is the same (definition of an invariant, nothing new here), 1) It can be computed in polynomial time, 2) If two links are not equivalent, they have same invariant with negligible probability (for some notion of "negligible probability"...) 

I am looking for a reference for a complete list of 3-cocycle representatives for $H^3(D_{2n},\mathbb{C}^\times)$, where $$ D_{2n}=\langle a, b\mid a^2=b^2=(ab)^n=e\rangle $$ is the dihedral group of order $2n$. Here's what I believe so far, but I do not know much group cohomology. First, I believe there are isomorphisms $$ H^3(D_{2n},\mathbb{C}^\times)\cong H^4(D_{2n},\mathbb{Z})\cong H_3(D_{2n},\mathbb{Z}). $$ I calculated these groups in GAP for $2\leq n\leq 10$, and I got the following formula: $$ H_3(D_{2n},\mathbb{Z}) \cong \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z}/2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/n & \text{if $n$ is even}\\ \mathbb{Z}/2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}/n & \text{if $n$ is odd.} \end{cases} $$ Are these formulas correct? Is there a reference for this, or does it follow by some spectral sequence calculation? Why is there an extra factor of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ when $n$ is even? Second, I believe I have a formula for 3-cocycles representing the $\mathbb{Z}/n$ factor, which is the factor I most care about. To give this formula, I use the following notation. First, represent the elements of $D_{2n}$ by the alternating words in $a,b$ with length at most $2n-1$ which always start with $a$. For such a word $w$, let $|w|$ be its length. If $\zeta_n=\exp(2\pi i / n)$, then for $k=0,\dots, n-1$, I believe the maps $$ \lambda_k(x,y,z) = \begin{cases} (\zeta_n^k)^{(-1)^{|x|} \lfloor (|x|+1)/2\rfloor } & \text{if $|y|$ is even and $|y|+|z|\geq 2n$}\\ (\zeta_n^k)^{(-1)^{|x|+1} \lfloor (|x|+1)/2\rfloor } & \text{if $|y|$ is odd and $|z|>|y|$}\\ 1 & \text{else} \end{cases} $$ give a complete list of normalized 3-cocycle representatives for the $\mathbb{Z}/n$ factor of $H^3(D_{2n},\mathbb{C}^\times)$. Certainly the $\lambda_k$ act like $\mathbb{Z}/n$ under multiplication, but is there an easy way to see they are not cohomologous? Is there an easier way to express these formulas, perhaps by choosing a different presentation of $D_{2n}$? Finally, the formulas above yield the trivial 3-cocycle when restricted to the two copies of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ generated by $a$ and $b$. To see this, just note $\lambda_k$ is normalized, $\lambda_k(a,a,a) = 1$, and if $w=(ab)^{n-1}a$, which is equal to $b$, then $\lambda_k(w,w,w) = 1$. (In both cases, $|y|$ is odd and $|y|=|z|$.) I believe any 3-cocycle representatives for the other cohomology classes should not restrict trivially to at least one of these copies of $\mathbb{Z}/2$. Partial answers would be greatly appreciated as well!
