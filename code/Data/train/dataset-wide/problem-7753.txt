Let $ |A \rangle $ and $ |B \rangle $ be two non-zero vectors of a Hilbert space $ \mathcal{H} $ that belong to two different one-dimensional subspaces of $ \mathcal{H} $. According to Dirac, $ |A \rangle $ and $ |B \rangle $ represent two different quantum states. Now, consider two non-trivial superpositions of $ |A \rangle $ and $ |B \rangle $: $$ |R_{1} \rangle := a_{1} |A \rangle + b_{1} |B \rangle \quad \& \quad |R_{2} \rangle := a_{2} |A \rangle + b_{2} |B \rangle, $$ where non-trivial means that $ (a_{1},b_{1}),(a_{2},b_{2}) \in \mathbb{C}^{2} \setminus \lbrace (0,0) \rbrace $. If $ |R_{1} \rangle $ and $ |R_{2} \rangle $ are to represent the same quantum state, then they must lie in the same one-dimensional subspace of $ \mathcal{H} $, i.e., they must be non-zero scalar multiples of each other. Knowing this, write $ |R_{2} \rangle = \lambda |R_{1} \rangle $, where $ \lambda \in \mathbb{C}^{\times} $. As $ \lbrace |A \rangle,|B \rangle \rbrace $ is a linearly independent subset of $ \mathcal{H} $, it follows that the condition $ (a_{2},b_{2}) = \lambda (a_{1},b_{1}) $ must be met. This condition does not hold for all choices of $ (a_{1},b_{1}) $ and $ (a_{2},b_{2}) $ in $ \mathbb{C}^{2} \setminus \lbrace (0,0) \rbrace $. Therefore, in general, $ |R_{1} \rangle $ does not represent the same quantum state as $ |R_{2} \rangle $. 

This problem was posed on Math StackExchange some time ago, but it did not garner any solutions there. I think that it is interesting enough to be posed here on Math Overflow, so here it goes. Let $ \mathcal{A} $ be a unital Banach algebra over $ \mathbb{C} $, with $ \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{A}} $ denoting the identity of $ \mathcal{A} $. For each $ a \in \mathcal{A} $, define the spectrum of $ a $ to be the following subset of $ \mathbb{C} $: $$ {\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}}(a) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \lbrace \lambda \in \mathbb{C} ~|~ \text{$ a - \lambda \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{A}} $ is not invertible} \rbrace. $$ With the aid of the Hahn-Banach Theorem and Liouville's Theorem from complex analysis, one can prove the well-known result that $ {\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}}(a) \neq \varnothing $ for every $ a \in \mathcal{A} $. All proofs that I have seen of this result use the Hahn-Banach Theorem in one way or another (a typical proof may be found in Walter Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis). Hence, a natural question to ask would be: Can we remove the dependence of this result on the Hahn-Banach Theorem? Is it a consequence of ZF only? Otherwise, if it is equivalent to some weak variant of the Axiom of Choice (possibly weaker than the Hahn-Banach Theorem itself), has anyone managed to construct a model of ZF containing a Banach algebra that has an element with empty spectrum? 

There is a beautiful observation of my advisor John Moore that to my mind ought to be part of the focus of any such argument: the Hopf algebra $H_{\ast}(BU;Z)$, or equivalently $H^*(BU;Z)$ is self-dual. This is pure algebra and streamlines the presentation. My preferred presentation is in Section 21.6 of May and Ponto, More Concise Algebraic Topology, available at Amazon or University of Chicago Press. Incidentally, there is a proof of real Bott periodicity along the same lines due to Moore (and written up by Cartan if memory serves) in one of the 1950's Cartan seminars and another such proof by Dyer and Lashof. The funny thing is that each of these proofs finds one of the six equivalences one has to prove more difficult than all of the others, but they find difficulty with different ones: combining the easier of the respective arguments gives a clean and instructive homological proof. 

I don't have time to wade through terminology, but this seems to be an exercise in avoiding the use of simplicial homotopies, as defined for example in Definition 5.1 on page 12 of Simplicial Objects in Algebraic Topology. These homotopies make sense for simplicial objects in any ambient category $\mathcal{C}$ whatsoever, so that with this notion there is no such thing as a $\mathcal{C}$ "with insufficient structure to support homotopies''. Extra degeneracies give a particularly convenient way to construct just such a homotopy. If you have a terminal object, then you have a trivial map $\epsilon$ from any simplicial object $X$ to the constant simplicial object $\ast$ at the terminal object. A "base point'' is a map $\eta$ from $\ast$ to $X$ and is determined by a map in $\mathcal{C}$ from the terminal object to $X_0$. Then $\epsilon \circ \eta$ is the identity on $\ast$ and we say that $X$ is contractible if $\eta\circ \epsilon$ is homotopic to the identity. That makes sense in any $\mathcal{C}$, and it agrees with the usual notion in the usual examples. 

This is an excellent question that I have thought a lot about. I'd rather answer it in a more general context that was motivated by what I knew to be true in the stable homotopy category. The reference is "The additivity of traces in triangulated categories", #99 on my web site. The essential point there is to formulate axioms relating triangulations to symmetric monoidal structures, and Axiom (TC3), with $Z=Cf$ and $Z'=Cg$, formulates exactly what happens when you smash two triangles (cofiber sequences) together. The motivation in terms of your question is given on page 49; I think the diagrams on pages 49 and 50 display the `filtration' you ask for, in appropriate generality, and they are what you see when you follow through on your concrete question. The equivalent form (TC3') of (TC3) may perhaps be easier to compare with your question, since it has $Z \wedge Z'$ conveniently displayed as the end target. The description of the proof of (TC3) on pages 60-61 follows the lines of your question. Edit: the page numbers above are those of the published paper; the page numbers of the file on my web site are 12-13 (for 49-50) and 21-22 (for 60-61). 

The mathematical economist Kenneth Arrow showed in a landmark paper (stemming from his PhD thesis) that one obtains a contradiction if all five assumptions are assumed to hold. In fact, Assumptions (1) - (4) imply the existence of a dictator. However, these assumptions seem fairly reasonable and consistent, so the fact that they are contradictory is why Arrow named his paper “A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare”. His result is known nowadays as Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. 

On the first page of Chapter 1 of Rieffel's Deformation Quantization for Actions of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $, Rieffel defines a family of seminorms on the space $ A^{\infty} $ of smooth vectors of a Fréchet space $ A $, for some action $ \alpha $ of the Lie group $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $ on $ A $, as follows. Suppose we already have a family $ (\| \cdot \|_{i})_{i \in \mathbb{N}} $ of seminorms on $ A $ that determine its topology. Choose a basis $ \lbrace X_{1},\ldots,X_{d} \rbrace $ of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $. Then for each $ k \in \lbrace 1,\ldots,d \rbrace $, let $ \alpha_{X_{k}} $ denote the operator of partial differentiation on $ A^{\infty} $ in the direction of $ X_{k} $; we thus identify $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $ with its Lie algebra in the usual way. For convenience, denote $ \alpha_{X_{k}} $ simply by $ \partial_{k} $. Next, for any multi-index $ \mu = (\mu_{1},\ldots,\mu_{d}) \in \mathbb{N}_{0}^{d} $, let $ \partial^{\mu} $ denote the higher-order partial derivative $ \partial_{1}^{\mu_{1}} \cdots \partial_{d}^{\mu_{d}} $. Then equip $ A^{\infty} $ with the seminorms $$ \forall (j,k) \in \mathbb{N} \times \lbrace 1,\ldots,d \rbrace ~~ \& ~~ \forall a \in A^{\infty}: \quad \| a \|_{j,k} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \sup_{1 \leq i \leq j} \sum_{|\mu| \leq k} \frac{\| \partial^{\mu} a \|_{i}}{\mu!}, $$ where $ |\mu| \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \mu_{1} + \cdots + \mu_{d} $ and $ \mu! \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \mu_{1}! \cdots \mu_{d}! $. My question is: As we are applying partial derivatives to $ a \in A^{\infty} $, are we identifying $ a $ with the function $ f_{a}: \mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow A $ defined by $ {f_{a}}(\mathbf{x}) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \alpha(\mathbf{x},a) $? Thank you very much in advance! 

Hi, this is a continuation of a previous question I asked about the convexity of an optimization problem I am working with. Consider the function \begin{multline} B_i(a_0,\mathbf{p}) \equiv B(\vec{x}_i,a_0,\mathbf{p}) = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & -p_{N}^*/a_0 \\\ p_{N}/a_0 & 1 \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\\ 0 & z_{N}(\vec{x}_i) \end{array}\right) \cdots \\\ \left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & -p_1^*/a_0 \\\ p_1/a_0 & 1 \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\\ 0 & z_1(\vec{x}_i) \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{cc} a_0 \\\ 0 \end{array} \right), \end{multline} where the variable $a_0$ is between 0 and 1, and the variables $\mathbf{p} = [\begin{array}{ccc} p_1 & \cdots & p_N \end{array}]$ satisfy $\vert p_j \vert \leq a_0$. The $z_j(\vec{x}_i)$'s are complex exponentials, e.g., $z_j(\vec{x}_i) = e^{\imath \vec{x}_i \cdot \vec{k}_j}$, where $\vec{x}_i$ is a spatial location and $\vec{k}_j$ is a spatial frequency location. Here is the optimization problem: \begin{equation} \begin{array}{lll} \textrm{maximize} & a_0 & \\\ \textrm{subject to} & 0 \leq a_0 \leq 1 & \\\ & \vert p_j \vert \leq a_0, & j = 1,\dots,N \\\ & \vert B^d_i - B_i(a_0,\mathbf{p}) \vert \leq \delta_i, & i = 1,\dots,N_s \\\ & a_0^2 \prod_{j=1}^N(1+\vert p_j \vert^2/a_0^2) \leq 1, & \end{array} \end{equation} where $B^d_i$ is a target spatial pattern I want to achieve at spatial location $\vec{x}_i$, with maximum error $\delta_i$, and $N_s$ is the number of spatial locations I consider. $B^d_i$ has a maximum magnitude of 1. The variables are $a_0$ and $\mathbf{p}$. Here is how I solve it, using bisection on $a_0$. I set initial lower and upper bounds on $a_0$ based on the result of a much faster, approximate optimization method. Then, for the initial lower-bound $a_0$ value, I solve the following feasibility problem, holding $a_0$ fixed: \begin{equation} \begin{array}{lll} \textrm{minimize} & r & \\\ \textrm{subject to} & \delta_i^{-2} \vert B^d_i - B_i(\mathbf{p};a_0) \vert^2 \leq r, & i = 1,\dots,N_s \\\ & \vert p_j \vert \leq 1, & j = 1,\dots,N \\\ & a_0^2\prod_{j=1}^{N}\left(1 + \vert p_j \vert^2/a_0^2\right) \leq 1, \end{array}. \end{equation} I solve this subproblem using the barrier method, with Quasi-Newton search directions for $\mathbf{p}$. If that problem is solved with $r \leq 1$, then these values of $a_0$ and $\mathbf{p}$ are feasible, and I can set the lower $a_0$ bound to this value of $a_0$, and repeat the problem at the midway point between this value of $a_0$ and the upper bound $a_0$. If $r > 1$, then these $a_0$ and $\mathbf{p}$ are infeasible, and I set the upper bound $a_0$ to this $a_0$, and solve the problem again for the midway point between the lower bound $a_0$ and the new upper bound $a_0$. I stop when $a_0$ stops changing by very much. My question: Is this problem convex? I have already proven that $a_0^2 \prod_{j=1}^N(1+\vert p_j \vert^2/a_0^2) \leq 1$ is convex in the domain of this problem, so it remains to be answered whether the $B_i$ error functions are convex. In a response to a previous question I asked it was shown that when $B^d_i = 0$, $\vec{x}_i = 0$ and $N=3$, then $\vert B^d_i - B_i(a_0,\mathbf{p})\vert $ is NOT convex. So, is it possible that when I use, for example, the barrier method to solve this problem, that the sum of the log-barriers for the $B_i$ error functions is a convex function? 

Probably what David has in mind is the old (1961) result of Huber that if X is a paracompact Hausdorff space, then the $n$th Cech cohomology group of X with coefficients in $\pi$ is isomorphic to the actual set of homotopy classes of maps $X\longrightarrow K(\pi,n).$ So Jeff is perhaps expressing a preference for Cech over singular cohomology. As Chris says, current practice in algebraic topology is to accept the weak equivalence axiom. Model theoretically, that expresses a preference for the Quillen (or the mixed) model structure over the Strom model structure on spaces. 

There are serious problems making your ideas coherent here! The notion of operad was in large part intended to model kinds of algebras whose laws do not involve repeated variables, do not involve diagonal maps. Operads do not even model groups, in particular, and that was intended. Any $E_{\infty}$ operad models all connective spectra, not just connected ones, the essential point being that the zeroth space of the spectrum associated to an $E_{\infty}$-space $X$, no matter how constructed, must be a group completion of $X$. There is no "the" $E_{\infty}$ operad, rather there are many interesting ones. (There is an axiomatization of infinite loop space machines, due to Thomason and myself, that makes this precise.) If you want to model $E_{\infty}$ ring spectra using operads only, you can make a mistake by trying to use just one operad, as I did over 40 years ago, or you can do it right by using two interrelated operads, one for the addition and one for the multiplication, as I also did over 40 years ago. See $URL$ for a modern recapitulation of that early theory. 

I'm rushed, so this might not be right, but it feels right. Consider reduced operads in a cartesian monoidal category, so that $C(0) = \ast$. A monoid $M$ in our category gives a reduced operad $R(M)$ with $j$th object $M^j$. The structure map $$M^k\times M^{j_1}\times\cdots M^{j_k}\to M^{j_1+\cdots + j_k}$$ has coordinates given by multiplying the $h$th coordinate of $M^k$ with the coordinates of $M^{j_h}$. This is a right adjoint to the functor $L$ that sends a reduced operad $C$ to $C(1)$ with the evident product and unit. The isomorphism of hom sets uses the degeneracy operators that are there because we are working with reduced operads. Obviously $LR= id$. Very often $id\to RL$ is an inclusion. That happens for little whatnots. Very rarely, only in uninteresting cases, is $id\to RL$ an isomorphism. That doesn't happen for little whatnots.
