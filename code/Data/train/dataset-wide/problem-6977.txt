There is a lot of newish research on the adverse consequences of Globalisation and more generally De-industrialization on low skilled workers in developed economies. A good place to start is Autor, Dorn, Hanson in the AER 2013. David Autor has other interesting work on this topic as well as on automation. Your questions have quite a normative ring to themselves, and it seems to me you already know what kind of answers you want. It is true that discussing the adverse effects of Globalisation or technological progress on some people in rich countries has become a more active research topic. But I think most people are very still far from questioning free trade or technological progress as Pareto efficient. And I think the overwhelming majority of economists still thinks that industrial policy in a developed country is a silly idea. So I don't think you are going to find this big trend you are looking for. Also, as a sidenote, even development economics has moved quite far from the kind of research that debated the industrial policy you have in mind. It's mostly about RCTs and institutions now. 

I hope this question is not too general in nature; I just wanted to ask the members of this community their opinion on the following question: How can one choose between the Bayesian approach and the Frequentist Approach? In what context is one approach better than the other? The reason I ask this is because whenever I attempt to answer causal empirical questions, I immediately think of trying to estimate Treatment Effects (for instance using difference in means, Difference-in-differences or matching estimators). On the other hand, when I wish to forecast, Ive heard that Bayesian Model Averaging Techniques often outpeform linear projections. On what basis can I choose between the two approaches? Thanks! 

I have a question regarding the Bartik Instrument. I understand that this instrument is a particularly important tool that is used in labor economics. From my understanding, this instrument attempts to isolate demand shocks from supply shocks. Consider the following thought experiment: Say that we have an equilibrium quantity determined both the labor demand and labor supply. Call it total labor employed in period t in region i. We can express it as:$$L_{it}=\sum_{j}L_{ijt}$$ where the RHS is the summation over all industries hiring labor in this region. Now, the problem is as follows: the changes in total labor hired in each industry is a result of both supply and demand shocks. What the Bartik Instrument does is that it constructs local labor demand shocks in the following manner:$$\tilde{L_{it}}=\sum_{j}\omega_{jt}L_{ijt-1}$$ where the LHS is region $i's$ predicted employment. The summation is basically a weighted average using weights which corresponding to growth rates in national level employment in industry $j$ times the labor force employed in industry j by region $i$ at time $t$. In a sense, these are changes that are unrelated to local labor supply shocks. The Bartik instrument is then calculated as $\frac{\tilde{L_{it}}-L_{it-1}}{L_{it-1}}$ This is where I am lost. Once I construct this 'instrument', what would be my first stage? Do I need a first stage anymore? My intuition tells me yes. What I mean is that is this already the predicted value that we obtain after a first stage? Let me phrase my question in a more intuitive manner:$$L=f(L^{d},L^{s})$$ As a result,$$dL=f_{L^d}dL^{d}+f_{L^S}dL^{s}$$ Now, in a stochastic environment:$$dL=f_{L^D}dL^{d}+f_{L^S}dL^{s}+v =f_{L^D}dL^{d}+\epsilon$$ where I assume that $$cov(dL^{d},\epsilon)=0$$ or that demand shocks and supply shocks are unrelated. In the first stage then, is the RHS the constructed Bartik instrument? In that case, I would regress the total observed change in labor on the Bartik instrument and obtain $\hat{dL}$ . Or is it the case that the constructed Bartik instrument by itself serves as $\hat{dL}$ ? Thanks a lot! 

You need to remember two properties of derivatives and expectations. Everything else stays the same. 

I am by no means an expert on this, but maybe this helps. Here is a simple example for a bellman equation $V(y) = \max_x u(x,y) + \beta V(y')$ $s.t. \, y' = f(x,y)$ This is a functional equation in an unknown function V. A solution to this problem is a function V that satisfies the equation above. If you look at the equation, it's pretty clear that the solution has to be a fixed point of the operator on the RHS of the bellman equation: if you take the correct V and an arbitrary y and calculate $\max_x u(x,y) + \beta V(y')$ $s.t. \, y' = f(x,y)$ you will get $V(y)$. The operator that is the RHS of the Bellman equation operates on functions, and the solution is a fixed point in some space of functions. It's a different question whether this fixed point exists and how to find it. Here, you appeal to the contraction mapping theorem: under typical assumptions on u and provided $\beta<1$, the maximization step above is a contraction mapping for any guess of V. This means that there exists a unique fixed point V, and you can find it by successive iteration. 

There are perhaps a variety of theories that can explain this, but I'll have a go at what seems intuitive to me. First, to answer your question, one will have to ask the question: "What determines interest rates?" In an economically perfect (frictionless, decentralized) world, the supply and demand of loanable funds would determine the interest rate. However, we know that it is the central bank, in most advanced countries, that sets the interest rate. Now, what does an interest rate mean? One way of looking at it is the cost of borrowing funds. The central bank sets an interest rate, so that bonds are priced according to this rate. For instance, Treasury Bills (30 -day, 90 day) etc. Now,, these are instruments for the government to raise money to finance expenditure. If we are agreed on the point that countries that are "richer" or more "advanced" have banking systems that people have more faith in, then they need to offer less on any amount borrowed. In other words, people will buy these bonds, and will need a not very high interest rate because it is basically a riskless asset. Countries where the banking system is not developed enough will have to offer higher rates to compensate for risk. 

This is/was a huge topic in macro and labor. Traditionally, macroeconomists calibrate models that require huge labor supply elasticities to match the data. Then labor economists estimate labor supply elasticities from micro data and find very very low elasticities. Imo the labor estimates are more trustworthy than the macro calibrations. Check out $URL$ for a summary of the issue and citations to the further literature. 

Your reasoning for the 1st part is correct. The 2nd part is a 2-period game. You should try to solve it by backward induction. First you go through all the 2nd period subgames. Then you can use the payoffs of the subgames and write up the investment decision subgame as a bimatrix game. However, the question is poorly written and as stated this game has no Nash equilibria in pure continous strategies. Let's go through the reasoning as to why. First, let's find the NE for all possible cases in the 2nd period. 

The underlying reason are probably differences in labor productivity. Assuming decreasing marginal productivity of labor, the real question is why migration flows do not equate labor productivity and wages as would be predicted by simple GE models. I can think of several factors: 

currency is like a taxi for your wealth, and inflation is indirectly the fare that you are charged while using this method of transportation for your wealth. If deflation becomes a reality, you are being paid to take a taxi instead of paying for it, so you are gonna stay in the taxi when you really should be getting on with your life. On the other hand, when there's too high an inflation, its as if the fare was too expensive, and then you'll prefer walking. 

I'm trying to find information about the current state of medical IP protection in countries willing to sign the TPP and the change they will go trough and maybe some impact analysis. I was hoping maybe i would catch someone currently swimming in this stuff right now and willing to share knowledge or links to valid informaiton 

I was thinking about a theoretical economy where there are 3 types of roles for the agents. They can be : workers : produce good A criminals : steal good A cops : protects good A without going into details, are they any theories around this type of economy and the different types of equilibrium that can be achieved, using different characteristics for agents, different rules etc... This idea came from the fact that raising productivity could have perverse effects (raise criminality in this case) given certain conditions. Also, do you have any tips on researching among existing economic theories for something that will describe an idea that you might have,
