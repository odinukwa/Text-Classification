This book is also great but not an introduction book at all but very helpful to understand the principles of growth theory which is so important in order to understand the development trajectories of countries. 

Nobody won, you have just lost 100 \$ :) you made a contractionnary monetary policy with a $10^{-1000000000000}$ amplitude on economy. It means that you have reduced the quantity of money in whole economy which will have the same effects (but very very tiny) of a contractionnary monetary policy of a central bank. 

It is already written but Euler equation in continous time yields $$\frac{\dot{C}}{C}=\sigma(r-\rho)$$ where $\sigma$ is intertemporal elasticity of substitution, $r$ interest rate and $\rho$ is the discount rate (impatience level). 

I think you can use VAR models in these kind of applied policy issues. I think you are interested by some questions like "how about the effect of exports on GDP and GDP on export ?" So, if it is the case, I think the most appropriate way is to use VAR models in which you can analyze the causality (like Granger Causality) between your key varibles. But you must look at your data if your time series are cointegrated, if yes, you can use a VECM model (Vector Error Correction Model) which can be considered as a different version of VAR models. 

I will try to answer to your last question. I did not read the paper but in models with higher dimensions, it is always difficult to find an analytical solution. If there exists an analytical solution (for a very basic model with a one-state variable), it is possible to derive the initial conditions for your control and state variable from your differential equations. However, in systems where there does not exist an analytical solution, you are supposed to solve it numerically, in which case you must give a numerical value for one of your variables (or more until you find steady state values for all your variables.) After, you can find the steady-state values of your variables in which case, your initial conditions should not be so far from the steady state level (otherwise, there would be some convergence problems in your model if you don't choose the appropriate initial values, close to steady state. It is another issue.) 

Firstly, the $\lambda$ is by definition the shadow price of the wealth/capital. It is the price when you increase one unit of additional capital. $\lambda$ measures the rate of increase of the maximum value of the utility function as the constraint is relaxed. So, the dynamic equation of $\lambda$ is the change on this variable, which intuitively is the capital gain. What do you mean by $(a_{t},H_{t})$ diagram ? Do you mean a phase diagram on $(a_{t},c_{t})$ ? For your last question, you can realize on your constraint that the consumption increases at the expense of capital gain (c.f $\dot{a}$.) So, this means that every unit of consumption instead of accumulation is a somewhat loss in capital accumulation. 

I am wondering if it is possible to write down a following CRRA utility function ; $$u\left(c(t)\right)=a\frac{c\left(t\right)^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}$$ where $a>0$ is a constant scale parameter. I need this $a$ to have some numerical results but I am not sure if $a$ can be justified. In a growh model, I am trying to show the existence of Hopf bifurcation and limit cycles. Then, with a scale parameter like that, I can show that it exists. Normally, it does not change the usual assumptions on a CRRA utility function, (an increasing concave function) Is there any way to justify it (are there some examples of this kind ?) or are there any types of utility function with constant scale parameters ? 

Simply, an iso-elastic demand function exhibits a constant elasticity. For example, CRRA type of utility function is an iso elastic function. The best way to see if the demand function is iso elastic or not, you could differenciate it as ; Your demand function is ; $$x\left(p\right)=Ap^{a}$$ To see that if elasticity is constant or not ; $$elasticity=\frac{\frac{\partial x\left(p\right)}{\partial p}}{\frac{x\left(p\right)}{p}}$$ When you make the calculations, you will see that elasticity will be simply equal to $a$ which is a constant term. (of course in iso elastic demand function.) Same counts for the cost function. Hope that it helps. 

It is normal that the slope of the LM is related to the elasticity of money demand. If in an economy, the elasticity of money demand is so high, for little changes in the interest rate will make fluctuate the demand so much. If you think about the extreme case, you will understand much easily. Suppose that the elasticity of money is near to infinity, (which makes the slope of your LM near to something horizontal on (interest rate, money demand) coordinate plane. (so in this case, your response to change of an interest rate is so huge.) The symmetrical extreme case is that this curve becomes vertical, which makes that your money demand never changes whatever the change of interest rate. 

One technical straightforward definition could be that dynamics in discrete time (except continuous time overlapping generations model) are often more difficult to deal with. 

In this kind of cases, I think you can not use a simple OLS estimation because of endogeneity of your variables. Probably, there would be causality between prices and sales data, this means that sales are influenced by prices but also prices are influenced by sales. So, in this case, in order to do a non-biaised estimation, you should use instrumental variables in order to avoid endogeneity issues between your variables. 

First of all, you have to find yourself a research question. Then, your research question would give you the clue to use either theoretical or an empirical framework. To be precise, I give an example. If you try to find out in which cases, pollution tax could discourage or encourage economic growh ? What are the main mechanisms that allow a higher/lower growth with a pollution tax ? In this case, probably you should use a theoretical model (mainly an endogenous growth model) On the contrary, if you would like to "measure" the effect of pollution tax on growth, you could make an empirical analysis. Maybe a VAR (vector autoregressive) or a cointegration model. 

I don't think there is a consensus about this. In 1980s and 1990s, growth theorists have tried to endogeneize the technological progress in growth models, that shows a "balanced growth path" (in which economy grows at a constant rate in long distance.) So, we can say that economists don't want a decrease in GDP. But note that there are some people who support the idea of "degrowth". You can find a definition on Wikipedia.
