Edit: Yeah, this is nonsense! So really $|S|=|X|^{|\mathbb N|}=|X|^{\aleph_0}$. Let X be a set of uncountable cardinality. Let S be the collection of countable or cocountable subsets of X. Then $X\in S$, clearly $S$ is closed under taking complements, and S is easily seen to be closed under countable unions. Every co-countable set corresponds to a countable set, so the cardinality of S is equal to the cardinality of the collection of countable subsets of X, say C. We can write C as the countable union of subsets of X of size $1,2,3,\cdots$. But the collection of subsets of X of size n has cardinality |X| for any n, and so we conclude that S has size |X| as well. So, it seems you can find a sigma algebra of any uncountable cardinality. Or did I make a mistake? 

That $D(T)$ is dense means that if $f\in D(T^*)$ then the associated $g$ is unique, so we can define $T^*(f)=g$. This level of generality seems rare-- e.g. Davies in his book "One-parameter semigroups" mentions this, notes that $D(T^*)$ can fail to be norm dense, and moves on to Hilbert spaces. Indeed, most books seem to just start out working with Hilbert spaces (and then usually $T^*$ means the Hilbert space adjoint-- but this is essentially the same thing, up to twisting by some conjugation). Here you can apply Hilbert space techniques to show that $D(T^*)$ is dense etc. It seems to me however that $D(T^*)$ will always at least be weak$^*$-dense and that $G(T^*)$ will be weak$^*$-closed in $E^*\times E^*$. Moreover, the proofs don't seem to need Hilbert space techniques. Moreover, starting with such a "weak$^*$-closed, densely defined operator" on $E^*$, we can always find a densely-defined closed operator on $E$ which induces it. Applied to a reflexive Banach space, one builds a very satisfactory theory. The only source I know which talks about "closed" operators in such generality is a paper by Ciorănescu and Zsidó, see MathSciNet or Project Euclid. Even they don't mention the duality result. 

Yes. Let $\phi:(E,+)\rightarrow S^1$ be a continuous homomorphism. For each $x\in E$, the map $\mathbb R\rightarrow S^1; t\mapsto \phi(tx)$ is continuous and a homomorphism, so there is some $\mu(x)\in\mathbb R$ with $$\phi(tx) = \exp(i t \mu(x)) \qquad (x\in E,t\in\mathbb R).$$ Then, for $x,y\in E$ and $\lambda\in\mathbb R$, $$ \exp(it\mu(\lambda x+y)) = \phi(t(\lambda x+y)) = \phi(t\lambda x)\phi(ty) = \exp\big(it(\lambda\mu(x)+\mu(y)\big). $$ Letting $t\rightarrow 0$, we conclude that $$\mu(\lambda x+y) = \lambda\mu(x) + \mu(y).$$ So $\mu$ is a linear map. If $x_n\rightarrow 0$ and $\mu(x_n)\rightarrow\mu$ then $$ \exp(it\mu) = \lim_n \exp(it\mu(x_n)) = \lim_n \phi(tx_n) = \phi(tx) = \exp(it\mu(x)), $$ for all $t$, so again, $\mu=\mu(x)$, and we conclude that $\mu$ is continuous. So $\mu\in E^*$ and $\phi(x) = e^{i\mu(x)}$ as you want. 

Let $X=Y=[0,1]$ with Lebesgue measure and consider $T:C(X) \rightarrow L^1(X) \subseteq M(X)$. By considering e.g. the functions $f_n(t) = \exp(2\pi itn)$ we see that $T$ is not compact. 

Usually we would define a "densely defined, closed operator" on a Banach space $E$ to be a linear map $T:D(T)\rightarrow E$, where $D(T)$ is a dense subspace of $E$, and the graph of $T$, $G(T)=\{ (x,T(x)) : x\in D(T) \}$ is closed in $E\times E$. Then we can define an adjoint by setting 

Then with $y=f(x)$ we have $|\phi(y)| = |\psi(x)| \leq \|f(x)\| = \|y\|$ so $\phi$ is a unital contraction (hence positive). We may again apply Hahn-Banach. 

By the way, here's the "correct" functorial property. If G and H are abelian, and $f:G\rightarrow H$ is a continuous group homomorphism, then we get a continuous group homomorphism $\hat f:\hat H\rightarrow \hat G$ between the dual groups. By the pull-back, we get a *-homomorphism $\hat f_*:C_0(\hat G) \rightarrow C^b(\hat H)$. We should think of $C^b(\hat H)$ as the multiplier algebra of $C_0(\hat G)$. Then $C_0(\hat G) \cong C^*_r(G)$, and so we do get a *-homomorphism $C^*_r(G) \rightarrow M(C^*_r(H))$; the strict-continuity extension of this is a *-homomorphism $M(C^*_r(G)) \rightarrow M(C^*_r(H))$ which does indeed send $\lambda(s)$ to $\lambda(f(s))$. For non-abelian group (in fact, non-amenable groups) it's necessary to work with $C^*(G)$ instead. We cannot ensure a map to $C^*_r(H)$ itself, as we cannot ensure a map from $C_0(\hat G)$ to $C_0(\hat H)$; indeed, this would only happen when $\hat f$ were a proper map. Similarly, we don't get maps at the von Neumann algebra level, as we don't get a map $L^\infty(\hat G) \rightarrow L^\infty(\hat H)$: we would need that $\hat f$ pulled-back null sets in $\hat G$ to null sets in $\hat H$. 

This implies that a unital functional from an operator system to $\mathbb C$ is positive if and only if it is contractive. So give a state $\psi:B\rightarrow\mathbb C$, when does there exist a state $\phi:A\rightarrow\mathbb C$ with $\phi\circ f = \psi$? 

Now, actually I can prove this. The technicality is that $D(\sigma_i)$ is only dense in $E$, and so you have to be careful with duality arguments (I cannot get a naive argument, using that $\sigma_i$ is a closed operator, to work, for instance). What I have is a long, but not particularly hard, proof. However, surely this should be in the literature, but I cannot find a reference. Does anyone have one? Is there a good general place to look for this sort of thing? 

Given this condition, there is a linear map $\phi:f(B)\rightarrow\mathbb C$ with $\phi f = \psi$. Notice that $\phi(1) = \phi(f(1)) = \psi(1) = 1$. 

Given a von Neumann algebra M, then the weak$^*$ (or extended) Haagerup tensor product of M with itself is the collection of $\tau\in M\overline\otimes M$ with $$\tau=\sum_i x_i\otimes y_i$$ the sum converging sigma-weakly, where $$\Big\|\sum_i x_ix_i^*\Big\|<\infty, \quad \Big\|\sum_i y_i^*y_i\Big\|<\infty$$ again, these sums of positives being in the sigma-weak sense. Let $\sigma:M\overline\otimes M\rightarrow M\overline\otimes M$ be the swap map. Notice that the extended Haagerup tensor product is not symmetric under $\sigma$. However, suppose that I happen to know that both $\tau$ and $\sigma(\tau)$ are in the extended Haagerup tensor product. Can I find a "symmetric" expression for $\tau$, similar to that above (surely it is too much to hope that, say, also $\sum_i x_i^*x_i$ and $\sum_i y_iy_i^*$ converge, but is there something a little weaker?) Pisier and Oikhberg studied something similar(ish) in a Proc EMS paper, but I don't know of any other sources in the literature. Edit: I should say that I'm also interested in the case when actually $\tau=\sigma(\tau)$.
