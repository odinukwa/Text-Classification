You can modify example above to return tuple with 2 params: subtree and number of nodes. In this case you should not evaluate number of nodes on each iteration using . Can be done like this: 

Complexity Sequence definition $$ F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n $$ which means that your complexity is \$ O(n) \$. Matrix definition $$ { \left ( \begin{matrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{matrix} \right ) } ^ n = \left ( \begin{matrix} F_{n+1} & F_n \\ F_n & F_{n-1} \end{matrix} \right ) $$ As you can see with matrix definition we can improve complexity using exponentiation by squaring which tells us that $$ A^{2n} = A^n \times A^n, A^{n+1} = A^n \times A $$ Which means that complexity using matrix definition is \$ O(\log n) \$ Big integers Fibonacci numbers are fast growing sequence, so in order to store values you have to use arbitrary-precision arithmetic. 

Purpose: write Java program that downloads a list of URLs specified on commandline in parallel (simultaneously), reporting download completion every second. My solution follows below, please point out areas for improvement / things you would redesign. 

I have written class that adds ability to dot access config values like ExtendedConfigParser().section_name.option_name: 

Is there some type/class I missed that can be evaluated by Python as True/False that I missed here? Drawbacks? Better ways? 

What I do not like about the code above is that I'm doing sort of manual attribute resolution in . Is there a better (cleaner, more general) solution? And also what will happen if a section name happens to be called like attribute? It would override it, correct? How can I avoid that? 

But, memory get free only after 3 minutes in my Google Chrome 43.0.2357.125 (64-bit). I was looking in htop, so chrome could free objects instantly, but return to system only after 3 minutes. Profiling If everything looks impossible, you can always try experimental way, using profiling. There is awesome article about profiling in Google Chrome also Firefox Developer Tools. I have applied chrome heap profiles for my example, and it says that data object doesn't exist in window scope any more after pressing "delete" button. Hopes it will help. 

You can use 2 custom attributes instead of one. In this case you should not swap value, just replace it. 

Fixed size value in binary file It is not a problem if you have binary file with fixed size data. In this case all you need is to copy your input file into output (or any other way of allocation equal amount of data) and then make to next value you need to write. Maybe it will be faster to change reading curstor instead of writing cursor, it this case you have no need to preallocate large sized file, just add to the end off file. Varies size value in text file Have no idea how to implement than in memory and perfomance efficient way. So if you can make some restrictions on input data, let it be binary file, in other case try to find out some other restrictions that, perheps, give you some advatages. BTW: if it wont be critical you can try converting file from text to binary for transposing and back to text after that. Explaining Lets look at the followig matrix $$ A = \left[ \begin{array}{ll} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{array}\right] $$ $$ A^T = \left[ \begin{array}{ll} a_{11} & a_{21} \\ a_{12} & a_{22} \end{array}\right] $$ Your source file contain matrix \$A\$, while your destination file should contain \$A^T\$. To write data into destination file in direct order you should jump over source file to read each element from current column. 

Obviously I defined Speclist to differentiate it from regular list that someone may set as value. Problems? Any better way to do this? 

uses (a that produces SQL concatenation operator ). It works in the sense of automatic PK creation in desired order and for querying by the attribute. However, the silly aspect is that obviously there's a single column filled with the same prefix over and over. The obvious problem here is that is a column for a single reason: so that I could use its method. I would like to change it in such way that the column is unnecessary (e.g. it could be SQL concatenation of a string and column). I do not know how to construct SQLAlchemy Core expression that would achieve this without using column method. 

At least this code is called more than once, so it is reasonable to make a helper function for this purpose and make more reusable code. But I'm sure that you need few strategy classes and multiform manager to hold options and build flow using strategy instances. 

field has standard $URL$ for it's numeric value. class property can make some troubles if future, when you'll need to make some manipulations with this list. But in this case it is acceptable solution. there is library called cities_light, it has states and some additional properties. Cons of using it - it require to download it's database (about 400MB) during migration. overuse of property. You should use boolean field and then adopt data presentation on form. Also, you probably wish to separate this huge model into few for performance improvements, but this require some profiling workaround. 

Several tests I wrote for this function pass, but I'm not entirely happy with this solution, it's somewhat convoluted. Better solutions? Simplifications? 

Goal: create a new instance's keys in such way that keys in the specified order list appear first. If some keys in order list are not present in , ignore them. Additionally, reordering should be "stable", that is, if some keys were not specified in order list, they should keep their original order from the old . In other words: 

Sort of like MultiDict from Paste, but that does not seem to have the same interface as ordinary dict. I wrote this: 

I needed smth that could send (scp/rsync) many files in parallel but that would not overload machine, firewalls on the way by starting e.g. 600 simultaneous uploads, so upload should be done in batches. Most of the utilities like are download managers and I needed something to send many files in parallel from a machine behind NAT to a machine on the internet (so no dl from internet possible). Pls keep in mind that it's the draft that I quote below, I do not need details on general good practices such as setting paths and counters using variables and not literal values. Any better approach? Problems? I've noticed that I have to between starting scp cmds in background or else target server refuses some connections. 

You can find full list at codeschool At least you can replace your div#some_id with section#some_id which brings more semantical meaning. Если можно, я буду писать на русском (: 

You will get with keys of your letters and values - their positions in the letters iterable. So you can find out position and find is character found in your characters set with 

As you can see, is much faster than implementation. Actually, if you are using cpython you do not really want to reinvent standard library functions because they are pretty nice optimized by c compiler and you code will be interpreted instead of compiling. In case of pypy you probably want to make some research, because JIT interpreter have a lot of different corner cases.
