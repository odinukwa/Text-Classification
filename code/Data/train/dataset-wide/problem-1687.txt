Depending on how one defines "quickly" and "significantly," I think a gravitational influence strong enough to do that would tear apart the Earth through tidal effects long before the change in orbit would make the planet unsuitable for life. 

There are several ways to measure a year. The time it takes for Earth to complete one orbit around the sun is called a sidereal year or 365.256363 days, and though it is a valid definition of a year, it is not the one our calendars measure, which is a tropical year. A tropical year is defined "as the period of time for the mean ecliptic longitude of the Sun to increase by 360 degrees," and is 365.24219 days in length. One way to think of the tropical year is the length of time it takes for the sun to complete its north-south journey through our sky.There is a decent discussion of the various definitions of a year at Wikipedia. It's worth a read if you're interested. 

I seem to recall reading something that said if the density of the universe was off by as little as one atom per cubic meter, the universe, as we know it, would not exist; one less and there wouldn't have been enough gravity to form galaxies and stars, one more and there would have been too much matter. (I don't know (or remember) what would have happened in the case of too much matter.)If I Google the title of this question, all I get is stuff about the expansion of the universe, nothing about whether or not it would exist. I've tried other variations but can't seem to find anything.Did I grossly misinterpret this? If not, does anyone know of any articles that can confirm or refute this? 

You can generally see the unlit side of the moon when a considerable amount of sunlight is reflected off the earth. This reflected sunlight illuminates the unlit side of the moon. This is referred to as earthshine, and a decent explanation can be found at timeanddate.com. I seem to recall reading somewhere (but now can't find a reference) that it is more prominent when it is very cloudy on earth near where the moon is overhead. 

If GTR with cosmological constant is right, we don't need to "fully comprehend" it to know its gravitational effect, which is what the calculation is based on. If GTR is wrong, which is of course quite possible, then we could be living in some analogue of a black hole. But then it's rather unclear what theory of gravity you wish for us to use to try to answer the question. There's no remotely competitive theory that's even approaching general acceptance. 

No, that's completely wrong. It doesn't become a black hole for the same reason it doesn't destroy the universe: the gravitating body moving relativistically past a stationary observer is physically equivalent to a relativistic observer moving past a stationary gravitating body. But the observer moving relativistically obviously does not nothing to the gravitating body! 

Back in 1246 CE, the perihelion coincided with the December solstice. The Earth was at perihelion at 1 Jan in 2005 and will be on 6 Jan in 2096, GMT time. The drift is not monotonic, but it does progress overall throughout the centuries. Eventually, it will drift towards the March equinox and beyond, to come back to the winter solstice in around twenty thousand more years. This is primarily due to MilankoviÄ‡ cycles of Earth's eccentricity and precession index. But the problem isn't just effectively unfixable; it's just not a problem in the first place. The apsides were seldom a concern for calendars. The practice of 1 Jan as the new year may have begun with the Romans, but it was not continuously practiced throughout Europe, e.g., the early medieval new year began at several different days from early to late March at different times in history, and sometimes at Christmas. 

On a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, a curve $\gamma$ is an affine geodesic whenever it can be parametrized in such a way as to keep the same velocity vector $u = \dot{\gamma}$, or slightly more formally, whenever its velocity vector parallel-transported along the curve remains the same. Equivalently, one can think of affine geodesics are curves of zero acceleration along themselves, which is expressed by the geodesic equation: $$\nabla_uu = 0\text{.}$$ There is an obvious intuitive connection between this and inertial motion, so we can think of these geodesics as describing the motion of free test particles. Unless the length along the geodesic is zero (which can happen on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold), we can take the length along it to be the affine parametrization. Later in physics, the length along the worldline of a massive particle is the time measured by a clock going along it--its proper time $\tau$. If you have you have two nearby geodesics with the same velocity $u$ but separated by a vector $n$ (i.e., this vector connects points of equal affine parameter), we can talk about the relative acceleration between those geodesics. This is known as the geodesic deviation equation, and in terms of the Riemann curvature $R$, one of its forms would be: $$\nabla^2_{u,u}n + R(n,u)u = 0\text{,}$$ or equivalently in coordinates: $$\frac{\mathrm{D}^2n^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\tau^2} + \underbrace{R^\alpha{}_{\mu\beta\nu}u^\mu u^\nu}_{\mathbb{E}^\alpha{}_\beta}\,x^\beta = 0\text{,}$$ where the tidal tensor $\mathbb{E}^\alpha{}_\beta$ is sometimes called the 'electric' part of the Riemann curvature tensor. If you're not familiar with how tensors work, for now just imagine the Riemann tensor as a mathematical machine that takes three vectors and spits out another one in a certain way. In four dimensions, the tensor has $256$ components, although only $20$ of them are algebraically independent. Anyway, once you get used to the idea that nearby geodesics can deviate from one another due to the presence of curvature, we can ask a similar question: suppose you have a small ball (size $\epsilon$) of test particles, all initially comoving with the same velocity $u$. Since their geodesics will have some relative acceleration, the ball generally won't stay of the same volume (or stay a ball, for that matter). In an inertial frame comoving with the test particles, we can consider the initial fraction acceleration of its volume in the limit of zero size of the ball: $$\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\left.\frac{\ddot{V}}{V}\right|_{t=0}\!= -\underbrace{R^\alpha{}_{\mu\alpha\nu}}_{R_{\mu\nu}} u^\mu u^\nu = -\mathbb{E}^\alpha{}_{\alpha}\text{,}$$ where the Ricci curvature $R_{\mu\nu}$ is the trace of the Riemann curvature, and the whole expression is equivalent to the trace of the tidal tensor. A more general situation is described by the Raychaudhuri equation. The takeaway is this: the Ricci curvature tells us whether small balls of initially comoving test particles will expand or contract, i.e. move towards or away from each other. (NB: There's almost no physics in this section--other than borrowing some vocabulary to help frame these issues in a way that will more readily connect to physics, these are facts of differential geometry.) 

I am probably going to get slammed for this, because it violates everything we were taught about tidal forces, but the antipodal tide is caused by the centrifugal force created by the Earth's rotation about the earth/moon barycenter, not differential gravitational forces. While the moon's gravity is less on the side of the earth furthest from it, that force is still towards the moon, not away from it.There is a good explanation of this centrifugal force explanation on NOAA's website here. I'll cite some pictures and pertinent text, but this site is a good read for anyone trying to understand the forces responsible for the Earth's tides.Here is a diagram showing the earth and moon's movement around the system's barycenter:And some of the pertinent text: 

Sunrise and sunset times are based on when an observer at the location in question would see the first or last limb of the sun appear or disappear; they do not take into consideration the light-speed delay between the Earth and the sun. They do, however, take into consideration the average refraction of the atmosphere, so sunrise occurs a bit earlier than plain line-of-sight would predict as would sunset occur a bit later. 

I believe that honor may belong to Adak, Alaska where solar noon does not occur during DST until 2:52 PM, or 1:52 Standard Time. All of Alaska is on Juneau time. You can check it here.Edit:There are maps here that show the offset between local and solar time. It's pretty informative. There may be other areas besides western China where solar noon is very late (maybe I'll modify a spreadsheet and see if I can some up with something). 

After astronomers observed the collision of two neutron stars back in June of 2013, a theory emerged that posits that most (all?) of the elements heavier than iron were synthesized in neutron star-neutron star or black hole-neutron star collisions. There is an article in Smithsonian that has a decent explanation.It's my understanding that this theory has yet to gain widespread acceptance, though the authors seem to make a pretty convincing argument in favor of it. Time and further observations may seal the deal or not.Edit: Adding some addition references: from Physics.org. And here is the paper the article cites. And from Nova.

One of the Friedmann equations describing the cosmological evolution of the universe is: $$H^2 \equiv \frac{\dot{a}^2}{a^2} = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{k}{a^2}\text{,}$$ where $a$ is the scale factor describing by how much the space expands (related to the Hubble parameter by $H = \dot{a}/a$), and $k\in\{-1,0,+1\}$ is a parameter corresponding to whether the spatial curvature is negative, zero, or positive, respectively. Note that this parameter doesn't tell us the magnitude of the spatial curvature, only its sign, e.g., a very slightly positively curved universe would still have $k=+1$. Also, the cosmological constant is considered to be part of the energy density $\rho$. If we want a spatially flat universe, we can put it $k = 0$ and infer a critical density that the universe would have to have in order to be flat: $$\rho_\text{c} = \frac{3H^2}{8\pi G}\text{.}$$ Using this value, we can re-write the first Friedmann equation as: $$\rho_\text{c} = \rho - \frac{3k}{8\pi G a^2}\text{,}$$ or in terms of the density parameter $\Omega = \rho/\rho_\text{c}$: $$(\Omega-1)\rho_\text{c}a^2 = \frac{3k}{8\pi G}\text{.}$$ What inflation does is exponentially increase scale factor $a$, which keeps $H$ and therefore $\rho_\text{c}$ constant. Since the right-hand side is always constant, that means $(\Omega-1)\rightarrow 0$, i.e., the universe is driven towards the density that makes it flat. 

What you're describing is basically the "collapsed star" (Eng) or "frozen star" (Rus) interpretation of black holes that was common prior to the late mid-1960s. It was a mistake. Suppose you are distant and stationary relative to the black hole. You will observe infalling matter asymptotically approaching the horizon, growing ever fainter as it redshifts. Does it mean that matter "clumps" around the horizon? To find out, suppose you throw yourself towards the black hole to try to catch the matter that you see. What you will find is that it fell into the black hole long ago. In other words, the most sensible way to answer whether or not infalling matter clumps on the horizon is to look at the situation from the frame of that infalling matter. And there, it is clear: no, it does not clump, as it crosses the horizon in finite proper time. (As an aside, for a Schwarzschild black hole, falling from rest is exactly Newtonian in Schwarzschild radial coordinate and proper time.) The "comoving viewpoint" was recognized by Oppenheimer and Snyder in 1939, but it was not until the 1960s, with the work of Zel'dovich, Novikov, et al., that it was generally recognized as truly significant in the community. In 1965, Penrose introduced conformal diagrams based on the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates (1924/1958) that showed quite clearly that the stellar collapse is not slowed, but instead continues to a singularity. For an overview of the history of this change of viewpoint, cf. Kip Thorne, et al., The Memberane Paradigm (1986). These topics are commonly covered in many relativity textbooks. Ok, but since it still takes an infinite amount time in the frame adapted to a stationary distant observer, does that mean that the horizon never forms in that frame? It does form: the underlying assumption in the argument that it does not would be either that the infalling matter needs to reach the center for the horizon to form or cross a pre-existing horizon to make it expand. But that assumption is simply not true. An event horizon is defined in terms of future lightlike infinity, roughly speaking in terms of whether or not light rays escape if one waits an infinite amount of time. That means the location of the horizon at any time depends on not just what has happened, but also what will happen in the future. In the frame of the distant stationary observer, as matter falls towards the event horizon, it does slow down to asymptotically approach... but the horizon also expands to meet it. Similarly, the initial collapsing matter does not need to collapse all the way to the center for the event horizon to form. 

It's worth noting that elements with atomic mass greater than about 140 were likely created in the collision of neutron stars as opposed to supernovae. There is an interesting article on Physics.org and another on the Washington Post. There is also another here. I too thought that all elements heavier than iron were created in supernova explosions, and when I first heard the theory that elements heavier than gold were likely created in neutron star collisions, I rejected that idea. But after reading these and other articles, I've come to accept it. Apparently, the energy generated in a supernova, while considerable, is not sufficient enough to synthesis the elements heavier than gold.Edit:I found this interesting article on the Smithsonian Magazine's website. The theory that NS-NS collisions create elements heavier than gold came from data observed from such a collision, which only happen, on average, every 100,000 years. Apparently, this theory better answers questions that the supernova creation of heavy elements cannot. The observed NS-NS collision was observed on June 3, 2013 

I was looking at the answer provided by Andy and the comments attached to it, and together they add up to a reasonable answer.There are several ways to measure a day, the two most common are sidereal and solar. A sidereal day is the time it take earth to rotate 360Â°; a solar day is the amount of time it takes the earth to rotate such that the sun appears at the same meridian as the day before. (Sunrise and sunset aren't really good references, as they are influenced by atmospheric conditions that affect refraction.) The solar day, or more accurately the mean solar day, is the day our calendars measure. The mean solar day is exactly what it says, the average amount of time during the course of a year that it takes for the sun to appear over the same meridian from day to day.Unfortunately, the definition of a sidereal day is very often given as the definition of a day, which is totally inaccurate, and very confusing.The length of the solar day varies during the year because the of Earth's distance from the sun; it is closer in January and farther in July. Because it is closer in January; it is also moving faster, which means that the planet has to rotate more for the sun to appear over the same meridian.If you can get your head around this, the concept really isn't very complicated. 

If the density is radially symmetric and given by $\rho = \rho(r)$, then a shell of radius $r$ and infinitesimal thickness $\mathrm{d}r$ has volume $\mathrm{d}V = 4\pi r^2\, \mathrm{d}r$, and therefore a mass of $\mathrm{d}M = \rho\,\mathrm{d}V$. The total mass enclosed by some radius $R$ is of course the sum of the masses of all shells up to that radius. I think this should enable you to finish the problem yourself. 

Not analogously to a supersonic (so here, superluminal?) one, no. For an electric charge, the ultra-relativistic limit of its electromagnetic field is a plane wave that's impulsive, an infinitely-thin Dirac delta profile. This travels at the speed of light. The gravitational analogue of this (for a Schwarzschild black hole) is the Aichelburg-Sexl ultraboost, which is a spacetime that's axially symmetric and everywhere flat except for an impulsive plane wave. 

For simplicity, let's consider a Schwarzschild black hole, so that the spacetime is spherically symmetric and static. In particular, the Schwarzschild time $t$ coordinate gives a direction in which the geometry 'stays the same' (a Killing vector field), and its inner product with the orbital four-velocity $u$ is conserved: $$\epsilon = -g(u,\partial_t) = \left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{\mathrm{d}\tau}\text{,}$$ where $\tau$ is the proper time of the orbiting particle. One can think of this as the specific (per-mass) energy, including mass-energy: a particle escaping to infinity that becomes asymptotically at rest with respect to stationary observers would have $\epsilon = 1$. 

The conformal time essentially uses the particle horizon as a measure of time, i.e. the furthest distance from which an ideal lightlike signal could have travelled since $t = 0$ in order to reach the observer by the present time. During inflation, the particle horizon rapidly expanded. 

The Schwarzschild time coordinate $t$ is quite different from the proper time $\tau$. The former is a special coordinate in which the Schwarzschild geometry is time-independent. It defines the worldlines of a family of observers that are stationary with respect to the geometry, and its scaling matches a stationary observer at infinity. On the other hand, proper time is simply the time measured along some particular worldline; in this context, by the orbiting test particle. The Schwarzschild radial coordinate $r$ is not a radial distance. It could be called an areal radius in the sense that it is chosen to make a sphere of constant $r$ have area of exactly $4\pi r^2$, but usually it is simply called the Schwarzschild radial coordinate. In the Schwarzschild coordinate chart, the radial distance between Schwarzschild radial coordinates $r = r_0$ and $r = r_1$ would be given by $$D = \int_{r_0}^{r_1}\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}}}\text{,}$$ and would be the distance one would measure if one slowly crawled along the radial direction from $r = r_0$ to $r = r_1$ with some ideal meter-stick, in the limit of zero speed. Of course, $r$ could serve as an approximation to the radial distance in appropriate contexts, but the point is that not only does $r$ fail to be the Newtonian radial distance, it's not actually the 'Schwarzschild radial distance' either. Acceleration is a bit of a loaded word here. If we mean the second derivative of our radial coordinate with respect to proper time, then no, $\ddot{r}_\text{GTR}/\ddot{r}_\text{Newtonian}$ does not simplify quite that nicely, but you calculate it from the above anyway. On the other hand, if we mean the second derivative of the inverse radial coordinate with respect to the azimuthal angle, then yes, the above correct. 

Even if the LHC did create a black hole, its mass would be no greater than the sum of the particles that formed it, i.e. very tiny. It would evaporate almost instantly due to Hawking radiation. Secondly, subatomic particles have been colliding with atoms high in earth's atmosphere for eons, and we're still here. 

The Effect of Centrifugal Force. It is this little known aspect of the moon's orbital motion which is responsible for one of the two force components creating the tides. As the earth and moon whirl around this common center-of-mass, the centrifugal force produced is always directed away from the center of revolution. All points in or on the surface of the earth acting as a coherent body acquire this component of centrifugal force. And, since the center-of-mass of the earth is always on the opposite side of this common center of revolution from the position of the moon, the centrifugal force produced at any point in or on the earth will always be directed away from the moon. This fact is indicated by the common direction of the arrows (representing the centrifugal force Fc) at points A, C, and B in Fig. 1, and the thin arrows at these same points in Fig. 2.And finally another diagram that the blockquote cites:Yes, one can probably find lots and lots of quotations declaring that the antipodal tide is caused because the moon's gravitational force is much less on the far side than on the near side, but that doesn't make it true. And I believe NOAA ought to be a pretty authoritative source. If they can't get it right... 

I have Googled "iridium content of comets" and can't find anything that suggests comets contain iridium in any detectable quantities. Yet, whenever I read an article about the Chicxulub impactor, the article invariably says something to the effect that it may have been created by an asteroid or a comet. But Alvarez and company first offered the impact hypothesis for the K-T extinction by observing an iridium layer in global sedimentary deposits, which could only have come from an asteroid impact, since iridium is extremely rare in the Earth's crust. Later the Chicxulub structure was identified as the probable site of the asteroid impact. While a comet could have caused the Chicxulub crater, it could not have been responsible for the global iridium layer. So why do science writers offer the comet alternative? If Chicxulub was created by a comet, then another site must have been the source of the iridium layer.
