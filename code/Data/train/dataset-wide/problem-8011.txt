I an not 100% sure that this question has an answer, but still I would like to ask it. There is a short an simple proof of Krull intersection theorem (for example page 12 in $URL$ or page 154 $URL$ ). As far as I got this short proof is very recent (at least in Pete Clark's notes there is a reference to an article of 2004). I would like to know if this proof can be stated in a more "geometric" language. Even though I seem to understand the proof it looks to me a bit as a trick... 

It is well known that a generic hypersurface of degree $2n-3$ in $\mathbb CP^n$ has finite number of lines. I would like to ask a couple of questions about lines on Fermat hypersurfaces and their symmetries: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}x_i^{2n-3}=0.$$ Fermat hypersurfaces have a group of automorphisms of order $(2n-3)^n(n+1)!$. In the case $n=3$ (the case of cubic) this group is acting transitively on the collection of $27$ lines and this rases some questions. The first question is pedagogical, I plan to use it for teaching and really want to know the answer. Question 1. Is there some slick way to give a high-school proof of the fact that there are exactly $27$ lines on Femat cubic in $\mathbb CP^3$ using (or not) the symmetries of the cubic but without using any theory at all? Further questions are not for teaching, I am just curious about them. Question 2. Is it known that a Fermat hypersurface of degree $2n-3$ has finite number of lines for any $n$? Is it known that these lines are never multiple? Question 3. Can one say something about the number of orbits of the action of symmetries on lines on a Fermat hypersurface of degree $2n-3$? For example, what happen in the case of quintic, $n=5$? According to wiki a generic quintic has $2875=125\cdot 23$ lines, so if Fermat quintic is generic, there should be more than one orbit in the action on lines on it. What is the number of orbits? I would be happy to know the answer on any of these questions. 

Suppose $F$ is a holomorphic (or polynomial if you prefer) function on $\mathbb C^3$ and $0$ is an isolated singularity of the surface $F=0$. Then on the one hand we can define Milnor number of this singularity, which is equal to the co-dimension of the Jacobian ideal of $F$ (the ideal generated by derivatives of $F$ at zero). On the other hand we can consider minimal resolution of the singularity of the surface $F=0$. Question. How can one calculate the Milnor number if one knows the exceptional divisor of the resolution? 

This is a question on teaching. I am teaching at this moment a course in algebraic geometry for master students on a very basic level. Today (this was the fourth lecture) I discovered that only four out of 20 students have ever seen the definition of projective space. I would like to ask you if you know some nice, short notes that explain what the projective spaces are and that give some simple but still not tautological statements about them. A nice example that comes to my mind is Desargue's theorem, but I would like to have more of such statements. Maybe there are some theorems from classical plane geometry that can be proven using projective geometry? Even though I know what is projective space for almost 20 years I find a bit hard to find a good way to introduce and motivate it... 

I think the answer is yes. Here is a sketch proof. Keep in mind that by Serre duality that $h^2(D)=0$. Suppose that the divisor is not connected. Then there are two possibilities: 1) There is an isolated exceptional subdivsor in $D$ (by this I mean a divisor $E$ that is a connected collection of $-2$ curves with $E^2<0$). It is clear that if you remove this divisor from $D$ then $h^0(D)$ will not change. At the same time $D^2$ will increase. From Riemann Roch it would follow that $\chi (D)$ increase as well. But since $h^0$ and $h^2$ don't change, this means that $h^1$ decreased. Hence it could not be zero in the beginning. 2) $D$ is a union of $\ge 2$ fibres of an elliptic fibration. In this case $\chi(D)=2$, at the same time if $D$ is not connected then $h^0(D)\ge 3$. This gives by Riemann-Roch that $h^1(D)\ge 1$. 

Let $F_1,F_2$ be two polynomials of two variables $(x,y)$ (say complex variables). Suppose that $F_1$ and $F_2$ have no common factors and $F_1(P)=F_2(P)=0$. What is in practice the quickest way to calculate the index of intersection of the curves $F_1=0$ and $F_2=0$ at $P$? Or, say, what methods one uses to calculate the index? I know two definitions of the index but they don't look so handy if $C_1$ and $C_2$ are "complicated" at $P$: 1) Take generic small numbers $c_1,c_2\in \mathbb C$ and count the number of intersections of curves $F_1=c_1$, $F_2=c_2$ close to the point $P$. 2) Calculate the dimension of the vector space $O_P/((F_1,F_2)\cdot O_P)$ where $O_P$ denotes the local ring of $\mathbb C^2$ at $P$. I guess, there should be one more way to make the calculation, by resolving singularities of curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ at $P$... But how to do this calculation in an effective way? 

Suppose that $V$ is a complex analytic manifold of dimension 3 with mild singularities, say it is an orbifold (i.e. has only quotient singularities). Let $C$ be a complex irreducible curve in $V$. Suppose that $V'$ is a blow up of $V$ along this curve that contracts only one divisor in $V'$. By this I mean that there is a holomorphic map $V'\to V$ that is an isomorphism on the preimage of $V\setminus C$ and the preimage of each point of $C$ is a curve in $V'$. Question. How to prove that $b_2(V')-b_2(V)=1$ using preferably a purely topological reasoning? Comments. I would be grateful for an idea of the proof or for a reference. Note that in the case when $C$ is smooth and does not intersect singularities of $V$, the proof is easy. I am confident that the statement is correct, and interested in a simple proof of it. If might be that the statement holds even if $V$ has more complicated singularities (though according to the answer of Remke below this is not always the case), and definitely it is not important that the dimension of $V$ is 3. I would prefer to get a proof of the statement rather to get a counterexample by relaxing the condition on singularities. 

Let $V^{2k}$ be a complex subvariety of dimension $2k$ (real dimension $4k$) in $\mathbb C^n$. Let $A$ be a complex $n-k$ dimensional plane in $\mathbb C^n$. Question. Is it true that the inclusion $H_{2n-2k-1}(A\setminus (V\cap A))\to H_{2n-2k-1}(\mathbb C^n\setminus V)$ is injective? We don't require $V^{2k}$ to be smooth, but $V^{2k}$ must be equidimesional, i.e. all its irreducible components have dimension $2k$. 

As far as I understand, Calabi ansatz is (in particular) a way to produce Kahler metrics on total spaces of line bundles (or their disk subbudles) over Kahler manifolds of the following form: Calabi Ansatz. Let $p:(L,h)\to (M,\omega_M)$ be a Hermitian line bundle over a Kahler manifold $M$. Consider on the total space $L$ the following two-form: $$\omega_L=p^*(\omega_M)+dd^cf(t).$$ Here $t=t(v)=\log|v|_h$ is the log of the norm function on $L$ defined by $h$ and $f\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb R^1)$. Question. As far as I understand, $\omega_L$ is Kahler on some disk sub-bundle of the total space $L$ provided $f$ satisfies certain (convexity?) conditions. Are you aware of a good reference on this that would give these conditions on $f$? (I am aware of a few articles, like Hwang-Singer (Transaction of AMS 2002) but would like something addressing my question more directly) 

I have a half page long proof of the following statement, and I would like to know if this is (a corollary of) a well known statement. Maybe there is a reference or a three lines proof? Statement. Suppose $D$ is a semi-ample divisor in a connected complex projective variety $X$. Suppose that $[D]\cap [D]\ne 0\in H^4(X, \mathbb R)$, then $D$ is connected. 

I would like to propose a slightly more elementary derivation of $17$ in the language that you used on math.stackexchange. Indeed $17=2\cdot 4+3\cdot 3$. So our hero: $l_1,l_2,l_3,l_4$ four lines, $l$ is one more line and $P$ is a plane. We are looking for coupes $l',l''$ so that $l'\cap l''\in P$, $l\subset P(l_1,l_2)$, and $l'\cup l''$ intersect all four $l_i$. In your answer on math.stack you have explained why $2\cdot 4$ and why $3$. So only the last $3$ should be explained. Here is a claim: There exists exactly $3=4-1$ couples $l',l''$ where $l'$ intersects $l_1,l_2$ and $l''$ intersects $l_3, l_4$. Proof. Note that the family of lines that intersect $3$ lines $l,l_1,l_2$ form a quadratic surface in $P^3$. Denote this surface $Q_{12}$. Denote by $Q_{34}$ the surface corresponding to lines $l, l_3,l_4$. Note now that $Q_{12}$ and $Q_{34}$ both intersect $P$ in conics. Denote these conics $C_{12}$ and $C_{34}$. By construction both $C_{12}$ and $C_{34}$ contain the intersection point $l\cap P$. And additionally to $l\cap P$ they have $3=4-1$ intersection points. Now, for each of these $3$ points we can pass two desired lines $l'$ and $l''$.
