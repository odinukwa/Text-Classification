The Old Latin alphabet had 3 letters for the sound [k]: C, K, and Q. K was used before A, Q before V (the shape U appeared later), and C elsewhere. Besides, C was also used for the sound [g]. Later, K was marginalized and used only in a couple of words, e.g. Kalendae, and a new letter, G, derived from C, was introduced for the sound [g]. In the post-classical Latin dialects, the sound [k] before [i] (spelled I and Y) and [e/ɛ] (spelled E, AE, OE) changed into [s], or [ts], or [tʃ] all of which can be found in the modern Romance languages. Since the European languages which now use the Latin script are or were once Roman Catholic, and the speakers were aware of the strong association of Q with U, and of the fact that C before E, I, and Y is not pronounced [k], and that the only universal letter that means [k] in all the positions was K, it was this K that they chose for the use in their native languages to denote the sound [k]. 

Note, that making passives with this suffix lies in the sphere of derivation, word building, and not in the sphere of conjugation, that can be the reason you haven't at once remembered about it as a passive suffix. 

It would be possible to use pinyin even without the tone marks to write down Chinese and it will be correctly understood. Actually, a similar thing has been done in the Dungan language for decades already, the only difference is they use not the Latin, but Cyrillic alphabet, and absolutely no tone marks although thera are tones in the language. Dungan is a dialect of Mandarin Chinese used by Muslims, this orthography functions in all spheres of life – at school, in books, newspapers, etc. 

It should be [ˈkœnn̩]. IPA notation hardly depends on what precedes. And since the first syllable remains closed (doesn't it?), there must be a pure [n] there. Besides, könn-, [kœn], is a distinct morpheme, there is no morpheme [kœ], so one still can break [ˈkœnn̩] into morphemes: [ˈkœn.n̩], which cannot be done with the other variants you suggested. 

Dominik Lukes' answer is quite right. I wanted to elaborate on the specific development: all of the sounds associated with the letter "j" in present-day languages are ultimately based on the front high semivowel sound that "j" is currently used for in German. (This is probably in part why the letter "j" is used in IPA for the semivowel sound). The letter "j" originated as a graphical variant of the letter "i", which typically is used to represent the front high vowel [i], which is pretty much a syllabic equivalent to [j]. The other pronunciations of "j" developed as follows: In Romance languages, Latin /j/ (originally written with the letter ) developed via regular sound change to something like [ɟ] or [dʒ] in certain contexts. (Not necessarily in all phonetic environments! And there were other sources of the sound [dʒ]. But the specifics depend on the particular language we're talking about.) French had the sound [d͡ʒ] when the word "just" was borrowed from it into English, and English speakers have mostly retained this pronunciation. French speakers later simplified the affricate to a fricative [ʒ]. The story of how Spanish got "j" = /x/ is the longest. In Spanish, the letter "j" at one point was used to represent the sound /ʒ/, as in modern French, probably for similar reasons. The sound /ʒ/ occurred in inherited native Spanish vocabulary as the reflex of word-initial Latin /j/ before back vowels (as in your example justo < L. iustus, or juego < iocum). It also occurred word-medially as the reflex of Latin "l" in certain palatalizing contexts, in words like ajo < alium, fijo < filius, ojo < oculus. Eventually, Spanish [ʒ] was devoiced and merged with the reflex of [ʃ] (which used to be spelled with "x"), and the merged reflex was further retracted to [x]. Because of the merger, in modern Spanish spelling the letter "j" is used in many words that used to be spelled with "x": e.g. ejemplo. (Interestingly, in some regional varieties of Spanish the sound /ʝ/ (often written "y") has gone through or is going through similar changes to the ones that Latin /j/ went through centuries before in words like justo. Spanish speakers in certain areas may realize the sound as a voiced affricate like [dʒ], a voiced fricative like [ʒ], or a devoiced fricative like [ʃ].) Sound changes and examples taken from "History of Spanish Consonants" from The Linguistics of Spanish, Mackenzie, Ian. 1999–2017. So to summarize: the various pronunciations of "j" can all be explained as resulting from sound changes in various languages that affected original /j/: however, this does not mean that every particular word in a modern language spelled with "j" used to be pronounced with the sound [j]. 

That's called the 'generalization / extension / broadening' of meaning: words with concrete meaning (like 'dialing' meaning 'calling by turning the round wheel on the phone') begin to mean more general things (now 'dialing' means 'calling from any kind of phone'). There are many examples of such generalization: manuscript once meant only handwritten documents, now it means any authorized copy, both handwritten and printed; picture once meant only a painting, now it means any kind of image, even photos; pipe used to mean "a musical wind instrument" now it can mean "any hollow oblong cylindrical body"(e. g. water pipes); in Russian стрелять (from стрела 'arrow') used to mean only 'to shoot arrows', now it means shooting from any kind of weapon, even from tanks and with missiles. 

The English sibling is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European *s(w)e-bh(o), an enlargement of the root *swe- "self" and is related to the second element in the English word gossip. Slavic languages have words which are also derived from the PIE *s(w)e-bh(o), for example, Russian has the root seb- ("себ-") also meaning "self" (для себя - 'dlya sebya' - "for oneself"). There is also an adjective sobstvenny ("собственный") - '(one's) own' formed from another variant of the root, *sob-. 

The Malay textbook I have (Дорофеева, Т. В.; Кукушкина, Е. С.. Учебник малайского (малайзийского) языка. М. Академия гуманитарных исследований, 2006) does use a special IPA symbol for the word-final and the one between different vowels: boleh /boleʰ/, tahu /taʰu/. See page 26. The textbook is very detailed in its phonetic part and uses the IPA to explain the pronunciation of the alophones. 

The explanation is rather simple. The suffix -ly (2) is derived from the Proto-Germanic suffix *-līkaz originally with the sense of 'having the body or form of', related to the Proto-Germanic noun *līką 'body'. It is a cognate of the English like. So, friendly can be interpreted as 'friend-like' and, say, masterly as 'master-like.' The suffix -y (2) means "full of or characterized by," that is why funny can be interpreted as 'full of fun / characterized by fun' and dirty as 'full of dirt / characterized by dirt.' This is the main guideline for the usage of the two suffixes. Naturally, there are exceptions and inconcistencies in their usage caused by historical reasons, but the main trend is like this.
