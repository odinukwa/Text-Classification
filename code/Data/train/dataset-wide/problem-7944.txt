Let $S$ denote the space of rapidly decreasing sequences, which means sequences $a=(a_k)_{k=1}^\infty$ such that the numbers $p_d(a)=\sup\{k^d|a_k| : 1\leq k<\infty\}$ are finite for all $d\in\mathbb{N}$. We give this space the topology generated by the family of seminorms $p_d$. Now let $M$ be a compact smooth closed manifold, and consider the space $C^\infty(M)$. For any differential operator $L:C^\infty(M)\to C^\infty(M)$ (of any nonnegative order) we have a seminorm $p_L(f)=\|Lf\|_\infty$, and we give $C^\infty(M)$ the topology determined by this family of seminorms. By a basis for $C^\infty(M)$ I mean a sequence of functions $f_k$ such that the rule $a\mapsto\sum_ka_kf_k$ gives an isomorphism $S\to C^\infty(M)$ of topological vector spaces. I think it is known that $C^\infty(M)$ always has a basis. 

The components are the orbits for $\langle\rho^2\chi\rangle$, crossing information is given by a map $\omega\colon A\to\{\pm 1\}$ with $\omega\rho=-\omega$, an orientation is a map $\delta\colon A\to\{\pm 1\}$ with $\delta\rho^2=\delta\chi=-\delta$, a Reidemeister move of type $k\in\{1,2,3\}$ can be performed whenever you have an element $a$ with $(\rho^{-1}\chi)^k(a)=a$, a connected sum splitting is given by an element $a$ with $(\rho^{-1}\chi)^i(a)=(\rho\chi)^j(a)\neq a$ for some $i,j>0$, and so on. 

For context: the group $LA=\text{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}/p^\infty,A)$ is called the derived $p$-completion of $A$. It has a natural map to the ordinary completion $CA=\lim_n A/p^nA$ which is often an isomorphism. In particular it is an isomorphism if $A$ is a free abelian group, or if it is finitely generated, or if there exists $n$ such that $\text{ann}(p^n,A)=\text{ann}(p^{n+1},A)$. In the cases where $CA\neq LA$ it typically works out that $LA$ has better behaviour and is more relevant for applications, especially in algebraic topology and homological algebra. One reference is the book "Homotopy Limits, Completion and Localization" by Bousfield and Kan. 

I'll assume you're working with the abstract group $GL_n(\mathbb{C})$. Probably you could do a similar thing with algebraic groups. Let $\lambda$ be a complex number whose argument is different from the arguments of any of the eigenvalues of $g$. Then the straight line from $g$ to $-\lambda I_n$ lies wholly in $Z_{GL_n}(g)$. It is then easy to connect $-\lambda I_n$ to $I_n$ in $ZGL_n\subseteq Z_{GL_n}(g)$. 

Of course questions of intent don't really have well-defined answers, but I think that there are two reasonable points of view. One is that HoTT should be the correct internal language for any higher topos in the sense of Lurie, or something like that. This should cover many different Quillen model categories, of which simplicial sets are only the simplest example. The other point of view is that HoTT aims to be an alternative foundation for homotopy theory and mathematics in general, in which case models are only important as relative consistency proofs rather than as the main point of the theory. 

Suppose you have a finite set $X$, and some system of numbers $d(x,y)$ that can reasonably be interpreted as the distances between the points in $X$. You can then use $d$ to regard $X$ as a finite metric space. There is an interesting measure of dispersion for finite metric spaces, called the magnitude. If I understand correctly, it was largely developed by Tom Leinster and Simon Willerton. They say that it has useful applications in a number of areas, such as quantifying biodiversity. You could start by looking at these talks: $URL$ Or at this preprint: $URL$ 

Neither Maple nor Wolfram Alpha ($URL$ gives a closed form for this integral (even after inserting numeric values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$). That probably means that there isn't one. If $\beta=0$ then Wolfram Alpha gives an answer of $e^{\alpha/2}K_0(\alpha/2)$, where $K_0$ is a Bessel function. 

This was mentioned as a brief comment by Derek Holt, but I think it deserves to be an answer. For a group of order $p^n$ and class $c$, the coclass is $n-c$. The known theory of classification by coclass is much richer than the known theory of classification by class; there is a nice account at $URL$ Part of the story is that one can also define coclass for infinite pro-$p$-groups, which is useful for the classification. The isomorphism types of finite $p$-groups of fixed coclass can be assembled into a tree in a natural way, and the infinite paths from the root of the tree correspond to isomorphism classes of pro-$p$-groups. 

$G\simeq SU(2)$, and $V$ corresponds to $\mathbb{C}\oplus W_1$. This means that there is a one-dimensional subspace $L\leq V$ such that $G=\{g\in SU(V):g|_L=1_L\}$. $G\simeq SO(3)$, and $V$ corresponds to $W_2$. This means that there is a real subspace $X\leq V$ with $V=X\oplus iX$, and $G$ is the evident copy of $SO(X)$ in $SU(V)$. 

For any field $K$ of characteristic $p>0$ there is a homomorphism $\phi:K\to K$ given by $\phi(a)=a^p$. This need not be surjective, for example when $K$ is the field $(\mathbb{Z}/p)(t)$ of rational functions over $\mathbb{Z}/p$. 

For the group $SU(2)=S^3$ we just have $H^*(BSU(2);\mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{Z}[c_2]$ (where $c_2\in H^4$). More generally, for all $n$ we have \begin{align*} H^*(BU(n);\mathbb{Z}) &= \mathbb{Z}[c_1,\dotsc,c_n] \\\\ H^*(BSU(n);\mathbb{Z}) &= \mathbb{Z}[c_2,\dotsc,c_n] \\\\ H^*(BSp(n);\mathbb{Z}) &= \mathbb{Z}[p_1,\dotsc,p_n] \end{align*} with $c_i\in H^{2i}$ and $p_i\in H^{4i}$. Now let $V$ be the tautological $3$-plane bundle over the space $X=BSO(3)$. This has Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_2\in H^2(X;\mathbb{Z}/2)$ and $w_3\in H^3(X;\mathbb{Z}/2)$. There is also a Bockstein element $v=\beta(w_2)\in H^3(X;\mathbb{Z})$ (which satisfies $2v=0$) and a Chern class $c=c_2(\mathbb{C}\otimes V)\in H^4(X;\mathbb{Z})$. The mod two reduction map $\rho$ satisfies $\rho(v)=Sq^1(w_2)=w_3$ and $\rho(c)=w_2^2$. If I've got everything straight, one can check using the Bockstein spectral sequence that $$ H^*(BSO(3);\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}[v,c]/(2v). $$ It is not possible to be similarly explicit about $H^*(BSO(n);\mathbb{Z})$ for general $n$ (although $H^*(BSO(n);\mathbb{Z}/2)$ and $H^*(BSO(n);\mathbb{Q})$ are fairly straightforward). 

Below I will give some definitions. My question is: do these appear in the literature, and if so, under what name? Let $G$ and $H$ be groups that may not be commutative. For $y\in G$, define $R_y:G\to G$ by $R_y(x)=xy$. Let $f$ be a function from $G$ to $H$. Define $\delta_n(f):G^n\to H$ by \begin{align*} \delta_0(f) &= 1 \\\\ \delta_1(f)(x) &= f(1) f(x)^{-1} \\\\ \delta_2(f)(x,y) &= f(1) f(x)^{-1} f(xy) f(y)^{-1} \\\\ \delta_3(f)(x,y,z) &= f(1) f(x)^{-1} f(xy) f(y)^{-1} f(yz) f(xyz)^{-1} f(xz) f(z)^{-1} \end{align*} and in general $$ \delta_{n+1}(f)(x_1,\dotsc,x_{n+1}) = \delta_n(f)(x_1,\dotsc,x_n) \delta_n(f\circ R_{x_{n+1}})(x_1,\dotsc,x_n)^{-1}. $$ This has one term for each subset $J\subseteq\{1,\dotsc,n\}$, with exponent $(-1)^{|J|}$. The order of the terms corresponds to the Binary Reflected Gray Code (see Wikipedia, for example). One could imagine using other orders such as lexicographic, but the BRGC order seems to do the right thing for the examples that I am considering. I'll say that $f$ is polynomial of degree at most $n$ if $\delta_{n+1}(f)$ is the constant function with value $1$. Clearly $f$ is polynomial of degree at most $0$ iff it is constant, and it is polynomial of degree at most $1$ iff it is a constant times a homomorphism. The commutative case is fairly well-known, and is consistent with the usual meaning of 'polynomial' for maps $\mathbb{Z}^p\to\mathbb{Z}^q$. I know of a 1971 paper by Andreas Dress, but it would not surprise me if there were earlier references. However, I have never seen the noncommutative case. Even in the commutative case, it takes some work to prove that any composite of polynomial maps is polynomial. I do not know whether that holds in the noncommutative case. 

You could look at this talk: $URL$ About the first third of the talk is a map of various different approaches to the stable and unstable homotopy groups of spheres. However, several approaches are missing: 

If $C$ is any additive category then every object has a unique structure as an abelian group object so $Ab(C)=C$; but typically $C$ is not abelian. For example, this applies to the category of free abelian groups. One can also think about triangulated categories, which are usually not abelian, although a nice theorem of Freyd gives a canonical embedding in an abelian category. One example that has been studied extensively is the category of spectra in the sense of stable homotopy theory. Similarly, one can consider abelian group objects in the homotopy category of spaces, otherwise known as commutative H-spaces. The question also says: 

I'll work in the based category, and consider $S^1$ as $\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|=1\}$. Consider the maps $$\text{point}\xleftarrow{}S^1\xrightarrow{f}S^1, $$ where $f(z)=z^2$. Suppose that there is a pushout $P$. We would then have a natural isomorphism $[P,X]=\text{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}/2,\pi_1(X))$. On the other hand, the fibration $$ S^1 = B\mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{f} S^1 \to \mathbb{R}P^\infty = B(\mathbb{Z}/2) \to \mathbb{C}P^\infty = BS^1 \xrightarrow{Bf} \mathbb{C}P^\infty $$ gives an exact sequence $$ [P,S^1] \to [P,\mathbb{R}P^\infty] \to [P,\mathbb{C}P^\infty]. $$ Now $\pi_1(S^1)=\mathbb{Z}$ and $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}P^\infty)=\mathbb{Z}/2$ and $\pi_1(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)=0$, so if $[P,X]=\text{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}/2,\pi_1(X))$ then we have an exact sequence $0\to\mathbb{Z}/2\to 0$, which is impossible. 

Here are some examples, for the case $M=\mathbb{R}$. For each $n\geq 0$ we have a closed ideal $$ I_n=\{f: f^{(i)}(0)=0 \text{ for } 0\leq i < n\} $$ We can write $I_\infty$ for the intersection of these, which is again closed. We can also put $$ J = \{ f : f(x)=0 \text{ for all } x \leq 0\} $$ and note that this is closed and contained in $I_\infty$. Next, for $n,a>0$ with $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ we can let $K_{n,a}$ be the principal ideal generated by the function $\exp(-a/x^{2n})$. These are all different and contained in $I_\infty$. I am not sure whether they are closed. For another kind of example, let $\mathcal{U}$ be a free ultrafilter on $\mathbb{R}$ and put $$ L = \{f : f^{-1}\{0\} \in \mathcal{U} \}. $$ This is a non-closed maximal ideal. UPDATE: Now let $A$ be an arbitrary closed ideal in $C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$. Put $$ X_n = \{ x\in\mathbb{R} : f^{(i)}(x)=0 \text{ for all } i \leq n \text{ and } f\in A\}. $$ Specialising Reimundo's answer to the case $M=\mathbb{R}$, we see that $$ A = \{ f : f^{(i)}=0 \text{ on } X_n \text{ for all } i\leq n \}. $$ The sets $X_n$ are closed, with $X_n\supseteq X_{n+1}$. Moreover, if $x$ is a non-isolated point of $X_n$ (so it is in the closure of $X_n\setminus\{x\}$) then it is easy to see that $x\in X_{n+1}$. I would guess that the closed ideals biject with chains of subsets with these properties, but I have not tried to prove that.
