Recall Waldhausen's fibration theorem, called 'localization theorem' in Thomason-Trobaugh: if $v\subset w\subset \mathcal C$ are categories of weak equivalences in a category with cofibrations $\mathcal C$, then under some hypotheses of saturation, extension and cylinder, the inclusions yield a homotopy fibration sequence: $Kv\mathcal C^w\to Kv\mathcal C\to Kw\mathcal C$. The specified nullhomotopy is given as follows: there is a weak equivalence from 0 to the inclusion $\mathcal vC^w\to w\mathcal C$ that thus induces a homotopy on $K$-theory (prop. 1.3.1 Waldhausen). My question is the following. Suppose we have another $v'\subset w'\subset \mathcal C'$ under the same hypotheses, and suppose we have an exact functor $F:\mathcal C\to \mathcal C'$ sending $v$ to $v'$ and $w$ to $w'$. Then consider the two homotopy fibration sequences given by the theorem above; they fit into a strictly commutative ladder diagram. Now take the homotopy fiber of the second map in both homotopy fibrations. Call them $X$ and $X'$. Considering a functorial construction of homotopy fibers, we have another strictly commutative ladder diagram. Consider the induced maps $Kv\mathcal C^w\to X$ and $Kv'\mathcal C'^{w'}\to X'$. Do they make the following square strictly commute? 

I can try to answer my question. Margolis' book "Spectra and the Steenrod Algebra" from 1983 does have such a list of axioms, in section 1.2. 

In many papers dealing with topological Hochschild homology, the original unpublished manuscripts by Bökstedt are cited. To name one example, in McClure and Staffeldt's On the topological Hochschild homology of $bu$, 1989, we can see 

Let $V$ and $W$ be symmetric monoidal categories. Let $F:V\to W$ be a lax symmetric monoidal functor with multiplication $\nabla:FA\otimes FB \to F(A\otimes B)$. Consider the following statements: 1) There are lax symmetric monoidal functors $F(-)^{\otimes n}:V\to W$ and $F((-)^{\otimes n}):V\to W$ for each $n\geq 2$, 2) There is a lax monoidal transformation $F(-)^{\otimes n} \Rightarrow F((-)^{\otimes n})$. They seems plausible to me. For example, if $n=2$ these things are a long but doable diagram chase. As $n$ gets bigger, it gets more and more unwieldy to actually verify it by hand. It seems to me this is a sort of "coherence theorem". For example, consider the second statement for $n=3$. There are two reasonable natural transformations to define by suitably tensoring $\nabla$ with the identity, yet they are equal by associativity of $F$. As $n$ grows, the amount of "obvious but provably equal" options for defining the natural transformation grows. 

For concreteness, let us work with the language of spectra introduced in EKMM. In Strickland's paper "Products on $MU$-modules", he proves the following. If $R$ is a q-cofibrant commutative $S$-algebra which is even, in the sense that its homotopy is concentrated in even degrees, and $x\in R_d$ is a non-zero divisor, then the diagram $R/x \vee R/x \to R/x\wedge R/x \to \Sigma^{2d+2}R$ induces a left exact sequence when applying $[-,R/x]$. This is lemma 3.6 in his paper. Since $\Sigma^{d+1} R$ is the cofiber of the canonical map $\rho:R\to R/x$, this led me to consider the following more general question: 

It's not evident to me that these definitions are all equivalent. Waldhausen's one is possibly the most concise. At first I thought that Weibel was fleshing out what it means for that functor in "Cyl 1" to be exact. If this is to be the case then condition iv. of Weibel should reformulate the fact that the functor of "Cyl1" takes pushouts along cofibrations to pushouts along cofibrations (one of the conditions on the definition of "exact functor"), but it isn't apparent that this is the case, if only for the trivial fact that a pushout in $Arr \mathcal C$ involves more arrows than there are on condition iv. Gunnar's definition is closer in spirit to Weibel, but it's not really the same either. The map that iv. of Weibel asserts to be a cofibration in the case that $a, b$ are cofibrations, Gunnar's definition takes it to be an isomorphism for any $a,b$... Gunnar doesn't mention weak equivalences, either. 

There are several definitions of what it means for a functor $F$ to create limits of a certain type. There is the definition in MacLane's CWM: 

As a novice in algebraic topology, I'm trying to grasp the concept of a spectrum. Let me first sketch two motivations. One motivation goes like this: for singular cohomology of spaces, we have $H^n(X;G)=[X,K(G,n)]$. We observe that these Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces are such that the maps $K(G,n)\to \Omega K(G,n+1)$ are weak homotopy equivalences. We get the notion of an $\Omega$-spectrum, and realize that any such spectrum gives rise to an (extraordinary reduced) cohomology theory in this way. We can then prove that actually any such cohomology theory on CW complexes arises in this fashion. Thus a spectrum is a cohomology theory (well, an $\Omega$-spectrum actually, but never the matter). Here's another one. Spectra, whatever that will be, should be the objects of a category where stable phenomena occur. So for instance, Freudenthal's theorem says that for $X$ a finite CW complex, the suspension colimit $colim_k [\Sigma^k X,\Sigma^k Y]$ stabilizes for sufficiently large $k$. We would like this colimit to be a the group of morphisms from a spectrum associated to $X$ to a spectrum associated to $Y$. This will be what the suspension spectra will accomplish: that colimit will be exactly $[\Sigma^\infty X,\Sigma^\infty Y]$. This is all fine and well, but I don't understand how the same object can come to realize both objectives at the same time. Moreover, both point of views are used at the same time when, for instance, we consider $E^*(E)$ for a spectrum $E$ (which is what we can quickly identify with the group of stable $E$-cohomological operations). Is there some deep reason behind this? Maybe both motivations are actually the same, if we look at them at a higher level? 

I'm reading a paper in which the following is done. We have a certain particular map of spaces $f:X\to Y$ and then it is said something along the lines of "let $Z_f$ denote the space whose defining attribute is that it is the space that fits into the following fibration sequence up to homotopy": 

In Waldhausen's Algebraic K-Theory of Spaces, he defines a cylinder functor on a category $\mathcal C$ with cofibrations and weak equivalences (henceforth called a Waldhausen category) as the following: 

Freyd-Mitchell's embedding theorem states that: if A is a small abelian category, then there exists a ring R and a full, faithful and exact functor F: A → R-Mod. I have been trying to find a proof which does not rely on so many technicalities as the ones I have found. I have leafed through: Freyd's Abelian Categories says that the text, excepting the exercises, tries to be a geodesic leading to the theorem. If you take out the exercises, probably the text is 120 pages long... Mitchell's Theory of Categories is very hard to read, and also to prove the theorem you have tons of definitions and propositions and lemmas to prove. For example, the study of AB-5 categories (C3 in Mitchell's notation) is fairly tedious. Weibel's An Introduction to Homological Algebra redirects me to Swan, The Theory of Sheaves, a book which is unavailable in my university's library. I've leafed through Swan's Algebraic K-Theory: the theorem is proved, but it is also long, hard and painful to read, and assumes a lot of knowledge I don't have (I had never seen a weakly effaceable functor, or a Serre subcategory; and it certainly is not well known to me that the category of additive functors from a small abelian category to the category of abelian groups is well-powered, right complete, and has injective envelopes!) Maybe there are more modern proofs which require less heavy machinery and technicalities? 

But maybe there is another characterization of "the" stable homotopy category, of which Boardman's (or Adams', or...) would be an example; I'd be interested by that, too. I am mildly aware of the fact that there is a stable $\infty$-categorical universal property. That is certainly interesting, but I would be interested to see how it could be formulated in older language (model categories?) since such a formulation is, in the spirit of my question, anachronistic. (Not that I would find it uninteresting). 

Note: there is a hidden (iterated) diagonal which might be a red herring. We could be considering the functors in 1) to be $V^{\times n}\to W$. 

There's Yeh's Theory of Measure and Integration which covers almost everything Folland does, but in a (really) verbose fashion. 

When you try to understand the fuss behind the new good categories of spectra that arose on the 90's, you read things such as the following paragraph written by Peter May (from "The Hare and the Tortoise"): 

Let $A\to B$ be a morphism of commutative rings. Let $\mathcal C$ be the category of commutative $A$-algebras augmented over $B$. Let $\mathcal M_B$ denote the category of $B$-modules. The cotangent complex can be defined like this (I will brush model-categorical considerations under the carpet). Consider the derived functor of the functor $$s\mathcal C \to s\mathcal M_B$$ obtained levelwise from the functor $\mathcal C\to \mathcal{M}_B$ given by $R\mapsto B\otimes_R \Omega_{R|A}$. Here $\Omega$ denotes Kähler differentials. The image of $B\in \mathcal C$ under this derived functor is the cotangent complex $\mathbb L \Omega_{A|B}$. If $M$ is a $B$-module, one defines the André-Quillen cohomology modules of $A\to B$ with coefficients in $M$ as $$D^i(B|A,M)=H^q(\mathcal M_B(\mathbb L\Omega_{B|A},M)) \cong H^q \mathrm{Der}_A(P,M)$$ where $P\to A$ is a projective resolution of $A$ in $s\mathcal C$. So I guess this allows one to safely say that André-Quillen cohomology are some kind of "derived functor of the derivations". I am wondering if it is (sometimes?) possible to resolve the module variable, i.e. to derive the functor $\mathrm{Der}_A(B,-):s\mathcal M_B \to s\mathcal M_B$, and get the same result. This feels somehow like asking whether $\mathrm Der_A(-,-): s\mathcal C \times \mathcal sM_B\to s\mathcal M_B$ is balanced. 

What are the advantages or disadvantages of one over the other? Surely there was something that motivated the modern definitions (2 and 3) to change the older definition (1) I'm aware of the remark on the nLab page on creation of limits: that probably answers why the need for a new definition. However, a functor that satisfies definition 2 also satisfies definition 3, but I don't see why a functor that satisfies definition 3 should preserve limits. So the question remains: why prefer definition 2 over definition 3 or viceversa? 

($F_1\mathcal C$ is the category of cofibrations in $\mathcal C$.) Weibel in his K-book defines it like this: 

Here "Mike" is Michael Boardman. Question number zero would be, could anybody share Boardman's "Stable homotopy theory" mimeographed notes where he introduces said category? Both that and Vogt's "Boardman's stable homotopy category" are hard to find, so it's hard for me to know what they are talking about. But suppose I know what Boardman's stable homotopy category is. Why should I agree that this is "the" right stable homotopy category, up to equivalence? I am guessing that the right way to formalize what I mean is: elabore a desiderata for a Stable Homotopy Category, prove that Boardman's satisfies them, and then prove that any two categories satisfying those axioms are equivalent. 

Let $\Gamma^{op}$ be the category of finite pointed sets. A special $\Gamma$-category is a functor $Y:\Gamma^{op}\to Cat$ such that the canonical maps $Y[n]\to Y[1]^n$, called Segal maps, are equivalences of categories, for all $n\geq 0$. There is a canonical way of associating to an unbiased symmetric monoidal category a special $\Gamma$-category (called a “homotopy monoidal category” by Tom Leinster in Higher Operads, Higher Categories). I think that Moritz Groth, in his Example 3.4 of his course in infinity categories, is saying that this association is an equivalence. However, Tom Leinster, pages 120-121 of the aforementioned book, says that “there is reasonable hope” that this is true. I would like to know whether this result is true or not, and where do the delicate points lie. If it is true, I what are some references where the result is proven in detail? EDIT: I would like to add some context. A commutative monoid in a cartesian monoidal category $\mathcal C$ is, equivalently, a functor $\Gamma^{op}\to \mathcal C$ that satisfies that the Segal maps are isomorphisms. My point is that I would like to apply this to the concept of symmetric monoidal category itself. However, a (small) symmetric monoidal category is not monoid, but a symmetric pseudomonoid in the cartesian 2-category $Cat$. So I guess I would like to know whether it is true that symmetric pseudomonoids in 2-categories $D$ are equivalently pseudofunctors $\Gamma^{op} \to D$ that satisfy that the canonical maps $Y[n]\to Y[1]^n$ are 1-equivalences. Note that this is not exactly what I wrote in the first line (here I'm letting $Y$ be a pseudofunctor). 

I tried playing around with diagrams but I got nowhere. It also seems the question would make sense in more generality, like in a stable monoidal model category with suitable additional hypotheses. 

This could be rephrased as "$A$ is a flat $R$-module". It is true that cofibrant $R$-modules are flat (EKMM III.3.8), however, the underlying $R$-modules of cofibrant commutative $R$-algebras are not generally cofibrant. Another positive result is that in the above hypotheses, $A\wedge_R-$ preserves weak equivalences of cofibrant commutative $R$-algebras (EKMM VII.7.4). 

On Angeltveit & Rognes' Hopf algebra structure on topological Hochschild homology only the first two are cited, but are attributed to "ca. 1986" and to the University of Bielefeld. On Vogt's Introduction to algebra over "brave new rings", again, only the first two appear, and attributed to 1985. And the list could go on. Anyway, the question is, where could one get hold of these preprints? EDIT: The question's been answered in the comments: I've got them sent to me. The question now is, shouldn't they be online for everybody to have access to them? I've no idea about copyright issues, etc. 

The torus $\mathbb{T}^n$, the sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ and the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$ admit metrics of constant (sectional) curvature $0, 1, -1$ respectively. Do they afford metrics of constant curvature in $\{0, 1, -1\}$ for a different value? (e.g. does the torus admit a metric of curvature $-1$, or $1$?) In the 2-dimensional case, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem answers the question negatively, but what about higher dimensions? 

I know this is perhaps argumentative. But the following is not. At the end of said chapter in Margolis' book, he conjectures that any two categories satisfying those axioms are equivalent. But at the time, it apparently wasn't established. 

Then it is said "To speak of the sequence above as a homotopy (co)fibration sequence, one needs to specify a preferred null-homotopy for the composite map". (the (co) is mine, since in fact the writer is working with spectra, and in my interpretation they are being replaced by spaces, where no longer cofibration=fibration) I don't really understand what's going on. I'm aware of the general fact that the nullhomotopies of $gf$ in the following diagram are in one to one correspondence with the extensions $G$ of $g$ to the homotopy cofiber: 

Let $(C,w)$ be a relative category. Then associated to it we have its hammock localization, $L^H(C,w)$, which is a simplicially enriched category. If $X,Y\in C$, the description of the simplicial set $L^H(C,w)(X,Y)$ can be found in Dwyer-Kan, "Calculating Simplicial Localizations", 2.1. The 0-simplices are zig-zags where the reversed arrows are in $w$. The $k$-simplices are defined by taking "natural transformations" of such zig-zags that fix the endpoints, all go in the same direction, and are in $w$. (See the article for more details). In the nLab, it is claimed that this is the nerve of a certain category (groupoid, actually), whose objects are some equivalence classes of zig-zags (under an equivalence relation whose formulation I don't really understand), and whose morphisms are similar to the 1-simplices of the simplicial set above. Is this formulation correct? I'm failing to see whether they're equal (or equivalent). In particular, I'm troubled by the fact that the $\pi_0$ of the nerve of a groupoid gives you the set of isomorphism classes of the groupoid, so I'm nervous about whether $\pi_0$ of the nerve defined in the nLab will actually really give $C[w^{-1}](X,Y)$. If the formulation is not correct, the next question would be: is the simplicial set $L^H(C,w)(X,Y)$ defined by Dwyer-Kan the nerve of some category?
