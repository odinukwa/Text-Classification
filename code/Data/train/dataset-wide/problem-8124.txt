It sometimes happens that 1D problems are easier to solve by somehow adding a dimension. For example, we convert linear differential equations for a real unknown to a complex unknown (to use complex exponentials), or we compute a power series' radius of convergence by thinking in the complex plane (or use complex analytic properties in path integrals), or we evaluate $\int^\infty_{-\infty} e^{-x^2}\ dx$ by squaring it... So, are any 2D problems easier to solve in even higher dimensions? I can't think of any. 

Is there any integer N such that 2^N=3 mod N? I understand that N must be an odd non-prime. I checked up to a million with no success (but, FYI, 2^N=5 and 2^N=7 have solutions). 

Given coprime positive integers M,N, and a corresponding integer z outside of the range (for all integers x,a,b,c) of $Mx^2-N(a^2+b^2+c^2)$, is there any such z which is "deceptive", meaning that it is modularly inside the range of the smaller components, i.e., inside the range of both $Mx^2$ mod N and $-N(a^2+b^2+c^2)$ mod M? Feel free to replace $a^2+b^2+c^2$ with "All integers except for $4^a(8b+7)$" per Lagrange. 

Dirichlet's theorem shows that, for any fixed prime integer a, "big prime numbers mod a" are uniformly distributed between 1 and a-1. If we similarly pick different prime integers b,c,..., are these uniform distributions independent of each other? 

Since Gerry Myerson is too humble to take answer credit, I'll make it even simpler and close out my stupid question: $0^2+(x+1)^2-x^2=2x+1$ ranges all odds, so $1^2+(x+1)^2-x^2$ ranges all evens. Just 3 integers are enough (a is 0, b is 0 or 1, c is x+1). 

How can I most quickly find a big prime, p, for which 4p+1 is also prime? For example, p=37 works. I wonder if these special primes have been researched and some characteristics are known. Are there infinitely many of these primes? 

Suppose that you have N labeled coins pinched in one stack in your fingertips (your palm is above your fingers and your palm is facing down, so that you can drop as many coins as needed from the bottom of the stack) and you have a table which only allows for two other stacks (call these L for left and R for right). You can freely choose L or R for each coin, but the coin dropping order is fixed. You can also freely pick up coins from either stack (the reverse of a drop). For general N, what is the minimum pickups needed to reverse the stack order? I'm curious about the total number of coins picked up and about the total number of pickup events, but am officially asking only for the latter. As an example, I believe the minimum for N=7 is 5. We start holding 1234567. Drop 247 in L and 1356 in R; pick up 1356 from R. Drop 16 in L and 35 in R; pick up 24716 from L. Drop 76 in L and 241 in R; pick up 35241 from R. Drop 54 in L and 321 in R; pick up 321 from R. Drop 321 in L; pick up 7654321 from L. 

Let $A \colon= {\Bbb C}[S_1,\ldots,S_n]$ with $1 \leq n < \infty$ $B \colon= A[X_1,\ldots,X_d]$ with $2 \leq d < \infty$. $O \colon= (0,\ldots,0)$ be the origin of ${\mathrm{Spec}}\,B$. Suppose ${\frak P}$ be a prime ideal of $B$ such that ${\frak P} \cap A = 0$. Scheme-theoretically, this is equivalent to the following condition$\colon$ ${\mathrm{Spec}}\,B/{\frak P} \to {\mathrm{Spec}}\,A$ is dominant, i.e. surjective after taking the closure of the image. Let $H$ be a hyperplane of ${\mathrm{Spec}}\,B$ whose defining equation $h$ satisfies the following condition$\colon$ $h = \Sigma_{i=1}^{i=d}a_iX_i\, ;\, a_i \in B, \phantom{i}^{\exists}a_i \not= 0 \,\,{\mathrm{s.t.}}\,\, a_i \in {\Bbb C}$. and define the intersection $D \colon= ({\mathrm{Spec}}\,B/{\frak P}) \cap H$. There is a natural morphism $\phi \colon D \to {\mathrm{Spec}}\,A$. Q. Is it possible to choose $H$ such that the following three conditions are satisfied? (i) $D$ passes through $O$. (ii) $D$ is irreducible. (iii) $\phi$ is dominant. 

We shall suppose that for any couple $m, n$ with $m > n$, ${\frak a}_m \mapsto {\frak a}_n, f_m \mapsto f_n$, respectively by the natural quotient surjection $A_m \twoheadrightarrow A_n$, i.e., eliminating variables $X_{n+1},...,X_m$ in $A_m$. Now, I should like to pose the following conjecture: Conjecture: Suppose that $m \gg n$ and $k(m) \gg k(n)$. Then the following inequality holds$\colon$ $l(m) > l(n)$. 

Let us define $A_n, f_n, {\frak a}_n, k(n), \iota_n, {\frak b}_n$ and $l(n)$ by the followings$\colon$ $A_n \colon= K[[X_1,...,X_n]]$, i.e. a $n$-variable formal power series ring over a field $K$. $f_n \colon= f_n(X_1) = c_n + c_{n-1}X_1 + ... + c_1X_1^{e-1} + X_1^e \in K[[X_2,...,X_{n}]][[X_1]]$. ${\frak a}_n \colon= (f_n, g_1, ... , g_{k(n)-1})$, an ideal of $A_n$. $k(n) \colon= {\mathrm{the ~number~ of~ generators~ of}}\,{\frak a}_n$. $\iota_n \colon K[[X_2,...,X_n]] \to K[[X_2,...,X_n]][[X_1]]/(f_n) = A_n/(f_n)$, a finite ring extension. ${\frak b}_n \colon= \iota_n(K[[X_2,...,X_n]]) \cap \overline{{\frak a}_n} \quad \!\! {\mathrm{in}}\,A_n/(f_n)$. $l(n)\colon= {\mathrm{the~ number~ of~ generators~of}}\,{\frak b}_n$. 

Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be integral schemes of finite type over a field $K$ (i.e., locally affine opens are finitely-generated algebras over $K$). Suppose we have the following condition$\colon$ $f \colon Y \to X$ is finite. We consider a dominant morphism $g \colon Z \to X$. Q. Suppose that ${\cal O}_Y \cap {\cal O}_Z = {\cal O}_X$. Then is it possble that $Y \times_X Z$ is not integral while $Y \times_X \eta_Z$ being integral ? As in the answer below in the case $Y = Z$, there is an example as $Y$ being a normalisation of $X$. 

Is anything known asymptotically about the binary "primes mod 3" sequence besides Dirichlet's result that 1 and 2 occur half of the time? For example, can you prove that it does not eventually cycle forever with a simple "12" repetition? (I would guess that this sequence is asymptotically random with no correlations, but it really wouldn't be that surprising if, for example, there were some tendency to switch back and forth in consecutive terms. If anyone has an argument, or data, indicating that this sequence is not so random, I'd like to hear about it.) 

What integers are not in the range of $a^2+b^2+c^2-x^2$ (for all integer combinations of a, b, c, and x)? This form is similar to that of Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem, for which the answer would be "none". The generalization by Ramanujan only seems to cover non-negative coefficients. 

I believe the current lowest-memory algorithm for computing the $n^{th}$ binary digit of $\pi$ requires $O(log(n))$ bytes and $O(n^2 log(n))$ days (I pick Bellard over Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe for speed). Can any of the common irrational constants be currently computed with the same low memory, but in faster time? Please consider constants which combine integers and $\pi$, natural exponential functions, and/or root functions (e.g., $\pi$, $\pi^2$, $e$, $e^{-\pi}$, $\sqrt2$, $\sqrt{2\pi}$). For any such constant, I am also curious about the randomness in its binary tail. These digit extraction constraints cause correlations in the constant's tail bits which probably go to zero for high $n$ (but, for $\pi$, the Bellard/BBP constraints are too subtle for me to conclude anything). If anyone has a low-memory method to distinguish a tail of some common irrational number from random bits (with the same speed in the limit of high $n$), please comment. 

What is the maximum number of spheres that can be placed in 3D such that all inter-touch? One can of course place four unit spheres tetrahedrally and then add a smaller sphere in the middle, so this number must be at least 5. [By the way, I was trying to extend the "five points in 2D cannot be inter-connected without a crossing" limitation to 3D with a simple statement, but this was sadly the best I could do. If anyone knows a better simple extension, please comment.] 

We shall define the infinitely-many-variable formal power series ring $A = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_{\infty}]]$ over a finite field ${\Bbb F}_q$ as the following$\colon$ $A \colon= \underset{n \geq 1}{\varprojlim}\, {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]$. For example, $\Sigma_{n = 1}^{n = \infty} X_n = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots \in A$. The ring $A$ is a non-noetherian local ring with the unique closed maximal ideal. I would like to pose the following theorem on which please let me know the correctness$\colon$ Theorem. $A$ is coherent. Proof. Let us fix a positive integer $l \geq 1$ and for an arbitrarily chosen elements $a_1,\ldots,a_l$ consider the linear equation $(*) \quad a_1Y_1 + \ldots + a_lY_l = 0 \quad (a_1,\ldots,a_l \in A).$ We shall define ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as the set of the whole solutions of $(*)$ in the ring $A$. We shall show the finiteness of the number of generators of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ as an $A$-module. We define ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as the image of ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m} \colon= A/((X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m,X_{n+1},X_{n+2},\ldots)$. We have simply $A_{n,m} = {\Bbb F}_q[[X_1,\ldots,X_n]]/(X_1,\ldots,X_n)^m$. Lemma. For sufficiently large $n, m$, the $A_{n,m}$-module ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ has generators whose number is less than or equal to $l$. Proof. Obviously, ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ can be viewed as the subset of the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$. But the whole solutions of the linear equation $(*)$ in the quotient ring $A_{n,m}$ has its cardinality less than or equal to $|A_{n,m}|^l$. Consequently we have $|{\mathrm M}_{n,m}| \leq |A_{n,m}|^l. $ When we view ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ as a $A_{n,m}$-module and set the number of the generators of ${\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ to be $\delta_{n,m}$, the following inequality holds$\colon$ $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |{\mathrm M}_{n,m}|. $ In short we have $|(A_{n,m})^{*}|^{\delta_{n,m}} \leq |A_{n,m}|^l.$ We can see the equality $|(A_{n,m})^{*}| = \frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|$ because $A_{n,m}$ can be divided into $q$ disjoint cosets as $c + {\frak m}$ with $c \in {\Bbb F}_q$ and ${\frak m}$ being the maximal ideal of $A_{n,m}$. Thus we obtain ${\delta_{n,m}} {\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|) \leq l\,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)$. So, we have ${\delta_{n,m}} \leq l \,{\mathrm log}_e(|A_{n,m}|)/{\mathrm log}_e(\frac{(q-1)}{q}|A_{n,m}|)$. When $n,m \to \infty$, we have $|A_{n,m}| \to \infty$, which ensures that the positive integer ${\delta_{n,m}}$ must be less than or equal to $l$ for sufficiently large $n, m$. Q.E.D. Now, by Lemma we can conclude that ${\mathrm M}_{\infty}$ has the set of generators with its cardinality less than or equal to $l$ as $A$-module because we have the equality ${\mathrm M}_{\infty} = \underset{n,m \geq 1}{\varprojlim} {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$, where all natural transition maps ${\mathrm M}_{n',m'} \to {\mathrm M}_{n,m}$ with $n' > n, m' > m$ are surjective. Q.E.D. 

Let's represent integers with D digits where each digit has B values (i.e., the base is B and we effectively work only with integers between 1 and B^D). Is it possible to choose a single cyclic/repeating stream of B^D digits and D relative position "windows" (to look into that stream and filter out the digits we view) such that all integers come out? As an example, for D=3 and B=3, the stream "1 2 1 2 3 3 1 1 2 3 1 1 3 2 3 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 3 3 3 3" with window positions at "1 11 18" generates the full range of integers exactly once per cycle (the first integer generated is 112, then 212, ...). I'm actually looking for an answer for D=4 and B=4 if there is no general method. 

Computer multiplication can be sped up by looking for patterns and re-writing this with minimal additions/subtractions (in terms of simple zero-cost bitshifts). To keep 64-bit accuracy, the best I could do was 13 steps: 

Consider a symmetric N-player game in which all players partition one total unit of energy among individual games. The probability of winning each game is simply proportional to the spent energy (player #1 wins with probability $\frac{E_1}{E_1+E_2+...+E_N}$). The winner is the first player to win G games. Before each game, players know both "how much energy each person has left" and "how many games each person has won" to choose the energy to spend in the next game. (I'm additionally interested in game theory if these are not both known, but that's a bonus.) A full game-tree solution for all cases would be nice, but maybe too much to ask for...instead, how much energy should be spent on the first game if N=2 and G=4 (World Series)? [this is a tangent from Flipping coins on a budget 

Given two vector sets, $\vec x_i$ and $\vec y_i$ (for $i$=1,2,...N, but the dimensionality of each vector can be more than N), let their sum set be $\vec z_i = \vec x_i + \vec y_i$. It's easy to compute the scalar inter-distances: $x_{ij} = \Vert{\vec x_i-\vec x_j}\Vert$, $y_{ij} = \Vert{\vec y_i-\vec y_j}\Vert$, $z_{ij} = \Vert{\vec z_i-\vec z_j}\Vert$. But, what's the quickest computation method to go backwards (i.e., from all of the inter-distances to any "high-dimensional embedding")? It seems I'm forced into ugly numerical "trial and error" methods even for small N=4 though there are easy analytical methods (for any N) if I didn't need to match the sum's inter-distances. 

Let ${\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ be a $n$-variable polynomial ring over a complex number field ${\Bbb C}$. For its maximal ideal $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$, we define the geometric regular local ring as $R \colon= {\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]_{(X_1,\ldots,X_n)}$, which is the localisation of ${\Bbb C}[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ at $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. $R$ has the unique maximal ideal $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. We shall consider the polynomial ring $R[X]$ over $R$ and choose $m$ Weierstrass polynomials \begin{align} & f_1(X) = c_{1,0} + c_{1,1}X + \ldots + c_{1,e_1}X^{e_1} \\ & {\phantom{AAA}} ... \\ & f_m(X) = c_{m,0} + c_{m,1}X + \ldots + c_{m,e_{m}}X^{e_m}, \end{align} where $c_{1,0},\ldots,c_{i,j},\ldots,c_{m,e_m} \in (X_1,\ldots,X_n)$. Suppose that ${\mathrm{GCD}}(f_1(X),\ldots,f_m(X)) = 1$. Now for a function $F(X) \in R[X]$, we consider the following condition$\colon$ $(\sharp)$ $\quad F(\alpha) \in (f_1(\alpha),\ldots,f_m(\alpha))\phantom{A}$ for any $\alpha \in {\Bbb C}$, where $(f_1(\alpha),\ldots,f_m(\alpha))$ is the ideal of $R$. Q. Does $F(X) \in (f_1(X),\ldots,f_m(X))$? 

I shall only propose an outline of the possible proof below, where Claim 1, Claim 2 and Claim 3 have not yet been proved rigorously. We shall begin the outline. So suppose that every element of $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_e$ contains every parameter of $X_3,\ldots,X_m$ in its presentation of the formal summation. Then, we consider the specialisation defined as follows$\colon$ $$(\lozenge) \quad X_i = S(X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m) \in K[[X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]].$$ Some sort of Bertini argument, i.e. Bertini irreducibility theorem for the hyperplane section, might justify the following Claim 1$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\, 1.}$ After the specialisation, by which I mean simply to insert $(\lozenge)$ into the irreducible polynomial $f$ at ${Q}\,2$ in the above, the specialised polynomial $s(f) \in K[[X_2,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]][X_1]$ remains still irreducible as long as $S(X_3,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m)$ is sufficiently general. Moreover, conditions in the question remains unchanged with only the number of variables dropped by one. Thus we can use the induction on $m$ when $m \geq 4$. That is, the ideal $I_1$ of the ring $K[[X_1,\ldots,X_m]]$ turns into another ideal $K_1$ of the ring $K[[X_1,\ldots,\check{X_i},\ldots,X_m]]$ after specialisation. Besides, the number of generators of $K_1$ is bounded by the constant $C$ due to the induction hypothesis. Finally, we propose the following result$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\,2.}$ There exists at least one general specialisation $(\lozenge)$ such that both numbers of generators of ideals $I_1$ and $K_1$ coincide with each other as long as $I_1 \not\supset (X_3,\ldots,X_m)$ (i.e., $I_1$ does not contain every parameter $X_3,\ldots,X_m$). The assumption of $Q\,2$ ensures that actually $I_1 \not\supset (X_3,\ldots,X_m)$ holds, for otherwise $J_1$ might not be monomial. Now, we proceed as follows. Since the number of generators of $K_1$ is bounded by $C$, Claim 2 ensures that the number of generators of $I_1$ is also bounded by $C$ as desired as long as $m \geq 4$. So eventually, the induction argument obliges us only to show the following claim$\colon$ ${\bf Claim\,3.}$ $Q\,1$ is correct. Wishfully, this outline should be justified rigorously at least in the case where every element $\alpha_i$ of $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_e$ contains every $X_3,\ldots,X_m$ in its presentation of the formal summation, i.e. $\alpha_i = \underset{e_2,\ldots,e_m}{\Sigma} c_{e_2\ldots,e_m \in {\Bbb Z}_{\geq 0}}\,X_2^{e_2} \cdots X_m^{e_m}$.
