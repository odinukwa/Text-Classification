1. Are the bolded clauses true absolutely? To wit, capital loss is identically (and NOT just near) 0? 2. Why are the bolded true? 

Footnote: I was reading p 201, Principles of Microeconomics (7 Ed, 2014) by N G Mankiw, when I encountered this problem. I don't quote Mankiw's book because it's brusquer than Cowen's above. 

1. How does excessive consumption in local institutions cause a $\color{darkred} { \text { downward trend in taxation } }$? Excessive consumption ought to be boost tax revenue? 2. The last sentence seems to contradict the anti-growth ideology. Please clarify? I am guessing that the anti-growth ideologues want to avoid $\color{green} { \text { greater fiscal expenditure } }$; so why do they reject a growth (or overgrowth) in consumption? 

Please explain the last sentence (that I bolded). I don't understand the significance of the 10% and âˆ’4%. The foregoing discusses NEGATIVE interest rates, the maximum of which must be 0%. So why bound the interest rate above, with a POSITIVE number (10%)? 

The question is not asking what you solved. You literally gave how much income would be needed by buy $90$ bottles at the new price. What the question is asking is basically "calculate the income effect, and add it to the original income, in order to cancel it out". That is, you solved for what he would have bought if there was no income or substitution effect, but the answer wants to know what he would have bought if there was no income but still a substitution effect. How the slutsky equation comes into play? That formula you gave is the income effect. The difference of two bottles is the substitution effect. From here on is an attempt at providing intuition that may be wrong in some aspect. I would not read it unless the above paragraphs did not make sense. At original prices and income you want to buy $90$ bottles. At the new price and income you want to buy $$ .02 \cdot 7500 - 2\cdot 40 = 70\text{ bottles} $$ you the quantity demanded has changed by $20$. That is, $$\frac{d x}{dp} = 20 $$ (counting a ten dollar price change as small, which is probably not the best assumption). The slutsky equation says that we can decompose this change in quantity demanded into an income and substitution effect. That is, \begin{align} \Delta x \text{ price change } = \Delta x \text{ substitution effect} + \Delta x \text{ income effect} \end{align} Our income has decreased by the number of bottles we were buying times the change in price (This is important to understand, IMO). Think about it, if you were buying $90$ bottles, and the price went up by $\$10$, now you are paying $90\cdot 10 = 900$ dollars more. Therefore, after the price change it is like we are facing prices of $\$30$ and income of $7500-900=\$6600$, if we are discussing the income effect. That is, if we are discussing the idea/thought/alternate reality where, instead of prices changing, we had prices be the same but instead our income decreased by $900$ dollars, we would demand $$ 6600\cdot .02 - 2\cdot 30 = 72 $$ Which means that we have a substitution effect of $2$ and an income effect of $18$. So to cancel the income effect, we would need enough original income to buy $70 +18$ bottles, which is $8400$ dollars. Now how/why these decompositions work I am still trying to better understand myself, so my reasoning may be off or wrong somewhere. There are also different ways to consider/define the income/substitution effects, which is something to take into consideration. 

The best way to understand Friedman's and 1950s Chicago methodology is to consider it more an operation research outfit than an economics department. The group consolidated in the war-time SRG, an OR group studying the mathematics and statistics of weapon ordnance (check out Machine Dreams for a good history of it). As with all OR groups, the Chicago group put the priority on usefulness. What matters in economics to Friedman is that the models predict well. Even if the premise of the model sounds wrong, it's fine to act "as if" it was true as long as it predicts data well. This went against most of past (and future) economics. The predominant philosophy of science in economics hasn't changed since John Stuart Mill. In short the idea is that data and experience is misleading, that the job of the economist is to isolate causal mechanisms whose effect may be masked by countervailing forces when we look at data alone. This results in a science that spends more time thinking about first principles (assuming everyone is rational...) than data itself. Maki makes a good case for it. There is a nice blog-post about it on "a fine theorem". 

A cynic would attribute the disparity (and the failures to gentrify) to indifference or inattention, (or worse) disdaining neglect or ignoring, by the politicians and rich of the poor in the poor areas. I exemplify with cities whose disparities I have witnessed, followed by links to the maps overlaying location with income, but I exclude downtown areas which always appear rich: New York: (Lower) Manhattan vs. The Bronx and Brooklyn (e.g. Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick) <Google search: 1, 2> London (Boroughs): Hammersmith & Fulham, Kensington & Chelsea, Westminster vs. Hackney, Tower Hamlets, and the southern boroughs like Lewisham, Croydon. <Google search: 3, 4, 5> Toronto: Midtown (along Yonge St. subway line, like Lawrence Park) vs. Jane & Finch, Rexdale <Google search: 6> Vancouver: West & North Vancouver, West Side, South Vancouver vs. Downtown East Side, Surrey <Google search: the Vancouver Sun has many maps.> 

Foreword: I ask NOT about the whole question; so I quote only the following part of the answer. Source: p 153, Question 7c, Principles of Microeconomics, 7 Ed, 2014, by NG Mankiw = Chapter 7, Question 6c, Principles of Microeconomics, 4 Ed, 2008, by NG Mankiw 

Hoping I don't confuse you any further. Variable cost is the cost that depends on how much you produce (hence, variable). So in your case that would be: $\text{VC}:25Q-5Q^2+Q^3$ Now the average cost is the cost divided by how much is produced. The average variable cost then is: $\text{AVC} = \frac{\text{VC}}{Q} =25 - 5Q + Q^2$ Now you want the minimum of the average cost. You find the minimum by deriving: $\frac{\partial \text{AVC}}{\partial Q} = 0; - 5 + 2Q = 0$ So you have that the minimum is at $Q=2.50$. Hurray. The AVC at the minimum is: $\text{AVC}(2.5) = 25-5*(2.5) + (2.5)^2$, that is 18.75. Now you also want the marginal cost, which is just: $\text{MC}:\frac{\partial \text{TC}}{\partial Q} = 25 - 10Q + 3 Q^2$ $\text{MC}(2.5)=25-10*(2.5)+3*(2.5)^2$. And look at that we get back 18.75. So apparently they are the same. Who would have thought. 

The truth is that it's unclear if firms use the concept at all. Alan Blinder wrote this wonderful little book called "Asking about prices". A survey of firms asking them how they set prices. And it's full of very puzzling finds. Elasticity is one of them(Page 99). So they ask firms what is their price elasticity of demand: 

From the graph, I see that perfectly elastic supply $\iff$ a flat supply curve $\iff$ producer surplus := Amount received by sellers $-$ Cost to sellers $\qquad = 0$. But please help me dig deeper than the graph, which I already understand and so ask NOT about. Intuitively, why is the above true? I seek only intuition; no maths arguments or formal proofs please. 

Please explain if this Best Answer is wrong? It claims that b) and c) are true. Yet my own work below shows a surplus of $+B$ after imports $\implies$ Gains from importing $\implies$ B and C are false. Please feel free to correct my graph, but please also explain the intuition. I wish to develop intuition, rather than be mechanically engrossed in graphs. 

On p 311, Mankiw discusses the deadweight loss (hereafter DWL) of a monopoly, which 2 above concerns. So what does 1 mean? It appears to contradict 2. DWL reduces the total market's surplus, and so the size of the economic pie. 

The marshallian demand functions are solutions to the utility maximization problem. That is, the solution to $$ \max u(\textbf{x})\\ s.t. \textbf{p}\cdot \textbf{x} = m $$ Where boldface is used to represent vectors. In your problem, you would use your utility function, and $\textbf{p}\cdot \textbf{x} = p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 + p_3x_3$ The other answer provides a link that I believe shows how to derive the formulas. I just wanted to explicitly state that marshallian demands are solutions to the utility maximization problem. If you know how to solve a maximization problem (using FOC and/or lagrangians), you can derive the marshallian demands. 

The paragraph is taken from paragraph from section 8.6 in Sargent and Ljungqvist. I understand that the fractions are independent of $s^t$, the state/complete history of realizations. However, I don't see how this leads to the second sentence -- there is extensive cross-history and cross-time consumption sharing. So my question is: why does the fractions of aggregate endowment assigned to each individual being independent of $s^t$ lead to cross-time and cross-history consumption sharing? Thanks 

I know that Mankiw's book is for first-timers to microeconomics, but 1 appears to oversimplify the subject of Sunk Costs. Is 2 correct? And does 2 refute 1? I do understand 2's subtlety: 2 means that Sunk Costs should motivate you to try to determine the reasons for the past decision, which may or may NOT justify resuming a past action; 2 does not mean that high Sunk Costs oblige you to resume a past action thoughtlessly and always. 

What have I misunderstood about 1? If male pensioners die earlier, then their pensions would be shorter, and the principal would generate less interest and fewer payments. So why ? 

I doubt 1 and 2 that feels too absolutely certain. (They're also restated, but rephrased, on pp 683 and 705.) Why must 1 and 2 be true? Abbreviate Prior Money as PM, i.e. consumers' money held 'in their pockets and bank accounts' before the price rise. Suppose that higher prices $\implies$ more money needed for each typical transaction. But even facing a higher price level, consumers may already possess enough PM to transact, and so needn't more money. Moreover, even with enough PM for their regular purchases, the price rise may cause consumers to spend less. Then money demand would DEcrease. 

My idea is that most people setting prices just don't understand or care about the idea of elasticity. A suspicion further compounded by the fact (underlined in the same book) that most firms seemed to have no understanding of marginal benefits and cost 

There is an interesting report that circulated during the Clinton administration, when we predicted we'd pay off all the debt, that I think answers your question. (here's a public radio article about it) The main takeaway is that government bonds are the safest and most liquid asset. Its existence is necessary for a large number of financial institutions (think insurance companies, pension funds and postal savings) and important as benchmark elsewhere. Moreover the report suggests that monetary policy would be harder without government bonds. The Fed would have to buy stocks or corporate bonds instead but most markets are simply too small to accommodate the Fed's needs. This would mean that any open-market operation by the central bank would produce large swings in the relative prices of financial assets with unknown consequences. Luckily we never paid it off. 

Is 1 intended to convey that RC's issuing bonds to pay for its repurchasing RC's stocks? What's wrong with 2? Did Cravath intend to convey that a RC ought shun bonds that require payment and interest to bondholders? Because if the RC goes bankrupt, at least it owes nothing to shareholders? 

Would someone please explain the bolded? It sounds too imperious and presumptuous: how MUST a rise in interest rate increase consumers' level of income? Eg, employers can still refuse to increase salary. Then income would NOT increase?

Abbreviate 'Social Value' as SV. In some other resources such as this, the SV curve is known as the Social Marginal Benefit curve. The following quotes explain [1.] why the SV curve is the demand curve shifted upwards, but they don't explain [2.] why the SV curve is NOT the supply curve shifted downwards. Here's my rationale for [2.]: Assume $SV > 0$. Because SV benefits society, the suppliers of this SV can consider the SV supplied, as follows: Suppliers' true cost $=$ their original costs $-$ SV, $\qquad$ for all quantities supplied. So the new supply curve must underlie, and be parallel to, the old supply curve. Source: pp 179-180, Modern Principles of Economics (2 ed, 2011) by Tyler Cowen, Alex Tabarrok
