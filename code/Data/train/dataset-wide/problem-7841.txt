If $C$ is an operad and $A$ is a $C$-algebra then you have maps $(C(n)\otimes A^{\otimes n})_{S_n}\to A$, where the domain is the module of coinvariants for the action of $S_n$ on $C(n)\otimes A^{\otimes n}$. The construction $x\mapsto\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\sigma.x$ gives a map from the coinvariants to the invariants, which is an isomorphism if everything is a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$. You can define a DP-$C$-algebra to be an object $A$ with maps $(C(n)\otimes A^{\otimes n})^{S_n}\to A$ subject to certain axioms. If you do this with the commutative operad, I think you are supposed to get divided power algebras. You might need to do a nonunital version to get the details straight. Anyway, this is certainly something intermediate between the integral and rational cases. I have never tried to work with it myself but I have heard Clark Barwick talk about it so you could try looking in his papers. 

Your claim can be restated and generalised slightly as $$S(v\times w)+(Sv)\times w+v\times(Sw)=\text{trace}(S)v\times w$$ for all symmetric $S$ and all $v,w\in\mathbb{R}^3$. Just as with the trace-free case, it is straightforward to check the identity by a large and unilluminating calculation. Another approach is as follows. We have an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors $e_i$ with eigenvalues $s_i$ say and the cross product of any two of them will be the third one up to sign. It is then easy to check the identity when $v=e_i$ and $w=e_j$ (noting that both sides are zero if $i=j$). The general case then follows by bilinearity. My guess is that there is a better, more direct proof but I cannot see one at the moment. I agree that this is a curious fact, and I am surprised that I have never seen it before. 

Freed, Hopkins and Teleman will be using the homotopical definition $K^0(X)=[X,\mathbb{Z}\times BU]$. For many spaces $X$ this is the same as the Grothendieck group of vector bundles on $X$; in particular this holds if $X$ is compact Hausdorff, or if it is a finite-dimensional CW complex. This definition is visibly homotopy invariant, and the spaces $U_{\pm}$ are contractible, so $K^0(U_{\pm})=K^0(\text{point})=\mathbb{Z}$. For a noncompact manifold $M$ we can also consider $\widetilde{K}^0(M\cup\{\infty\})$. This is the Grothendieck group of vector bundles on $M$ with a specified trivialisation outside of a compact set. This is also interesting, but different. With the homotopical version of $K$-theory, you get a Mayer-Vietoris sequence for $K^0(A\cup B)$ whenever the map from the homotopy pushout of $A\xleftarrow{}A\cap B\to B$ to $A\cup B$ is a homotopy equivalence. Provided that all the relevant spaces have the homotopy type of CW complexes, this essentially means that you get a Mayer-Vietoris sequence in $K$-theory iff you get one in ordinary singular cohomology. In particular, this will certainly work if $A$ and $B$ are open subsets of a manifold. 

Choose generators $n_1,\dotsc,n_r$ for $N$ with $p^{s_i}n_i=0$. It is not hard to see that the annihilator of $p^{s_i}$ on $M$ is $p^{s-s_i}M$, so we can choose $m_i$ with $p^{s-s_i}m_i=n_i$. If we can prove that the elements $m_i$ form a basis for $M$ over the ring $R/p^s$, then everything else is clear. The given assumptions on $N$ imply that the elements $p^{s-1}m_i=p^{s_i-1}n_i$ are linearly independent over $R/p$ in the space $M[p]=\{m\in M:pm=0\}$, and by counting dimensions they must form a basis. Multiplication by $p^{s-1}$ gives an isomorphism $M/pM\to M[p]$, so the elements $m_i$ form a basis for $M/pM$ over $R/p$. We can certainly write $m_i=\sum_ja_{ij}e_j$ for some matrix $A=(a_{ij})$ over $R$, where $e_1,\dotsc,e_r$ is the standard basis for $M$. The above shows that $\det(A)$ is invertible mod $p$. It follows easily that it is invertible mod $p^s$ as well, which proves the claim. My argument refers to $p^{s_i-1}$ and so does not immediately work if $s_i=0$ for some $i$, but that can be cured with a few more steps. 

Firstly, conformal is the same as complex-analytic, and it is much more convenient to think in those terms. Secondly, there are well-known examples of functions such as $f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^{n!}$ that are analytic on the open unit disc but diverge at a dense set of points on the unit circle so cannot be continued analytically. This is not quite what you asked for, but is suggestive. You can search for 'analytic natural boundary' to find out more. I think it is also true that there are functions that are continuous on the closed disc and holomorphic on the open disc but cannot be extended analytically any further. My feeling is that there should be elementary examples, but I cannot seen any at the moment. However, you can also think about the Riemann Mapping Theorem, which says that for any simply connected proper open subset $U\subset\mathbb{C}$, there is an analytic bijection $g$ from the open unit disc to $U$. You can choose $U$ so that the boundary is quite wild, and then it will be unlikely that $g$ has an analytic extension. For example, we can take $U$ to be the complement of the Mandelbrot set in the Riemann sphere. I don't have the relevant book to hand, but I think it is known that in this case the map $g$ can be extended continuously over the closed unit disc. I would bet that it cannot be extended analytically any further than the closed disc, but I do not know a proof of that. However, it is possible that I have still not addressed the question that you really need. Perhaps you want to assume that $f$ is conformal on the boundary in some sense, rather than just assuming that it is continuous on the closed disc and conformal in the interior. If so, you should spell things out in more detail, because there seem to be some rather subtle issues about exactly what the right definition should be, and I have never understood this properly myself. 

Let $L$ denote $\mathbb{C}$ with $S^1$ acting by multiplication, and let $\mathbb{C}$ denote $\mathbb{C}$ with trivial $S^1$-action. Then the projective space $P(L\oplus\mathbb{C})$ is homeomorphic to $S^2$, and the natural $S^1$-action is the one that you mentioned. Thus, your problem is a special case of calculating $K_G(PV)$, where $V$ is a complex representation of a compact Lie group $G$. There is an evident map from $R(G)=K_G(\text{point})$ to $K_G(PV)$, and the tautological bundle $T$ also gives an element of $K_G(PV)$, so the polynomial ring $R(G)[T]$ maps to $K_G(PV)$. Put $f(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{\text{dim}(V)}(-1)^k\Lambda^k(V^*)t^k$. The constant bundle with fibre $V$ splits as $T\oplus T^\perp$, and using this one can check that $f(T)=0$ in $K_G(PV)$. With more work it can be shown that $K_G(PV)=R(G)[T]/f(T)$. This is stated as Proposition 3.9 in Segal's "Equivariant K-Theory"; the proof relies on a result that Segal states as Proposition 3.8, but does not prove; for that, see Proposition 4.9 of Atiyah's "Bott periodicity and the index of elliptic operators". A more direct argument is possible for the case that you mention, but the result above gives the general context. 

This will not work in exactly the form that you state, as you will see if you consider the case where $A=S\vee\overline{A}$; there is an extra factor of $S$. To fix this, you should replace $A\vee A$ by the pushout of the diagram $A\xleftarrow{}S\xrightarrow{}A$, which we can call $P$. It is then true that the cofibre of the natural map $P\to A\wedge A$ is $\overline{A}\wedge\overline{A}$. The easiest way to see this is to use the theory of total cofibres: given a commutative square $$ \begin{array}{ccc} W & \xrightarrow{f} & X \\ g \downarrow && \downarrow h \\ Y & \xrightarrow{k} & Z \end{array} $$ we can form the pushout $P$ of $f$ and $g$, then there are natural equivalences $$ \text{cof}(P\to Z) \simeq\text{cof}(\text{cof}(f)\to\text{cof}(k)) \simeq \text{cof}(\text{cof}(g)\to\text{cof}(h)). $$ Apply this to the square $$ \begin{array}{ccc} S & \to & A \\ \downarrow && \downarrow \\ A & \to & A\wedge A \end{array} $$ to get the earlier claim. 

This is always true. The Morrey-Grauert theorem says that $M$ has a real-analytic embedding in Euclidean space, so real-analytic functions $M\to\mathbb{R}$ separate points, so they are dense in the algebra of all continuous function (by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem). Thus, given a map $f:M\to S^1\subset\mathbb{C}$ we can choose a real-analytic map $g:M\to\mathbb{C}$ with $\|f-g\|<1$. The formula $h(x)=g(x)/|g(x)|$ then gives a real-analytic map $h:M\to S^1$ that is homotopic to $f$. 

Here are some initial steps, which may be useful. First, consider $A=L_{K(n)}(E\wedge X)$, which is a $K(n)$-local $E$-module with $\pi_*A=E^\vee_*X$. It is not hard to see that $A\wedge M_I=E\wedge X\wedge M_I$. Given this, we see that we have a short exact sequence $$ \lim_I{}^1\pi_{*+1}(A\wedge M_I) \to \pi_*(A) \to \lim_I\pi_*(A\wedge M_I), $$ and we want to know whether the middle term is finitely generated, assuming that the last term is. All this makes sense for an arbitrary $K(n)$-local $E$-module $A$, and I suspect that it is easiest to work in that generality. In particular, we can replace the operation $A\mapsto A\wedge M_I$ with $A\mapsto A\wedge_EE/I$. This is advantageous because we can construct $E/I$ for any ideal of the form $(u_0^{i_0},\dots,u_{n-1}^{i_{n-1}})$, and it is easy to analyse the maps between these objects. Next, recall the category of $L$-complete $E_0$-modules described in Appendix A of Hovey-Strickland. Results given there suffice to show that all $E_0$-modules arising in any plausible approach to the above problem will be $L$-complete. Note in particular that if $P$ is $L$-complete then the map $P=L_0P\to\widehat{P}=\lim_IP/IP$ is always surjective. I am not sure exactly where to go from here, but I would suggest doing the case $n=1$ first. There we need to show that if $\lim_k\pi_*(A/p^k)$ is finitely generated, so is $\pi_*(A)$. The obvious approach is to compare the tower $\{\pi_*(A/p^k)\}$ with the towers $\{\pi_*(A)/p^k\}$ and $\{\text{ann}(p^k,\pi_{*-1}(A))\}$. 

If the dimension of $M$ is low relative to that of $G$ then the calculation of $[M,G]$ typically reduces to stable homotopy theory or generalised cohomology, for which many methods are known. For example, if $\dim(M)<2n$ then $$[M,U(n)]\simeq [M,U(\infty)] \simeq [\Sigma M,BU(\infty)] \simeq K(\Sigma M) $$ (where $K$ denotes complex $K$-theory). This can often be understood using explicit constructions with vector bundles, or using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence $H^*(M;K^*)\Longrightarrow K^*(M)$. Similar methods work for $[M,O(n)]$, $[M,SU(n)]$, $[M,Sp(n)]$ and so on, provided that $n$ is large enough. If you want to consider small $n$ then it may be possible to work back from large $n$ using fibrations like $U(n)\to U(n+1)\to S^{2n+1}$. 

This is essentially just a slower walk through José's diagram. I'll assume you're interested in closed, connected subgroups $G\leq SU(3)$. I'll write $V$ for $\mathbb{C}^3$ regarded as a faithful representation of $G$ via the inclusion in $SU(3)$. If $G$ is abelian then we can decompose $V$ as a sum of three one-dimensional representations, say $V=V_1\oplus V_2\oplus V_3$, and then $$ G \leq SU(V)\cap (U(V_1)\times U(V_2)\times U(V_3)) \simeq U(1)\times U(1). $$ All remaining questions about the abelian case are now easy, so I'll assume that $G$ is nonabelian. Now consider the rank of $G$, ie the dimension of its maximal torus. As $G$ is nonabelian and contained in $SU(3)$ the rank must be one or two. If the rank is one, then it is standard that $G$ is isomorphic to $SU(2)$ or $SU(2)/\{\pm I\}\simeq SO(3)$. Let $W_1$ denote the standard two-dimensional representation of $SU(2)$, and let $W_2$ denote the symmetric tensor square of $W_1$, which has dimension $3$. The action of $SU(2)$ on $W_2$ factors through $SO(3)$. The only irreducible representations of $SU(2)$ of dimension $\leq 3$ are $\mathbb{C}$, $W_1$ and $W_2$. It follows that one of the following holds: 

Consider the function $$ f(t) = \frac{2e^{-2t^2}}{e^{-3t^2}(1+\cos(2t))+(1-\cos(2t))}. $$ I think that this does what you want. It is certainly real analytic and strictly positive. It satisfies $f(k\pi)=e^{k^2\pi^2}$, and so is unbounded. Near $k\pi$ it has a hump of width approximately proportional to $e^{-3k^2\pi^2/2}$, so the area scales like $e^{-k^2\pi^2/2}$. Away from these humps, the function is extremely small. This suggests that it is integrable, but I have not proved that rigorously. 

Let $F$ be the homotopy fibre of $f$ (ie the space of pairs $(x,u)$, where $x\in M$ and $u$ is a path from $f(x)$ to a specified baspoint in $N$). If $f$ is homotopic to a submersion $f'$, then (using Ehresmann) $F$ will be homotopy equivalent to a closed manifold $(f')^{-1}\{\text{point}\}$, and in particular, it will be equivalent to a finite CW complex. I do not know whether the converse is also true, but I suspect that any counterexamples would be quite exotic. So the first thing to do is to try to estimate the size of $F$. Let $k$ be a field, and take cohomology with coefficients in $k$. At least is $N$ is simply connected, there is an Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence $\text{Tor}_{H^*N}(H^*M,k)\Rightarrow H^*F$, where $F$ is the homotopy fibre. If $H^*M$ is a free module over $H^*N$ then this collapses to an isomorphism $H^*F=H^*M\otimes_{H^*N}k$, and this will be a finite-dimensional $k$-algebra. I think it will also automatically have Poincare duality (provided that $M$ and $N$ are oriented). If $H^*M$ is not free over $H^*N$ then the $E_2$ page will typically be very large, and in some cases it may be possible to show that no possible pattern of differentials will leave a finite-dimensional $E_\infty$ page. If so, we can conclude that $f$ is not homotopic to a submersion. Alternatively, if $f$ is homotopic to a submersion then the tangent bundle $\tau_M$ maps surjectively to $f^*(\tau_N)$, which implies that the Stiefel-Whitney polynomial $w(\tau_M,t)=\sum_iw_i(\tau_M)t^{\dim(M)-i}$ is divisible by $f^*w(\tau_N,t)$ in $H^*(M;\mathbb{Z}/2)[t]$. This should generally be easy to check. There is a similar criterion with Chern polynomials of the complexified tangent bundles in integral cohomology. 

You have given yourself an invertible element $u\in\pi_2(R)$ and a coordinate $x\in R^2(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)$ with $\psi(x)=x\otimes 1 + 1\otimes x + ux\otimes x$. This means that the class $m=1+ux\in R^0(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)$ satisfies $\psi(m)=m\otimes m$. In other words, $m$ can be regarded as a map of ring spectra from the ring spectrum $T=\Sigma^\infty_+\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ to $R$. Snaith defined an element $v\in \pi_2(T)$ and proved that $T[v^{-1}]$ is equivalent to $K$. You are also implicitly assuming that $x$ restricts to the standard generator of $\widetilde{R}^2(\mathbb{C}P^1)\simeq R^0(\text{point})$. I think that this means that $m_*(v)=u$, which is invertible, so $m$ induces a ring map $K=T[v^{-1}]\to R$. Under plausible additional assumptions, this map $K \to R$ will in fact be $E_\infty$. Thus, $R$ will always be a $K$-algebra, and probably an $E_\infty$ $K$-algebra. The non-$E_\infty$ version could also be extracted from the standard Landweber exactness technology, at least up to phantoms. If we have an $E_\infty$ map $K\to R$ and $R$ is $p$-complete then we can check that $R^0(B\Sigma_p)/\text{tr}(1)$ is isomorphic to $R^0$, and we can use this to define a power operation $\psi^p$ on $R^0(X)$ for all spaces $X$, which is a ring map satisfying $\psi^p(t)=t^p\pmod{p}$. The existence of $\psi^p$ excludes many possibilities for $R^0$ (or the $p$-completion of $R^0$, if $R^0$ is not already $p$-complete). For example, the ring $A=\mathbb{Z}[e^{2\pi i/p}]$ does not admit a map $\psi^p$ of the required type. 

No, that map is not an isomorphism. First, there are a couple of different things that you might mean by $\Omega^*_G(*)$, and if you want the full story then you need to distinguish between them, but there is no standard interpretation under which your map is iso. The basic point is that, just as in the Atiyah-Segal theorem, the codomain is uncountable and complete with respect to the augmentation ideal, but the domain is countable and not complete. You can find much more in the paper "Localization and completion theorems for MU-module spectra" by Greenlees and May. 

The DJ construction works with a simplicial complex $K$ and a subtorus $W\leq\prod_{v\in V}S^1$ (where $V$ is the set of vertices of $K$). People tend to be interested in the case where $|K|$ is homeomorphic to a sphere, but that isn't really central to the theory. However, it is important that we have a simplicial complex rather than something with more general polyhedral structure. It is also important that we have a subtorus, which gives a sublattice $\pi_1(W)\leq\prod_{v\in V}\mathbb{Z}$, which is integral/rational information. I don't think that the DJ approach will help you get away from the rational case. I like to formulate the construction this way. Suppose we have a set $X$ and a subset $Y$. Given a point $x\in\prod_{v\in V}X$, we put $\text{supp}(x)=\{v:x_v\not\in Y\}$ and $K.(X,Y)=\{x:\text{supp}(x) \text{ is a simplex}\}$. The space $K.(D^2,S^1)$ is a kind of moment-angle complex, and $K.(D^2,S^1)/W$ is the space considered by Davis and Januskiewicz; it has an action of the torus $T=\left(\prod_{v\in V}S^1\right)/W$. Generally we assume that $W$ acts freely on $K.(D^2,S^1)$. There is a fairly obvious complexification map $K.(D^2,S^1)/W\to K.(\mathbb{C},\mathbb{C}^\times)/W_{\mathbb{C}}$. Under certain conditions relating the position of $W$ to the simplices of $K$, one can check that $K$ gives rise to a fan, that the complexification map is a homeomorphism, and that both $K.(D^2,S^1)/W$ and $K.(\mathbb{C},\mathbb{C}^\times)/W_{\mathbb{C}}$ can be identified with the toric variety associated to that fan.
