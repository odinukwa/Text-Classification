As for your question in principle nothing happens to demand (in the short-run); only the quantity demanded changes. Suppose before the game is played we have the initial situation like this: 

As @denesp has pointed out making real precise predictions with game theory is difficult because it is hard to gather data on payoffs and behavior under uncertainty, not to mention the fact that game theory typically assumes individual rationality (although the behavioral game theory referenced by @HerrK above loosens some of those requirements) Of course that has never stopped people from trying. At least in environmental and resource economics there are plenty of papers looking into dynamic games that are calibrated to make some general (but perhaps not very accurate) predictions. This overview paper from Hannesson includes a lot of references to such papers in fisheries, a similar but older overview paper on transboundary polution was written by Finus. Given what you're interested in, I'd look into repeated games with sequential moves. In a very simple set-up it could work out like this: each period the employers make an offer, and the unions then decide to either go on strike (hurting the employers and employees and moving to another round) or accept (which ends the game). As said, I don't think it will give you an accurate prediction, but it would perhaps give you some insights in the motives at work. The problem with such a game set-up is that 

The staircase function is the supply of laborers, the dotted function the demand. In this situation person 1 is willing to work at wage=1, and person 2 at wage=2. In principle in this case the firm would hire person 1. Now the game is played and person 2, undercuts person 1, who will undercut person 2 in turn etc.. What this does is bring the staircase steps down until they are all aligned at 0 like this: 

I suspect the $Î¼$ is introduced to account for the fact that no party can be forced to enter into a contract. Thus if we want to maximize the joint surplus that only works if both parties are willing to trade, and the parties are only willing to trade if it makes them both better off. Suppose you had a situation where the maximum joint surplus results in a negative utility of the employee, but that is outweighed by the positive utility for the employer. Clearly, the employee would not want to enter into such a contract, because the employee is better off not working in that case. 

My guess: high investment costs, low gains relative to alternatives such as buses. You need rails and electric lines, which are expensive. In the western hemisphere trams already existed before alternatives such as large buses came about, so the costs consist mainly of maintenance. In other parts of the world the infrastructure is not in place, and getting it is expensive. For buses the infrastructure is already there as all you need is a decent road. 

I would say that the main difference stems from the solution method, which results in your statement about all paths versus only the path at time t being true. Dynamic programming (at least when done numerically) consists of backward induction. One tries to identify the optimal action for all possible values of the state variable in the final period, and then reasons backwards following the state equation. In this way one gets a solution not just for the path we're currently on, but also all other paths. Similarly, if one uses the guess-and-verify method to solve the value function of the Bellman equation, the value function one guesses defines the optimal decision for all possible values of the state variable. Thus one gets a solution for all possible paths, including the current one. Kuhn-Tucker basically works the other way around. One formulates the necessary and sufficient conditions, and solves the resulting difference equation(s) using the initial conditions as starting points. 

First of all the speed is not constant, it declines as one gets closer (at least according to the text book predictions). A classic paper on among others this issue is the one by Mankiw, Romer and Weil in the 1992 QJE "A Contribution to the Empirics of Economic Growth" They find convergence rates of about 1 to 2%. The paper is cited 16,000 times in Google scholar, so no doubt you'll find some material there too. I'm no macro-economist, but it seems an area of active research. 

You don't really need game theory for this, although you could. Take it to a multi-person level and basically what you have is simple competition. Unless there is some other motivation to take the job (for example because one is required to do an internship and it's one of the only ones offered) you would not compete to 0, but to your reservation wage, below which you would refuse to work at all. Of course you can always say that you've normalized the reservation wage to 0. Moreover, the reservation wage is not the same for everyone because we have different alternative opportunities, typically. If there is an other reason to take the job, as e.g. with the earlier mentioned internship, there is no reason why competition could not drive the wage below 0, that is people will actually pay to take the job if they want it bad enough. 

Let me fist answer that individual decisions on whether to try to have children or not is a decision that is not driven by economics alone. There are many other factors that influence these decisions such as individual experiences and preferences and social norms. That being said there is a relatively large literature on the economics of families and children. Some of the arguments as to why people have fewer children in developed countries include: The costs of children are higher and the direct economic benefits are lower in developed countries. In developing countries children constitute extra labour (although they also need to be fed) and they require little education and other investments. In developed countries children typically do not contribute towards family income, and need large investments in terms of education and raising. A related argument that was put forward by Becker and Tomes is that there is a trade-off between the "quality" and the quantity of children, and in developed countries there is a larger demand for quality as opposed to quantity of children. Another argument is that the need for a large number of children is lower in developed countries. In developing countries children are your old-age insurance policy, and infant mortality is high. In developed countries we have pension systems, good (partly) public health care and elderly homes, all of which reduce the necessity of having many children. The good health care system reduces the infant mortality so you don't need more children to be sure that you'll have a few when you get old. The pension systems, good public health care system and elderly homes mean you have to rely less on your children for income and care when you get old. A final argument that has been made is that the opportunity costs of children are larger in developed countries. Most people are highly educated, and receive a relatively high salary. If they have to reduce their working hours to provide care to children, the opportunity costs are higher (all else being equal). 

True to the saying that a picture is worth a thousand words, let's plot the profit function under the Stackelberg game and see what we're dealing with. You correctly observed (or copied from the Baye, Shin paper) that the reaction function of player 2 is: $$ R(x_1)=\frac{2\mathit{x_1}-\sqrt{2}\,\sqrt{2\mathit{x_1}-{{\mathit{x_1}}^{2}}}}{2\mathit{x_1}-2}\ $$ Inserting this reaction function in the profit function of player 1 gives us a complicated expression: $$ \pi(x_1)=-\frac{{{2}^{\frac{3}{2}}}\,\sqrt{2-\mathit{x_1}}\,{{\mathit{x_1}}^{2}}-2{{\mathit{x_1}}^{\frac{3}{2}}}-3\sqrt{2}\,\sqrt{2-\mathit{x_1}}\,\mathit{x_1}+4\sqrt{\mathit{x_1}}}{{{2}^{\frac{3}{2}}}\,\sqrt{2-\mathit{x_1}}\,\left( \mathit{x_1}-1\right) } $$ (Perhaps more advanced symbolic math programs can further simplify this, mine won't). In any case this is a function of one variable $\mathit{x_1}$, and can be plotted. For completeness I have inserted the original equilibrium as well. 

I think you're over-analyzing here. Game theory is not just about maximizing your own pay-off, but about doing the best you can given the behavior of others. What Smith describes is just that people do what they're good at to make a living. That is, the way I read it, Smith claims that people specialize independent of what others do. That being said if the emergence of specialization was to be predicted with game theory I'd look into evolutionary game theory. I'm not sure if you'll find anything though. 

The supply curve becomes a horizontal line at 0. The quantity demanded for the number of laborers changes from 1 to 2. In a model involving more people that all have the same reservation wage the supply curve would look like a straight upward-sloping line and competition would induce the supply curve to turn until it is horizontal at the reservation wage. Why does that not happen in real life? Given that typically everyone has not the same reservation wage because they have different outside options, people do drop out of the competition earlier and the supply curve stays an upward sloping line. 

Despite its funny title and although it is quite old you may find this paper interesting: The economics of the afterlife by Scott Gordon in the JPE. His argument is basically that in the presence of an infinite amount of time there would still be a rate of time preference. A follow-up paper disproving Gordon's claim was written by Amegashie, but I haven't checked that one in detail. You can find that here. Nb credit where credit is due: I would probably never have read the first paper without Yoram Bauman's presentation "Hyperinflation in hell" 

There is a very good review article by Richard Carson in the review of environmental economics and policy, which (perhaps unfortunately) shows that much of the empirical evidence for an environmental Kuznet's curve is weak at best. 

One can model anything, that's why it is a model. The real question is what the value of such a model would be. More to the point, I think this would be a very hard thing to do sensibly because how are we going to measure well-being? It encompasses way more factors than our economic models typically capture, such as social relations, health and mental state. Even if we include all of those, the relation between all those variables among each other and well-being is often unknown. We could theorize about it, but actually finding out what the relations are would be very hard to do. For example suppose I model well-being as a combination of health, income and social relationships. That would mean that my macro-economic model would have to contain some kind of measure how social relationships evolve. Moreover, not only are increases in my income going to improve my well-being directly, but it is also going to affect my health (positively up to a point probably) and social relationships (those I guess could go both ways depending on income inequality or the possibility to be generous or visit friends and relatives). If one really wants to capture well-being there are so many variables affecting that, that the model essentially becomes a black box. We don't know what's driving the results anymore. What has been done, is trying to measure these things in retrospect. There are various macro-economic/social indicators and indices that try to capture how well-being has evolved over time. These retrospective studies are then used to judge what has gone well and what has not (the latter is also a hard thing to do because we typically have no good counterfactuals)
