Since the maximal order of a finite subgroup of $Mod(S_g)$ is $84(g-1)$ for $g\ge 2$, and this bound is realised for infinitely many $g$'s, listing all finite subgroups might be quite hard for bigger $g$. ( Larsen proved the remarkable result that the frequency of $g$ for which the bound $84(g − 1)$ is attained is the same as the frequency of the perfect cubes in the integers.) Also, all finite groups can be realised as a subgroup of $Mod(S_g)$, for $g\ge 2$. So it seems to me that such a list is difficult to obtain (I have not seen it), but I am not an expert, and perhaps someone knowns more here. Of course, the bound for finite cyclic subgroups is only $4g+2$, so that a list of finite cyclic subgroups seems much easier to obtain. 

I have seen several papers in this direction, but don't know exactly what is known. Perhaps the following reference is helpful: M. P. Young obtains in his article The second moment of $GL(3)\times GL(2)$ L-functions at special points in $2009$ such estimates for a family of $L$-functions $L(φ×u_j,s)$ where $u_j$ runs over the family of Hecke-Maass cusp forms on $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$, $\phi$ is a fixed $SL(3,\mathbb{Z})$ Maass form (Rankin-Selberg convolution of $\phi$ with $u_j$) ; at the special points $\frac{1}{2}+it_j$. The results are stated in Theorems $3.1$ and $3.2$. In particular, $$ \sum_{t_j\le T}|L(u_j, \frac{1}{2}+it_j|^6 \ll T^{2+\varepsilon}. $$ 

The converse is not true in general. ￼Beyl, Felgner and Schmid presented a condition in which the capability of a direct product of finitely many of groups implies the capability of each of the factors On groups occurring as center factor groups, Proposition 6.2. Examples and counterexamples are also given in Remark $2.4$ and Example $2.1$ here. 

It is perhaps not a direct analogue, but the reciprocity formula of K. S. Williams, K. Hardy and C. Friesen published in 1985 gives an expression for all odd primes $q>1$. This formula comprises all known rational quartic reciprocity laws: Theorem (Williams, Hardy, Friesen): Let $p\equiv 1(4)$ be a prime, and let $A,B,C$ be integers such that $A^2=p(B^2+C^2)$, $2\mid B$, $(A,B)=(A,C)=(B,C)=1$, $A+B\equiv 1(4)$. Then for every odd prime $q>1$ with $(p/q)=1$ we have $$ \left(\frac{q}{p}\right)_4=\left(\frac{A+B\sqrt{p}}{q}\right). $$ An elementary proof and a discussion how to derive Burde's law from this is given in Franz Lemmermeyer's article Rational quartic reciprocity. 

Yes, the orthogonal group makes sense over any field $k$. It is an linear algebraic group. In fact the theory of linear algebraic groups generalizes that of linear Lie groups over the real or complex numbers to give something that makes sense over an arbitrary field $k$. 

Perhaps a summary of the comments is useful. Using Euler's formula for $\sigma(n)$ to test $n$ for primality certainly is not efficient. The values $\sigma(n-1),\sigma(n-2),\sigma(n-5),\cdots $ are hard to compute. More precisely, in general computing $\sigma(n)$ is equivalent to factoring $n$ in the following sense: 

The Lie algebra is filiform nilpotent and is generated by $e_1$ and $e_2$. It is known that any faithful Lie algebra representation $\rho:\mathfrak{f}_n\rightarrow \mathbb{gl}(V)$ of a $n$-dimensional filiform Lie algebra $\mathfrak{f}_n$ is of degree at least $n$. In the above example, we do not need to invoke Ado's theorem. It is enough to construct a faithful $5$-dimensional Lie algebra representation as follows. By Lie's theorem, we may assume that the operators $\rho(e_i)$ are simultaneously upper-triangular. We may even assume that $\rho(e_1)$ satisfies further properties. Then it is easy to compute explicit matrices $\rho(e_1)$ and $\rho(e_2)$, which determine a faithful representation of degree $5$. For details on this construction see, e.g., here, and for computational aspects and other methods in general see here, with references to GAP programs. Edit: A short computation shows that $$ \rho(e_1)=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix},\; \rho(e_2)=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ defines a representation of the above filiform Lie algebra, where the center is represented nontrivially, i.e., $\rho(e_5)\neq 0$, so that the representation is faithful. 

We can say something on such matrices $B$ by characterizing its eigenvalues, which coincide with the eigenvalues of $A$. Since $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, it has real eigenvalues. Hence a necessary condition on $B$ is that it has real eigenvalues. But one can say more. There are necessary and sufficient conditions known for real numbers $\lambda_1,\ldots ,\lambda_r$ to be the eigenvalues of a non-negative symmetric matrix. See for example the paper of M. Fiedler, Eigenvalues of nonnegative symmetric matrices here: $URL$ Update: We still have the additional condition that the diagonal of $A$ is $(a,a,\ldots ,a)$, but this is also discussed in the paper of Fiedler. Given $2n$ real numbers $\lambda_i$, one can say whether there is a nonnegative symmetric matrix with eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\ldots ,\lambda_n$ and diagonal $\lambda_{n+1},\ldots ,\lambda_{2n}$. 

You can just recursively compute the gcd of $t\ge 2$ polynomials by $$ \gcd(P_1, P_2, \dots , P_t) = \gcd( P_1, \gcd(P_2, \dots , P_t)), $$ starting with $\gcd(P_{t-1},P_t)$, $\gcd(P_{t-2}, \gcd(P_{t-1},P_t))$ etc. If you do this with the extended Euclidean algorithm you obtain the Bezout-coefficients, i.e., polynomials $Q_1,\ldots ,Q_t$, and one can estimate the degree (also the degree of a gcd of univariate polynomials can be estimated by Barnett's theorem, see $URL$ Edit: The estimate on the degrees obtained in this way may not be optimal, of course. However, as soon as one can find $P_i$ and $P_j$ with $\gcd(P_i,P_j)=1$, one has $1=Q_iP_i+Q_jP_j=\sum_{k=1}^tQ_kP_k$ with all other $Q_k=0$, and $\sum_{k=1}^t\deg (Q_k)\le 2n$. Otherwise each pair $(P_i,P_j)$ has a non-trivial gcd, and this should help to reduce the total degree of the $Q_i$'s. 

There is among other references the thesis of J. Lengler devoted to the Cohen-lenstra heuristics. This is not too technical and has many details. The author says: " The aim of this thesis is to explain and motivate the fundamental assumption of the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics, namely that the larger the automorphism group of a group is, the less likely it should appear". The author also has a paper on "The Global Cohen-Lenstra Heuristic", see $URL$ 

For a finite group $G$, denote the maximum of the orders of its Abelian subgroups by $a(G)$. Then we have, for $G=F_4(q)$ and $q$ even, $$ q^{11}\le a(G)\le q^{17}, $$ and for $G=F_4(q)$, $q$ odd, $$ q^{9}\le a(G)\le q^{14}. $$ For $G=C_n(q)$ we have, for $n\neq 2$, $$ a(G)=q^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}. $$ For a reference, see the paper Maximal Orders of Abelian Subgroups in Finite Chevalley Groups by E. P. Vdovin, published in $2001$; in particular table $2$. 

As the comment shows the answer is negative in general. Perhaps it is worth to mention that for connected compact Lie groups the answer is yes, because its exponential map is surjective. In general, if the exponential map of a Lie group $G$ is surjective, then every group element $g \in G$ has a square root, i.e. an element $a \in G$ with $a^2 = g$, since $\exp(x)$ has $\exp(x/2)$ as a square root for any $x \in \mathfrak {g}=\operatorname{Lie}(G)$. 

A good example why $p=2$ and $p=3$ are exceptional for Lie theory is the classification of simple modular Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields of characteristic $p$. For $p=2$ a classification seems to be completely out of reach, and even for $p=3$ this might not be feasable. The reasons have been given already, but also trivial reasons from linear algebra play a role, e.g., $0=tr(A+A^t)=tr(A)+tr(A^t)=2tr(A)$ will not imply that $tr(A)=0$ for $p=2$. However, for $p\ge 5$ the classification is very nice: the simple Lie algebras fall into the following three classes: $\bullet$ Finite dimensional graded Cartan type Lie algebras and their deformations. $\bullet$ Classical Lie algebras $A_n,B_n,C_n,D_n,G_2,F_4,E_6,E_7,E_8$. $\bullet$ The Melikyan algebras $M(m,n)$ on two parameters, for $p=5$. 

Let $A\in M_n(K)$ be a square matrix over a field $K$. The notion of inverse matrix was generalized by Moore and Penrose for real and complex matrices (also called pseudo-inverse $A^{\dagger}$ of $A$, satisfying $AA^{\dagger}A=A, A^{\dagger}AA^{\dagger}=A^{\dagger}$ and $AA^{\dagger}$ Hermitian). This was again generalized to arbitrary fields with involutory automorphism of $K$ by Pearl, but the existence depends on additional rank conditions. Question: What is known on the existence of a generalized inverse $A'$, which just satisfies $AA'A=A$, over an arbitrary field ? Do we also need an additional assumption, perhaps on the characteristic of $K$, or again some rank condition ? 

If one could prove the explicit $abc$-conjecture, i.e., with an explicit constant $C$, then one would have explicit bounds on the heights of the rational points in Falting's theorem. If this is not available, one can try other methods. For example, consider the Fermat quartics $x^4+y^4=c$. For $c=17$ this is Serre's curve. Serre asked whether or not there are rational solutions other than the obvious ones $(\pm 1,\pm 2),(\pm 2,\pm 1)$. This could be proved by Flyn in $2001$ using Chabauty techniques. All other cases $c\le 81$ can be solved easier, i.e., by local methods or by a map onto an elliptic curve of rank $0$. All integer solutions of $y^2-y=x^5-x$ have beed determined by Yann Bugeaud, Maurice Mignotte, Samir Siksek, Michael Stoll and Szabolcs Tengely in $2008$. They are $$ (x,y)=(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(2,-5),(2,6),(3,-15),(3,16),(30,-4929), (30,4939). $$ 

The mentioned result of Cohn has been further extended. Let us write $σ(G) = n$ whenever $G$ is the union of $n$ proper subgroups, but is not the union of any smaller number of proper sub- groups. Thus, for instance, Scorza’s result asserts that $σ(G) = 3$ if and only if $G$ has a quotient isomorphic to $C_2 × C_2$. Theorem(Cohn 1994): Let $G$ be a group. Then (a) $σ(G) = 4$ if and only if $G$ has a quotient isomorphic to $S_3$ or $C_3 × C_3$. (b) $σ(G) = 5$ if and only if $G$ has a quotient isomorphic to the alternating group $A_4$. (c) $σ(G) = 6$ if and only if $G$ has a quotient isomorphic to $D_5, C_5 × C_5$, or $W$,where $W$ is the group of order $20$ defined by $a^5 =b^4 ={e},ba=a^2b$. Furthermore, Tomkinson proved that there is no group $G$ such that $σ(G) = 7$. For more information see the article of Mira Bhargava, "Groups as unions of subgroups". The references also contain papers on the subject from $1964$ to $1997$, e.g., J. Sonn, Groups that are the union of finitely many proper subgroups, Amer. Math. Monthly 83 (1976), no. 4, 263–265. 

True for dimensions $n\le 8$: the existence of left-invariant affine structures on nilpotent Lie groups of dimension $n$. All nilpotent Lie groups of dimension $n\le 8$ admit such a structure. This is probably false for all $n\ge 9$, but this is only proved for $n=10,11,12$ so far. More precisely, there exist nilpotent Lie groups of dimension $10,11,12$ which do not admit any affine structure. 

In addition to the atlas of finite groups I would look for more specific results on minimal faithful representations of finite groups. 1.) Here is a nice tlak with slides from Saunders: caul.cii.fc.ul.pt/GSConf2011/Slides/saunders.pdf‎. 2.) here is a nice talk with slides from Lötscher: $URL$ 

In general this is a difficult problem, but in special cases like $x^n+y^n=z^n$ in polynomials we can use Mason's theorem, which is about an analogue of the $abc$-conjecture for polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[t]$. It implies the following result: Theorem: Let $n ≥ 2$ be an integer, and suppose $a, b, c \in \mathbb{C}[t]$ are pairwise relatively prime polynomials, at least one of which is not a constant, satisfying $a^n + b^n = c^n$. Then $n = 2$. For the case $n=2$ we have the basic solutions $(a(t),b(t),c(t))=(m(t)^2-n(t)^2,2m(t)n(t),m(t)^2+n(t)^2)$ with polynomials $m(t),n(t)$.
