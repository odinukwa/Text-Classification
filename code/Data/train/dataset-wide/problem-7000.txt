If you buy stocks of a company you are buying a share in that business. If you buy bonds from the same company you are essentially loaning them money for future payment. I am guessing (correct me if I am wrong!) that if you buy a bond the terms of repayment have to be very concrete, i.e. you get 2 dollars next year and 10 after that. Otherwise they could tag the repayment to the stock price and what you would have is a bond that behaves like a stock with automated dividends. My question: What body of law governs what you can and cannot promise in a bond contract and what agency is overseeing this? (Corporate law and the SEC?) I am most interested in the US setting, but info about other countries is also welcome. A secondary question is what big practical differences between stocks and bonds the regulation causes. (The common economics/finance wisdom is that stocks have higher yields but bigger 'risk'. I am more interested in practical differences that lie in the mechanisms, such as bond owners having precedence in case of bankruptcy.) 

I have to say I do not believe in simple all encompassing answers. The reasons behind the differences are probably complex and multitude, varying from country to country. Below are some answers that one runs into and I think these probably account for a share of the inequality. 

It is based on multiple pieces of work, most of which can be found in the prize committee's thoroughly referenced announcement. 

EDIT: Plurality rule has one round of voting and whoever has the most votes wins. Example: United Kingdom parliamentary elections The simple run-off rule has two rounds of voting. The two candidates with the most votes in round 1 advance to round 2. In round 2 voters vote for their favourite remaining candidate, and whoever has the most votes wins. Example: French presidential election The elimination rule is similar to the run-off rule but has three rounds (number of alternatives minus one). In each round the candidate with the least votes is eliminated (figuratively). Others proceed to the next round. Example: Academy award (Oscar) vote 

It is true because of the discounting. If the discount parameter were $\delta = 1$ then players 1 and 2 could alternate playing TL and MR in equilibrium and then reach the average payoff vector $1,1,5$. But if $\delta < 1$ someone will not play along. Suppose the players are supposed to start with TL. Then MR would follow in the next round then, then TL again, and so on. In this case $$ U_1 = 0 + 2 \cdot \delta + 0 \cdot \delta^2 + 2 \cdot \delta^3 + ... $$ Yet by always playing B player 1 would achieve the payoff $$ U_1' = 1 + 1 \cdot \delta + 1 \cdot \delta^2 + 1 \cdot \delta^3 + ... $$ which is larger then $U_1$. Similarly player 2 would not want to start with MR. So these are not equilibrium playoffs. (Not even Aumann's correlated-equilibrium would do the trick.) 

In this context 'market' usually means some allocation mechanism. For example free market, or a market where someone has monopoly power. Allocation of goods and resources can be done in other ways: e.g. you can divide all resources evenly among production processes and all goods evenly between consumers. This will generally result in allocative inefficiency (were all production processes equally important and efficient?). But it is not market failure because there was no market, just an allocator/social planner. 

In the UK in May 2016 the Alcohol Duty payed on alcoholic beverages was 852 million pounds. I would argue that this tax is levied on the suppliers of the beverages. Of course consumers are made aware of the tax and suppliers use the money payed by consumers to transfer to the treasury but consumers transfer exactly 0 million pounds to the treasury under the heading Alcohol Duty. The other approach where we estimate a demand and supply curve and calculate the equilibrium price without the Alcohol Duty and compare this to the price consumers pay and the price suppliers get with the duty would yield a different outcome. But this obfuscates matters greatly. Again, what happens is that the market mechanism is changed. The duty raises the equilibrium price payed by the consumers and lowers the equilibrium price received by suppliers. Sometimes this phraseology also talks in welfare terms and mentions the tax burden. I find this somewhat better as both consumer and supplier welfare is decreased in this case. Usually however this burden is equated with the tax received by the state. This is generally incorrect as it does not take into account the deadweight loss caused by the tax. So while the tax does burden both consumers and suppliers just by comparing these burdens one does not get anything akin to who is paying what share of the tax. The market mechanism is changed by the tax. Comparitive statistics may be preformed to examine welfare changes. These concepts exist and are clear. 

It can be both. The number of working hours are of course easier to interpret. You can also make the assumption that every employee works some fixed number of hours, say 8 per day (or 220 per month, or 38 a week, etc). In this case if you denote by $n$ the number of workers and $L$ the number of hours worked you have of course $$ n \cdot 8 = L $$ and then $$ A \cdot K^{1-\alpha} \cdot L^{\alpha} = A \cdot K^{1-\alpha} \cdot ( n \cdot 8 ) ^{\alpha} = 8^{\alpha} \cdot A \cdot K^{1-\alpha} \cdot n ^{\alpha} = \left(8^{\alpha} \cdot A\right) \cdot K^{1-\alpha} \cdot n ^{\alpha}. $$ So you can choose $L$ to represent either quantity as long as you take it into consideration when choosing/calibrating $A$. (Provided that some conditions like $n \cdot 8 = L$ hold or are a reasonable approximation of reality.) 

An obvious way to approach this would be to compare projections based on a China without the one child policy (pre 1979 pop growth rates) and on a China with the one child policy (post 1979 pop growth rates). Pop growth rates are constant but different in the two cases. 

One reason a direct interpretation may be difficult is that the function is seemingly without unit. That is if for a function $F()$ the inequality $F(y) \leq 0$ yields the set of feasible productions then the function $G() = 2F()$ works as well. The same is true for any other scalar multiplication or any monotonic transformation of $F$ that leaves the $F(y) = 0$ level curve in place. 

You could add up the equations \begin{align} \delta(1-\underline{S})S_j=e_i(S_i+S_j)^2 \\ \delta(1-\underline{S})S_i=e_j(S_i+S_j)^2 \end{align} to get \begin{align} \delta(1-\underline{S})(S_i+S_j)=(e_i+e_j)(S_i+S_j)^2 \end{align} which simplifies to \begin{align} \delta(1-\underline{S})=(e_i+e_j)(S_i+S_j). \end{align} This gives you $(S_i+S_j)$. From the initial equations \begin{align} \delta(1-\underline{S})S_j=e_i(S_i+S_j)^2 \\ \delta(1-\underline{S})S_i=e_j(S_i+S_j)^2 \end{align} you can also get $$ \frac{S_j}{e_i} = \frac{(S_i+S_j)^2}{\delta(1-\underline{S})} = \frac{S_i}{e_j}, $$ which gives you $$ \frac{S_j}{S_i} = \frac{e_i}{e_j}. $$ Now you have both the sum and ratio of the variables $S_j,S_i$. Calculating their individual values should be a straightforward matter. 

Ideally the points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ are very close. The assumption is that that they are so close that the elasticity of the demand function on the curve between them is nearly constant. This is what elasticity is trying to measure, local changes, because on the far side of the range of the demand function consumer behavior may be unobserved and totally different. E.g. to my knowledge no one has tried to sell a bottle of Coke for \$40,000 so we don't know what value the demand function would take. If you would choose a very distant point $(x_3,y_3)$ instead of the local $(x_2,y_2)$ you would get a very different value of elasticity. So what does the book mean by initial value? Ideally the elasticity measured in points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ would be constant because they are very close. Of course in practice this will not always be the case, meaning $$ \frac{(x_1-x_2)/x_1}{(y_1-y_2)/y_1} \neq \frac{(x_1-x_2)/x_2}{(y_1-y_2)/y_2}. $$ Instead of taking one of these values as the elasticy of the curve we can improve our estamite by taking the arc elasticity which usually yields a value between these two. 

Would you be satisfied with a graph of the last 20 years? Is yes, you can use Google Data Explorer. It seems to rely on Eurostat as well, so the data is probably available from them somewhere. 

An economics professor and her student are walking on the street. The student points to the ground before them. "Professor look! A twenty dollar bill!" The professor waves dismissingly. "Do not bother picking it up. If it were a real twenty dollar bill someone would already have picked it up." I also like these two SMBC comics featuring Superman, but the images are big so I will only link to them. It's more complex than you realize. Finally, we found maximum efficiency. 

The relative aggregate demand is the ratio $\frac{c_x}{c_y}$. As we have discussed $\frac{c_y}{c_x} = p$ so $$ \frac{c_x}{c_y} = \frac{1}{p}. $$ As a result one can draw the relative aggregate demand in the previous graph as hyperbole. The intersection with the relative aggregate supply curve will give yield the equilibrium price ratio and will also yield information about the production of individual countries. Where this intersection occurs depends on the parameters $L_E,L_P,a_{x,E},a_{y,E},a_{x,P},a_{y,P}$. I will distinguish between three types of equilibria, each represented in the following figure: 

Source Hence the recommendation is to use what they have at hand: euro bills. But if their euros would be the same as other euros, then the exchange rate between a Greek euro and a 'normal' euro could not go over 1, because you could always take a Greek euro abroad and use it there. So if the government wants the exchange rate to change (this would increase competitiveness and this is the biggest advantage Greece could get out of a new currency) they will have to modify the existing euros they have. For example they can stamp holes in them. You can read about such speculation in more detail 

Utility is constant for all points $(q_B,q_A)$ on an indifference curve. So there is a number $u_1$ such that $$ \forall (q_B,q_A) \in IC_1: \ U(q_B,q_A) = u_1. $$ Similarly there is a number $u_2$, such that $$ \forall (q_B,q_A) \in IC_2: \ U(q_B,q_A) = u_2. $$ If $IC_1 \neq IC_2$ then $u_1 \neq u_2$. 

This does not directly answer your question, but I will try to explain why I don't think that such well known papers exist. If submitted I don't think that such a paper would be accepted by the top five journals. This is because the journals also compete to stay relevant, to give surprising information. The phenomenon is known as publication bias. This was also a big problem for the medical community. The solution they arrived at is that they only accept trials if the trial and its hypothesis is reported to the authorities at the beginning of the trial. Because of this the result will be stored no matter what it is. Even though unsurprising results are unlikely to get much publicity, a researcher looking for them can find them. The same solution cannot work for economic regressions because running a regression on the same data always gives the same result. Hence false positives are not a result of lucky samples, but of tweeking the model to particular data. 

Because otherwise you would not have subgame perfect equilibria. Suppose I have an item you need and the item is worthless to me. I would be happy to give you the item for any positive amount of money. If you give me no money for it, I am indifferent, both giving you the item and not giving you the item is an optimal choice for me. Just to be clear: we are not bargaining. You set I price and I will take it or leave it. If you offer price 0 and I give you the item that is an equilibrium. No one could have made a better choice given the other person's choice. If you offer price 0 and I do not give you the item that is not an equilibrium, because I would give you the item for any small positive payment and you would be willing to pay that, so you could have made a better move. If you offer price $2a>0$ I will give you the item. But this is not an equilibrium. You could also have offered me $a$, which is also positive, and I would also have given you the item then. So you could have saved some money, your original move was not optimal. Because there is no smallest positive number, the only equilibrium in such cases is when one side is indifferent.
