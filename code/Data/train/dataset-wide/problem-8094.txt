We can think of the splitting principle as a condition on a "cohomology theory" (of some sort) $E^*$, coming about when working with Chern classes for instance, and then ask: When does $E^*$ satisfy this condition? First, let's make the condition more precise and reformulate it: Condition 1: Given $X$ and a vector bundle $V$ on $X$, there exists $f: X' \to X$ such that $f^* V'$ has a filtration with subquotients line bundles, and $f^*: E^*(X) \to E^*(X')$ is injective. But there is a universal choice for $X'$, namely the flag variety of $V$: $p: Fl(V) \to X$. Any $f: X' \to X$ with $f^* V'$ filtered with line bundle subquotients will factor through $p$, and so we're really just asking if $p^*: E^*(X) \to E^*(Fl(V))$ is injective. Condition 1': For all $X$ and $V$, $p^*: E^*(X) \to E^*(Fl(V))$ is injective. At this point there are two ways this answer can go, depending on ones tastes: 

It sounds like you may want Exercise 9.7 in Hartshorne's "Residues and Duality". I paraphrase the statement: 

Transitive groups e.g. $G=\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_p)$ certainly have this property but I wonder if there exist infinitely many intransitive examples. I think one can easily reduce to the case that $G$ is a primitive linear group but then I don't know how to proceed. 

Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ (the most interesting case to me is $q=O(1)$). Let $A$ be an arbitrary subset of $V$ that spans $V$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $\mu=|A|/|V|$ be the density of $A$. What can we say about the smallest $k$ such that every $v\in V$ can be written as a linear combination of $t\leq k$ elements $a_1,\dots, a_t\in A$ $$ v=\sum_{i=1}^t c_i a_i $$ with coefficients $c_i\in\mathbb{F}_q$? I can prove $k\leq (1/\mu)^c$ for some constant $c>0$, basically by repeating applying the fact that $|A-A|\geq (3/2)|A|$ if $A$ is not a subgroup of $V$. This fact follows from an argument of Laba, and is stated as Lemma 2.5 in the following survey by Lovett: $URL$ Is there a better upper bound? And any lower bounds known? 

You can somewhat lift the algebraic closedness assumption: You have to allow an auxillary ring (actually, division algebra) to act equivariantly on both representation and tensor over it. Such a decomposition should hold whenever one of the groups has semi-simple representation category (the division rings in 1 are endomorphisms of simples). Then, the decomposition can be made canonical precisely up to choosing representative simple objects. If $V$ is a $G \times H$-rep, and $\rho$ are representative simples for $G$, then the natural map $$ \bigoplus_{\rho} \rho \otimes_{D_\rho} Hom_G(\rho, V) \to V $$ with $D_\rho = End_G(\rho)$ will be an isomorphism of $G \times H$-modules. (Conversely, given applying such a decomposition to $k[G]$ viewed as $G \times G$-module one would have to recover a representative set of simples.) For symmetric groups (in char. $0$), the endomorphism rings of simples are just the field (i.e., the simples remain irreducible over the alg. closure), so in particular you get such decompositions. Moreover, there are explicit representative simples that one can write down (the Specht modules). I don't know of the combinatorial theory to say if this gives any sort of satisfactory answer to your question 3.

I am interested in intransitive irreducible linear subgroups $G\subseteq\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_p)$ acting on $V-\{0\}=\mathbb{F}_p^n-\{0\}$ in the natural way, such that all of the orbits are very large, with constant density in $V$. Actually I am wondering if there exists an infinite family of groups satisfying this property. Here $p$ is supposed to be a fixed prime. The question can be formalized as follows: 

Dear all, Consider the $(n+1)\times (n+1)$ matrix $A$ with indeterminates $X_i, Y_i$, $0\leq i\leq n$ such that the $(i,j)$-th entry is given by $X_i^jY_i^{n-j}$. The $i$-th row is $(X_i^n,X_i^{n-1}Y_i,\dots,Y_i^n)$ that can be thought as given by the Veronese embedding $\mathbb{P}^1\to\mathbb{P}^n$. The determinant of $A$ is multi-homogeneous and hence defines a variety in $\prod_{i=0}^n\mathbb{P}^1$. It can be checked that $\det(A)$ has the following nice factorization $$ \det(A)=\prod_{0\leq i<j\leq n}\det\left(\begin{smallmatrix}X_j & Y_j\\X_i & Y_i\end{smallmatrix}\right) $$ which gives the decomposition of the corresponding variety. Actually, setting $Y_i=1$, $0\leq i\leq n$, the matrix $A$ simply becomes the Vandermonde matrix and the above factorization becomes $\det(A)=\prod_{0\leq i<j\leq n}(X_j-X_i)$, as is well known. We may also consider its higher dimensional generalization: for $n,d\geq 1$, let $N={n+d\choose d}$. Consider the $N\times N$ matrix $A$ whose $i$-th row is given by the $n$-uple Veronese embedding $\mathbb{P}^d\to\mathbb{P}^N$ that sents $(X_{i,0},\dots,X_{i,d})$ to the $N$-tuple consisting of all monomials in $X_{i,0},\dots,X_{i,d}$ with total degree $n$. Question: for $d>1$, does $\det(A)$ admit similar factorization? Or is it simply irreducible? Setting $X_{i,0}=1$ for all $i$ gives the higher dimensional analogue of the Vandermonde matrix which arises naturally in, for example, the problem of multivariate interpolation. For the multivariate case, I have never seen a simple explicit form of $\det(A)$ as the univariate one, though. So I guess it must be complicated. And my understanding in this case is very limited. I tried to calculate the determinant in a naive way (by mimicing the calculation in the 1-dimension case) but the amount of calculation blows up quickly. But maybe there are structures that I didn't recognize which help simplifying the calculation. So I am also looking for any suggestion for better calculation methods (grobner basis, tools from algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, etc). Thanks a lot! 

Consider the Euclidean group $E(n)$ as the semidirect product for Euclidean vector space $\mathbb{E}^n$ with its orthogonal group $O(\mathbb{E}^n)$: $E(n)=\mathbb{E}^n\rtimes O(\mathbb{E}^n)$ Then the following short exact sequence splits $1\rightarrow \mathbb{E}^n\rightarrow E(n)\rightarrow O(\mathbb{E}^n)\rightarrow 1$ Now consider a subgroup G of the Euclidean group which translational subgroup T (all isometries in G with trivial linear part) can be identified with a lattice $\mathcal{L}^{n}$ in Euclidean vector space, i.e. all $\mathbb Z$-linear combinations of a chosen basis. The translation subgroup T is normal in G and we can write the short exact sequence $1\rightarrow T\rightarrow G\rightarrow Q\rightarrow 1$ where quotient group $Q=G/T$. This short exact sequence splits iff $G=T\rtimes Q$. This is the case iff Q is isomorphic to the automorphism of the lattice so that we can write for example the following split short exact sequence $1\rightarrow \mathcal{L}^{n}\rightarrow G\rightarrow Aut(\mathcal{L}^{n}) \rightarrow 1$ 

As far as I understood, the Fourier decomposition of a function $\boldsymbol{F}\colon\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}^{m}$ where $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is endowed with the Euclidean inner product $\left<\cdot,\cdot\right>$ is given by $\boldsymbol{F}(\bar{x})=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}{\tilde{\boldsymbol{F}}(\bar{\nu})e^{2\pi i \left<\bar{\nu},\bar{x}\right>}}{d\bar{\nu}}$ where $\tilde{\boldsymbol{F}}(\bar{\nu})=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}{\boldsymbol{F}(\bar{x})e^{-2\pi i \left<\bar{\nu},\bar{x}\right>}}{d\bar{x}}$ How does this come about and for which functions does it apply? I'm not even able to find the right framework to work in (Hilbert spaces?). Secondly, could I just replace the Euclidean inner product by the Minkowskian inner product when in Minkowski space? 

The following is not strictly speaking something that can be read off from the character table. However, it is an elementary combinatorial identity about partitions which one can deduce from understanding the character theory of symmetric groups well enough, and looking at the character table does play a central role: For $\lambda \vdash n$ a partition of $n$ (i.e., $n = 1 \lambda_1 + 2 \lambda_2 + \cdots + n \lambda_n$) define $$ A(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} n^{\lambda_n}, \qquad B(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (\lambda_n)! $$ Claim: $$\prod_{\lambda \vdash n} A(\lambda) = \prod_{\lambda \vdash n} B(\lambda) $$ The character-theoretic proof proceeds as follows: 

If $X$ is smooth and proper, GAGA does in fact suffice (despite the observation that $d$ is not $\mathcal{O}_X$-linear: One obtains a comparison map of hypercohomology spectral sequences; it is an isomorphism on the $E_2$ page by GAGA, and thus on the $E_\infty$ page. It is to prove the general case (i.e., $X$ smooth but not necessarily proper) that one needs to do additional work. 

A finite transitive permutation group $G$ can always be ``decomposed'' into primitive permutation groups, called its primitive components, although the decomposition is not unique. See Chapter 1 of Finite Permutation Groups by Wielandt. Suppose $H$ is a primitive component of $G$, and $T$ is a composition factor of $H$ that is also a classical group $X(d,q)$. Here $X$ stands for $\mathrm{PSL}$, $\mathrm{PSU}$, etc. Then $T$ is a subquotient of a composition factor $T'$ of $G$. If $T'$ is an alternating group $\mathrm{Alt}_k$, is there any lower bound on its degree $k$, in terms of $d$ and $q$? If $T$ is a subgroup of $T'$ then $T$ has a faithful permutation representation of degree $k$. In this case I think a lower bound of order $q^{\Theta(d)}$ is known. See: Cooperstein, Bruce N. "Minimal degree for a permutation representation of a classical group." Israel J. Math. 30 (1978), no. 3, 213-235. MR 506701 DOI: 10.1007/BF02761072. I wonder if a similar bound is possible if $T$ is only a subquotient of $T'$. A related question: for $k\in\mathbb{N}^+$, denote by $\Gamma_k$ the family of finite groups whose nonabelian composition factors are all isomorphic to subgroups of $\mathrm{Sym}_k$. If $G$ is a group in $\Gamma_k$, are its primitive components also in $\Gamma_k$ (or $\Gamma_{k'}$ for some $k'$ depending on $k$)?
