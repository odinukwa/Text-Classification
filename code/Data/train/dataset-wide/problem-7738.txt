How many points of the integer lattice ${\mathbb Z}^2$ can an axis-parallel ellipse of radius $r$ contain on its boundary? (that is, we consider ${\mathbb Z}^2$ as lying in ${\mathbb R}^2$). Alternatively, this appears to be very similar to the question of how many points can the boundary of any axis-parallel ellipse contain from an $r\times r$ section of the integer lattice. Let us say that the ellipse is defined as $(ax-b)^2+(cy-d)^2=r^2$. If $a,b,c,d$ are integers, we can reduce the problem to asking for the number of integer solutions to of an equation of the form $ax^2+by^2=r^2$ with integers $a,b$. This is known to have at most $r^{\frac{c}{\lg \lg r}}$ solutions, for some constant $c$. Does a similar bound exist for every axis-parallel ellipse? In case it helps, I mainly care about the case where $a,b,c,d$ are not much larger than $r$. 

Let $A_r = \{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z|\leq 1\}\cup\{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z-1|\leq r\}$ be the unit disk with a small "bump" (I'm interested in the regime $r\to 0$). What can be said about the logarithmic capacity of $A_r$? I can prove that there exists a constant $\gamma>0$ such that $\mathop{\mathrm{cap}}(A_r)=\gamma r^2 + $terms of smaller order, but have no idea about how to obtain the value of $\gamma$. Related to the above question: is there any useful explicit form of the conformal mapping of $\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \Im(z)\leq 0\}$ to $\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \Im(z)\leq 0\}\cup \{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z|\leq 1\}$? 

Let $S(n)$ be the discrete sphere of radius $n$ (i.e., the internal boundary of the Euclidean discrete ball $B(n)$) centered in the origin, and consider a simple random walk starting at some $x\in\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $2n-1<\|x\|\leq 2n$ (the dimension $d$ is at least 2). Let $\nu_{n,x}$ be the conditional entrance measure to $S(n)$, given that the walk hits $S(n)$ before $S(4n)$. Also, let $hm_n$ be the harmonic measure (from infinity) on $S(n)$. Can one prove that the R.-N. derivative of $\nu_{n,x}$ with respect to $hm_n$ satisfies the Lipschitz condition? That is, there is a constant $C$ (maybe depending on the dimension), such that $$\Big| \frac{\nu_{n,x}(y)}{hm_n(y)} - \frac{\nu_{n,x}(z)}{hm_n(z)} \Big| \leq C \frac{\|y-z\|}{n}, $$ for all $y,z\in S(n)$. This is obviously true for the Brownian motion, but the discrete case is more tricky, since the harmonic measure is not uniform. 

You can do a bit better than the bound in Dan's reply. For a sufficiently small $\varepsilon$, consider the polynomial $g= f^2-\varepsilon$. Note that the zero set of $g$ has at lest one connected component inside of every cell of ${\mathbb R}^n\setminus M$. Thus, the Milnor-Thom theorem gives the upper bound $d^n$. The above bound is asymptotically tight. By taking $f$ to be the product of $d$ linear expressions of the form $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n+b$ you get that $M$ is the union of $n$ hyperplanes. When these hyperplanes are generic, it is not difficult to show that ${\mathbb R}^n\setminus M$ consists of at least $cd^n$ compoenets, for some constant $c$. If you would like to have a more well-behaved polynomial, you can again replace $f$ with $g= f^2-\varepsilon$. 

Is there an explicit formula for the (logarithmic) capacity of a union of two disjoint disks? As far as I understand, one can assume without loss of generality that the disks have the same radii (otherwise apply a suitable Möbius transform etc.). 

There is an example in the book "Essentials of Stochastic processes" of Durrett, which shows that, in general, $m$ need not be equal to $2n-2$ (it is Example 4.5 of the chapter devoted to Markov chains, Durrett calls this example "Mathematician's nightmare"). The state space of the chain is $\{0,1,\ldots,14\}$, from $0$ it jumps to $5,9,14$ with equal probabilities, from other states $x>0$ it always jumps to $x-1$. It is then claimed that $m$ is at least $30$ for this chain (I didn't do the calculations myself, though). 

Many combinatorial problems can be reduced to bounding the number of edges in a given graph with $n$ vertices. Each time I encounter such a problem, I check whether the corresponding graph has a property that is known to imply a bound on number of edges (as probably most people do). For example, whether the graph is planar. My question is what graph properties imply a bounded number of edges. I assume that there are such properties that I am not familiar with, and it seems quite useful to have a list of these properties. I am only interested in cases where the number of edges is asymptotically smaller than $n^2$ (for example, Turan's Theorem is not relevant). Some properties that I am already familiar with: 

No, the CLT need not hold under these assumptions. Consider the following example: take $p=1/2$ for definiteness, and divide the (discrete) time into intervals $I_1=[1,2]$, $I_n=(2^{n-1}, 2^n]$, $n\geq 2$. On each interval, let $(X_k, k\in I_n)$ be the i.i.d. Bernoulli($1/2$) conditioned on $\sum_{k\in I_n}X_k=|I_n|/2$ (think about placing $|I_n|/2$ balls into $|I_n|$ urns at random); clearly, $(X_i,X_j)$ are negatively correlated when $i,j\in I_n$ for some $n$. Then the CLT doesn't hold since the sum becomes deterministic from time to time. The correlations are not strictly negative though (because the $X$'s are independent if belong to different intervals), but you can probably make them so by some "small" perturbation. 

Notice that the number of Catalan paths of area at least $cn^{\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon}$ is less than the number of all paths that deviate from the horizontal axis by at least $n^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}$. Let $(S_k, k\geq 0)$ be the one-dimensional simple random walk starting from the origin. We need to find an upper bound for the following probability: $$P\big[\max_{k\leq 2n}S_k > n^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}\big].$$ Now, one may use e.g. a Chernoff's bound for the Binomial distribution (together with the Reflection Principle if you don't want an extra polynomial term in front, see e.g. Chapter III of the Feller's book) to obtain that the above probability is upper bounded by $\exp(-c'n^{\varepsilon})$. So, the total number of such paths is at most $4^n\exp(-c'n^{\varepsilon})$. 

Perhaps you will not consider this as a real-world application, but in recent years Theoretical Computer Science is using more and more Algebraic Geometry. For example, one main approach for attacking the "P vs NP" problem is based on Algebraic Geometry (see this Wikipedia page). There are various algorithms that rely on tools from algebraic geometry (see for example this paper). Other uses of Algebraic Geometry pop up in Cryptography, Coding Theory, and other sub-fields. 

The Szemerédi–Trotter bound is known to be false for circles (it is true for circles with the same radii). There is a construction that gives $N^{2/3}|C|^{2/3}\log^{1/3}N$ incidences. The current best upper bound is about $N^{6/11}|C|^{9/11}$, and this is conjectured to be far from tight (see for example this recent result of Sharir and Zahl). You can find a similar correct argument in Claim 1.6.4 here.
