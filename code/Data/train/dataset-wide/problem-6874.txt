Note that $p$ is not orthogonal to consumption vectors on the budget line, but it is orthogonal to a any vector $v$ that satisfies $x+v=x'$ with $x,x'$ in the budget line. MWG are drawing vectors starting from some $x$. About the slope: In the budget line you can see that the slope for any $x$ is $D_x (p.x)=p$ (that is the line that is drawn from $x$). That line or vector can be represented with the function $x_2=(p_2/p_1)*x_1$ (note that if $x_1=p_1$, $x_2=p_2$). The slope is $p_2/p_1$. On the other hand, all vectors on the budget line satisfy $x_2=(-p_1/p_2)*x_1+w/p_2$. The slope here is $(-p_1/p_2)$. This slope is the rate of exchange. Both slopes imply that the two functions (the vector $p$ and the budget line) are orthogonal. Or maybe it's better to say that the orthogonality between the budget line and the vector $p$ imply that $dx_2/dx_1=-p_1/p_2$, that is, the last term captures the rate of exchange. 

If you don't have any background in Real Analysis, I suggest you to read "Analysis I" written by Terence Tao. I was in a similar situation that you a year ago. I studied Economics at college but we never had to do rigorous proofs (as a matter of fact, I did not know what was a theorem, a mathematical proof, or mathematical logic until I read the book). We only learned some "rules" of derivation and integration, and to manipulate algebraic equations in order to get some important results in Economics. However, a professor suggested me to apply to a PhD program and to take a real analysis course. It was really hard because I had never seen something like that. The books recommended by the analysis professor were the common books you will be recommended here: Baby Rudin, Kolmogorov and Fomin, Ok, Abbot, Apostol, etc. I read some of them (specially Baby Rudin) and I found them too difficult. The problem was that I found difficult "thinking as a mathematician". Therefore, I started to search for the "best book" in real analysis, and I found this one written by Terence Tao. It was amazing, not only because the deep understanding and the outstanding expository skills of the author, but because he started from the very beginning: he answers some important questions (what is analysis and why to do it?) and starts explaining what are the natural, integer, rational, and real numbers (and also the Peano axioms, and some operations). He also starts explaining what sets are. Then, he develops the most important concepts of analysis: sequences, limits, convergence, series, etc. I think the most important feature of the book is that it is completely focused on building mathematical skills: how to prove a proposition, different ways to do it, how to use your intuition to develop a proof, etc. And also, it gives you a complete understanding of the topic. This makes it starkly different from other books such as Baby Rudin (which assumes that you know lots of results that, in fact, you don't), which is useful as a reference book and also when you have some well understanding of the topic (I moved easily from Tao to Rudin when the analysis course I took required me to do so). Another important characteristic of the book is its appendix: it gently introduces you to the basics of mathematical logic: what mathematical statements are, the structure of proofs, (nested) quantifiers, etc; and gives several examples of proofs. I often see questions like this and I have always found puzzling why no one recommends this book. It is maybe the best mathematics book I have ever read (as it may seem obvious, I love that book I have fond memories of me learning how to make proofs and what real numbers and analysis really are). Also, it is strange because Terence Tao is unarguably the most important mathematician alive and a very kind person. You can see his blog and the books he has published in the following link: $URL$ I hope this recommendation would be useful. 

The preference relation does not violate continuity. Consider a sequence $x_i \succsim y_i$ which converges to $x,y$. These sequences can only be such that $x_i=x$ and $y_i=y$, and $x\neq y$, since all other $x_i,y_i$ either do not converge to $x,y$, or do not fulfill $x_i \succsim y_i$. But clearly if $x_i\succsim y_i$ then $x\succsim y$. Monotonicity 

Let us first boil this question down to a simple story: Suppose bread prices are very flexible while luxury car prices are very sticky. If the central bank now changes its monetary policy to increase inflation, then bread will become relatively more expensive compared to luxury cars. If the central bank anticipates this, they may prefer a more restrictive monetary policy to avoid redistribution from the bottom to the top. To analyze this, two literature strands may help you. First, heterogeneous price stickiness has been studied in Carvalho, Carlos. "Heterogeneity in price stickiness and the real effects of monetary shocks." Frontiers in Macroeconomics 6.3 (2006). This paper essentially breaks with the standard assumption of identical price stickiness across sectors. Thus, at some point one sector (bread) may experience higher inflation than another sector (luxury cars), since luxury car prices are more sticky and there is an expansionary monetary policy. The framework for welfare analysis in sticky price models is given in: Woodford, Michael. Optimal monetary policy inertia. No. w7261. National Bureau of Economic Research, 1999. However, you not only have heterogeneity in price stickiness, but also heterogeneity in consumers. This is the second strand in the literature you should consider, the estimation of demand systems and welfare effects therein. The main reference (and recent Nobel memorial prizewinner) is: Deaton, Angus, and John Muellbauer. "An almost ideal demand system." The American economic review (1980): 312-326. If you combine these two analyses, you will have an answer to your question. However, this would require you more or less to write a paper about this (which may very well be worth it). 

As it is known, in simple economic growth models such as the Solow or the Ramsey model, all goods prices are set equal to 1 in each period. Also, as we known from general equilibrium theory, homogeneity of degree zero of demand implies that only relative prices matter. Therefore, we can always set one price equal to 1 (or do other types of "normalization"). However, in economic growth models (which are general equilibrium models) we have an infinite number of good prices and all are set equal to 1. Why do we always do that? Doesn't it affect the analysis of the model? I have search for an explanation, but I've been unable to find one. I have a hypothesis, though. Maybe we can normalize goods prices in each period because we assume the economy is in equilibrium at each instant. Then, by the same argument we use in static models, we can normalize goods price in each period. Is this explanation true? Or there is some other reason? And, if it is true, how do models that feature inflation are made? 

I did not understand the last part when you said $0≻x$ is impossible. I think it's necessary to use continuity + monotonicity in (3). For instance, let's take the $\Bbb R^2$ case. Assume we have two elements $x_1=(0,1)$ and $x_2=(1,0)$. Then, any combination is greater than $0$: $\alpha*x_1+(1-\alpha)*x_2 >>0$ if $\alpha \in (0,1)$. Re-definining $\alpha=1/n$. Then, we have built a sequence $x_n=(1/n)*x_1+(1-1/n)*x_2$ such that $x_n >> 0$ for any $n=2,3,...$. By monotonicity, $x_n≿0$ for all $n=2,...$. Finally, by continuity of preferences, $\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n≿0$. That is, $x_2≿0$ (the same for $x_1≿0$). This can be done in $\Bbb R^n$ and for any vector that have $x_j=0$ for some $j$. Hence, adding this with the proof you have made for the other cases ($x=0$ and $x>>0$) we have $x≿0$. The (1) case is implied by completeness, which imply reflexivity. 

let j(x) = behavioral curve let a(x) = a perfect bell shape = (1/50)(-(x-50)^2) + 50 let a(x) = money collected at x% rate of total income-- j(x) = (1/100)(x) (j(x)) a(x) = (1/100)(x) (j(x)) (100)(a(x)) = (x)(j(x)) (100*a(x))/(x) = j(x) ---substitute the equation for the perfect a(x)--- (100*((1/50) (-(x-50)^2) + 50))/(x) = j(x) 

So, I decided to first graph the behavior of the workers as the rate increases, which would then affect the amount of revenue the government took in (which, when graphed, is the Laffer curve), and then, just for fun, I included the disposable income. The x axis is the tax rate and the y axis is money amount-- in the United States, dollars. All y values are arbitrary. You could see the graph here: $URL$ Because the behavior of the workers is arbitrary, any depiction of their behavior would be sufficient for my purposes. Therefore, if you click on the link, you can see two different situations graphed, each situation for a different type of behavior. (For simplicity, I disabled the graphs for the second situation). Situation one: The orange curve is the total income of the economy before taxation, the purple curve is the tax revenue and the black curve is the disposable income. Situation two (not enabled): The green curve is the total income of the economy before taxation, the blue curve is the tax revenue and the red curve is the disposable income. The total income curves are shaped like they are because as the tax rate increases, society works less, (or is less motivated to make the same amount of money), and as a whole, has less total income. The tax revenue curves: Because, number one, as tax rates increase, workers are motivated to make less money, and, number two, the rate at which they make less money is increasing, the value of tax revenue does not increase at a constant rate. In fact, after a certain rate (changing depending on the behavior of the workers) tax revenues start to decrease. 80% of 60 dollars is more than 90% of 43 dollars. The tax revenue curves are, in essence, the Laffer curve. And lastly, the disposable income curves are simply, 

Let me just add some observations which are too long for a comment. It seems that the description of demand with linear utility as a step function seems not quite correct. In fact, what we get instead is a demand correspondence. The step function "jumps" at the step $w_x=w_y$, while the correct demand correspondence includes all possible combinations of $x$ and $y$ at the step. Moreover, the selection of demand (possibly better termed Marshallian demand) as an additional feature is good, but I think the table would be more useful if there are (possibly hidden until manually opened) the indirect utility function, the Hicksian demand and the expenditure function in the graph. Aside from the mentioned CES, quasilinear and translog utility, I would add the isoelastic utility $u(x,y)=x^a+y^b$. Note that if we start including utility functions over lotteries, we may also expand the tables by preferences over time, i.e. rational/hyperbolic discounting, etc. Finally, I think the generalization of the current functions to $n$ goods rather than two should not complicate the table but adds generality. (Also possible as additional entries). Edit: I also just realized that the current demand for the Leontief utility is wrong. It should be $I w_x/(p_yw_y+p_xw_x)$ for good $x$. What is currently given as the demand is instead the indirect utility $I/(p_yw_y+p_xw_x)$. The demand functions for the linear (and similarly the max function) can be written as $\begin{cases} I/p_x, & p_x w_x \leq p_yw_y \\ 0, & p_x w_x>p_yw_y \end{cases}$ The assumptions of the consumption problem should also be clearly stated (budget constraint, maximization problem) 

Actually there is a large literature on the estimation of production functions. Usually, one starts out with assuming a particular functional form (CES, Cobb-Douglas, etc.) and then estimating the parameters of the model. As indicated, the mathematics of this estimation are often nontrivial. However, here are some early references which can provide you with an entry point to the literature: Aigner, D., Lovell, C. K., & Schmidt, P. (1977). Formulation and estimation of stochastic frontier production function models. Journal of Econometrics, 6(1), 21-37. Førsund, F. R., Lovell, C. K., & Schmidt, P. (1980). A survey of frontier production functions and of their relationship to efficiency measurement. Journal of Econometrics, 13(1), 5-25. 

The Laffer curve merely describes the relationship between tax rate and tax revenue. It assumes that workers are most motivated to make money when the rate is 0%. It also assumes that as the rate increases, their motivation decreases. These two assumptions are the basis of the shape of the graph. It would therefore be understood, based on the two aforementioned assumptions, that at a 0% rate, the total income of the society is of large magnitude. But the graph neglects to depict this. All in all, I think the graph neglects to depict three thrings: 

The workers' income and how it changes as rates increase, the behavior of the workers as rates increase, (this is similar to but different than the first neglect), and the basis of the Laffer curve shape. 

Now, if one would argue that the Laffer curve should not be bell shaped, and rather should have constant slopes, we could deploy my graphs to show the absurdity of that assumption. The only society that can support a Laffer curve with constant slopes would be in a society where those taxed don't lose motivation to make money. This was, I believe, shown to be an impossibility during Communism in the USSR. Because it is a given that society becomes less and less motivated to make money the more they are taxed, using may graphs we can show that the Laffer curve must have changing slopes. I graphed a society with indifference to the tax rates using my equations. It can be found this link: $URL$ I was playing around with my graphs, creating different situations each depicting different worker behaviors and I noticed I was unable to choose a behavioral situation, (the orange curve in first situation above and green one in the second), where the tax revenue curve (the purple curve in first situation above and blue one in the second) would be a perfect bell shape like Laffer depicted in his curves. So, I decided I would work backwards. I would first draw the tax revenue curve and derive the formula for the associated behavioral curve. This requires simple algebra.
