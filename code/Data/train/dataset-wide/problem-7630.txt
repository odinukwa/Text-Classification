I'm trying to do some calculations with bimodules (over Azumaya algebras, as it happens), and I need a string diagram notation that mixes the tensor product over the base ring (a symmetric monoidal product) and the tensor product of bimodules. I haven't seen any diagrammatic calculus that allows for this mixing, but I haven't searched exhaustively. It seems that if I do something naive I could get something completely wrong. Has anybody used/seen such a thing? 

It is well-known there is an isomorphism between $GL(3,2)=PGL(3,2)$, the automorphism group of the Fano plane (i.e. the projective plane over the finite field with two elements), and $PSL(2,7)$, which is the automorphism group of the oriented projective line over the field with seven elements. (More details are on Wikipedia). What I'd like to know is if there is a finite geometric reason that these two groups are isomorphic. For instance, some combinatorial mapping of these geometries that induces an isomorphism between their automorphism groups. I was talking to Richard Green today about exceptional stuff in low dimensions and he claimed that there wasn't really a nice way to see it, unlike, for instance, the construction of the exceptional (outer) automorphism of $S_6$ using synthemes and duads. 

In particular, Lieven works out what is the Frobenioid associated to $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$, with the last post filling in the bit missing from earlier posts. Note that links to blog versions of these no longer work, as Lieven's blog has had some technical upheavals in the meantime. As a small comment of my own, the discussion of cancellative monoids, the monoid $\mathbb{N}^\times$ and actions of the latter, this seems very much like what Connes and Consani are doing with the Arithmetic site. The general philosophy of $\mathbb{F}_1$ seems to pervade this area. 

Why has no one mentioned anafunctors? They were invented by Makkai for the express purpose of expressing universal constructions as functor-like things (I was going to say 'objects') without having to make choices. The definition is as follows: Let $C$ and $D$ be categories. An anafunctor from $C$ to $D$ is a span $C\leftarrow U \to D$ where $U \to C$ is fully faithful and surjective on objects. That's it. Of course, it is a bit more tricky to show that there are the arrows of a (weak) 2-category of categories, and that category theory works perfectly well using this notion of categories; for the present purposes, the references at the above link should satisfy the most curious. In the case of the pullback 'functor' $h^*$ we have an anafunctor $\mathbf{C}/C \leftarrow P \to \mathbf{C}/C'$ where $P$ is the category with objects pullback squares with bottom arrow $h$ and morphisms the canonical thing which makes $P \to \mathbf{C}/C$ fully faithful: commutative triangles involving the other leg of the cospan involving $h$ - in other words, arrows in $\mathbf{C}/C$. This induces a canonical arrow in $\mathbf{C}/C'$ by the universal property of pullbacks, and then the functor $P\to \mathbf{C}/C'$ just forgets the original pullback square, and keeps the arrow with codomain $C'$. This is a functor by using the universal property of pullbacks a couple of times. If one has a way of choosing a particular pullback square for each object of $\mathbf{C}/C$, say by some sort of canonical construction as in the category of (ZF-)sets (Kuratowski pairs and subsets), or by judicious amounts of the axiom of choice, then one can find a section on objects of $P \to \mathbf{C}/C$, and this gives you a canonical section of the functor $P \to \mathbf{C}/C$, which then gives a pullback functor $h^*\colon \mathbf{C}/C \to \mathbf{C}/C'$. A similar sort of anafunctor exists for any universal construction, which is defined up to isomorphism by some universal property. 

Actually a classifying space $BG$ for the group $G$ is weakly terminal (existence but not uniqueness) in the category of principal $G$-bundles with commuting squares for maps. Sometimes this sort of thing is called 'generic' in category theory, in this case the generic $G$-torsor. Also, depending on which model you take, it may not classify all bundles, for example Segal's model for the classifying space of a well-pointed topological group only classifies numerable bundles: those trivialisable over an open cover with a subordinate partition of unity. Off the top of my head I can't think of a universal bundle that classifies all principal bundles (such a thing would have to not be numerable itself, as Segal's and Milnor's constructions are). Note that given a collection of transition maps $U_{ij} \to G$ over a non-numerable cover $U = \lbrace U_i \rbrace$ of some space $X$ ($G$ well-pointed, here), there is another reason you cannot get a classifying map $X\to BG$, namely that the canonical map $|NU| \to X$, where $|NU|$ is the geometric realisation of the nerve of the topological groupoid associated to $U$, is not split, as it is in the case when $U$ is numerable, though it is a weak homotopy equivalence. This raises the question of whether the functor $X \mapsto GBund_X$ is representable on the homotopy category of $Top$, rather than on the category of spaces and homotopy classes of maps. This depends on whether or not an arbitrary space is weakly equivalent to a paracompact space. 

I'm taking this from pages 15-16 from the linked article. The ene product $f \star g$ (not correct notation, I know) of two polynomials seems to be the polynomial which has roots the products $\alpha\beta$ for $\alpha$ a root of $f$ and $\beta$ a root of $g$. Then the ene product of a pair of Euler products $$ F(s) \bar{\star} G(s) = \prod_p F_p(p^{-s}) \bar{\star} \prod_p G_p(p^{-s})$$ where each of the $F_p$ and $G_p$ are polynomials indexed by primes $p$, is $$ F\;\bar{\star}G(s) = \prod_p F_p \star G_p (p^{-s}) $$ This is clearly merely the definition, and doesn't even ask what it might do. All I can glean is that the set of Dirichlet $L$-functions becomes a ring under this product with the Riemann zeta (suitably normalised) becoming the multiplicative unit. 

In the first sentence, the differentials $d_r$ are those appearing in the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for K-theory, and $cl$ is the map associating to an analytic cycle the corresponding cohomology class. Is it still true that there are no such counterexamples? Is there any evidence for this refinement of Hodge, or against (eg in work of Voisin)? In the second sentence, I'm not sure what Deligne means. It seems like something K-theory-like. 

I hope this this is not seen as too much as jumping on the band-wagon, but here goes. Deligne's proof of the last of the Weil conjectures is well-known and just part of a huge body of work that has lead to prizes, medals etc (wink wink). The other conjectures were proved by Dwork and Grothendieck. According to Wikipedia, Deligne gave a second proof, and then mentions three more proofs. However, it is unclear from what I read as to which of the conjectures they all prove - namely all of them, or just the Riemann hypothesis. 

Hurwitz's theorem is stated here (section 2.6 of 'A taste of Jordan algebras' by Kevin McCrimmon) as: 

The Lie group $Sp(2) = \{A\in GL(2,\mathbb{H})\mid A^\dagger A = I \}$ has a variety of nice geometric aspects. One of which is that it is the boundary of the disk bundle $D(V)$ of the rank-1 quaternionic vector bundle $V\to S^7$ associated to $Sp(1) \to Sp(2) \to S^7$. Here $Sp(1) \to Sp(2)$ is the inclusion of the top left entry, $q\mapsto \left(\array{q & 0\\0&1} \right)$. If one looks at the fibre of this disk bundle over the image of $I$ in $S^7$, then it turns out to be the unit ball in $\mathbb{H}$, which has boundary $Sp(1)$. It thus has the nice extrinsic definition as $D(V)_{[I]}=\{q\in \mathbb{H} \mid \bar q q \leq 1 \}$. What I'm wondering is if there is such a nice description of all of $D(V)$ as a submanifold-with-boundry of $End(\mathbb{H}^2)$. One can then consider the framing on $Sp(2)$ arising from this embedding, analogous to how one can consider the framing on spheres arising from their standard embeddings. Is this known explicitly? 

In a recent talk Serre made some comments about proofs that rely on the classification of finite simple groups (CFSG) and on the ATLAS of Finite Groups. Namely, he said that a proof that relied on the CFSG and said so was ok, but a proof that relied on the ATLAS was not so ok, because the content has not been completely independently verified, and has as its basis old computer and other calculations that have only been done once. Given the (numerous?) little errors have been found over time, it would be good to have a definitive record as to which bits have either been calculated or proved elsewhere, or formally verified in the case of the computer calculations, and if so where and by whom (with code for the latter case). Note that merely being able to do some calculations in GAP is not quite enough, since, as the documentation says 

Might I recommend Sheaves in Geometry and Logic by MacLane and Moerdijk. To quote bits from the blurb: 

I need this for a counterexample: the multiplication in the fundamental group $\pi_1(\Sigma X_+)$, when it is equipped with the topology inherited from $\Omega \Sigma X_+$, fails to be continuous for the sort of space in the question, by a result from 

Sheaves work in any structural set theory, because they work using any base topos. Note that SEAR-sets form a well-pointed boolean topos $\mathbf{Set}_{SEAR}$ (this Theorem and this Theorem on the nLab page on SEAR), and SEARC-sets form a well-pointed boolean topos $\mathbf{Set}_{SEARC}$ satisfying the axiom of choice in the form "all surjections have a section". By Axiom 4 both these variants have natural number objects, denoted $\mathbb{N}$. The poset $P$ used to add an $A$-indexed collection of Cohen reals is just the set of partial functions $\mathbb{N}\times A \rightharpoonup 1 \amalg 1 =: 2$ (which is in fact definable in any topos with NNO) together with the usual partial ordering. Note that once one has a well-pointed topos with NNO then any "structural" construction one might undertake in ZFC that doesn't rely on Replacement can be done. By this I mean anything not referring to elements of elements of sets and so on, or in other words, things invariant under bijections. One can define the topos of sheaves on $P$ considered as a site with the double negation topology (which is a special case of the dense topology on a small category) in a way that only uses the topos-theoretic machinery that $\mathbf{Set}_{SEAR(C)}$ being a topos affords. In fact the construction in this section, illustrating the method of forcing as applied to showing CH is not provable from the axioms for a well-pointed boolean topos, works verbatim in SEAR with some minor syntactic sugar for the topos structure (one could unwind it back to the language of SEAR if desired). Alternatively, the notion of Lawvere-Tierney topology makes no references to coverages and sieves, and one can define the double negation topology (which you need for forcing in classical logic) using an LT topology. This means one can consider the category of presheaves on $P$, which is nice to consider as a construction using internal diagrams, and then carve out the subtopos of double negation sheaves. A good reference is either Tierney's classic paper Sheaf theory and the continuum hypothesis, or if you can get access to it, Mac Lane and Moerdijk's book Sheaves in Geometry and Logic, the chapter on forcing there is pretty good. Regarding forcing a random real, one can define the poset of Borel subsets of positive measure in $\mathbb{R}$, because one can define all the relevant machinery in a well-pointed boolean topos with NNO and Choice, and then consider the topos of sheaves with the double-negation topology as before. The point about forcing in ZFC is that it is secretly taking sheaves on a poset and then translating back to ZFC in the internal logic of the sheaf topos using the standard Mitchell-Cole-Osius construction.
