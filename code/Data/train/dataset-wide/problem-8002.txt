There is a theorem in finite group theory, that if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers all greater than $1$, there exists a finite group $G$ with elements $x$ and $y$ such that: $x$ has order $a$, $y$ has order $b$, and $xy$ has order $c$. I think the first person to prove this was G.A. Miller, whose proof looked at lots of separate cases, and had tons of long, tedious calculations in symmetric groups (I will try and find the paper and post the reference later). I don't know who discovered the more modern proofs, but Derek Holt posted a proof on the group-pub that is one of the most elegant things I've ever seen. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be available on the archive of the list, so I will just post it here verbatim: 

If the group $C_2$ acts on $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ by sending $x$ to $-x$ and $y$ to $-y$, then the fixed subalgebra is the domain $\mathbb{C}[x^2,y^2,xy]$. This is Noetherian and normal. A theorem of Nakajima gives the isomorphism type of the divisor class group (in this case, $C_2$.) A theorem of Kang asserts for such examples (polynomial rings over $\mathbb{C}$, fixed subalgebra of finite group action), the Picard group is always trivial, so one can find many examples. The reference for all of this is Benson's Polynomial Invariants of Finite Groups. Kang's theorem is Theorem 3.6.1; Nakajima's theorem is Theorem 3.9.2 (and Corollary 3.9.3). Steve 

I think Hulek's book is a nice introduction that does the commutative algebra as needed. I think it is a little more demanding than some of the other suggestions though. 

One can also sometimes use Fox calculus, which describes the abelianization of a finite-index normal subgroup of $G$. If this abelianization is infinite, your group is infinite. Johnson's "Presentations of Groups", chapter 12, describes this in detail. Also see this thread for some examples of other techniques: group-pub Steve 

It's actually easy to put a bound on $Aut(P)$ for some finite $p$-group $P$, simply using Burnside's basis theorem, which says every basis for the elementary abelian group $P/\Phi(P)$ corresponds to a minimal generating set for the group $P$. Clearly, any element of $Aut(P)$ must take one minimal generating set to another. So how many minimal generating sets are there? Well, if $|\Phi(P)| = p^d$, and $|P/\Phi(P)|=p^e$, then a minimal generating set consists of $e$ elements. There are $$ \prod_{k=0}^{e-1} (p^e-p^k) $$ different bases of $P/\Phi(P)$ (as a vector space of dimension $e$). Each such element really represents a coset of $\Phi(P)$, which contains $p^d$ elements; that is, for such a given basis, each basis vector has $p^d$ choices up in $P$; all told, then, there are $$ p^{de} \prod_{k=0}^{e-1} (p^e-p^k) $$ minimal generating sets. Of course, $Aut(P)$ acts on these freely (as it is defined by what it does to a generating set), so its order divides that number. 

I am currently a graduate student, who will (hopefully!) graduate in the next year (or two..). I have slowly come to realize that I enjoy teaching, and consequently want to do more of it! My main reasons are such: 

I am sure they do, but when Googling, I invariably come up with graduate summer schools, or "local" opportunities. (By "local" here, I mean those which are only eligible to students in that particular school's graduate program.) So I am hoping someone (or several people) here know more about it than Google does. I know that most opportunities for this summer have probably already expired, but I want to stress I am not only focused on summer sessions. In particular, I would gladly forego my usual TA appointment for a semester, to be a part of a more difficult and rewarding experience somewhere else. Finally, I am on the fence about whether this question should be CW or not; as of now, it isn't. If people feel it should be, I will change it. Thanks in advance. 

That last point is particularly important to me, because I feel I have received insufficient training in how to teach mathematics well. Now, I have done the usual TA thing. For the past year, I have also been an adjunct instructor at a local four-year college, so I pretty much know what it's like to be "fully responsible" for a course. What I am looking for are challenging opportunities which allow me to do some - or all - of the following: 

It is impossible. As I mentioned in the comment to Richard Stanley's answer, you are looking for a finite group $G$ with a maximal subgroup $M$ such that $M$ intersects every conjugacy class. Then $G=\cup M^g$ is the union of $M$ and its conjugates, which is well-known to never happen. Steve 

If $G$ is the free group on two generators, then $N$ the commutator subgroup is not finitely generated. If $H$ is any finitely generated, but not finitely presented group, then $H$ is the quotient of a finitely generated free group $G$, with kernel $N$ which is not normally finitely generated. Steve 

Yes, this is true. Suppose that $\Omega_1(K)=K$, and let $t\in K$ be such that $t^2=1$, but $t\notin Z(K)$. Then $M=\langle t,Z(K)\rangle$ is an elementary abelian subgroup. But $K=\cup_{h\in H}\ M^h$, because $H$ acts transitively on $K/\Phi(K)$, and thus every element of $K$ has order $2$, which is absurd. Note that the above shows more; namely, in your case $\Omega_1(K)=Z(K)$. It is key that you have this group $H$ of automorphisms. For example, there is a group $L$ of order $64$ such that $Z(L)=\Phi(L)=L'$ is elementary abelian of order $8$, and $\Omega_1(L)=L$. There are lots of things one can say about $\Omega_1(G)$ for p-groups $G$. It actually doesn't seem that rare that $G=\Omega_1(G)$, though I believe it is slightly more restrictive in the $p=2$ case. Such a group is called one-stepped, after Ito, and in the 2-group case this means there is a collection of involutions $t_1,\ldots,t_n$ - with $|G|=2^n$ - such that $\langle t_1,\ldots,t_i\rangle$ has order $2^i$. A very good reference for all of this is the two-volume Groups of Prime Power Order by Berkovich and Janko. 

$D_8\times D_8$ is such a group (it has 35 involutions) that fails to be either elementary abelian or generalized dihedral. There is an actual classification of groups with at least half the elements being involutions; it was first done by Miller. A modern reference would be the paper by Wall, "On Groups Consisting Mostly of Involutions". A simpler treatment, though with a different goal in mind, is given in Liebeck and MacHale's paper "Groups with Automorphisms Inverting Most Elements". 

$\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ and Thompson's group $F$ have the same finite quotients, because $F'$ is the minimal normal subgroup of $F$. 

Many techniques discussed here: group-pub EDIT: Some of the ideas, in the above thread, I like the most: If $q$ is a prime congruent to $1$ mod $p$, then consider the Frobenius group $H\rtimes K$ with $H$ cyclic of order $q$ and $K$ cyclic of order $p$. Then if $a$ generates $H$ and $b$ generates $K$, you can show $b$ and $ab$ are such that $b$, $ab$ and $ab^2$ have order $p$, so this group is a quotient of your group. Choosing $q$ arbitrarily large suffices to show your group is infinite. You can also show that the two infinite permutations on $\mathbb{Z}$ $a=...(-p+1,-p+2,...,-1,0)(1,2,...,p)(p+1,...,2p)... $ $b=...(-p+2,-p+3,...,0,1)(2,...,p+1)(p+2,...,2p+1)...$ are such that $a$, $b$, and $ab$ have order $p$, and yet generate an infinite group (it acts transitively on $\mathbb{Z}$). Fox calculus can be used to show $\lt\lt xy^{-1}\gt\gt$ has infinite abelianization. 

Let $r$ be the number of conjugacy classes in $G$. The action of $G$ on itself by conjugation gives, via the Cauchy-Frobenius formula, $r=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum |C(g)|$, where $g$ ranges over $G$. This action restricted to $H$ gives the number of $G$-conjugacy classes in $H$ as $\frac{1}{|G|}\sum |C_H(g)|$, and from the fact $|C_H(g)|\ge \frac{1}{k}|C(g)|$ the first part of your problem follows. EDIT: As pointed out by Sergei Ivanov below, this argument also shows the second part is true as well. 

I was wondering if, via the geometrization conjecture, this basic outline now works for any compact 3-manifold $M$. I guess my question is really two (related) questions: 

I think this works, and is based on the interpretation of Tom Goodwillie above. Let $G = \langle a,b,c\ |\ [a,b]=[a,c]=b^{11}=1,b^c=b^4\rangle$. Now let $H=\langle a^{-1}c^{-1}\rangle$, $G_1=\langle b,c\rangle$ and $G_2=\langle b,ac^2\rangle$. Then $G=HG_1=HG_2$, but $G_1$ is not isomorphic to $G_2$. 

Reduce to the case $M$ is closed and irreducible; Use the JSJ decomposition to split $M$ along tori, getting pieces which are either 

Take $G$ to be the nonabelian group of exponent $3$ and order $27$. Then the inner automorphisms are self-centralizing in $Aut(G)$, so $K(G)$ is just $Z(G)$, a group of order $3$. Thus $Aut_c(K(G))=Aut(K(G))\neq 1$. 

The answer to your first question is no. Take the group $$ \langle a,b,c\ |\ [a,b]=[a,c]=b^{11}=1,b^c=b^4\rangle.$$ Consider the subgroups $G=\langle b,c\rangle$, $H=\langle b,ac^2\rangle$, $K_1=\langle a\rangle$, and $K_2=\langle a^2c^5\rangle$. One can check that the group is both the direct product $G\times K_1$, and $H\times K_2$. Both $K_1$ and $K_2$ are infinite cyclic. Now $G\cong\langle u,v\ |\ u^{11}=1, u^v=u^4\rangle$, and $H\cong\langle x,y\ |\ x^{11}=1, x^y=x^5\rangle$. These groups are not isomorphic, but both have finite-index centers, and so both are FC groups. 

Your group is such that $|G|=p^n$ and $|\Phi(G)|=p$. Since $(C_p)^{n-1}$ is completely reducible, there is a subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that $G=HZ(G)$ and $H\cap Z(G)=\Phi(G)$. Thus $H$ is an extra-special group (possibly trivial), and we are taking the central product with the abelian group $Z(G)$, which is either of the form $(C_p)^m$ or $(C_{p^2})\times(C_p)^m$. The first case is easy, since again, it is completely reducible, so we get a group of the form (extra-special) times (some copies of $C_p$). The second case also gives (some group) times (some copies of $C_p$). I believe the (some group) is uniquely determined by its order (that is the central product of either of the two non-abelian groups of order $p^3$ and $C_{p^2}$ are isomorphic), but I haven't checked any cases but $p=2$.

Let $S(x)=\prod_{j=1}^k \text{sin}(jx)$ and $C(x)=\prod_{j=1}^k \text{cos}(jx)$. Let x = $\frac{\pi}{2k+1}$. Then $S(2x) = S(x)$ (from $\text{sin}(\pi-x)=\text{sin}(x)$), and $S(2x)=2^kS(x)C(x)$ (from $\text{sin}(2x)=2\text{sin}(x)\text{cos}(x)$), from which the result follows. Steve 

Philip Hall published his paper with Higman, as well as his "Theorems like Sylow's", after he was 50. These are arguably his two biggest papers (and the Hall-Higman paper is arguably one of the most important papers in group theory). Steve 

Realize $\pi_1(M)$ as the fundamental group of a graph of groups, where the vertex groups come from the Seifert fibered spaces and hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the edge groups come from the tori we split along. Show all these vertex groups are essentially linear, and the $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ edge groups correspond to maximal unipotent subgroups. Conclude, using the main theorem of the paper, that $\pi_1(M)$ is residually finite. 

If you did in fact mean the free abelian group, you can still do it (up to punctures). All references in brackets are to Hempel. If $\pi_1(M)\cong \mathbb{Z}$, then $M$ is one of $S^2\times S^1$, $S^2\tilde{\times} S^1$, the solid torus, or the solid Klein bottle. [5.3] If $\pi_1(M)\cong \mathbb{Z}^2$, then $M$ is an I-bundle over the torus. [10.6] If $\pi_1(M)\cong \mathbb{Z}^3$, then $M$ is the 3-torus. [11.11] The case $k>3$ doesn't happen. [9.13] 

Suppose I have the group presentation $G=\langle x,y\ |\ x^3=y^5=(yx)^2\rangle$. Now, $G$ is isomorphic to $SL(2,5)$ (see my proof here). This means the relation $x^6=1$ should hold in $G$. I was wondering if anyone knows how to derive that simply from the group presentation (not using central extensions, etc.). Even nicer would be an example of how software (GAP, Magma, Magnus, etc.) could automate that. 

OK, here is the derivation, based completely on the amazing information provided by Victor Miller (who I should also thank for letting me know about kbmag). First, some identities: (1) From $x^3=xyxy$ we get: (a) $x^2=yxy$; (b) $xyx^{-1}=y^{-1}x$; (c) $x^{-1}yx=xy^{-1}$. (2) From $y^5=xyxy$ we get: (a) $y^4=xyx$; (b) $x^{-1}y^3=yxy^{-1}$; (c) $y^3x^{-1}=y^{-1}xy$. (3) From (1a) and (3b) we get $(yxy)(yxy^{-1})=(x^2)(x^{-1}y^3) = xy^3$; so $xy^2xy^{-1}=y^{-1}xy^3$. (4) From (2b) and (1b) we get $(yxy^{-1})(xyx^{-1}) = (x^{-1}y^3)(y^{-1}x) = x^{-1}y^2x$, so that $yxy^{-1}xy=x^{-1}y^2x^2$. (5) From (2c) we get $y^2x^{-1}y^{-1}=y^{-2}x$; squaring that yields $y(yx^{-1}yx^{-1})y^{-1}=y^{-2}xy^{-2}x$. (1c), inverse, squared, shows this is the same as $yx^{-1}y^{-2}xy^{-1}=y^{-2}xy^{-2}x$. (6) Similar to (5). From (2c) we get $y^2x^{-1}=y^{-2}xy$; squaring that yields $y^2x^{-1}y^2x^{-1}=y^{-1}(y^{-1}xy^{-1}x)y$. (1b) squared shows this is the same as $y^2x^{-1}y^2x^{-1}=y^{-1}xy^2x^{-1}y$. OK, now consider the word $(y^{-1}xy^3)xy^{-1}xy$. From (3) this is $xy^2x(y^{-1}xy^{-1}x)y$, which from (1b) squared is $xy^2x(xy^2x^{-1})y=xy^2x^2y^2x^{-1}y$. This word can also be written as $y^{-1}xy^2(yxy^{-1}xy)$, which from (4) is $y^{-1}xy^2(x^{-1}y^2x^2)$. So the previous two computations show $y^2x^2y^2xy^{-1}=x^{-1}(y^{-1}xy^2x^{-1}y)yx^2$ $=x^{-1}y^2x^{-1}y^2(x^{-1}yx)x$ ...... from (6) $=x^{-1}y^2(x^{-1}y^2x)y^{-1}x$ ....... from (1c) $=(x^{-1}y^2x)y^{-1}xy^{-2}x$ ......... from (1c) squared $=xy^{-1}x(y^{-2}xy^{-2}x)$ ........... from (1c) squared $=xy^{-1}(xyx^{-1})y^{-2}xy^{-1}$ ..... from (5) $=x(y^{-2}xy^{-2}x)y^{-1}$ .............from (1b) $=(xyx^{-1})y^{-2}xy^{-2}$ ............ from (5) $=y^{-1}xy^{-2}xy^{-2}$ ............... from (1b). So $y^2x^2y^2x^{-1}y=y^{-1}xy^{-2}xy^{-2}$, or $y^2x^2y^2=y^{-1}xy^{-2}xy^{-3}x$. But $y^{-1}xy^{-2}x(y^{-3}x)=y^{-1}xy^{-2}(xyx^{-1})y^{-1}=y^{-1}x(y^{-3}x)y^{-1}=y^{-1}(xyx^{-1})y^{-2}=y^{-2}xy^{-2}$ (through repeated application of (2b) inverse, and (1b)). Thus $y^2x^2y^2=y^{-2}xy^{-2}$, or $y^4x^2y^4=x$, and from (2a) we get $xyx^4yx=x$, or $1=yx^4yx=(yxy)x^4=x^6$ (the second follows from $x^3$ being central and the third from (1a)). Done! 

No such $M$ exists for $k=2$. It is also known (via Mostow rigidity) that for such an $M^k$ to exist for $k>3$, we cannot have the fiber $N^{k-1}$ hyperbolizable as well. But I don't know anything further than that. 

(3) and (4) - Tarski Monsters. EDIT - Benjamin Steinberg pointed out this works for (1) and (2) as well. 

The fact you are using above is really that all $S_n$, except for $n=2,6$, are complete groups. This means they are centerless, and all automorphisms are inner. Clearly, all complete groups $G$ are isomorphic to $Aut(G)$. But the infinite dihedral group $D_\infty$ is centerless, yet not complete. We still have $D_\infty\cong Aut(D_\infty)$. The dihedral group of order 8 $D_8$ is not centerless, and yet still $D_8\cong Aut(D_8)$. I doubt very much there is a complete classification available. Steve 

Let $S$ be a surface (possibly with boundary, and punctures), and let $\alpha,\beta$ be two simple closed curves on $S$ which intersect once. If $a,b$ denote the isotopy classes of $\alpha,\beta$, respectively, then why is the subgroup of $\text{Mod}(S)$ generated by $T_a,T_b$ isomorphic to the braid group $B_3$? [Here, $T_a$ is the Dehn twist around $\alpha$, and $T_b$ the Dehn twist around $\beta$.] I understand why the relation $T_aT_bT_a=T_bT_aT_b$ holds, but why is this the only relation? If it makes any difference, I am reading the "Primer on Mapping Class Groups" by Farb and Margalit (available here); they claim this is true, but give no proof. The relevant section in that PDF is 3.5, specifically pages 91--94 (in the PDF). Thanks for any help, Steve 

If $N^2$ is a closed, orientable surface of genus at least $2$, and if $\phi$ is an (orientation-preserving) pseudo-Anosov mapping on $N$, then one can form the closed orientable 3-manifold $M^3$ by gluing the boundary components of $N^2\times [0,1]$ via $\phi$. In other words, $M^3$ is fibered over $S^1$, with fiber $N^2$. $M^3$ can also be given a hyperbolic structure (much like $N^2$ can). So my question is: 

OK, here is an argument for $p$ odd (I have been [wrongly] assuming $p$ was a prime this whole time). First, note that the abelianization is $\mathbb{Z}$; this shows is that if $K=[G,G]$, then your group is the semidirect product $K\rtimes \mathbb{Z}$. The first half of the Reidemeister-Schreier theorem shows that $K$ is generated by $b_{i,n}$, where $b_{i,n}=y_0^ny_iy_0^{-n-1}$. The relations are all of the form $y_0^ny_iy_jy_{j+k}^{-1}y_{i+k}^{-1}y_0^{-n}$, where all the first indices are interpreted modulo $p$. If we allow $b_{0,n}=1$ for all $n$, then these relations are all rewritten as $b_{i,n}b_{j,n+1}b_{j+k,n+1}^{-1}b_{i+k,n}^{-1}$. If we think of all the generators in an array, where the columns are indexed by $i$ mod $p$, and the rows indexed by $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, then these relations allow us to "cancel" most of the generators, so that $K$ is generated by the $b_{1,n}$. But it is also easy to see that $b_{1,n}$ lies in the subgroup generated by $b_{1,n+1}$. Since $G$ is polycyclic (Mark showed this in his answer, when he showed $G$ is a quotient of the Klein bottle group), $K$ is finitely generated, and this gives us enough to conclude $K$ is cyclic. Now in writing $G=K\rtimes\mathbb{Z}$, the $\mathbb{Z}$ factor is generated by $y_0$. Quotienting out by $y_0^2$ gives the dihedral group $D_{2p}$, and thus $K$ must have order $p$, so that $G=C_p\rtimes\mathbb{Z}$.
