Your stated goal is true, and is pointed out by Kenyon immediately after Theorem 1. He expresses the frequency of motif with $k$ dimers as a $k \times k$ determinant, each entry of which is in $\mathbb{Q} + \mathbb{Q} (1/\pi)$. 

This isn't true if $n$ is odd. For example, if $n=3$, then your formula is $(a,b,c) = (\cos^2 \theta, 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta, \sin^2 \theta)$ and it always lies in the hyperplane $a+c=1$. More generally, whenever $n$ is odd, the equality $1 = (\sin^2 \theta+ \cos^2 \theta)^{(n-1)/2} = \sum \binom{(n-1)/2}{k} \sin^{2k} \theta \cos^{n-1-2k} \theta$ gives a hyperplane containing your points. When $n$ is even, this is true. We want to prove that the following list of $n+1$ functions is linearly independent: $\cos^{n-1-k} \theta \sin^k \theta$, for $0 \leq k \leq n-1$, and the constant function $1$. If $k$ is odd, then $\cos^{n-1-k} \theta \sin^k \theta$ is an odd function; if $k$ is even, then $\cos^{n-1-k} \theta \sin^k \theta$ is an even function, as is the constant function $1$. An odd function and an even function can never be proportional unless they are both zero, so it suffices to show that the odd and the even functions are linearly independent. For the odd functions, your Vandermonde determinant argument works (as do many others). For the even functions, note that $\cos^{n-1-2j} \theta \sin^{2j} \theta = \cos^{n-1-2j} \theta (1-\cos^2 \theta)^j$. This is a polynomial in odd powers of $\cos \theta$ with terms in degrees between $n-1$ and $n-1 - 2j$. Therefore, the matrix which transforms the even functions in your list into the functions $\cos^{2m+1} \theta$ is upper triangular with nonzero entries on the diagonal, and is thus invertible. For example, $$\begin{pmatrix} \cos^3 \theta \\ \cos \theta \sin^2 \theta \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \cos^3 \theta \\ \cos \theta \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} $$ 

No $3$ on a line and no $4$ on a hyperplane. For any two triples of points, the hyperplanes they span will not be orthogonal. For any triple of points, the projections of the remaining $4$ points onto the hyperplane it spans do not lie on $2$ orthogonal lines. 

Here's a quick test which might disprove your hopes very quickly: Take $n$ to be small: Try $2$ first, and $5$ is probably near the limit of a computer algebra system. Choose $x$ to be a random $n \times n$ diagonal matrix with determinant $1$, for example, $\mathrm{diag}(17, 1/17)$. Write out your relation, leaving all the elements of $y$ as variables. After clearing denominators, you have $n^2$ simultaneuous homogenous equations in $n^2$ variables. (If I haven't made any dumb errors, they have degree $3n$.) Ask your favorite computer algebra system to solve them for you. If any of the roots are not on the hypersurface $\det y=0$, then you have a counterexample! 

The right way to do the next part would be to step by step run through the isomorphism between Cech and Dolbeault cohomology. I'll skip to the end and work back instead. Write $w_i = z_i - 1.2$. The particular number $1.2$ doesn't matter, the point is that $(1.2, 1.2) \in Y \setminus X$. Let $$\eta = \frac{\overline{w_2} d \overline{w_1} - \overline{w_1} d \overline{w_2}}{(w_1 \overline{w_1} + w_2 \overline{w_2})^2}$$ If I didn't make any typos, we should have $$\eta = \bar{\partial} \frac{\overline{w_1}}{w_2(w_1 \overline{w_1} + w_2 \overline{w_2})} = - \bar{\partial} \frac{\overline{w_2}}{w_1(w_1 \overline{w_1} + w_2 \overline{w_2})}.$$ If $\eta$ was $\bar{\partial} f$ for some function $f$, then let $$g_1 = \frac{\overline{w_1}}{w_2(w_1 \overline{w_1}+ w_2 \overline{w_2})} -f \quad g_2 = - \frac{\overline{w_2}}{w_1(w_1 \overline{w_1} + w_2 \overline{w_2})} -f$$ So $\bar{\partial} g_i = \eta - \bar{\partial} f =0$, and we see that $g_i$ is holomorphic on $X \setminus \{ w_i =0 \}$. Set $h_i = w_i g_i$. Note that $h_i$ is bounded on $X$. (We are using that $(w_1, w_2) = (0, 0) \not \in X$, so $w_1 \overline{w_1} + w_2 \overline{w_2}$ is bounded below on $X$.) By Riemman extension, we see that $h_i$ extends to a holomorphic function on $X$ and, thus, extends to a holomorphic function on $Y$. Then look at $$w_2 h_1 - w_1 h_2 = w_1 w_2 \left( \frac{\overline{w_1}}{w_2(w_1 \overline{w_1}+ w_2 \overline{w_2})} + \frac{\overline{w_2}}{w_1(w_1 \overline{w_1} + w_2 \overline{w_2})} \right) = \frac{w_1 \overline{w_1} + w_2 \overline{w_2}}{w_1 \overline{w_1} + w_2 \overline{w_2}} =1$$ But the left hand side vanishes at the point $(w_1, w_2) = (0,0)$ of $Y$ and the right hand doesn't, a contradiction. So we conclude that $\eta$ is not $\bar{\partial}$-exact. 

I'll first give intuition, and then give a precise statement. For $|z|<1$, we have $\sum_{i \geq 0} z^i = 1/(1-z)$. For $|z|>1$, we have $\sum_{i<0} (-1) z^i=1/(1-z)$. Thus, the two functions $\phi(i) = \begin{cases} 1 \quad i \geq 0 \\ 0 \quad i<0 \end{cases}$ and $\psi(i) = \begin{cases} 0 \quad i \geq 0 \\ -1 \quad i<0 \end{cases}$ have the "same" Fourier transform. This question is about generalizations of this phenomenon to higher dimensions. 

Alex Fink and I prove a number of lemmas about this operation in section 6 of our paper on matroids and equivariant localization. (This paper was still being written at the time I asked this question.) 

Let me make sure I understand the question: $V$ is spanned by all functions of the form $g \mapsto f(gh)$, $W$ is spanned by the functions $g \mapsto v_i(g)$, it is clear from the given formula that $W \subseteq V$ and you are asking whether $V=W$. Also, I am assuming you are dealing with reduced algebraic groups over a algebraically closed field $k$, since otherwise what you mean by an orbit is a bit confusing. So I can think of elements of $\mathcal{O}(G)$ as functions on the $k$ points of $G$. Yes. Since the $e_i$ are a basis for $\mathcal{O}_G$, in particular $e_1$, $e_2$, ..., $e_m$ are linearly independent. So we can find $h_1$, $h_2$, ..., $h_m$ in $G(k)$ so that the matrix $\left( e_i(h_j) \right)$ is invertible. Inverting the equations $$f(g h_j) = \sum v_i(g) e_i(h_j)$$ we see that $g \mapsto v_i(g)$ is in the span of functions of the form $g \mapsto f(gh)$, as desired. 

The answer to question 1 appears to be "no". Pinchuk, in "A counterexample to the strong real Jacobian conjecture" found a polynomial map $g: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $\det(Dg)$ is nonvanishing, yet $g$ is not a diffemorphism. Campbell and Gwoździewicz (independently) computed the image of Pinchuk's map and found that it omitted $(0,0)$. I say apparently because their computations don't seem to agree! Campbell finds that the omitted points are $(0,0)$ and $(-1,-163/4)$; Gwoździewicz gets $(0,0)$ and $(-1,0)$. It's probably just a notational issue, but one should probably check their work carefully before relying on it. Still thinking about question 2. Given the complexity of Pinchuk's example, this seems likely to be hard. 

Now, for the Atkin-Lehner connection. The modular curve $Y_0(p)$ (the one without the cusps) parameterizes ordered pairs $(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2)$, where $\Lambda_2$ is an index $p$ sublattice of $\Lambda_1$, and where $(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2)$ is identified with $(\alpha \Lambda_1, \alpha \Lambda_2)$ for any nonzero complex number $\alpha$. The Atkin-Lehner involution sends $(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2)$ to $(\Lambda_2, p \Lambda_1)$. So a fixed point of Atkin-Lehner must correspond to a pair $(\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2)$ such that $(\Lambda_2, p \Lambda_1) = (\alpha \Lambda_1, \alpha \Lambda_2)$ for some $\alpha$. In particular, $$p \Lambda_1 = \alpha (\alpha \Lambda_1) = \alpha^2 \Lambda_1.$$ Set $\gamma = \alpha^2/p$. Then both $\gamma$ and $\gamma^{-1}$ take $\Lambda_1$ to itself, so both $\mathbb{Z}[\gamma]$ and $\mathbb{Z}[\gamma^{-1}]$ are discrete lattices. Looking at the case by case analysis above, one works out that $\gamma$ is one of $1$, $-1$, $\pm i$, $\pm e^{2 \pi i/6}$ and $\pm e^{4 \pi i/6}$. Now, $\alpha = \sqrt{p \gamma}$ and we have $\alpha \Lambda_1 = \Lambda_2 \subset \Lambda_1$. So $\sqrt{p \gamma}$ must also generate a discrete sublattice of $\mathbb{C}$. Looking at the previous list of cases, the only one that survives is $\gamma = -1$ and $\alpha = \sqrt{-p}$. So the fixed points of Atkin-Lehner come from lattices $\Lambda_1$ such that $\sqrt{-p} \Lambda_1 \subset \Lambda_1$; for each such lattice $\Lambda_1$ we get the fixed point $(\Lambda_1, \sqrt{-p} \Lambda_1)$. Using the previous discussion, the number of such $\Lambda_1$'s is essentially the class number of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-p})$. 

To spell out potentially dense's comment, the Hodge theorem tells you that $$\begin{array}{rcl} H^0(X, \mathbb{C}) &\cong& H^0(X, \mathcal{O}) \\ H^1(X, \mathbb{C}) &\cong& H^1(X, \mathcal{O}) \oplus H^0(X, \Omega^1) \\ H^2(X, \mathbb{C}) &\cong& H^1(X, \Omega^1) \\ \end{array}$$ where the left hand sides are topological cohomology and the right hand sides are sheaf cohomology. Serre duality tells us that $H^1(X, \mathcal{O}) \cong H^0(X, \Omega^1)^{\vee}$ and $H^0(X, \mathcal{O}) \cong H^1(X, \Omega^1)^{\vee}$. So $$\dim H^0(X, \mathbb{C}) - \dim H^1(X, \mathbb{C}) + \dim H^2(X, \mathbb{C}) = 2 \left( \dim H^0(X, \mathcal{O}) - \dim H^1(X, \mathcal{O}) \right)$$ as desired. 

A truly uniform distribution, no. (Well, your question is not completely well posed, but I will argue this for most ways of making it so.) There are $(kn)!$ factorial ways to shuffle a deck of $kn$ cards. So you want each permutation to occur with probability $1/(kn)!$. In particular, for every prime $p \leq kn$, you want $p$ to occur in the denominator of the probability that each permutation occurs. Let's look at your operations: Reordering $i$ decks can only introduce primes $\leq i$. Perfectly shuffling an $n$ card deck can only introduce primes $\leq n$. Cutting depends on what mathematical model you use for cutting; if all cut points are equally likely, you only get primes dividing $n(n-1)\ldots (n-i+1)$. I imagine other models of cutting will cause similar problems. The more commonly studied question is how to get a probability distribution that is extremely close to random. There are lots of good results on this; see Trailing the Dovetail Shuffle to its Lair. 

The plane version is false as stated. Choose two skew lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and place $\geq 3$ points on each of them. Any three of these points will either all lie on the same $\ell_i$ (and thus be collinear) or two of them will lie on the same $\ell_i$, so the plane they span contains that $\ell_i$ and thus contains three collinear points. A true version is that there is a plane containing precisely $k$ of the points for which $k-1$ of them are collinear. This is due to Motzkin (Trans. AMS, 1951), with a higher dimensional generalization by Hansen (Math. Scand. 1965). I took the above counterexample from Hansen's paper. I think the curve version should be false, but I haven't broken it yet. I have now discovered two papers: Wiseman and Wilson, (Disc. and Comp. Geom 1988) and Czapliński et. al., (Rendiconti del Seminario Matematico della Università di Padova 2016) which pose the curve version as an open question, so it probably isn't easy to resolve. 

The inner product which Ben describes (2-the adjacency matrix) also shows up in the classification of simple Lie groups/algebras. It is the matrix of inner products between the simple roots. For any n vectors v_1, ..., v_n in R^n, the matrix < v_i, v_j > is positive semi-definite. 

Whew! Now comes the actual hard part. Let $$E:=\{ (z,w) \in (\mathbb{C}^*)^2 : \ 4+z+z^{-1}+w+w^{-1} =0 \}.$$ This is an elliptic curve with four punctures. As Bjorn points out, this is a nodal cubic and can be parameterized as $$(z,w) = \left( \frac{1-u}{u(1+u)}, \frac{u(u-1)}{1+u} \right).$$ We'll come back to this point later. The $2$-form $dw dz/(4+z+z^{-1}+w+w^{-1})$ has a simple pole on $E$. Let $\omega$ be the $1$-form on $E$ which is the residue of that $2$-form. I think there should be a curve $\gamma$ in $E$ such that $S$ is homotopic, in $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2 \setminus E$, to a tubular neighborhood of $\gamma$. So $$\int_S \frac{w^k z^{\ell} (z-z^{-1}) dw dz} {4+w+w^{-1}+z+z^{-1}} = \int_{\gamma} \omega w^k z^{\ell} (z - z^{-1}) .$$ If we substitute in the above parameterization, this will be the integral around a closed loop of some rational function in $\mathbb{Q}(u)$. In particular, we can compute this integral by residues and we will get something of the form $a+b \pi$, as desired. Actually, it looks to me like we should just get $b \pi$. Maybe the integration by parts doesn't go as well as I hoped? 

This answer is just to record that Will Sawin's example works: The Borel subgroup of $PGL_2$ is not a complete intersection in $PGL_2$. Recall that the coordinate ring of $GL_2$ is $k[w,x,y,z,\Delta^{-1}]$ where $\Delta=wz-xy$. We are thinking of $w$, $x$, $y$, $z$ as entries of the matrix $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} w & x \\ y & z \end{smallmatrix} \right)$. The coordinate ring of $PGL_2$ is the subring of homogenous elements, where $w$, $x$, $y$ and $z$ are graded in degree $1$ and hence $\Delta^{-1}$ has degree $-2$. The Borel is given by the equations $wy/\Delta=xy/\Delta=y^2/\Delta=yz/\Delta=0$. Conceptually, the defining equation is $y=0$, but the element $y$ isn't in the coordinate ring of $PGL_2$. Since the Borel is a hypersurface, if it were a complete intersection, it would be defined by the vanishing of a single equation, say $g(w,x,y,z)/\Delta^k$, where $g$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $2k$. We may also assume that $\Delta$ does not divide $g$. Since $g$ has even degree, it must either vanish to even order along $y=0$, or else vanish along some other hypersurface besides $y=0$. Either way, $g/\Delta^k$ does not define the ideal of the Borel.
