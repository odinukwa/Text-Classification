The set of all smooth maps $S^1\to M^n$ ($M$ is a smooth manifold) is a generalized manifold(see $URL$ I was wondering if the set of singular loops (maps with selfcrossings or zeros of derivative) is a (Fréchet,Frolicher,diffeological)submanifold of loop space? EDIT: it is clear that answer is no (see answer below). So, I rewrite question: is it true that set of singular loops is a collection of submanifolds different codimension(set of loops with one selfintersection has codimension $dim M-2$, loops with zero of derivative has codimension $dim M -3$ and so on. Set of loops with infinite number of singularities should have infinite codimension... Let's forget about them.) So, the question is about local situation: for example, let's consider a loop with one self-intersection (and without other singlarities). Is it true that set of near loops with one self-intersection is a submanifold in sense of (Fréchet|Frolicher|diffeological)? EDIT 2. I reformulate question. $map(S^1 \to \mathbb R^3)$ is a functional space, so we can apply a technique of singularity theory. Generic map $f$ with one self-intersection has one-parameter versal deformation $V:[0,1]\times S^1\to \mathbb R^3$ - and any deformation are induced from $V$. Does it imply that $D$(set of singular loops) near the $f$ is a submanifold of codimension 1 in sense of Fréchet or Frolicher? ADDED. Andrew Stacey explains in his answer and in $URL$ why a stratum of a loop space is not a submanifold (the reason is tha same as in a standart smooth injection of line to plane where image is not a submanifold). But locally, as Ryan said, each stratum is a submanifold (in sense of Frechet). And the kast question is: For a smooth submanifold $X⊂Y$ of codimension 2, for a general point $x∈X$ we always have a map from small neghbourhood $U$ of $x$ to $D^2$ ($x∈U⊂Y,f:U→D^2$) such that $U\cap X= f^{−1}(0)$. I belive that in situation of space of loops there is no such map... Is it true? 

$f$ is continuous; $f$ is of bounded variation; the Luzin N property holds: if $E$ has Lebesgue measure $0$, then so does $f(E)$. 

An easy calculus exercise gives the blue area as $\frac{a^p}p$ and the green area as $\frac{b^q}q$, hence their sum dominates the area $ab$ of the rectangle outlined in red. I learned this proof from Cohn's measure theory book, where it appears as an exercise (in Section 3.3). 

$x_{n+1} = a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}$. Then you move to $(i+1,j+1)$, and the edge connecting the two vertices is labeled with this common value $a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}$. $x_{n+1} = a_{i+1} < b_{j+1}$. Then the last $i+1$ symbols of $x_1\cdots x_{n+1}$ are the first $i+1$ symbols of $a$, but $x_1\cdots x_{n+1}$ doesn't end with any initial segment of $b$, so you move to $(i+1,0)$. Thus you get an edge from $(i,j)\to(i+1,0)$ labeled with $a_{i+1}$. $x_{n+1} = b_{j+1} > a_{i+1}$. As in the previous case, you get an edge $(i,j)\to (0,j+1)$ labeled with $b_{j+1}$. $a_{i+1} < x_{n+1} < b_{j+1}$. Then $x_1\cdots x_{n+1}$ doesn't end with any initial segment of either $a$ or $b$, so you're back to $(0,0)$. Thus you get an edge from $(i,j) \to (0,0)$ labeled with $x_{n+1}$. 

I think there are several different ways to make intuitive sense of this, so I'll have a bit of a go at each of them, and hope you find it helpful. First explanation: At the global level for similarity maps. Let $M$ be a manifold, and consider a conformal map $f\colon M\to M$. (By conformal we mean that $Df_x$ is a scalar multiple of an isometry.) The simplest case to consider is the one where $\|Df_x\|$ is constant everywhere, say $\|Df_x\| = e^\lambda$ for some $\lambda > 0$; for example, let's consider the case where $M$ is the $n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $f(x)=e^\lambda x$. In this case, $\lambda$ is the Lyapunov exponent of every point in $M$, and you can easily check that if $B(x,n,\delta)$ is the Bowen ball of radius $\delta$ and order $n$, then $B(x,n,\delta) = B(x,\delta e^{-\lambda n})$. The metric balls $B(x,\delta e^{-\lambda n})$ are used in the definition of Hausdorff dimension, while the Bowen balls $B(x,n,\delta)$ are used in the definition of entropy. If instead of the classical definition of entropy one uses Bowen's definition as a Caratheodory dimension characteristic (see Pesin's book, for example), then the definition of entropy is a verbatim transcription of the definition of Hausdorff dimension, with Bowen balls replacing metric balls. In particular, it is pretty straightforward to see that $$ \text{Hausdorff dimension} = \frac{\text{topological entropy}}{\text{Lyapunov exponent}}. \qquad \qquad \text{(1)} $$ At some level, everything else is just a fancy generalisation of (1). Indeed, in the case mentioned, the potential $\log \|Df_x\|$ is equal to $\lambda$ everywhere, and so the pressure function is given by $$ P_\Lambda (-t\log \|Df_x) = h_\mathrm{top}(\Lambda, f) - t \lambda $$ using basic properties of pressure. The unique root of this equation is $t=h_\mathrm{top}(\Lambda, f) / \lambda$, which by (1) is exactly the Hausdorff dimension. Second explanation: At the local level for arbitrary maps. Now consider an arbitrary conformal map, so $\|Df_x\|$ may vary from point to point. One way of computing both Hausdorff dimension and topological entropy/pressure is by using (invariant) measures, so let $\mu$ be an invariant measure. Then if you know something about the pointwise dimensions and local entropies of $\mu$, you can use that knowledge to calculate (or at least estimate) global dimensional quantities like Hausdorff dimension, entropy, and pressure. But at the local level, subject to some bounded distortion estimates, it's not too difficult to show that $$ d_\mu(x) = \frac{h_\mu(x)}{\lambda(x)}; $$ that is, that $$ \text{pointwise dimension} = \frac{\text{local entropy}}{\text{Lyapunov exponent}}, $$ a nice counterpart to (1) in this more general setting. Third explanation: As a generalisation of Moran's equation. If you build a Cantor set on the interval (or indeed, in $\mathbb{R}^n$) by using $k$ basic sets at every stage of the construction, each of which is scaled down by a factor of $\lambda_k$ from the basic set at the previous stage that contains it, then Moran's theorem says that the Hausdorff dimension of the resulting Cantor set is the unique value of $t$ such that $$ \lambda_1^t + \cdots + \lambda_k^t = 1. \qquad \qquad \text{(2)} $$ If you take the log of both sides, you get a special case of Bowen's equation. Probably the easiest case to see this in is when $k=2$ and $\lambda=1/3$; then the unique solution of (2) is $t=\log 2/\log 3$, as expected. So one can think of Bowen's equation as the natural generalisation of Moran's equation to the setting where the ratio coefficients can vary at each stage of the construction of a Cantor set. References: We included a discussion and proof of Moran's Theorem in chapter 2 of Lectures on Fractal Geometry and Dynamical Systems, by Yakov Pesin and Vaughn Climenhaga, and the relationship (1) and its siblings appear in various places in the first four chapters of that book. And if it's not too gauche to continue to refer to my own work, I'll point out that "Bowen's equation in the non-uniform setting", which is here on the arXiv, contains some more precise and detailed formulations of a bunch of the things I said above. 

Yes, your formula is right. For the intuitive understanding just compute it for 1- and 2- dimensional half-spaces. See Bott & Tu, Differential forms in Algebraic topology, $\S 5$, Poincaré duality. I give only sketch of proof for your question. 

Consider an convex plane figure $F$. How to prove that there is an affine transformation $a$ such that $\sqrt{3}$ diameter$(a(F))^2\leq 4$ area$(a(F))$? I found only one reference, to "Über einige Affininvarianten konvexer Bereiche", but unfortunately it is in German. Added: formula (12) there looks like desirable. After I found a solution myself, I can understand German. The proof there in the pages 734 (corresponding to considering $D'$ below) and 735 (considering $D''$). The author estimated $f/d_u^2$, $f$ is an area (Flacheninhalt) and $d_u$ is a diameter(Durchmesser). So, emergency over, thank you)) the proof is rewritten by me in $URL$ 

For a $\mathbb C P^2$ is known a result: if through the generic points $p_1,p_2,\dots p_n$ with multiplicities $m_1,m_2\dots, m_n$ correspondingly a degree $d$ curve passes then $d^2\geq m_1^2+m_2^2+\dots+m_n^2-min (m_i)$. (see Lemma 1 in "Curves in $\mathbb P^2$ and symplectic packings" Geng Xu) The idea of the proof is the following: move slightly a point $p_i$ and apply Bezout theorem. Can we do the same in $\mathbb CP^3$ ? For a generic set of points $p_1,p_2,\dots p_n$ with prescribed multiplicities $m_1,m_2\dots m_n$ we are looking for a minimal degree $d$ hypersurface through them. Suppose it is $d$. Then slightly move $p_i$ in different directions and find two surfaces of degree $d$ through new collections of points. Then apply Bezout theorem of these three hypersurfaces and get $d^3\geq m_1^3+m_2^3\dots +m^2_n- min(m_i)^2$. The only problem is that these surfaces may intesect by a curve and we can not apply Bezout Theorem. Can we repair this? 

Not a complete answer, but for $n=4$ if you start with an arithmetic progression ($1,2,3,4$ works) then you have probability $1$ of ending up with them all being identical. Consider the following set of states for the quadruple $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ once it has been ordered so that $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq x_3 \leq x_4$: State $A_0$: All the $x_i$ are equal. State $A_1$: $\vec x$ is of the form $(a-d,a-d,a+d,a+d)$ for some $a,d$. State $A_2$: $\vec x$ is of the form $(a-d, a, a, a+d)$ for some $a,d$. State $A_3$: the four numbers are distinct and form an arithmetic progression, so $\vec x = (a - 3d, a-d, a+d, a+2d)$ where $a$ is the average value. Given $\vec x$ in one of the four states, choose a permutation from $S_4$ at random and apply the procedure described in the question. There are really only $3$ equivalence classes of permutations, since you only need to know which of the three numbers $x_2,x_3,x_4$ does not get added to $x_1$, and then everything else is determined. It's not hard to show that if you are in state $A_j$, then with probability $1/3$ you remain in state $A_j$, while with probability $2/3$ you move to state $A_{j-1}$. (Of course if you're in state $A_0$ then you stay there no matter what.) This means that almost surely you eventually end up in $A_0$, where all four numbers are equal. I'm not sure what happens if you try this for $n\geq 5$. 

This solution is not true, sorry. I can prove that $area(M)\geq 3d^2/8$. First of all find $v\in \mathbb Z^2$ such that $w_v(M)$ is minimal. Than by an affine transform $a$ put $v$ into vector $(1,1)$. Now draw lines which give us widths of $a(M)$ in the directions $(1,0),(0,1)$. Now $a(M)$ is inside a horizontal stripe of width at least $d$, inside a vertical stripe of width at least $d$ and inside a diagonal (in the direction $(1,-1)$) stripe of width exactly $d/{\sqrt{2}}$. Here I use usual widths. Now look at the picture - we see a 6-gon (or 3,4-gon) $B$ as the intersection of the strips, we know that on each side of $B$ there is a vertex of $a(M)$. By playing with vertices one can find all the extremal cases (so, vertices of $a(M)$ must coincide with vertices of $B$). Finally, in all the extremal cases the area of $a(M)$ is no less than $3d^2/8$ 

Added: another function like that is $S_p f(z) = f(z)+\frac{f(\sqrt{zp})^2}{f(p)}$ in a field of characteristic two. We discovered the following operator which acts on the space of polynomials (or series) of the type $\sum a_{ij}x^iy^j$ where $a_{ij}$ belong to a field $k$ of characteristic two. For a point $p\in (k^*)^2$ and $f$ as above, we define $$S_p f(z) = f(z) + \sqrt{f(z^2/p)f(p)}.$$ Here we multiply and divide points coordinatewise, i.e. $z^2=(z_1,z_2)^2=(z_1^2,z_2^2)$. Note that $\mathrm{char}(k) = 2$ facilitates taking the square root, so $S_p f$ is again a polynomial (series). The properties are as follows: $S_pS_pf=S_pf$ and $(S_pf)(p)=0$. We can take several points $p_1,p_2,\dots\in (k^*)^2$ and look on the dynamic generated by $S_{p_i}$. The question is as follows: have you seen something like that? Could you advise anything on studying of this dynamic? In a sense $S_p$ changes the curve $f(z_1,z_2)=0$ to a curve $(S_pf)(z_1,z_2)=0$ which passes through $p$. So the limit of applications of $S_{p_i}$ will be a curve which passes through all $p_i$. Motivation: this operator appeared as a detropicalization of a certain operator in sandpiles. See $URL$ for details about the problem. The idea is that in the limit, sandpile pictures become tropical curves. And adding a grain to a point corresponds in the limit to the following operator $G_p$ -- we take the face of the tropical curve where $p$ belongs and contract this face until this new tropical curve passes through $p$. Trying to interpret $G_p$ algebraically we ended up with the above operator $S_p$. We can not reproduce the same behavior for other characteristics of the field. 

A little further searching turned up a simple proof of Lebesgue's decomposition theorem in "The Lebesgue Decomposition Theorem for Measures", J. K. Brooks, The American Mathematical Monthly, 78 (1971), pp. 660-662. Without much extra work, it admits the following generalisation. Theorem. Let $\mathcal{N} \subset \Omega$ be a collection of subsets such that 

The local entropy of a point $x\in X$ is $h_\mu(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty} -\frac 1n \log \mu([x_1\dots x_n])$, where $[x_1 \dots x_n] = \{ y\in X \mid y_i = x_i \\,\forall 1\leq i\leq n\}$, provided the limit exists. Denote by $Z_\mu$ the set of points $x$ for which $h_\mu(x)$ exists and is equal to the measure-theoretic entropy $h_\mu(\sigma)$. Fact #2. If $\mu$ is ergodic, then Shannon-McMillan-Breiman implies that $\mu(Z_\mu)=1$. 

Let $X = \Sigma_p^+ = \{1,\dots,p\}^\mathbb{N}$ and let $f=\sigma\colon X\to X$ be the shift map. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the space of Borel $f$-invariant probability measures on $X$ endowed with the weak* topology. Now $\mathcal{M}$ is a Choquet simplex, and hence connected. The geometry of its extreme points is a little more subtle. These extreme points are precisely the ergodic measures. Let $\mathcal{M}^e$ denote the collection of ergodic measures in $\mathcal{M}$. Note that $\mathcal{M}^e$ has some nice properties; for instance, there is a natural embedding from the space of Hölder continuous functions into $\mathcal{M}^e$ that takes $\phi$ to its unique equilibrium state $\mu_\phi$. The image of the embedding is the collection of Gibbs measures (for Hölder potentials). Of course, there are many ergodic measures that do not arise as equilibrium states of Hölder continuous functions, and so I wonder which nice properties of the collection of Gibbs measures extend to $\mathcal{M}^e$. In particular: Is $\mathcal{M}^e$ connected? Path connected? I expect that it is, and that moreover this should happen whenever $X$ is a compact metric space and $f\colon X\to X$ is a continuous map satisfying the specification property, but I don't know a reference and don't yet see how to approach a proof. 

Let us consider polynomial contact structures on $\mathbb RP^3$, i.e. contact structures on $\mathbb R^3$ defined by a form $w=Pdx+Qdy+Rdz,\ P,Q,R\in \mathbb R[x,y,z]\ $ in an affine part and then extended to $\mathbb RP^3$, and $ w \wedge dw \ne 0$ everywhere. One can find all such forms $w$ that $deg P, deg Q, deg R \leq 1$ by direct calculation: $w=(qy-rz+a)dx+ (pz-qx+b)dy + (rx-py+c)dz,\ a,b,c,p,q,r\in \mathbb R;$ $ap+br+cq \ne 0$. But I can't do anything for greater degrees. Do you know any criteria for coefficients of $P,Q,R$? Does anybody know any contact polynomial form with $deg P, deg Q, deg R \geq 2$? Added: What is the form (I mean form coefficients in $\mathbb R^3\subset \mathbb RP^3$) defining the polynomial contact structure constructed by plurisubharmonic function $f=x^4+y^4+z^4+t^4$? Answer: $f=x^4+y^4+z^4+t^4$ is not strictly plurisubharmonic (see on the plane $x=y=0$ on subspace generated by $dx,dy$). So it does not produce a contact structure. 

First of all you need pairing between $H_c^k(M, \partial M)$ and $H^{n-k}(M)$. Just consider $M= [0,+\infty)$, find $H_c^k(M), H_c^k(M,\partial M), H^k(M), H^k(M,\partial M) $ and check that you have non-generating pairing. By induction, expand previous statement to $\mathbb R_{+}^n = \{(x_1,x_2\dots,x_n)|x_1\geqslant 0\}$ (read Bott & Tu $\S 4$ and do the same things). Prove that there is Mayer-Vietoris sequence for $H_c^k(M,\partial M)$ similar to Mayer-Vietoris sequence for $H_c^k(M)$. Prove duality the same way as in $\S 5$ (check the commutativity of diagram and apply 5-lemma).
