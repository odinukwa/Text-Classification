Composing two random "exact-in-the-middle" functors should give a counterexample. E.g. let's consider the functor from $\mathbb Z$-modules to itself given by $$ M \mapsto Hom(\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z, M/p^2 M),$$ for some fixed prime $p$. Applying this to the short exact sequence $$0 \to \mathbb Z/p^2 \mathbb Z\to \mathbb Z/p^3\mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z/p \mathbb Z \to 0$$ (the first non-trivial arrow being mult. by $p$ and the second being the natural projection) gives the sequence $$ \mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z,$$ with all the arrows being 0 (assuming I haven't miscalculated). 

Let me focus on the case when $K$ is non-archimedean; the archimedean case is somewhat easier. There is a coarse classification, valid for any reductive group, into supercuspidals, and all the others --- the others are ones that can be parabolically induced from supercuspidals of proper Levi's, and so in principle are understood by induction, while the supercuspidals are the basic building blocks. There is a subtley that certain parablic inductions of irreducibles are not themselves irreducible, which leads to so-called special representations (EDIT: and in the general, ie. non-$GL_n$ case, so-called packets), but at least in the $GL_n$ case these are well-understood too. (EDIT: In particular the packets are actually just singletons). So everything comes down to the supercuspidals. (This is explained in the introduction to Harris and Taylor's book, among many other places.) This coarse classification is also compatible in a natural way with the local Langlands correspondence. For $GL_n(K)$ the supercuspidals are completely classified. (This is the difference between $GL_n$ and most other groups.) In fact there are two forms of the classification. (1) Via the local Langlands correspondence (a theorem of Harris and Taylor). (2) Via the theory of types (a theorem of Bushnell and Kutzko). The first classification relates them to local $n$-dimensional Galois reps. The second relates more directly to the internal group theoretic structure of the representations. As far as I know, the two classifications are not reconciled in general (say for large $n$, where large might be $n > 3,$ or something of that magnitude), and this is an ongoing topic of investigation by experts in the area. (Any updates/corrections to this statement would be welcome!) The difference in the archimedean case is that there are no supercuspidals, so everything comes down to inducing characters of tori, and understanding the reducibility of these parabolic inductions. 

It seems worth mentioning another application of the functional equations. To fix ideas, I will suppose that $E$ is an elliptic curve over ${\mathbb Q}$, and let $L(E,s)$ be the $L$-function of $E$. There is then a functional equation relating $L(E,s)$ and $L(E,2-s)$; one feature of this functional equation is that it has a sign, i.e. has the form $L(E,s-2) = \pm (\text{ a positive constant })L(E,s),$ where $\pm$ is some fixed sign, depending on $E$, and easily computed (say using the modular form corresponding to $E$). Thus one find that the order of vanishing of $L(E,s)$ at $s = 1$ is odd (even) precisely if the sign is $-1$ ($+1$). Since the order of vanishing is conjectured to coincide with the rank of $E({\mathbb Q})$ (the BSD conjecture), this is pretty important arithmetic information which is obtained pretty easily from the functional equation. In particular, if the sign is $-1$, we always expect there to be a rational point of infinite order, and arranging things so that the sign is $-1$ (by twisting by a well-chosen character, say) is a common way of forcing the existence of rational points in various situations. (There is a large body of research focused around this expected relationship between signs of functional equations and the existence of rational points on elliptic curves; for example, it lies at the heart of the study of Heegner points by Gross and Zagier and Kolyvagin. Some important recent contributions are by Nekovar, Mazur and Rubin, and T. and V. Dokchitser.) 

The following greedy algorithm should reconstruct the tree corresponding to a given distance matrix $M$, assuming it exists. Beforehand, one must show that $T$, if it exists, is unique, but unless you insist I will skip these details (informally, you can use induction on $n$: from a tree $T$ for $M$, remove a leaf $l$, use induction to get the unique tree for $M$ with the $l$ row/column removed, then show that there is only one unique place to plug back $l$). 

Say we have a labeled, binary unrooted tree $T$, i.e. each node has either 1 or 3 neighbors. Denote by $L(T)$ the set of leaves (degree-one nodes) of $T$. For some $L \subseteq L(T)$, denote by $t(L)$ the smallest subtree of $T$ containing $L$. That is, $t(L)$ is the minimal (in terms of nodes) connected induced subgraph of $T$ that contains $L$. A $k$-partition $P = \{L_1, \ldots, L_k\}$ of $L(T)$ is called valid if for any distinct $L_i, L_j \in P$, $t(L_i)$ and $t(L_j)$ are vertex-disjoint. The question is : how many valid $k$-partitions of $L(T)$ does $T$ have ? Denote by $p(T)$ the number of such partitions. I'd like to know if this problem is known/has been addressed previously. I'd be happy with lower and upper bounds on $p(T)$. I'd also like to know if the structure of $T$ is relevant, or is $p(T)$ only dependent on $|L(T)|$ ? NOTE : this originates from this thing called the Perfect Phylogeny Problem, which has been studied for some time - but no one seems to have bothered with counting $p(T)$. 

In other words, pick any $k - c$ vertices. Then there's some smallest dominating set that contains them. This doesn't hold for $c = 0$, but it makes intuitive sense that it does for $c = 1$. However, I'm not even close to showing this is true for some constant, neither that there there is a $c$ for which the statement holds for every $k$, but for at least one smallest tournament with domination number $k$. 

For some tournament $T$, let $\gamma(T)$ denote the cardinality of a smallest dominating set of $T$. Denote by $f(k)$ the minimum number of vertices of a tournament $T$ having $\gamma(T) = k$. From what I've been able to find, not much is known about $f$. We know $f(2) = 3, f(3) = 7$ and $f(4) = 19$. Past that we're lost. Results from Erdos and Szekeres-Szekeres showed that $$(k + 1) 2^{k - 2} - 1 \leq f(k) \leq (k - 1)^2 2^{k -1} C$$ (for suitable constant $C$) some 50 years ago, and I haven't any refinement of those bounds (except that $f(5) > 47$, showing the lower bound is not exact). I'm interested in the structural properties of a tournament $T$ of order $f(k)$ having $\gamma(T) = k$, but I can't find much except this paper : Domination and irredundance in tournaments and its references. Any references that describe $T$ would be helpful. In particular, I'm interested in the existence/non-existence of a constant $c$ that satisfies this statement for any $k$ (and for a large enough tournament) : 

If we take $X$ and $Y$ in the abelian category $C$, and regard them as objects of the derived category of cochain compelexes (by placing them in degree 0), then $Hom_{D(C)}(X,Y[n]) = Ext^n(X,Y)$, where the left-hand side is Hom in the derived category from $X$ to a shift of $Y$, and the right-hand side is a Yoneda Ext group. For this reason, when $A$ and $B$ are any two objects in the derived category, one write $Ext^n(A,B) = Hom(A,B[n]).$ Assuming that what I've written here is a faithful interpretation of your notation, then I can summarize things by saying that the answer to your question is yes. 

The answer is "for lots of reasons". Let me explain a couple: 1. As several people have already noted in answers and comments, sometimes profinite groups arise naturally. For example, if $k$ is a field and $k^s$ is its separable closure, it is natural to consider the group of automorphisms of $k^s$ over $k$. One then equips this group with a topology (the weak topology, when $k^s$ is equipped with its discrete topology --- i.e. two elmenents are close it their action coincides on a large finite set of elements of $k^s$), and then discovers that this makes the automorphism group into a profinite group. Now one can bring the pro-structure to the fore by regarding $k^s$ not just as a field extension of $k$, but as an ind-finite extension of $k$, by writing it as the inductive limit of its finite subextensions. But, while this is technically useful in some contexts (for example, in the proof the automorphism group is profinite), it is not always convenient --- there are often advantages to having $k^s$ available as a naked field, without having to bother with its ind-structure. 2. The concept of topology is incredibly, amazingly flexible, much more so than the concept of pro-object. There are lots of illustrations of this, but one very convincing one is the theory of the adeles. Here one takes the topological product of a profinite ring with copies of $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb C$. One obtains a locally compact ring, equips it with a Haar measure, and proceeds to do harmonic analysis. Trying to carry all this out in the language of pro-systems (say, of pro-Lie groups) would be incredibly convoluted. Indeed, in the early days of class field theory, before the introduction of the adelic view-point, this is essentially what people did: they worked explicitly with the pro-systems underlying the adeles (without using that language, of course). The introduction of ideles and adeles swept away the inherent (conceptual and notational) complexities of that view-point, and so was (and is) rightly regarded as a major advance.
