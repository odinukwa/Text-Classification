$G$ is supramenable iff for all $\varnothing\ne A\subseteq G$ there is a finitely-additive $\mu:2^G\to[0,\infty]$ with $\mu(A)=1$. Given Choice, this is true iff $G$ has no non-empty $G$-paradoxical subsets. $G$ is exponentially bounded iff for all finite $F\subseteq G$ containing identity and closed under taking inverses we have $\lim |F^n|^{1/n} = 1$, where $F^n$ is the set of products of $n$ elements of $F$. (Rosenblatt 1974 proved that exponentially bounded groups are supramenable.) The type semigroup, due to Tarski, is defined on pages 164-5 of this piece by Laczkovich. 

Question: For $n\ge 3$, is there a maximal isometrically-invariant finitely additive extension of Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R^3$? A maximal extension of a measure with some properties (in this case, isometric invariance and finite additivity) is one that cannot be extended to a larger algebra of subsets while preserving these properties. Ciesielski and Pelc (see here) proved that there is no maximal isometrically-invariant countably additive extension of Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R^n$. On the other hand, Banach showed that for $n\le 2$, there is a finitely additive extension of Lebesgue measure to all subsets of $\mathbb R^n$, and of course it follows from Banach-Tarski that this is false for $n\ge 3$. I am assuming Choice throughout, of course. [Edit: As Bill Johnson points out in the comments, this is just a quick application of Zorn. I guess that since this is very much nontrivial in the countably additive case, it didn't occur to me that maybe the finitely additive case is really easy!] 

$P(-|B)$ is a finitely-additive probability function for each $B\in F-\{\varnothing\}$ $P(A|B)P(B|C)=P(A|C)$ if $A\subseteq B\subseteq C$. 

What do we know about the circumstances (whether having to do with the axioms of set theory or the model itself) under which a field $F$ of hyperreals (=ultrapower of $\mathbb R$ with respect to a non-principal ultrafilter on an infinite set) has this property: For every $x \in F \backslash \mathbb R$ there is a field homomorphism (=monomorphism) of $F$ to itself that fixes $\mathbb R$ and moves $x$? (It looks to me that saturation is a sufficient condition, even if we replace "homomorphism" with "isomorphism".) 

$G$ is neatly supramenable There is a hyperreal-valued finitely-additive measure $\mu$ on $2^G$ that vanishes only on the empty set and is approximately left-$G$-invariant: $\operatorname{st}(\mu(gA)/\mu(A)) = 1$ There is a hyperreal-valued exactly left-$G$-invariant function $\mu$ on $2^G$ that vanishes on and only on the empty set and is approximately finitely-additive: $\operatorname{st}(\mu(A\cup B)/(\mu(A)+\mu(B)))=1$ if one of the sets is non-empty There is a finitely-additive conditional probability $P:2^G\times (2^G-\{\varnothing\})$ that is strongly left-$G$-invariant: i.e., $P(gA|B)=P(A|B)$ whenever $A,gA\subseteq B$. There is a finitely-additive conditional probability $P:2^X\times (2^X-\{\varnothing\})$ that is strongly left-$G$-invariant on every space $X$ on which $G$ acts. 

Let $G = \mathbb Z_2^\omega$, with pointwise addition. Assume the Axiom of Choice. I am interested in finitely additive probability measures $\mu$ defined on all of $\mathcal PG$ that can be intuitively thought to represent an infinite sequence of independent fair coin tosses. One condition I want is $G$-invariance: $\mu(A)=\mu(\alpha+A)$ for $\alpha\in G$ and $A\subseteq G$. Since $G$ is abelian, there is an invariant measure on $\mathcal PG$. Question: Is there a finitely additive invariant $\mu$ also subject to the independence condition that $\mu(A\cap B)=\mu(A)\mu(B)$ whenever $A$ and $B$ "depend on different coordinates". (If we let $\pi_J : G\to \mathbb Z_2^J$ be the projection for $J\subseteq \omega$ given by $\pi_J(\alpha)=\alpha|_J$, then $A$ and $B$ depend on different coordinates iff we can write $A=\pi_J^{-1}[A']$ and $B=\pi_K^{-1}[B']$ for some disjoint $J$ and $K$.) Comment: I was asked if there are $G$-invariant $\mu$ that don't satisfy independence. Yes. Start by noting that there is no $G$-invariant $\mu$ that is also invariant under the permutations of $\omega$ (acting by composition--I will write this action on the right). In fact, for any $G$-invariant $\mu$ on $G$ and infinite $A\subseteq \omega$ there will be a permutation $\tau$ fixing $\omega-A$ and a subset $C$ of $G$ depending only on the coordinates in $A$ such that $\mu(C)\ne\mu(C\tau)$. Now, fix any $G$-invariant $\mu$, and let $A$ and $B$ be infinite disjoint subsets of $\omega$. It's easy to now show that there is a $G$-invariant $\nu$ (formed by combining $\mu$ with two permutations) and subsets $C$ and $D$ of $G$ depending on the coordinates in $A$ and $B$ respectively such that $\nu(C)\ne \mu(C)$ and $\nu(D) \ne \mu(D)$. Suppose $\mu$ and $\nu$ satisfy the independence condition. Replacing $C$ and/or $D$ with its complement as needed, assume $\nu(C)>\mu(C)$ and $\nu(D)>\mu(D)$. Let $\rho=(1/2)(\mu+\nu)$. Then $\rho$ is $G$-invariant but $\rho(C\cap D) > \rho(C)\rho(D)$, so $\rho$ does not satisfy the independence condition. 

A quick note that (2) doesn't follow from ZF (assuming ZF is consistent) or even ZF+DC. (2)+Countable Choice for Finite Sets (CC(fin)) implies that every uncountable set has a non-principal (finitely additive, non-trivial) measure. Let $\Omega$ be uncountable. Let $\mu$ be as in (2). Let $A = \{ x : \mu(\{ x \}) > 0 \}$. The standard proof that a finite measure has only countable many atoms only uses CC(fin) (there are at most $n$ elements $x$ such that $\mu(\{ x \}) \in [1/n, 1/(n-1))$). So $A$ is countable. So $\mu(A)<1$. Then $\nu(B) = \mu(B-A)$ defines a non-principal measure and is non-trivial since $\nu(\Omega)=1-\mu(A)>0$. But Blass gave a model of ZF+DC with no non-principal measures ("A model without ultrafilters", Bull. Acad. Polon. Sci. 25 (1977), 329â€“331; I haven't read the paper, but Pincus and Solovay say that it proves this). Since DC implies CC(fin), (2) is false in that model. A different way to see that (2) doesn't follow from ZF is this. Take a model where there is an infinite Dedekind-finite set but CC(fin) still holds (the Consequences of AC website lists a bunch of models where Form 10 is true and Form 9 is false). Now if $\Omega$ is an infinite Dedekind-finite set and $\mu$ satisfies (2), then every point of $\Omega$ will have to be an atom of $\mu$ (or else $\mu(\Omega - \{ x \}) = \mu(\Omega)$). But by CC(fin), the set of atoms is countable, which is impossible for a Dedekind-finite set. I'm curious if (2) implies CC(fin). 

The answer seems to be negative. Here's a quick and rough sketch. Say that $C:2^\Omega \times (2^\Omega \backslash \{\varnothing\})\to [0,\infty]$ is a comparative probability on $\Omega$ iff $C(-,Y)$ is a finitely additive measure with $C(Y,Y)=1$, and $C(X,Y)C(Y,Z)=C(X,Z)$ whenever the product on the lhs is defined (i.e., isn't zero times infinity). Comparative probabilities and Popper functions making all non-empty subsets normal are interdefinable: given such a Popper function $P$, let $C(X,Y)=P(X,X\cup Y)/P(Y,X\cup Y)$ (where $x/0=\infty$ if $x>0$). Analogous invariance conditions hold for comparative probabilities and Popper functions. So I'll just show that there is no weakly invariant comparative probability on a large square $\Omega$ (and hence on any square), where weak invariance is the condition $C(\rho A,\rho B)=C(A,B)$ assuming all four sets fit in $\Omega$, and strong invariance is the condition $C(\rho A,B)=C(A,\rho B)=C(A,B)$, where $\rho$ is an isometry. Fact: We can bootstrap from the weaker invariance condition $C(\rho A,\rho B)=C(A,B)$ to the stronger invariance condition $C(\rho A,B)=C(A,\rho B)=C(A,B)$ for $A,B\subseteq [-1,1]^2$, as long as $\Omega=[-L,L]^2$ for a sufficiently large $L$, size dependent on $\rho$. Once we have this bootstrapping, we simply let $E$ be Just's bounded paradoxical subset of the unit disc and choose $L$ sufficiently large to guarantee that the stronger invariance condition holds for all the isometries $\rho$ used in Just's paradoxical decomposition. So we just need to prove the bootstrapping fact. Throughout, I will assume that $L$ is sufficiently large to make the arguments go through, i.e., to make all the transformations fit inside $[-L,L]^2$. All we need to prove is that $C(A,\rho B)=C(A,B)$ for any isometry $\rho$ (assuming $L$ is big enough relative to facts about $\rho$), since we then have $C(\rho A,B)=C(\rho A,\rho B)=C(A,B)$. First, we prove $C(A,\rho B)=C(A,B)$ for $\rho$ a reflection. We have $C(A,\rho A)=C(\rho A,\rho\rho A)=C(\rho A,A)$ by the weaker invariance condition. Moreover, $1=C(A,A)=C(A,\rho A)C(\rho A,A)$ if the rhs is defined, which it is since both factors are equal. Thus $C(A,\rho A)=C(\rho A,A)=1$. Thus, $C(B,A)=C(B,A)C(A,\rho A)=C(B,\rho A)$ for any $B$. (For this argument to work, $L$ must be large enough that $B\cup \rho B$ fit in $[-L,L]$.) Now suppose $\rho$ is a rotation about some point $z$. Let $\sigma$ be a reflection about a line that goes through $z$. Observe that $\sigma\rho = \rho^{-1}\sigma$. And we've already proved our strong invariance for $\sigma$. Then $C(A,\rho A)=C(A,\sigma\rho A)=C(A,\rho^{-1}\sigma A)=C(\rho A,\rho\rho^{-1}\sigma A)=C(\rho A,\sigma A)=C(\rho A,A)$. But $1=C(A,A)=C(A,\rho A)C(\rho A,A)$. Thus, $C(A,\rho A)=C(\rho A,A)=1$. Thus, $C(B,A)=C(B,\rho A)C(\rho A,A)=C(B,\rho A)$. (For this argument to work, $L$ must be large enough that $A\cup \rho A\cup \sigma\rho A\cup \sigma A$ fit in $[-L,L]$.) But all isometries can be written in terms of rotations and reflections. 

Regarding measurability: Depending on the audience, it may help to say that standard limit theorems (LLN, CLT, etc.) require measurability (here's something very simple I wrote recently on what you can say in the way of LLN without measurability--basically nothing, except for what you get by applying the standard W/S LLN to the measurable minorant/majorants). Most of the practical applications of probability theory depend in some way on limit theorems: e.g., statistics and CLT, stochastic algorithm convergence, Bayesian convergence, etc. Regarding finite additivity: On the bright side, if one replaces countable with finite additivity one gets to keep some limit theorems (at least those that give explicit bounds on convergence of distributions: just approximate r.v.'s on a finitely additive space with simple ones, and apply the standard theorems to the simple ones). On the dark side, replacing countable additivity with finite additivity will not make all sets measurable in dimensions $n\ge 3$, due to Banach-Tarski issues. In situations where there are rotational symmetries, one will still have to have non-measurable sets, assuming AC. 

(3 and 4 are analogues of open problems for supramenable groups. But they might be easier for neatly supramenable ones.) Here's what I have so far (a lot of this uses AC via ultrafilters): A. Exponentially bounded groups are neatly supramenable. B. The following are equivalent: 

Parikh and Parnes showed that one can define a isometry-invariant finitely-additive conditional probability for all pairs of subsets of the interval. Can one extend this result to bounded subsets of $\mathbb R^2$? Of course, due to the non-amenability of SO($n$), $n>2$, one can't do it in $\mathbb R^n$ for $n>2$. One way to put the question more precisely is to ask whether there is a Popper function $P$ on $[0,1]^2$ such that (a) every non-empty set is normal and (b) we have the following weak invariance condition: $P(A|B)=P(\rho A|\rho B)$ for every isometry $\rho$ such that $A,B,\rho A,\rho B$ are all subsets of $[0,1]^2$. I've tried to leverage Winfried Just's construction of a bounded paradoxical subset of $\mathbb R^2$ to provide a counterexample, but with only the weak invariance condition, I can't do it. (A stronger invariance condition would be $P(A|B)=P(\rho A|\sigma B)$ for every pair of isometries $\rho,\sigma$ such that $A,B,\sigma B$ are subsets of $[0,1]^2$ and $A\subseteq B$ and $\rho A\subseteq \sigma B$. With that invariance condition, the bounded paradoxical subset of $\mathbb R^2$ shows we can't have such a $P$.) I don't think the Parikh and Parnes construction using a Lebesgue sample generalizes to $\mathbb R^2$. That construction will, I think, fail when the isometry group has exponential growth. 

$G$'s action on $X$ has the invariant order extension property. $X$ has a linear $G$-invariant order. No element of $G$ has an orbit of finite size greater than one.
