Who cares, without a majority of scientists agreement, it's probably just a bad study. No one can model what's happening in our atmosphere, it's just too big. 

If you're working in a high radiation environment, it's likely that there is going to be strong EM interference. While we commonly think of radioactive waste giving off Ionizing radiation, they also give off other types of radiation as well (RTG's rely on this). There may just be too much interference in the environment that these robots exist to rely on radio communication. 

I'm going to go a different direction and say don't let the people know that the 1% are going to be escaping this hell-hole of a planet. Lets start with how do we keep the thing a secret while designing it? Don't let anyone know what's it's true intention is. No one below UltraProject Director needs to be aware that the people on this vessel will not be returning to new Venus. If anyone starts to question what the thing is for, you can offer them a place on your ship; after all if they know about it, they're probably a good person to have on board. If they want to "spread the truth", then kill them. They were already doomed anyway, you're just advancing the time table. Kill their family too for good measure. Reducing living family members to zero also reduces the chances of media inquiry, and again, these people were already dead anyway... Now, about who we populate this station with. Surely the great thinkers (or at least the highest elected politicians) are reasonably assured a place, as well as few "minor" dignitaries from the third world who we don't vehemently disagree with, all for the sake of appearing diverse. Our families need to have boarding rights too. The surviving laborers who created the ark should come along to, because routine maintenance and custodial work will need to be done. The Engineers and Scientists need to come, probably several astronomers, physicians, doctors, and computer scientists. Celebrities and media personalities (including celebrity scientists, sorry but Tyson and Nye aren't coming) won't be invited, because we don't want word to spread. Finally, the venture capitalists who invested in this business will come, because they invested in it to finance the building of the thing. They may find their new positions as fry cooks and grill line workers a little bit less glamorous, but that's just how things are on the ARK, we all have a part to play, my part is deciding what functions are useful and who boards, your position is fulfilling the utility you are assigned as payment for boarding. 

Using crows would have the same plausibility of using ravens (or owls, or some other bird). AFAIK pigeons are the only ones actually used in practice because their natural instinct makes them return to their nest even after being taken afar. Other birds have similar instincts (e.g.: swallows) but neither crows nor ravens share it (AFAIK). 

As You correctly guessed the "orbit plane" is actually a surface (no thickness), so the individual atoms of the space station would, if separate, be on different orbits and drift away over (short) time; of course they are kept together by direct interaction so structural strength of your space station won't have any problem in keeping it together. This doesn't hold true for any free-floating object which, unless prevented, will try to follow his own orbit. This means objects "above" the "mean orbital surface" will drift to the ceiling, while those "below" (in Earth direction) will drift toward the floor. Let us try to compute the actual forces. On orbital plane (assumed being the Station Center of gravity) the two forces, gravity ($F_g = \frac{G M m}{r^2}$) and centrifugal ($F_c = m v^2/r$) are exactly the same "by definition" . This enables us to easily find relationship between speed and radius of a circular orbit. What we need to do is a bit different, we need to find what is the difference of force if we change "a bit" the radius leaving the speed the same. So we have: $\Delta F = F_g^\prime - F_c^\prime = \frac{GMm}{(r+\delta)^2} - mv^2/(r+\delta) = ma$ $a = \frac{GM}{(r+\delta)^2} - v^2/(r+\delta)$ If we substitute the relevant data: $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}$ $M = 5.972 \times 10^{24} kg$ $r = 35786 Km = 35786000 m$ $v = 3.07 Km/s = 3070 m/s$ and assume for $\delta$ 50 floors about $3m$ each: $\delta = 50 \times 3m = 150m$ we get: $a = \frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times 5.972 \times 10^{24}}{(35786000+150)^2} - 3070^2/(35786000+150) \approx 8 \times 10^{-7} m/s^2 $ Note: I had to "cheat" to get the result; the values I have for all constants are way too imprecise to correctly compute the result (we are speaking about $4 ppm = 4 \times 10{-6}$). What I did is to "massage" radius till the acceleration ($\delta = 0$) was null, then I added the displacement. Someone is welcome to cross-check my computations as I might have goofed somewhere. From basic Physics we have: $s = 1/2 at^2$ ... $t = \sqrt{2 s / a} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times150}{8 \times 10^{-7}}} \approx 8470s \approx 2 h 20m$ As you see the "free floating" objects will drift to floor/ceiling in a matter of hours, days at most for objects nearer to orbital plane. Note that the forces involved are quite tiny, so even the smallest friction will prevent it, so, in particular, you can expect surface tension to keep liquids plastered to whatever surface they touch and not to drift around. 

Lets assume you are travelling at an appreciable fraction of C. Chances are you have some sort of shielding so the front of your ship (and then the front of you) doesn't get abraded away by the interstellar medium. Could you figure out some sort of measurement device that uses the activity of that shield? Could you then combine that with a known density of the interstellar medium? 

So there is a conspiracy going on, attempting to prove this "Threat" is real, and that we should start paying these science types more mind. 

North Korea has been a problem child in the world-at-large for longer than most of the world has been alive. The DMZ is one of the largest permanent military operations in the world, and every act made by the nation is scrutinized thoroughly and treated with the utmost suspicion. A sort of prejudice against any action taken by N. Korea has formed in the world consciousness. Tomorrow, Kim-Jong Al* usurps Kim-Jong Un in a violent takeover because he's sick of seeing his people in a famine state, he's sick of his people being denigrated, and he's sick of constantly wondering if eagleland will get sick of his nations antics and use nuclear weapons to make South Korea an island; but most of all, he's sick of the embargo that keeps him from upgrading from iPhone 6 to the iPhone 6s. Given the current hostility towards anything North Korean, what would he have to do, and what would the world have to do, in order to bring North Korea gracefully into the world economy? At this point it seems like the mistrust would run too deep to gracefully let the nation become a world player. *A fictional "Second Prince" to Kim-Jong Un if you will 

This (somewhat) resembles political structure of Magna Grecia colonies. In this scenario it's likely the Colony should be in position to start R&D "departments" within a few generations and thus be able to "keep up" (somewhat) with motherland. Stabilization could be achieved in very few centuries. OTOH worst scenario (barring utter colonization failure) is: 

IMHO you are approaching the problem from the wrong vantage point. In order to be able to act on a planetary mass from far enough to avoid tearing it to pieces (i.e.: to have a reasonable pull also on the "far part" of the planet, otherwise you risk ripping away a piece of planet) you need a comparable mass, something between Earth and Moon mass. If you compress it to "manageable size" you risk ending up with a very high surface gravity which will just squash your tug-ship. In any case your "tug" needs to have engines powerful enough to move that mass and the mass of the planet trying to fall on it, accelerating both fast enough to prevent the planet from "catching up", i.e.: with the same acceleration the planet have, so that distance remains constant (a difficult exercise, if you ever tried to "tug" a magnet with another one). If you have engines that powerful it would probably be easier to apply them directly to the planet. There's a problem in applying such a force on a planet without destroying it. A very large floating mass (about 100km radius) could be pushed down in the Ocean for about 100m could provide reasonable push "gently" enough. Of course synchronizing push with planet rotation and gently enough to avoid disruptive tsunamis is another exercise left to the reader ;) A more viable plan could be to mount the engines unto a (large) metallic asteroid (or an asteroid fleet) and have it (them) repeatedly approach planet and be deflected by planet gravity. This schema trades a high pull (not easily obtainable without destroying the planet) for a series of smaller pulls, possibly less damaging. Before you are able to do such a thing you need to "invent" a reactionless engine along with a huge energy generator. 

many time manipulation theories I have heard of involve massive sums of energy....that being said as metals can be used to deflect and ground energies as in faraday cages your answer may be found there....say the person evolve in a way that their mitochondria evolved in such a way it was able to generate the necessary energy you could even tie this to the magickal powers....but the metals could deflect the enegries and maybe even store them and or reuse them to the wearers ends.... 

A T-rex is only slightly larger than an elephant but its bone structure is far different being bipedal as opposed to quadropedal and the elephant is known to use its trunk to help detect its surroundings enabling a much smoother ability to walk tham some other quadropeds.The angle of the legs would allow for much more force to be applied to the ground for forward motions and stopping or for smashing.given the smaller sized arms its likely this large creature would use its leggs as a primary force for attacking with much as a chicken will often use its legs to attack. As stated you are probably right in the assumption that movies greatly exagerate this but it could be rather viable that these types would be likely to make a substantial vibration. for instance if you were to go out in the country and stand next to a railroad with a train going at full speed with empty cars the vibrations would be almost perfectly comparable to the effect the dinosaur would have on the ground...speciffically because the estimated weight of a T-rex is 9 tonnes and a train car about 20 tonnes across 2axels about the size of their foot area. The vibration caused at this point is due to the many minor differences in rails allignments but is only considering mere inches of up and down impact so one could reasonably presume a similar impact would be nearly standard for casual motion of this type of creature. in a full on sprint or large jump this could be much more prominent. note that a train is possible to be heard in an unobstructed environment for as far away as 5miles...and if you are acustomed to a life of absolute silence (unlike most people today between tv and internet) you can likely even feel some minor vibrations from at least a mile away. 

I'm gonna say it wouldn't happen, at least on the computational level. While a doctor, jeweler (for making the scalpel, needle, etc), geochemist (for mining and refining the materials needed by the jeweler), microbiologist (for penicillin to fight infections) and textile factory worker (Where do you think you get the threads for stitches?) may be able to get together to make a Kidney transplant happen, computers would be way more complicated. Every CS college grad at least in some way understand Turing machines and bit-wise operations, but the entire computer science industry is standing on the shoulders of giants. If you got the right group of highly advanced specialists (Manufacturing, hyper-mathematics, programmers, system designers), it could be done, but if you just took an average sampling of people, I'd be highly incredulous if you said you got the right people to build a computer. 

Nails -- These were hard to make -- A box of 5000 would be a good bribe for certain groups, especially smiths for shoeing horses (although this may require specialty nails) Nail usage in the middle ages 

If he's even remotely close to a large city and you wanted a landmark for your story, I'd suggest going with skyglow. I live about 20 miles outside of Wichita, and am surprised occasionally just how pronounced it is. Smaller suburbs have reduced, but still visible sky glows as well. 

These machines are cool, but also very expensive. The primary benefit is of course the same benefit that humans and other legged creatures have over tanks -- They can easily maneuver over rugged terrain that treads could not be able to deal with. That being said, in a world with aircraft (Although b.Lorenz points out not all celestial bodies have an atmosphere capable of supporting aircraft), there is no real reason to go with n-pedal tanks. If you really are interested though in such a device, I suggest you look at Boston Dynamics new Hybrid robot, and compare it to some of their previous inventions like the Big Dog. By using a creature with knees, but using wheels instead of feet, the hybrid has the advantages of a bipedal locomotion, while eschewing the complexity of multi-jointed ankles. 

Instead of using batteries use a generator (something like a Fuel Cell, but enhanced) that cannot give enough power to keep the laser on continuously, but will need to recharge (possibly ramping up voltage) a condenser which will provide the energy for the shot, but will need time to recharge. A mechanism similar to old battery-capacitor flashes. 

Rosie the Riveter (and Wendi the Welder, and others) cannot be thought as a myth, 'cause they were very, very real. They were surely used in propaganda, but that is not their essence, even if what we remember today is almost exclusively the "propaganda sugar-coated" images. You should think of those women as icons for a certain kind of strong-willed women who didn't scorn filling in in "unladylike" jobs... and sometimes discovered they loved it. 

You can think about a swarm of planets/satellites locked in Lagrange points (L4 or L5, as the others are unstable) such that a small satellite projects a circular shadow always in the same (more or less) point. I am unsure if this can be really done, but it's worth a try. Using L1 would be much simpler, but that is unstable, unfortunately, and stabilizing would require "humans fiddling around". If the shadow is large enough the center is going to be quite cold and You could think about some orographic barrier to make the change even sharper. Not in such condition you would have a constant cold wind blowing from the dark zone. For maximum effect place the shadow in the middle of an equatorial desert.
