If a real analytic function $f:U\subset\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R^m$ is zero on a set $Z$ of positive measure (and $U$ is connected), then $f\equiv 0$. Indeed, almost every point of $Z$ is a density point. It is easy to see that the derivative at a density point is zero. Therefore $df=0$ a.e. on $Z$. Applying the same argument to $df$, conclude that the second derivative vanishes a.e. on $Z$ too. And so on. Thus $f$ has zero Taylor expansion at some point, hence $f\equiv 0$. 

If you are looking for a geometric classification of all affine transformations of the Euclidean plane (not to mention higher dimensions and other fields), there is probably no such thing. It is possible to classify them in some sense, but some transformations are too far away from things that have names in elementary geometry. And if you move out of elementary geometry, it is so much easier to just use linear algebra. The worst example is the following type of a linear map: $A=S^{-1}RS$ where $R$ is a rotation (take some nontrivial angle, not $\pi$ or $\pi/2$) and $S$ is a scaling in one direction: $S=diag(k,1)$. The resulting map resembles rotation, but it rotates along ellipses rather than circles. 

I've been using the representation result below, from Krasnosel'skij/Lifshits/Sobolev; Positive Linear Systems---The Method of Positive Linear Operators. Heldermann Verlag, 1989. Theorem. Let $E$ be a real Banach space partially ordered by a solid, normal and minihedral cone $E_+$. Then there exist a compact Hausdorff space $Q$ and a linear homeomorphism $\Phi: E \rightarrow C(Q)$ such that $\Phi(E_+) = C_+(Q)$. In this statement, $C(Q)$ stands for the space of continuous, real-valued functions on $Q$, while $C_+(Q)$ consists of the nonnegative ones. This is stated as Theorem 6.6 on page 64 in the book. I'm wondering if anybody knows of a better presentation of this result. It's not the first time that I've been having problems with this book, which has many mistakes. The original paper of Kakutani from 1941 doesn't seem much easier to read, and Google searches haven't yielded much on that direction. Thanks! 

I think I got it! I turned out to be mistaken about item 2 in my Progress Notes. Lemma 1. Suppose $f \colon {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}$ is locally integrable, and let $F\colon {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0} \rightarrow {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}$ be the primitive given by $$ F(t) := \int_0^t f(s)\,ds\,, \quad t \geqslant 0\,. $$ For any positive integer $m$, set $f\colon {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}^m \rightarrow {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}$ by $$ f_m(t) := \prod_{i = 1}^m f(t_j)\,, \quad t = (t_1,\ldots,t_m) \in {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}^m\,, $$ and set $$ S_m(T) := \{t \in {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0}^m\,;\ 0 \leqslant t_1 \leqslant \cdots \leqslant t_m \leqslant T\}\,, \quad T \geqslant 0\,. $$ Then $$ \int_{S_m(T)} f_m(t)\,dt = \frac{[F(T)]^m}{m!}\,, \quad \forall T \geqslant 0\,, \quad \forall m = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\,. $$ Proof. Follows by Fubini and integration by substitution. (Details/clarification upon request.) Assuming that $f(t,\cdot)$ is compactly supported uniformly in $t$ as described in item 1 of my Progress Notes, we may apply Lemma 1 to show that $(\varphi_k(\cdot,x))_{k \geqslant 0}$ is a Cauchy sequence on $[0,T]$ for each $T \geqslant 0$. Thus $$ \varphi(t,x) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \varphi_k(t,x)\,, \quad \forall (t,x) \in {\mathbb R}_{\geqslant 0} \times {\mathbb R}^n\,. $$ 

The geodesics between points are not unique in both cases. Moreover the following is true: if $M$ is a universal cover of a compact Riemannian manifold whose fundamental group is virtually solvable but not virtually abelian, then there are conjugate points on some geodesics in $M$ and hence geodesics between some points are not unique. See Croke and Schroeder "The fundamental group of compact manifolds without conjugate points", Comment. Math. Helv. 61 (1986), no. 1, 161--175, MR847526, for the case when the metric is analytic, and Lebedeva "On the fundamental group of a compact space without conjugate points", here, for the general case. 

I don't know what was meant in that exercise, but your revised conjecture is certainly true and well-known. Here is an elementary proof. The assumptions (local injectivity, continuity and segment-to-segment mapping) imply that the map is injective and preserves collinearity of points and endpoints of segments. By continuity it suffices to show that the midpoint of every segment is sent to the midpoint of its image. Consider any two points $A,B$. Let $A',B'$ be their images and $D'$ the midpoint of $[A'B']$. By continuity there is a point $D\in[AB]$ mapped to $D'$. We are to prove that $D$ is the midpoint of $[AB]$. Pick a point $C$ such that its image $C'$ is not collinear with $A'$ and $B'$ and choose points $E\in[AC]$ and $F\in[BC]$ such that $CD$, $BE$ and $AF$ have a common point $G$ in the triangle $ABC$. Note that all these points belong to the plane containing $A,B,C$. By elementary geometry (see e.g. Ceva's theorem), $D$ is the midpoint of $[AB]$ if and only if $EF$ is parallel to $AB$. Suppose it is not, then the line $EF$ intersects the line $AB$ at some point $H$. This configuration is mapped to a configuration $A',B',\dots,H'$ with the same collinearity relations. Since $E'F'$ is not parallel to $A'B'$ (they intersects at $H'$), the same application of Ceva's theorem shows that $D'$ is not the midpoint of $[A'B']$, a contradiction. 

One may assume without loss of generality that $f(t,\cdot)$ is compactly supported uniformly in $t$; that is, there exists a compact $K \subseteq {\mathbb R}^n$ such that $f(t,x) = 0$ whenever $x \notin K$. Setting $\varphi_0(t,x) := x$, then $$ \varphi_k(t,x) := x + \int_0^t f(s, \varphi_{k-1}(s,x))\,ds\,, \quad k = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\,, $$ recursively, as in the standard proof of existence, doesn't seem to work. Euler's proof of existence seems to almost work. But the construction is not "canonical" in the sense that the subsequence along which convergence occurs via Arzela-Ascoli will depend on $f$. I would like to have a sequence $(\varphi_k)_{k \in {\mathbb N}}$ which could be defined by a procedure independent of $f$. This is because I'm ultimately interested in the flow of parametrized differential equations, and I don't want to have to choose a different subsequence for each parameter. 

We know that, under these hypotheses, the ordinary differential equation $$ x' = f(t,x) $$ generates a unique global flow $$ \varphi: [0,\infty) \times {\mathbb R}^n \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^n\,. $$ Question I'm wondering whether there is a canonical way of realizing $\varphi$ as the limit of globally defined maps $$ \varphi_k: [0,\infty) \times {\mathbb R}^n \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^n\,, \quad k \in {\mathbb N}\,. $$ Progress 

EDIT: This answer is wrong: as pointed out by Alfonz, this map is not algebraic. The similar one with a rational approximation of $\sqrt2$ is, but then the degree is unbounded. Consider the following map $f$ from $\mathbb R^2$ to the torus $\mathbb T^2=\mathbb R^2/\mathbb Z^2$: $$ f(x,y) = (x, \sqrt2 x) \bmod \mathbb Z^2 . $$ Its set of critical values equals its image and it is dense in the torus, so the $\epsilon$-neighborhood has full measure for any $\epsilon>0$. 

You don't have to define your objects as sets, in fact, you should avoid such unnatural definitions. I don't think a number theorist would be happy to see a proof referring to elements of a natural number or using the identity $1=\{0\}$. Such proofs are not acceptable because they won't survive even the slightest change in the foundations. Similarly, if you develop Euclidean geometry, you don't define a point as a two-element set whose first element is a Dedekind cut and the second one is another weird set. You rather begin with axioms (either Euclidean ones or some axiomatization of the real line) and build the geometry on these. The set theory comes in if you want to show that your theory is consistent (as long as ZF is), and you do that by building a model within ZF. In your example with men, your actually create a mathematical model of whatever you want to study, in the same way as physics does. There are always translation steps from real world to mathematics and back, they just happen to be trivial in this case. So it's not a problem that men are (modelled by) sets. Only if you like to believe that mathematical objects do exist in some metaphysical sense, you will have a problem with the counter-intuitive claim that everything is a set. But you can just remove this axiom and stay agnostic about whether everything is a set or not. You will not lose anything - the only essential use of this axiom is that you are able to define the notion of equality rather than having it built into logic. And this is hardly of any importance outside the logic itself. 

Background Let $a,b,c,d$ be nonnegative constants and consider the map $T\colon [0,1]\times[0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]\times[0,1]$ defined by $$ T(x,y) := \left( \frac{1}{1 + ax + by}, \frac{1}{1 + cx + dy} \right), \quad (x,y) \in [0,1] \times [0,1]. $$ I'm interested in this map (and other similar ones) in the context of monotone dynamical systems. They come up, for instance, as the input to output characteristic of controlled dynamical systems with outputs modeling simple biochemical networks. Question By Brower Fixed Point Theorem, $T^2:= T \circ T$ has a fixed point. Now is this fixed point unique? If it is not unique, is there a counterexample? Are there reasonable hypotheses on $a,b,c,d$ which would guarantee that to be true? Of course I'm also interested in the general finite-dimensional case $$ T(x_1, \ldots, x_n) := \left( \frac{1}{1 + a_{11}x_1 + \cdots + a_{1n}x_n}, \ldots, \frac{1}{1 + a_{n1}x_1 + \cdots + a_{nn}x_n} \right), $$ as well as replacing the $1$'s in the numerator and denominator by general constants. But I'm hoping to find something conceptual in the simplest case which could then be applied in the general scenario. Progress (1) Computer simulations with randomly generated coefficients $a,b,c,d$ seem to indicate that this is true in arbitrary finite dimensions, with any nonnegative $a,b,c,d$. (2) If $a + c < 1$ and $b + d < 1$, then $T$ is a contraction (with respect to the sum-norm $|(x,y)| := |x| + |y|$. In particular, it has no period-2 points, and so $T^2$ has a unique equilibrium. But these hypotheses seem too restrictive. In fact, taking into consideration where $a,b,c,d$ come from, this is not always true. (3) This is also true if $b = c$ and $a = d = 0$. This makes me wonder whether there could be some sort of diagonalisation argument. Though I have no idea what to do with the nonlinearity. (4) I'm also attempting to approach this as a global optimization problem. More precisely, I'm looking at the map $$ (x,y) \longmapsto \|T^2(x,y) - (x,y)\|^2 $$ and tried to compute the Hessian using Maple but haven't gotten anywhere so far.
