This is one of two answers to this question. The other one addresses the finite dimensional case. This one points out that the Hilbert space case seems to involve the invariant subspace problem. Disclaimer: I am really bad at functional analysis. Suppose that $W$ is a Hilbert space of dimension $>1$ and $T: W \to W$ is an invertible operator with no invariant subspace. (If the ISP has counter-examples, it has invertible counter-examples; see the comment of Simon Henry below.) Let $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ act on $W$ by $(i,j) : w \to T^{i+j}(w)$. Then $W$ is an irreducible $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ rep, but it is not of the form $U \otimes V$ for $\mathbb{Z}$-reps $U$ and $V$. Proof: Suppose it were. Choose a nonzero vector $u \in U$. Then $u \otimes V$ would be an $H$-subrep, and hence an invariant subspace. So $u \otimes V = W$ and $\dim U=1$. Similarly, $\dim V=1$. But then $\dim W = 1$, a contradiction. Of course, this means that the statement should be false for more general things like Banach spaces, where the invariant subspace problem fails. 

$\def\ZZ{\mathbb{Z}}$ This can happen in finitely generated abelian groups. Let $p$ be prime, set $G = \ZZ/p^2 \oplus \ZZ/p$ and set $H = \ZZ/p^3 \oplus \ZZ/p^2 \oplus \ZZ/p$. Then there are two non-isomorphic short exact sequences $0 \to G \to H \to G \to 0$. The first one is the sum of the extensions: $$\begin{matrix} 0 & \to & \ZZ/p & \to & \ZZ/p^3 & \to & \ZZ/p^2 &\to& 0 \\ 0 & \to & \ZZ/p^2 & \to & \ZZ/p^2 & \to & 0 &\to& 0 \\ 0 & \to & 0 & \to & \ZZ/p & \to & \ZZ/p & \to & 0 \\ \end{matrix}$$ and the second is the sum of $$\begin{matrix} 0 & \to & \ZZ/p^2 & \to & \ZZ/p^3 & \to & \ZZ/p &\to& 0 \\ 0 & \to & 0 & \to & \ZZ/p^2 & \to & \ZZ/p^2 &\to& 0 \\ 0 & \to & \ZZ/p & \to & \ZZ/p & \to & 0 & \to & 0 \\ \end{matrix}$$ Let's see that these are not isomorphic. Write $\alpha$ for the map $G \to H$. In the first extension, $\alpha(p G) \cap p^2 H = (0)$; in the second extension, $\alpha(pG) = p^2 H$. In any reasonable category, isomorphism classes of extensions $0 \to X \to ?? \to Z \to 0$ are classified by the orbits of $\mathrm{Aut}(X) \times \mathrm{Aut}(Z)$ on $\mathrm{Ext}^1(Z,X)$. You are asking for cases where there is more than one orbit which makes the center term isomorphic as an abstract element of the category. There is no reason this shouldn't happen, so I would expect it to happen basically any time there are nontrivial extension groups available. 

I suspect that a complete list of relations for $R$ is $$\mathrm{rank} \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c & d \\ x & y & z & c-1 \end{pmatrix} \leq 1$$ and I suspect that the image of $X$ in $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ is everything except the line $\{ a=b=c=x=y=z=0 \}$. (On this line, $d$ is unconstrained.) Written this way, the $\mathbb{G}_a$ action is $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & t \\ & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c & d \\ x & y & z & c-1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & & & \\ & 1 & & \\ & & 1 & t \\ & & & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$ But I doubt I will get around to checking this. 

In my personal opinion, you do not need any set theory to learn the basics of category theory. Well, you need to know the meaning of the symbols $\in$ and $\subset$, because any mathematical paper will probably use them, but that is all. Every once in a while, your introduction will probably use the word "class", or remark that we are working within a fixed universe. For the purpose of learning the basics, I claim you can ignore these statements. Just think of "class" as a large set, and "working within a universe" as "we are allowed to do reasonable set-theoretic constructions". Certainly, it's worth eventually going back and learning what those terms mean. But I just looked at my bookshelf. The most intensely category theoretic books are FGA (together with "Fundamental Algebraic Geometry: Grothendieck's FGA Explained"), "Methods of homological algebra", "Introduction to Homological Algebra", Hatcher's "Algebraic Topology" and "A guide to Quantum Groups." I claim that you can understand any of these with only the most naive set theory. I'd be curious to know what areas of category theory can't be handled in this naive manner. 

Partial progress: It's easy to achieve $n-3$. Consider matrices of the form $$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & r_1 & r_2 & \cdots & r_{n-3} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & r_1 & \cdots & r_{n-4} & r_{n-3} \\ r_1 & 0 & & & & & \\ r_2 & r_1 & & & & & \\ \vdots & \vdots & & & {\LARGE 0}& & \\ r_{n-3} & r_{n-4} & & & & & \\ 0 & r_{n-3} & & & & & \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ where the bottom right square is entirely $0$. If this has rank $<4$, then the upper-left $4 \times 4$-submatrix implies $r_1^4=0$, so $r_1=0$. Then inductively $r_2^4=0$, and so forth. For $n=5$, this only gives a $2$ dimensional subspace, and I argued in the comments on my other answer that a generic $3$ dimensional subspace of the $5 \times 5$ matrices should work. Right now, though, I can't see how to do better for $n \geq 5$. Ah, slight improvement. For $n$ even, and taking advantage of the fact that I'm working over the reals, I can do $n-2$: $$\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & a_1 & b_1 & \cdots & a_{(n-2)/2} & b_{(n-2)/2} \\ 0 & 0 & -b_1 & a_1 & \cdots & -b_{(n-2)/2} & a_{(n-2)/2} \\ a_1 & -b_1 & & & & & \\ b_1 & a_1 & & & & & \\ \vdots & \vdots & & & {\LARGE 0}& & \\ a_{(n-2)/2} & -b_{(n-2)/2} & & & & & \\ b_{(n-2)/2} & a_{(n-2)/2} & & & & & \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ If this has rank $<4$, then $(a_i^2+b_i^2)^2=0$ for all $i$, so over the reals this can only happen when it is $0$. 

No variant is necessary, $X_{\Sigma}$ is $\mathrm{Proj}_{B(\Sigma)} (R)$. Note: I'm assuming you already understand how this construction works in the projective case, so that I can jump in and start working an example. Let's work through the example of $\mathbb{P}^2$ with a point deleted. The corresponding fan has three rays, in directions $e_1= (1,0)$, $e_2 = (0,1)$ and $e_3 = (-1, -1)$ and with two dimensional faces $\mathrm{Span}(e_1, e_3)$ and $\mathrm{Span}(e_2, e_3)$. The ring $R$ is $k[x,y,z]$, with $x$, $y$ and $z$ corresponding to $e_1$, $e_2$ and $e_3$. The grading is that $x$, $y$ and $z$ are in degree $1$. The ideal $B(\Sigma)$ is $\langle x, y \rangle$. So, the points of $k[x,y,z]$ correspond to those hemogenous primes of $k[x,y,z]$ which do not contain $\langle x,y \rangle$. Sure enough, that's $\mathbb{P}^2$ with a point removed! Note that we don't change the ring or the grading $R$, both of which are determined by the set of rays of the fan. We just change the irrelevant ideal $B(\Sigma)$. See David Cox's paper The Homogeneous Coordinate Ring of a Toric Variety for the full generalities. 

Estimates for $\Gamma(z)$: For $\Re(z)>0$, we have $|\Gamma(z)| \leq \int_0^{\infty} e^{-t} |t^z| dt/t = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-t} t^{\Re(z)} dt/t = \Gamma(\Re(z))$. By Stirling's formula, this shows that $\log |\Gamma(z)| = O(|z| \log |z|)$. Now using the recursion for the $\Gamma$ function lets us extend this estimate to all of $\mathbb{C}$ (details omitted). We also have the easy estimate $\log |\sin (\pi z)| = O(|z|)$, on a contour which stays well away from the zeroes of $\sin$: Say a circle of radius $N+1/2$. So $\Re(g) = O(|z| \log |z|)$ for $z$ on a circle of radius $N+1/2$. As $g$ is entire, the maximum modulus principle gives us the same bound everywhere in $\mathbb{C}$. Harmonic functions with slow growth rate: Let $f$ be a harmonic function on the unit disc. We have the Poisson integral formula: $$f(x+iy) = \int \frac{1-x^2-y^2}{1-2 (x \cos \phi - y \sin \phi) + x^2+y^2} f(e^{i \phi}) d \phi.$$ Differentiating inside the integral sign, there is some smooth function $K(x,y,\phi)$ such that $$\frac{\partial^{a+b} f}{(\partial x)^a (\partial y)^b}(x+iy) = \int K_{ab}(x,y,\phi) f(e^{i \phi}) d \phi.$$ Now, let $f$ be defined on a circle of radius $R$. Making the appropriate variable changes, $$\frac{\partial^{a+b} f}{(\partial x)^a (\partial y)^b}(x+iy) = \frac{1}{R^{a+b+1}} \int K_{ab}(x/R, y/R, \phi) f(R e^{i \phi}) d \phi.$$ So, if $g$ is entire and $g = o(R^k)$, then every $k$-fold derivative of $g$ is $o(1/R)$. Sending $R$ to infinity, every $k$-fold derivative of $g$ is zero, so we deduce that $g$ is a polynomial of degree $\leq k$. The Gamma function at $1/2$: We have $\Gamma(1/2) = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-t} t^{-1/2} dt = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-u^2} (2 du)$. This can be evaluated by a variety of methods.
