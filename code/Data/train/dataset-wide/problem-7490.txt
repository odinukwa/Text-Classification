As people usually do, denote the equivalence relation $\ell_\infty : = \mathbb{R}^\omega \backslash \ell_\infty$ (where of course the latter $\ell_\infty$ refers to the group). $\ell_\infty$ is universal under $\leq_\text{B}$ for $K_\sigma$ equivalence relations. (Rosendal. See Theorem 8.4.2 of Gao.) $E_1$ is $K_\sigma$. Hence $E_1 \leq_\text{B} \ell_\infty$. If the group $\ell_\infty$ is Polishable, then the equivalence relation $\ell_\infty := \mathbb{R}^\omega \backslash \ell_\infty$ is a Borel orbit equivalence relation. It is well-known that $E_1$ is not Borel reducible to any orbit equivalence relation of a Borel group action (Kechris-Louveau; see Theorem 10.6.1 of Gao). 

In Feng, Magidor, and Woodin "Universally Baire Sets of Reals", they show that if $A$ is a $\mathbf{\Pi}_2^1$ set and $U$ and $V$ are any pair of trees witnessing the universal baireness of $A$, then in all generic extension, one continues to have $A = p[U]$, where $A$ as defined by the $\mathbf{\Pi}_2^1$. Is this true for $\mathbf{\Pi_3^1}$ (or more generally any higher projective sets)? Rather than any pair of trees as in the $\mathbf{\Pi}_2^1$ case, if one assumes all $\mathbf{\Pi}_3^1$ sets are universally baire, does there exists some pair of trees $T$ and $U$ such that $T$ continues to represent a given $\mathbf{\Pi}_3^1$ set $A$ in all generic extensions? What about, if one fix a particular forcing $\mathbb{P}$, can one find pairs of trees $T$ and $U$ that continue to represent a particular $\mathbb{\Pi}_3^1$ set in $\mathbb{P}$ extensions. 

To be a bit more precise. Suppose $\varphi$ is a $\Pi_3^1$ formula possible using some reals as parameters. With appropriate large cardinals, all $\mathbf{\Pi}_3^1$ sets are universally Baire. Hence there are trees $T$ and $U$ such that $V \models (\forall x)(\varphi(x) \Leftrightarrow x \in p[T])$ and $V \models (\forall x)(\neg \varphi(x) \Leftrightarrow x \in p[U])$ If $\mathbb{Q}$ is a forcing, then $1_\mathbb{Q} \Vdash_{\mathbb{Q}} ...$ the same two statements. The question is for any $\mathbf{\Pi}_3^1$ formula $\varphi$ can one find trees $T$ and $U$ witnessing universally Baireness with the additional property that: For all forcings $\mathbb{Q}$, $1_\mathbb{Q} \Vdash (\forall x)(\varphi(x) \Leftrightarrow x \in p[\check T])$. This is what I mean by a $\mathbf{\Pi}_3^1$ sets being represented by the same tree in all generic extensions. 

Let $\mathscr{L}$ be a recursive language. Let $\varphi$ be a $\mathscr{L}_{\omega_1 \omega}$-sentence and $\varphi \in L_{\omega_1^\emptyset}$. (Let $\varphi$ be a computably infinitary formula.) Let $\text{Mod}(\varphi)$ denote the set of countable models of $\varphi$. Is there anything inherently wrong with the existence of the following: (1) For every admissible ordinal $\alpha$, there is a $M \in \text{Mod}(\varphi)$ such that $\omega_1^M = \alpha$ and $\text{SR}(M)$ is $\alpha$ or $\alpha + 1$. (2) For all $M \in \text{Mod}(\varphi)$, there is an admissible ordinal $\alpha$ such that $\text{SR}(M)$ is $\alpha$ or $\alpha + 1$. (3) For each admissible ordinal $\alpha$, there is only one isomorphism class of Scott rank $\alpha$ or $\alpha + 1$. 

It is known that (light-face) $\Sigma_3^1$ generic absoluteness is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$: Friedman and Bagaria showed that it holds in the $\text{Coll}(\omega, < \kappa)$ extension of $V$ where $\kappa$ is a $\Sigma_2$-correct cardinal. My questions are about what large cardinal principles can prove $\Sigma_3^1$-generic absoluteness. In particular: 1) If $0^\sharp$ exists (or even $x^\sharp$ exists for all reals $x$), does (light-face) $\Sigma_3^1$-generic absoluteness holds. 2) What if there is a measurable cardinal, then does $\Sigma_3^1$-generic absoluteness hold? Is there any large cardinal whose existence implies $\Sigma_3^1$ generic-absoluteness? 

Is it consistent that there is a model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ (or $\mathsf{ZF}$) with the following properties: (1) For all $x \in {}^\omega 2$, $x^\sharp$ exists (or $\mathbf{\Sigma}_1^1$ determinacy) (2) For all sets $A$, there exists $x \in {}^\omega 2$ such that $A \in L[x]$, i.e. every set is constructible from a real. If one takes an arbitrary model $V$ of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ satisfying (1), will $L[({}^\omega2)^V]$ have this property or does it necessarily add a set that is not constructible from any single real? Thanks for any information or clarification. 

The answer is no. Su Gao $\textit{Invariant Descriptive Set Theory}$, Lemma 9.3.3 has a direct proof. 

Working in $L$, suppose $L \models \kappa$ is a cardinal and $(\mathbb{P}, <) \in L_\kappa$. Let $\varphi(x)$ be a $\Sigma_1^1$ formula. Let $\tau \in L_\kappa$ be a $\mathbb{P}$-name for an element of ${}^\omega\omega$. Is "$1_\mathbb{P} \Vdash \varphi(\tau)$" absolute between $L_\kappa$ and $L$? It seems that if $L_\kappa$ satisfies enough of set theory to prove the Mostowski Absoluteness and some basic facts about the forcing relation, then this would be true. For instance if $\kappa$ was inaccessible or even regular uncountable. For any arbitrary cardinal $\kappa$, does $L_\kappa$ satisfy enough set theory for the Mostowski absoluteness. A related question is what are the known fragments of ZF that all $L_\kappa$ (or the fine structures $J_\kappa$) where $\kappa$ is a cardinal satisfy? Thanks for any information that can be provided. 

I am trying to establish whether it is consistent that some property holds at the least weakly compact cardinal. I know that the property holds at measureables. Hence (hoping everything else goes well), a natural approach would be to find some forcing extension in which the measurable cardinal becomes the least weakly compact. Can this be done? Since a measurable cardinal has a cofinal sequence of weakly compact cardinals, if such a extension is possible, it would necessarily kill the measurability of the cardinal. A weaker question is if there there is a forcing extension where a measurable cardinal $\kappa$ in the ground model is not measurable but still weakly compact in the generic extension? Are there forcing extensions that kills weakly compact cardinals? Given a positive solution to the weaker question above, perhaps applying the weakly compact killing extension to that extension, one may be able to make the cardinal the least weakly compact. Although there may be some trouble since in the first extension $\kappa$ may still be a limit of weakly compacts. Thanks for any information that can be given. 

Suppose $M$ is a countable transitive model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ (maybe more). Suppose $x, y \in {}^\omega\omega \cap M$ and $M \models y = x^\sharp$. Is it true (possible with additional assumptions), that $V \models y = x^\sharp$? From Kanomori's book, $y = x^\sharp$ is $\Pi_2^1$. However, I can not apply Shoenfield absoluteness since $M$ is countable and does not have the countable ordinals of $V$. An even stronger general question may be: are there conditions on $M$ or $V$ such that $\Pi_2^1$ absoluteness can hold between the universe and the countable model $M$. Thanks for any insight on these questions. 

Does there exist a forcing $P$ which adds a generic real in the sense that $V[G] = V[x]$ for some $x \in ({}^\omega\omega)^{V[G]}$, and for all reals $y \in ({}^\omega\omega)^{V[G]}$, if $V[y] \neq V$, then there exists some $z \in {}^\omega\omega$ such that $V \subsetneq V[z] \subsetneq V[y]$? Is there a forcing poset $P$ which adds a generic real and in $V[G]$ there are no finite sets $\{z_1, ..., z_n\}$ such that for all reals $V[z] = V[z_i]$ for some $i$, and if $A \subseteq ({}^\omega\omega)^{V[G]}$ and $A \in V[G]$ there exists some $y \in A$ such that $V \subsetneq V[y]$ and $V[y]$ is $\subseteq$ minimal among $\{V[z] : z \in A\}$. This question is motivated by forcing (like Sack's Forcing) which adds a minimal real degree. Adding finite real degrees means that there is a finite set $\{z_1, .., z_n\}$ such that for all $y$, $V[y] = V[z_i]$ for some $i$. I am interested in the behavior of forcing extension that do not add finite real degrees. The two questions above can be phrased differently as follows: For the first question I want to know if there is a generic extension such that the proper intermediate extensions given by reals are not well-founded under $\subseteq$. The second question, is whether there is a extension that does not add finite real degrees whose proper intermediate extensions given by reals are well-founded in the sense above. Thanks for any information. 

A tree $T$ on $\omega \times \lambda$ is weakly homogeneous if there is a countable set $\sigma$ of countably complete measures on ${}^{<\omega}\lambda$ so that $x \in p[T]$ if and only if there is a countably complete tower of measures $\bar{\mu} = \langle \mu_i : i \in \omega \rangle$ so that each $T_{x\upharpoonright i} \in \mu_i$ and each $\mu_i \in \sigma$. Fix such a tree $T$ and a $\sigma$ witnessing weak homogeneity. Fix an enumeration $\langle \mu_i : i \in \omega\rangle$ of $\sigma$ so that projections of $\mu_i$ come before $\mu_i$. For an ordinal $\nu$, the Martin-Solovay tree $\mathrm{MS}_\nu(T,\sigma)$ is a tree on $\omega \times \nu$ defined by: $(h,s) \in \mathrm{MS}_\nu(T,\sigma)$ if and only if for all $i < l < |s|$, if $k_i = \dim(\mu_i)$ and $k_l = \dim(\mu_l)$, $T_{s \upharpoonright k_i} \in \mu_i$, $T_{s \upharpoonright k_l} \in \mu_l$, and $\mu_i$ is a projection of $\mu_l$, then $j_{i,l}(h(i)) > h(l)$, where $j_{i,l}$ is the natural map between the $\mu_i$ ultrapower and the $\mu_l$ ultrapower. In Steel's "The Derived Model Theorem" Lemma 1.19, he shows that $p[T] = {}^\omega\omega \setminus p[MS_{\lambda^+}(T,\mu)]$. This is proved by finding a continuous witness to the ill foundedness of all appropriate towers coming from $\sigma$. At least in the Steel's proof provided there, it seems that he is using the axiom of choice. So my question is: Under $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}$, Martin showed that every tree $T$ on $\omega \times \lambda$ where $\lambda < \Theta$ is weakly homogeneous. Fix $T$ and $\sigma$ witnessing weak homogeneity. The Martin-Solovay tree $\mathrm{MS}_{\lambda^+}(T,\sigma)$ can be constructed. Under $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}$, is $p[T] = {}^\omega\omega \setminus p[MS_{\lambda^+}(T,\sigma)]$ still true? In Larson's Stationary tower book, he mentioned that it is unknown whether the type of continuous witnesses to illfoundedness of all towers (used in $\mathsf{AC}$ proof) can be proved in $\mathsf{ZF + DC}$. In his Games and Scales paper, Steel mentioned that Martin-Solovay trees are studied in the choiceless $\mathsf{AD}$ context. I suspect at least under determinacy the Martin-Solovay tree should project onto the complement of a weakly homogeneous tree. Thanks for any information or references to this question. 

Let $P$ be a closed set with code in $V$ and $P$ is countable in $V[G]$ where $G$ is generic for some forcing $\mathbb{P}$. This means that there is some tree $T$ consisting of binary sequences so that $P = [T]$, where the latter is the set of infinite paths through $T$, and $T$ belongs to the ground model $V$. First the claim is that $[T]$ is countable in $V$. If not, by the perfect set property for closed set (which you can prove by the Cantor-Bendixson idea of the other answer), $[T]$ has a perfect subset. This means there is a subtree $S \subseteq T$ with the property that for all nodes $s \in S$, there is a extension $t \supseteq s$ so that $t0, t1 \in S$. ($S$ is a perfect tree.) Go back into $V[G]$, $S \subseteq T$ so $[S] \subseteq [T] = P$. But since $S$ is a perfect tree, $[S]$ must be in bijection with $2^\omega$. So $P$ is not countable. Contradiction. This shows that $[T]$ is countable in $V$. So pick some $f : \omega \rightarrow [T]$ which is a bijection of $\omega$ onto $[T]$ and $f$ belongs to $V$. $V$ satisfies that statement $$(\forall x \in 2^{\omega})(x \in [T] \Rightarrow (\exists n \in \omega)(f(n) = x))$$ This is a $\Pi_1^1$ statement of descriptive set theory. By Mostowski absoluteness, this statement remains true in $V[G]$. Hence in $V[G]$, one can show $[T] \subseteq f''\omega = [T]^V$. The latter consists of only elements of $V$. 

It seems that I understood the question as is it ever possible to force the continuum to be $\aleph_2$ without adding Cohen generic over $L$. It seems the far more interesting question is whether for any universe $V$ (perhaps not equal to $L$) which does not have Cohen generic over $L$, is there a forcing extension of $V$ which does not add Cohen generics over $L$. 

Concerning the existence of Suslin trees under $\mathsf{AD + V = L(\mathbb{R})}$: Assume $ZF + AD^+ + V = L(\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{R}))$. Let $(T,\prec)$ be an $\omega_1$-tree with all levels countable. (I) Suppose $T$ is wellorderable. We can repeat Hamkin's argument above: One can show $T$ is in bijection with $\omega_1$. $(T,\prec)$ can be coded as a subset of $\omega_1$. $(T,\prec)$ is constructible from real $r$ by a result of Solovay; hence, $(T,\prec) \in L[r]$. $r^\sharp$ exists, so $\omega_1^V$ is weakly compact and has the tree property. Therefore, in $L[r]$, $T$ has a branch which is in bijection with $\omega_1^V$. $(T,\prec)$ is not a Suslin tree in $V$. (II) Suppose $T$ can not be wellordered. By Theorem 1.4 of "A Trichotomy Theorem in Natural Models of $\mathsf{AD}^+$" by Caicedo and Ketchersid, there is an injection $\Phi : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow T$ under these assumptions. Define a prewellordering on $\mathbb{R}$ by $x \sqsubseteq y$ if and only if the level of $(T,\prec)$ that $\Phi(x)$ belongs to is less than or equal to the level of $(T,\prec)$ that $\Phi(y)$ belongs to. Since $(T,\prec)$ has countable levels, $\sqsubseteq$ is a prewellordering on $\mathbb{R}$ with each prewellordering class countable. This does not exists under $\mathsf{AD}$. 

Suppose $\mathbb{P}$ is a forcing with the following properties: Let $G \subseteq \mathbb{P}$ be filter generic over $V$, then there exists $A \in V[G]$ such that $V[G]$ thinks $A$ is countable and $A \subseteq {}^\omega 2 \cap V$, but $A$ is not covered by any ground model countable set. That is, in the generic extension there is a countable set of ground model reals that can not be covered by a countable set from the ground model. Certainly $\mathbb{P}$ is not a proper forcing. Is it possible that $\mathbb{P}$ can preserve $\aleph_1$? As $A$ need not be a set in $V$, it seems at least theoretically possible that $\mathbb{P}$ does not need to collapse any cardinals. Now I would like to iterate this forcing by itself. However, since it is not proper, I do not know what properties can be expected to be preserved. Although this may be a bit too open ended, my next question is : What classes of forcing (by which I means things like c.c.c., proper, semi-proper, etc) could $\mathbb{P}$ potentially belong to given that it adds a countable set of ground model real that can not be covered by a countable ground model set. (Certainly $\mathbb{P}$ can not be c.c.c. or proper.) Do any of these classes have preservation theorems for iterations (countable support or perhaps some other type of iterations)? I am most interested in perserving $\aleph_1$, preserving ${}^\omega\omega$-bounding, or $\aleph_2$-chain conditions. If it is applicable, one may assume $\mathbb{P}$ has size $\aleph_1$ if $\mathsf{CH}$ holds. I am looking for some class of forcing that can help handle iterations of non-proper forcings like $\mathbb{P}$. Thanks for any information that can be provided.
