Option 1 is where the rule is clearly non-canon. In this case, the PCs don't actually heal that quickly and in the "real" story they spent much longer accomplishing things. But to make the story more fun the telling of the story glosses over the lengthy recoveries. Of course, that makes other stuff no longer sensible. Like, how did the PCs kill three dragons in one summer if it took 6 months between kills to get their strength back? Well, they didn't. In fact, the PCs only killed one dragon, one of them was killed, two of them quit adventuring, and it took an army to take on the other dragons. But who cares? Story trumps logic here. In essence, the magical healing only affects the PCs and it's explicitly a non-canon, out-of-universe plot gimmick because you and your players decided it was fun. So there's nothing to change in the setting, because it doesn't exist in-universe. Option 2 is to make it canon, in-universe magic, but make it only affect the PCs (and possibly a few select NPCs). Perhaps the PCs are The Chosen Ones and the gods granted a boon upon their births. Perhaps when they met in that tavern in the first episode, an Old Man Who Is Really A Great Wizard cast a spell on them. Maybe it's a one-in-a-million thing, and the PCs actively sought others like them to form an adventuring group. Regardless of exactly how it happened, there is precedent for it in-universe, but it's not generally important because almost nobody else has the same regeneration. The only place you'd really add it to the setting is if a certain bad guy needs to keep up with the PCs or something. Alternately, you could use it as a plot device for "the villagers decide to do experiments on your party to unlock the secrets of your regeneration" or similar. It could be tied to an artifact the PCs possess and need to guard. Option 3 is to make it canon and commonplace. This is where you have to actually start worrying about the world-building aspects. Because constant regeneration means lots of things we are very concerned with would be nearly insignificant to normal people. You'd need to flesh out the how and the why a bit more to get any good answers though. Do people still need to eat and drink? Do people get disease? Infection? Do they age normally? Is heart failure "injury" or "disease"? Where do you draw the line between "major" vs. "minor" injury? Can the magic be dispelled or prevented using other magic? Reversed to kill you faster? Does it exist literally everywhere, or just in certain parts of the world? What if they open a door to another dimension? If most of those answers are pretty normal, then you might not have much difference at all. You won't really hear about the guy who lost his farm because he couldn't work all summer, nor are you likely to see a poor beggar whose back problems make him useless in the area, but those aren't really a huge part of most stories anyways. On the other hand, if people pretty much never die, get sick, etc, it could drastically alter the basic mood of the setting. There would be a lot less of the dark, depressing, dystopian kinds of atmosphere and a lot more Meet the Rogers kinds of atmosphere. This could work for or against your campaign. 

As mentioned in a couple other answers, the problem here isn't just the escape velocity of the moon, but the orbital velocity of the planet as well. Escape Velocity So first, you need to escape the moon's gravity. Wikipedia says the fastest human sprinting speed is 12.4 m/s. Let's assume that's a pretty good number for jumping speed also. So we need a moon whose escape velocity is less than that. I happen to have a paper here which says the escape velocity is given by $v_{escape}=\sqrt{2Gm\over r}$. Notice that it depends on both mass and radius, so there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. We could have a massive but large moon, or a lighter but smaller moon, and get the same escape velocity. So let's say the upper limit to density is Earth's density, $\rho_E=5495 {kg \over m^3}$, and the lower limit is around the density of a comet, $\rho_C$$={0.3 g\over cm^3}$$=300 {kg\over m^3}$. The density of the moon is in the middle at $\rho_M=3343{kg\over m^3}$ We can re-arrange density to solve for mass. $\rho={m\over V}$$\leftrightarrow m=V\rho$. The volume of a sphere is $V={4\over 3}\pi r^3$, so $m={4\over 3}\pi r^3\rho$. Ok, so we can plug density and our mass substitution into the escape velocity equation: $v_{escape}=\sqrt{2G({4\over 3}\pi r^3\rho)\over r}$$=2r\sqrt{{2\pi\over 3}G\rho}$. From here, we can re-arrange to solve for radius. $r={v_{escape}\over 2\sqrt{{2\over 3}G\pi\rho}}$. $r(\rho_C)$$={12.4 {m\over s}\over 2\sqrt{{2\pi\over 3}6.673\cdot 10^{-11}{N\cdot m^2\over kg^2}300{kg\over m^3}}}$$={12.4\over 2\sqrt{{2\pi\over3}6.673\cdot 10^{-11}\cdot 300}}{{m\over s}\over \sqrt{{kg\cdot m\over s^2}{m^2\over kg^2}{kg\over m^3}}}$$=30279m$$=30.3km$ $r(\rho_M)$$=9070m$$=9.1km$ $r(\rho_E)$$=7737m$$=7.7km$ $r(\rho)$$={524447\over\sqrt{\rho}}$ So our moon's radius needs to be less than 30.3 km if it's a comet-like object, less than 9.1 km if it's moon-like, and less than 7.7 km if it's Earth-like. You can use the last equation for an arbitrary density. De-orbit Velocity But now we're just hanging out in space. We need to fall onto the planet. So we need our jump from the moon to leave us with enough velocity to cancel out our orbital velocity. The equation for orbital velocity is the equation for escape velocity. Let's say we're orbiting the parent planet at the Earth-Moon distance, 365,542 km. We can solve for the required mass of the planet. $v_{orbital}=\sqrt{2Gm\over r}$$\leftrightarrow m=v_{orbital}^2{r\over2G}$$=12.4^2{m^2\over s^2}{365,542,000 m \over 2\cdot 6.673\cdot 10^{-11}{N\cdot m^2\over kg^2}}$$=4.225\cdot 10^{20}{m^2\over s^2}m{s^2\over kg\cdot m}{kg^2\over m^2}$$=4.225\cdot 10^{20}kg$. The Earth has a mass of about $5.972\cdot 10^{24}kg$, which is about 14000 times the mass our planet needs to be. So with a tiny planet and a really tiny moon, you could jump from the moon to the planet. If you want to play with different distances and planetary masses, you can use the following equations, remembering mass is in kilograms and distance is in meters. $m_{planet}$$=1.1558\cdot 10^{12}\cdot r_{orbit}$ $\leftrightarrow$$r_{orbit}$$=8.6518\cdot 10^{-13}\cdot m_{planet}$. Positioning An important note here, is that you can't jump towards the planet. That just gives you an eccentric orbit. You need to jump when the planet is on the horizon, and it needs to be backwards compared to the moon's orbit.
