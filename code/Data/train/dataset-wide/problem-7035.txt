White standard errors correct for heteroscedasticity only, whereas Newey West standard errors are robust to both Heteorscedasticity and Autocorrelation (HAC) . 

I have a question regarding the Bartik Instrument. I understand that this instrument is a particularly important tool that is used in labor economics. From my understanding, this instrument attempts to isolate demand shocks from supply shocks. Consider the following thought experiment: Say that we have an equilibrium quantity determined both the labor demand and labor supply. Call it total labor employed in period t in region i. We can express it as:$$L_{it}=\sum_{j}L_{ijt}$$ where the RHS is the summation over all industries hiring labor in this region. Now, the problem is as follows: the changes in total labor hired in each industry is a result of both supply and demand shocks. What the Bartik Instrument does is that it constructs local labor demand shocks in the following manner:$$\tilde{L_{it}}=\sum_{j}\omega_{jt}L_{ijt-1}$$ where the LHS is region $i's$ predicted employment. The summation is basically a weighted average using weights which corresponding to growth rates in national level employment in industry $j$ times the labor force employed in industry j by region $i$ at time $t$. In a sense, these are changes that are unrelated to local labor supply shocks. The Bartik instrument is then calculated as $\frac{\tilde{L_{it}}-L_{it-1}}{L_{it-1}}$ This is where I am lost. Once I construct this 'instrument', what would be my first stage? Do I need a first stage anymore? My intuition tells me yes. What I mean is that is this already the predicted value that we obtain after a first stage? Let me phrase my question in a more intuitive manner:$$L=f(L^{d},L^{s})$$ As a result,$$dL=f_{L^d}dL^{d}+f_{L^S}dL^{s}$$ Now, in a stochastic environment:$$dL=f_{L^D}dL^{d}+f_{L^S}dL^{s}+v =f_{L^D}dL^{d}+\epsilon$$ where I assume that $$cov(dL^{d},\epsilon)=0$$ or that demand shocks and supply shocks are unrelated. In the first stage then, is the RHS the constructed Bartik instrument? In that case, I would regress the total observed change in labor on the Bartik instrument and obtain $\hat{dL}$ . Or is it the case that the constructed Bartik instrument by itself serves as $\hat{dL}$ ? Thanks a lot! 

The total wealth (as is pointed out in the book) is given as : $$ X(1)=\delta_{0}B(1)+\delta_{1}S_{1}(1)+...\delta_{N}S_{N}(1) $$ The wealth at period one is just the sum of the securities (including amount invested in the bank) times their number. In other words, the total wealth is the amount of money this individual has invested in the different assets. It has nothing to do with a "changing process." Asssume that the individual does not buy any more assets during period 1 and the assets promise a return of $(1+r_{i})$ where $i$ denotes the asset in question. In period 2, the individuals wealth is then $$ X(2)=\delta_{0}B(1)(1+r_{0})+\delta_{1}S_{1}(1)(1+r_{1})+...\delta_{N}S_{N}(1)(1+r_{N}) $$ 

To supplement the above answer, you can force your regression to not have a constant. In this case, economic theory will indicate that $C(0)$ is at least non zero. 

A short answer to your question is both yes and no. You have to first define productivity: productivity, in my opinion, cannot simply mean publishing the number of articles, but rather, their impact. A typical way of modelling the impact of authors is by looking at their h-index. There are many other ways of measuring productivity as well- where the articles are published is important as well. The top 5 journals in economics are (in no particular order): Econometrica, AER, QJE, JPE and ReStud. Articles published in these journals are generally of high quality. However, there are many articles that are published in these journals that do not always have the desired impact. Many a time, articles ranked in lower journals have a high impact. Consequently, it is extremely difficult to measure productivity. To me, the h-index is a good measure. 

In their example, both traders have the same utility function, which has the following characteristics: 

I often see papers in economic theory mentioning a duality between the price space and the commodity space. I think they refer to duality of vector spaces. I.e, the commodity space is a vector space, a price system is a linear functional over the commodity space (assigning a value to each bundle), and so the space of all possible price systems is the dual of the commodity space. Is there a standard reference that explains this duality in more detail? 

The textbook I am currently reading claims that, in an infinitely-repeated game with discount, there might be a payoff vector which is feasible and individually-rational, but it is not an equilibrium payoff vector in the repeated game. The example is the following basic game for three players: 

Here I am stuck. I don't understand why the utility function I suggested above doesn't work? And what axiom is violated here? 

In the TR and ML cells, the sum of utilities of the row and column players is less than 2; hence, these cells are not played in equilibrium at all. So in equilibrium, the only cells that may be played with positive frequency are: TL, MR, BL, BR. Now, the authors claim that TL and MR are also not played at all in equilibrium. From this they conclude that the payoff of the dummy player is 0. I didn't understand this part. Is it true that TL and MR are never played in equilibrium? Why? 

Suppose the Net Domestic Product in a certain sector (e.g. agriculture) is 10 billion. Who enjoys this 10 billion? Initially, I thought that this 10 billion is the gross income of the farmers. So some of it is paid as taxes while the rest remains with the farmers as net income. But, I did the math with some real-life data, and found out that the net income of the farmers is much smaller. So, where does the difference go to? My conjecture is that the NDP include the income of other workers related to agriculture, e.g. truck drivers, traders and sellers in farmer markets. Is this correct? Or are they counted in a different sector? 

When I took a course in consumer theory, the economy always had a single consumer, represented by a monotone positive utility function $u(x,y)$ and an income $I$. Given prices $p_x$ and $p_y$, it is possible to calculate the demands of the consumer for products $x$ and $y$. Now, I deal with a different type of economy: there are many consumers, each of them wants only a single unit of each product. Each consumer is represented by three positive values: $u_x$ (utility for having $x$), $u_y$ (utility for having $y$) and $u_{xy} \geq \max(u_x,u_y)$ (utility for having both $x$ and $y$). Given prices $p_x$ and $p_y$, each consumer buys either $x$ or $y$ or both, whichever gives the highest net utility (utility of product/s minus price). So it is possible to calculate the aggregate demands for $x$ and $y$. MY QUESTION IS: Is there a natural/standard way to convert between these two types of economies? I.e, given a utility function $u(x,y)$ and income $I$ for a single consumer, is it possible to construct a set of consumers with different $u_x$, $u_y$ and $u_{xy}$, such that the demand curves in both economies are the same? 

There are a few papers that I have seen that publish insiginficant results, such as responses (see Easterly's response published in the AER to Burnside and Dollars World Bank paper titled 'Aid, Policies and Growth). The aim of these papers, however, is to negate a positive claim which they do by producing insignificant results (in the hypothesis testing sense) using the same idea as the original authors, but using new data. However, I have yet to come across a major paper in its own right published in the top 5 journals that publishes results that are insignificant. This is a scary thought because when I do my own research, I always shudder before entering the regress y x command. Are there well known papers that publish insignificant results? Thanks! 

Yes, there is an income effect, as the individual needs to work less in order to obtain the same amount in the numerator (relative to before the increase in exchange rate). The assumption is that the substitution effect dominates the income effect here, regardless of whether the individual is a borrower or a lender. 

There is not a period-to-period borrowing constraint. You only have a transversality condition. However, the constraint will be binding if you have Inada conditions, in which case you do not need the multipliers. 

I am using Mishkin's textbook "Economics of Money, Banking and Financial Markets." On the chapter on financial crises, the authors list a number of factors that could trigger a crises. One factor is An Unanticipated Decline in the Value of the Domestic Currency. I quote "Because of uncertainty about the future value of the domestic currency in developing countries (and in some industrialized countries), many nonfinancial firms, banks, and governments in developing countries find it easier to issue debt denominated in foreign currencies rather than their own currency. This can lead to a financial crisis in a similar fasahion to an unanticipated decline in the price level. With debt contracts denominated in foreign currency when there is an unanticipated decline in the value of the domestic currency, the debt burden of domestic firms increases.â€¢ Since assets are typically denominated in domestic currency, there is a resulting deterioration in firms' balance sheets and a decline in net worth, which then increases adverse selection and moral hazard problems along the lines just described." I don't get the logic. The authors are a bit vague: a decline in the value of the domestic currency perhaps means a depreciation relative to other currencies. Now, if that is correct, if there is uncertainty about the future value of the domestic currency, why would firms issue debt denominated in foreign currencies? If domestic currency is expected to appreciate, then only does it make sense (forgetting uncovered interest parity for now). Am I thinking correctly about this? Thanks! 

I am struggling a bit with understanding the meaning of capital ratios, and bank profitablity. It seems to me that capital requirements stipulate that a certain fraction of banks' risk weighted assets have to be held as equity. I get why that is the case: for any given value of assets, having more capital serves as a cushion against their falling values. The definition of bank capital is: $$E=A-L$$ Where E represents bank capital. Now, from a textbook I am reading, it says that banks don't like having high amounts of capital, as it reduces their potential profits. I don't understand what that means- doesn't having high amounts of capital mean that the bank is indeed very profitable (maximizing difference between assets and liabilities?)
