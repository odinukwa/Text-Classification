Checking this axiomatization works It's clear that if $\mathcal{G} = (V,E)$ is a finite directed serial graph and $s \in V$, then $(V,N(\mathcal{G},s),E,s,\in)$ is a model of this theory. Conversely, if we have a finite model $(V,N_0,E,s,\epsilon)$ of this theory, then $(V,E)$ forms a directed serial graph with $s \in V$. Now let $N_1$ consist of those $Y \in N_0$ such that $\forall x (x \epsilon Y \rightarrow V(x))$. I claim that: $N((V,E),s) = \{ \{x : x \epsilon Y\} : Y \in N_1\}$ But I won't prove this. A remark about some "unnaturalness" It should seem like I could have done things differently so that things looked more natural and the above claim could be proved more easily. The way I've written 2 and 3 are not the most natural, but I've done it for a reason. 2 says that if $\vec{x}$ is a tuple which is sure to contain an infinite path starting at $s$, then there's a member of $N$ consisting precisely of the members of $\vec{x}$. 3 says that if $\vec{x}$ is sure to not contain an infinite path starting at $x$, then there's nothing in $N$ consisting precisely of the members of $\vec{x}$. The formulas in 2 and 3 are in prenex normal form, where the matrix is a conditional where the left side only involves the symbols $\bar{E}$ and $\bar{s}$, and the right side only $\bar{N}$ and $\bar{\epsilon}$. Moreover, the antecedents have variables $\vec{x}$ and the consequents have variables $\vec{x}, Y, x$. The point You want a theory equivalent to axiom 1 and schemas 2 and 3 above, but you want to replace 2 and 3 with (probably finitely many) axioms which don't mention the symbol $\bar{E}$. I feel like there ought to be some interpolation-type theorem (along the lines of Craig Interpolation or Lyndon Interpolation) which says this can't happen, i.e. something which says that a theory in which each axiom mention either only $\bar{V}, \bar{E}, \bar{s}$ or only $\bar{V}, \bar{N}, \bar{s}, \bar{\epsilon}$ can't prove a theory which has axioms like those in schemas 2 or 3. 

Let $E$ be an irreducible Banach $A$-module, for a Banach algebra $A$. One can easily show that for an ultra filter $\mathcal U$, $(E)_\mathcal U$ is a Banach $(A)_\mathcal U$-module. Is it possible to find a countably incomplete ultra filter $\mathcal U$ such that $(E)_\mathcal U$ becomes an irreducible Banach $(A)_\mathcal U$-module? 

Let $G$ be a l.c. group and $f$ belong to $C_c(G)$, the space of continuous functions with compact support. Define an operator$T_f$ on $L^2(G)$ by $T_f(g)=f*g$ (the convolution product). If $T_f$ is positive and invertible, could $\|T_f\|$ belong to the point spectrum of $T_f$? 

Denote by $\precsim$ the order comes from "Murray-von Neumann" equivalence in the projection lattice of a von Numann algebra. Let $e$ and $f$ be two projection in a von Numann algebra $\mathfrak M$. Why is there a central projection $p$ such that $$ep\precsim‎ fp\quad \text{and}\quad (1-e)(1-p)\precsim‎(1-f)(1-p).$$ 

Do there exist an amenable Beurling algebra that is neither Arens regular nor strongly Arens irregular? In his memoir "The second duals of Beurling algebras", A. T. Lau proved that there exists a weight $\omega$ on $\mathbb Z$ such that $\ell^1(\mathbb Z,\omega)$ is neither Arens regular nor strongly Arens irregular, but this algebra is not amenable. 

Does anyone know of generalizations of pcf theory where we might consider products of the form: $$\aleph_1 \times (\aleph_2 \times \aleph_2) \times (\aleph_3 \times \aleph_3 \times \aleph_3) \dots$$ $$(\aleph_1 \times \aleph_2 \times \dots) \times (\aleph_1 \times \aleph_2 \times \dots) \times \dots$$ or, more abstractly: $$P_1 \times P_2 \times P_3 \times \dots$$ where each $P_i$ is a $\mathrm{cof}(P_i)$-directed partial order. My motivation is that I'm interested in what the relationship between $$\max\mathrm{pcf}\langle \aleph_1,\aleph_2,\aleph_2,\aleph_3,\aleph_3,\aleph_3,\dots\rangle$$ and $$\max\mathrm{pcf}\langle\aleph_n\rangle_{0 < n < \omega }$$ might be because it might help me understand the relationship between $$\max \mathrm{pcf} \langle \aleph_n \rangle_{0 < n <\omega }$$ and $$\max \mathrm{pcf} \langle \aleph_{2n} \rangle_{0 < n <\omega }$$ 

Let $G$ be a $(V,P)$-generic filter containing $q$. We want to show that $G \cap M$ is a filter on $P$ generic over $M$. $G \cap M$ will be countable so it typically won't be closed upwards in $P$, the relevant point is that it's closed upwards in $P \cap M$. So it's not hard to see that it's a filter on $P \cap M$. Next we need to see it's generic over $M$. Let $A \in M$ be a maximal antichain in $P$. Let $p$ be the sole element of $A \cap G$. Let $r$ extend both $p$ and $q$, which is possible because they're both in $G$ and $G$'s a filter. By (i), $A \cap M$ is predense below $q$, and $r \leq q$, so there's some $p' \in A \cap M$ compatible with $r$. But since $A$ is a maximal antichain, there's precisely one element of $A$ compatible with $r$, and we already know $p \in A$ is compatible with $r$ (in fact it's above $r$), so $p' = p$. Therefore $p \in A \cap G \cap M$, meaning $G \cap M$ meets $A$. Since $A$ was arbitrary, $G \cap M$ meets every maximal antichain belonging to $M$, hence it's generic over $M$. Just as genericity of a filter can be defined in terms of dense sets, open dense sets, predense sets, or maximal antichains, it can so be done for genericity of a condition. See Lemma 1.2 in my notes below; it gives three equivalent conditions for $(M,P)$-genericity. The first and third are just like your (i) and (ii) but with antichains replaced with dense sets. The second one is also in terms of dense sets but slightly different from your (i) and (ii), and it's another useful way of looking at $(M,P)$-genericity. $URL$ 

Denote by $\precsim$ the order comes from "Murray-von Neumann" equivalence in the projection lattice of a von Numann algebra. Let e and f be two projections in a properly infinite von Numann algebra M. Do $e\precsim f$ and $1-e\precsim 1-f$ imply $e\sim f$? 

Let $H_0:=(\ker M)^\perp$ and $E$ be the projection on $H_0$. Then $$[\xi,\eta]:=\langle M\xi,\eta\rangle\quad(\xi,\eta\in H_0)$$ define an inner product on $H_0$. Assume that $H$ is a completion of $H_0$ w.r.t. the norm, $\||\cdot\||$ induced by $[\cdot,\cdot]$. It is easy to show that for $S\in\mathcal B(F)$, $S\in\mathcal B_M(F)$ iff $ES|_{H_0}\in\mathcal B(H)$ and $\|S\|_M$ is just the norm of $ES|_{H_0}$ in $\mathcal B(H)$. So the result you want follows from the fact you mentioned ($r(T)\leq w(T)$). 

Denote by $\sim$ the "Murray-von Neumann" equivalence in the projection lattice of a von Numann algebra. Let $e$ be a projection in a properly infinite factor. Is it always true that $e\sim 1$ or $1-e\sim 1$? 

I saw it as an exercise (E1.4.2) in the book "Analysis Now" by "Gert. K. Pedersen" with slight difference; $f$ is defined by $$f:\mathbb R\rightarrow\mathbb R,\quad x\mapsto\limsup\frac1n{\sum_{k=1}^nx_n}$$ where $x-\lfloor x\rfloor=0.x_1x_2\dots$ is the binary expansion of the fractional part of $x$. 

The reason I ask this question comes from a more specific question, but to ask that question I need to give some background -- all of this comes from Stevo's article mentioned above: Let $\mathrm{PFA}(\omega _1)$ be the statement that if $P$ is a proper notion of forcing, and $\mathcal{D}$ an $\omega _1$-sequence of predense subsets of $P$, each of size at most $\omega _1$, then there exists a $(P, \mathcal{D})$-generic filter. Lemma: $\mathrm{PFA}(\omega _1)$ holds iff for every $\Delta _0$-formula $\varphi$ and a parameter $a \in H _{\omega _2} $, if some proper poset forces that $\exists x \varphi (x, a)$ is true in some transitive model then $H _{\omega _2}$ already satisfies $\exists x \varphi (x, a)$. In a later lemma, Stevo claims that the following formula is $\Delta _0$ in order to apply the lemma quoted above: $\psi (x,y,a)$ is the formula which says: 

Unless I made a mistake, I've shown that a DLO $(L,\leq)$ is a DLO with a dense subset of size $\kappa$ iff it is (up to isomorphism) some set $X \subset \mathcal{P}(\kappa)$ ordered by inclusion such that $(X,\subseteq)$ satisfies the following property: 

Let $B(m,n)$ be the Burnside group on $m$ generators of exponent $n$. Suppose the class number - the number of conjugacy classes - of $B(m,n)$ is finite. Does it imply that $B(m,n)$ is finite? 

For $T\in B(F)$, we have $\ker T=\ker T^*T$ and $\ker T=(\text{Im} T^*)^\perp$, so for a positive operator $M$ we obtain $\ker M^{1/2}=\ker M$, whence $$F=\ker M\oplus\overline{\text{Im} M}=\ker M^{1/2}\oplus\overline{\text{Im} M^{1/2}}$$ If $P$ denote the projection on $\overline{\text{Im} M}=\overline{\text{Im} M^{1/2}}$,then $$\langle M^{1/2}x,M^{1/2}y\rangle=\langle M^{1/2}Px,M^{1/2}Py\rangle=\langle MPx,Py\rangle=\langle Px,Py\rangle_M$$ so $F/\ker M=\overline{\text{Im} M^{1/2}}$ and the product defined on $F/\ker M$ is just the one defined on $\overline{\text{Im} M^{1/2}}$. 

Let $\beta$ be a Hilbert basis for $H$. If $\tilde\beta$ is a finite subset of $\beta$ and $f:\beta\rightarrow \beta\setminus\tilde\beta$ is a bijection, then $$U:H\rightarrow H,\quad v\mapsto f(v)$$ introduce a partial isometry in $B(H)$ whose initial projection is $I$ and its final projection is $I-P$, where $P$ is a projection on the closed subspace generated by $\tilde\beta$. So $I\sim I-P\neq I$ and that mean $I$ is infinite. Also, if we choose disjoint subsets $\beta_1,\beta_2$ such that $\beta_1\cup\beta_2=\beta$ and $\beta$, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ have same cardinals, the argument like the one above shows that $I$ is properly infinite projection. 

Stefan's answer pointed me in the right direction, and then talking it over with prof. Leo Harrington we've got an answer: A complete Boolean algebra $\mathbb{B}$ never adds a dominating real iff for any collection $\{ u _{m,k} : m, k \in \omega \} \subset \mathbb{B}^+$ the following weaker form of weak $(\omega ,\omega )$-distributivity holds: 

A non-principal ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $\omega$ is a p-point (or weakly selective) iff for every partition $\omega = \bigsqcup _{n < \omega} Z_n$ into null sets, i.e each $Z_n \not \in \mathcal{U}$, there exists a measure one set $S \in \mathcal{U}$ such that $S \cap Z_n$ is finite for each $n$. A non-principal ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on $\omega$ is Ramsey (or selective) iff for every partition as above, there exists a measure one set $S$ such that $|S \cap Z_n| = 1$ for each $n$. Clearly, every Ramsey ultrafilter is a p-point. What is known about the converse? I couldn't find anything, not even a consistency result, in any searches I've done or sources I've checked. Is very little known/published about the converse? 

We may say that two finitely generated groups $G$ and $H$ are generating-bijective when there exist homomorphisms $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ and $\psi:H\rightarrow G$ such that, for each ordered generating sets $\mathfrak g$ and $\mathfrak h$ of $G$ and $H$, resp. we can find ordered generating sets $\mathfrak h'$ and $\mathfrak g'$ of $H$ and $G$ resp. such that $$\phi(\mathfrak g')=\mathfrak h,\quad \psi(\mathfrak h')=\mathfrak g$$ Do there exist finitely generated groups $G$ and $H$ along with epimorphisms $\phi:G\rightarrow H$ and $\psi:H\rightarrow G$, such that $G$ and $H$ aren't generating-bijective? 

Denote by $U(M)$ the group of unitary elements of a von Neumann algebra $M$. $\rho|_A$ is inner iff $u\in U(A)U(A')$. Assume first that $u\in U(A)U(A')$, so there are $v\in U(A)$ and $w\in U(A')$ with $u=vw$. Then for $a\in A$ we have $$\rho(a)=uau^*=vwaw^*v^*=vav^*$$ On the other hand, if there exist $v\in U(A)$ such that $uau^*=\rho(a)=vav^*$, then $v^*ua=av^*u$, $a\in A$, whence $v^*u\in U(A')$ and $u=v(v^*u)\in U(A)U(A')$ 

Is the norm on a unital semi-simple commutative Banach algebra with $\|I\|=1$, unique? ($I$ denotes the identity element) 

You can see for example section 1.4 - spectral theorem II(1.47) - in the book "A course in abstract harmonic analysis" by "Gerald B. Folland". 

Consider the tree of finite partial attempts to build a well-ordering, and notice that it has size continuum. More rigorously, let: $$T = \{ f : n \to \omega\ |\ n \in \omega, f \mbox{ injective } \}$$ ordered by extension. This is clearly an $\omega$ branching tree of height $\omega$, and its branches are precisely the injections $\omega \to \omega$. But we're interested in the set of well-orderings of $\omega$. Now, those injections which are bijections give us distinct well-orderings, but perhaps there are too few of them. What about the branches that aren't surjections? We can create distinct well-orderings out of them too: if a branch $b$ is not surjective and $X$ is the set of naturals missed by its range, consider the well-ordering obtained by taking $b$, then concatenating on to its end the numbers in $X$, ordered naturally. So the branches of our tree are in bijection with a set of well-orderings of $\omega$, and there are continuum many branches, so there are continuum many well-orderings. Note that the set of well-orderings we get is not even the set of all well-orderings. In particular every well-ordering we get has order type $\leq \omega + \omega$. 

Let $A$ be a Banach algebra and $E$ be an irreducible Banach $A$-module. Is there a countably incomplete ultra filter $\mathcal U$ on $\mathbb N$, the set of natural numbers, such that the ultra power $(E)_\mathcal U$ becomes an irreducible Banach $A$-module? (The Banach $A$-module, $E$, which I work with is reflexive, also $E'$ is an irreducible $A$-module.) 

For Banach spaces $E$ and $F$ we denote the approximate operators by $\mathcal A(E,F)$ and projective tensor product by $\hat\otimes$. Consider the natural map $$\Delta: \mathcal A(\ell^q,\ell^p)\hat\otimes\mathcal A(\ell^p,\ell^q)\rightarrow \mathcal A(\ell^p), \quad S\otimes T\mapsto ST$$ Can we write elements in image of $\Delta$ in form of $TS$ where $T\in\mathcal A(\ell^q,\ell^p)$ and $S\in\mathcal A(\ell^p,\ell^q)$? 

It is obvious that for a Banach space $E$, $E$ is reflexive iff $\ell^2(E)$ is reflexive. Let $\mathcal U$ be an ultrafilter. Is the reflexivity of $(E)_\mathcal U$ equivalent to refelxivity of $(\ell^2(E))_\mathcal U$? 

Let $E$ be a reflexive Banach space. Let $\{x_n\}_n$ be a bounded sequence of linearly independent elements of $E$. Does there exist a sequence $\{\phi_n\}_n$ of elements of $E^*$ (the dual of $E$) such that $\langle x_n,\phi_m\rangle=\delta_{mn}$ and $\sum\|\phi_n\|<\infty$. As Nate Eldredge's argument below shows, there is not such sequence $\{\phi_n\}$. Indeed I have a bounded sequence $\{y_n\}$ and I want to know if there is a bounded operator $T\in\mathcal L(E)$ such that $Tx_n=y_n$ for a bounded sequence $\{x_n\}$ in $E$. I thought if $\{x_n\}$ is a bounded linearly independent sequence, then one can define $T=\sum y_n\odot \phi_n$ which $\{\phi_n\}$ is as above. So my main question is that if there is such an operator $T$? 

$$2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1$$ This is a pet peeve of mine, I'm always surprised at the number of people who think that $\aleph_1$ is defined as $2^{\aleph_0}$ or $|\mathbb{R}|$. 

Then, since $D$ is a directed subset of $j^{\ast}(C)$, elementarity will give us that $j''\lambda \in j^{\ast}(C)$, as desired. Since $M^{\lambda} \subset M$, we know that $g := j\upharpoonright \lambda \in M$. So for $x \in X$ (and in particular for $x \in C$), $j^{\ast}(x) = j''x = g''x$. Using this it's not hard to see that $\bigcup D = j''\lambda$. It also implies that $j^{\ast}$ $''X$ $= \{j^{\ast}(x)\ |\ x \in X\}$ $= \{j''x\ |\ x \in X\} = \{g''x\ |\ x \in X\}$ belongs to $M$. Now if $h : X \to C$ is a surjection in $V[G]$, then $j^{\ast}(h)\upharpoonright j^{\ast}$ $''X$ is belongs to $M[G\times H]$ and its range is $D$, so $D \in M[G\times H]$. It remains to show $M[G\times H] \vDash |D| < j(\kappa)$. Since $j(\kappa)$ is inaccessible in $M$, there's some bijection $i: \alpha \to Y$ in $M$ for some $\alpha < j(\kappa)$. This gives a surjection $k : \alpha \to X$ in $M[G\times H]$. We can obtain a bijection $l : X \to j^{\ast}$ $''X$ via $l(x) = g''x$. And $j^{\ast}(h)\upharpoonright j^{\ast}$ $''X$ is a surjection onto $D$. So: $M[G\times H] \vDash |D| \leq |j^{\ast}$ $''X| = |X| \leq \alpha < j(\kappa)$.
