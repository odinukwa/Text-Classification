With the axis of rotation of the earth matching the axis of rotation of the stars, and the equator of the earth matching the equator of the stars, any place along the equator would match what you have described. However due to closeness to the horizon, the polar-most stars wouldn't be visible. If you were able to get a hundred metres or so above the ground, with nothing in the surrounding landscape, you could see all of the stars in the sky over a year's time. 

As far as we know, once beyond the event horizon, someone might experience all of time in the blink of an eye until the hawking radiation makes the black hole disappear and the person comes out again. More likely though you'd just get spaghettified.. In all seriousness though, there is no real limitation, although they aren't really transported to the future, the outside world just moves faster. 

As Andy mentioned, it seems far too slow to be any space debris, and also a bit slow to be a plane. I feel like it might have been a lense flare from the sun. Try setting the camera up in the same spot for another video and see what happens :) 

As @Hohmannfan pointed out, but in addition, there is solid proof that humans have landed on the moon, with several major incidents with the various Apollo missions. One of the missions put a reasonably large retro-reflector array on the surface of the moon to reflect back lasers with the purpose of measuring the moon's distance to the earth, accurate to within millimetres. That alone I consider to be the biggest most undeniable piece of evidence. 

All telescope mounts are calibrated with several known target objects, but to initially line up with said objects it is possible to use eyeballing and then moving the radio-telescope around until reaching a peak value from instruments, which would indicate you are pointing directly at the object. I'm not sure how the professional observatories manage it, but it would be a similar process. 

Your scenario is, of course, rather speculative and considers the very distant future. I don't like that article you're referencing, some stuff seems inaccurate (for example the fraction of baryons locked into stars is tiny and will always remain tiny). If two brown dwarves collide (extremely unlikely, but if you wait long enough, anything with some tiny non-zero probability eventually will happen), they form a new star with their combined mass. Since the brown dwarves have not undergone any hydrogen burning, the new star has the same composition as a new-born star of the same mass would have had (except for lithium) and, if massive enough, will evolve just like an ordinary M dwarf (or so). In other words, it will fuse hydrogen into helium as all stars on the main sequence. 

In addition to the answers by Florin and Rob, I'd like to point out that the gravitational energy in the end dominates over all other sources, like fusion, at least for massive stars. When a massive star eventually collapses to a neutron star, the gravitational pressure is so strong that protons and electrons are pressed into neutrons and all heavy nuclei are destroyed. In other words, the energy gained by fusion was merely a credit payed back with huge interest. The situation is even more dramatic when the star collapses to a black hole. Such objects release an energy of $\epsilon M c^2$ with efficiency $\epsilon\sim0.1$ depending on the details (e.g. the spin of the black hole). This is far more than the $\epsilon<0.01$ from Hydrogen fusion and by far the most efficient natural energy source. The energy emitted from the formation of supermassive black holes equals (approximately) the binding energy of their host galaxies. 

Actually, the planets do not retain their energy or angular momentum. However, this is not (or hardly as explained by Rob) due to collisions with meteroids or any other dust, but due to their mutual gravitational interactions. These are far more important. The gravitational interaction energy of the Earth with Jupiter is about $10^{-4}$ times that with the Sun, $\sim10^{11}$ times more important than the 'dust'. The gravitational interactions are conservative: energy and angular momentum are not lost, only exchanged, but this does not mean that the Solar system is stable. Finally, tidal forces result in the dissipation of energy (but not the total angular momentum including spin), for example the Moon's orbit around Earth increases in radius by about 1inch/yr due the tidal interaction with Earth. For the dynamics of the Solar system these tides are the most important non-conservative forces. 

After a quick google, This page pops up showing that Anaxagoras was the first documented person to make the link between the sun and stars being the same thing. 

While I'm lacking the formulae, the applicable surface area of a body would have to be great enough, and it's density low enough that it's gravity remains below that threshold. So a smaller body is much more likely. If you think about it, most dust from near the sun gets pushed out by the pressure. There wouldn't be a specific point where you would get the matter buildup, it'd be more like the Roche limit where the gravity and density are the factors of the distance from the larger body. Without running calculations I'm also unsure as to whether it would in fact be a stable arrangement but more like an L1 style Lagrange point, where it requires some energy every now and then otherwise it drifts. Edits are welcome, I feel that I haven't used the best language available here and may have rambled. 

As there is no air in space for sound to travel through, you can't hear anything outside of the small bubble you're in, e.g. space suit, space ship. There is however 'noise' in the electromagnetic spectrum which can be picked up by electronic equipment, with this being an example $URL$ 

If we had two moons in opposition of each other the only short term effect would be amplified tides. Long term it will accelerate the decay of Earth's rotational period. 

If I understand your question correctly: The moon and sun have a visual angle of ~32 Arcminutes. So during a total solar eclipse, from when it begins to when it ends, the moon traverses ~64 Arcminutes (one edge touching to edge of the sun to the opposite side at the end which is two diameters) relative to the sun. But in actuality it will have travelled further with respect to your viewing location. 

just check what 'median' means. the median stellar mass is such that half of all stars have lower and the other half hihger mass. it has nothing to do with the logarithm. I havn't seen the term (median stellar mass) in the scientific literature. 

Is it possible to create the proposed system of satellites? Yes (in theorey). Hierarchical multiple systems (like the one proposed in the OP) tend to be stable if the periods differ by $\sim 5$ or more and the orbits are near-circular. So, such a system could be stable. A slight problem may be the commensurability of the periods (the fact that their ratios are rational numbers), which implies orbital resonances. However, these resonances are rather weak (the lowest ratio is 1:24), but they may mess up the system in the very long term (a detailed analysis would be required to find out). In practice, it will be extremely hard to set-up such a system, even with advanced space engineering. What are some values for the weights, rotational speed, and radii that would work? Since this is a strongly hierarchical system, the masses $m$ and semi-major axes $r$ (=radius if the orbit is circular) can be worked out from Kepler's third law $$ \frac{2\pi}{T} = \Omega = \sqrt{\frac{G(m_1+m_2)}{r^3_{1-2}}} $$ for each sub-system. Giving \begin{align} \frac{4\pi^2}{1\mathrm{sec}^2} &= \frac{G(m_S+m_M)}{r^3_{S-M}} \\ \frac{4\pi^2}{1\mathrm{min}^2} &= \frac{G(m_S+m_M+m_H)}{r^3_{SM-H}} \\ \frac{4\pi^2}{1\mathrm{hour}^2} &= \frac{G(m_S+m_M+m_H+m_D)}{r^3_{SMH-D}} \\ \frac{4\pi^2}{1\mathrm{day}^2} &= \frac{G(m_S+m_M+m_H+m_D+m_X)}{r^3_{SMHD-X}}, \end{align} where $r_{ABC-D}$ denotes the distance (more precisely: the orbital semi-major axis) between object $D$ and the centre of mass of objects $A$, $B$, and $C$. Since these are 4 equations for 8 unknowns (4 masses and 4 distances), there is some freedom in the design of your 'clock'. Does the universe have a limit on how many layers of satellite systems it permits? So far, our formula only considered gravitational forces and neglected all else. Moreover, post-Newtonian effects (general relativity) have been ignored. As long as these assumptions remain valid (orbital speeds $\ll c$, orbital distances $\gtrsim\,$cm, solid objects with sizes $\ll$ distances so that tides are neglible, no electric or magnetic fields, vacuum), there is no limit. However, in practice, there is always some elctro-magnetic field and never perfect vacuum... 

That scale up the top is measured in milli-Gal which is thousandths of a cm/s^2. For scale gravity is ~9.81m/s^2 which equals ~981000mGal. The difference between gravity at sea level and the top of mount everest is 2Gal, or 2000mGal, which is 0.2% of average gravity. On the moon, the variation seems to be about 1000mGal, with the average being 162000mGal, which is about 0.6% of average gravity. In conclusion, on the surface, there is no noticeable difference. Not to a human anyway. 

They are most likely dense clumps of dust absorbing whatever wavelength of light this image was captured in. It's hard to say just how big they are as I can't find any scale for this image, but generally nebulae are lightyears massive, with the Crab Nebula according to wiki being 11 light years. So whatever they are, they're still pretty big. Edit: Just look at the horizontal band of darker lumps, you can tell that they are between us and the brighter region. The band would be of the same material as the bright green cloud, just less energised as it is further away from the star. 

Gravity would warp your entire body, or at least tug on it, because bodies that aren't bound together by gravity largely resist it's deformation, at least that's the major point I'm working on here. That being said, it should pull on some structure in your ear, be it the bones or the tiny Philae (I believe that's the right word, edit if not), either way it results in a deviation from their original position. Depending on proximity you might also be able to feel it, in likeness to standing in front of a large speaker. However the ears would be far more sensitive. I hope I've answered your question :)
