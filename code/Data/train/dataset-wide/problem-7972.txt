Even though it is less general than some other definitions, the Riemann sum definition is very close to the way that integration is interpreted and used in geometry and in applied mathematics. When I set up an integral, say to find the volume of a domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ or the volume of a manifold, I basically derive the integrand as an idealized (possibly multidimensional) Riemann sum. For example, say that I want to find the integral of a function $f(\theta,\phi)$ on the sphere $S^2$. Then the limit of a Riemann term is the value of $f$ times a little region in the shape and orientation of Colorado (as if the sphere were the Earth) that subtends angles of $d\theta$ and $d\phi$. The region has height $d\theta$ and width $(\sin \theta)d \phi$, hence the integral is $$\int_{S^2} f(\theta,\phi) (\sin \theta) d\phi d\theta.$$ Admittedly this informal model can be adapted to Lebesgue integration as well as to Riemann integration --- but not especially to Cauchy's trick that Dieudonné promotes. So, Lebesgue integration is a good thing to teach, but it is clearly more complicated than Riemann integration. It's really an upper-division undergraduate topic, or a first-year graduate topic, to explain why Lebesgue integration is an excellent definition and not a gratuitously complicated one. (But it makes sense, when you teach Riemann integration, to briefly state that Lebesgue integration cures particular diseases of Riemann integration.) 

The other answerers in this thread, who are more expert in this topic than I am, had more information about why a compact complex manifold might not be a smooth projective variety. Just for clarity, I will restrict attention to the compact, smooth case. Also, you say "proper" rather than "compact" in the algebraic category because every algebraic variety is "compact" in the extremely coarse Zariski topology. An algebraic variety is proper if and only if it is analytically compact. The main use of the word proper is to emphasize that it is more general than projective, which means given by polynomial equations in complex projective space. There are two very different initial reasons that an analytic complex manifold might not be projective. It might not be Moishezon: A complex $n$-manifold is Moishezon if it has $n$ algebraically independent meromorphic functions. (The number of algebraically independent elements or the transcendence degree of a field is called the Krull dimension. The meromorphic Krull dimension of a compact complex $n$-manifold is at most $n$.) Or it might not be Kähler: A complex $n$-manifold is Kähler if it has a Riemannian metric such that the covariant derivative of the complex structure vanishes. So to summarize what people said about compact complex manifolds (much of which is in the back of Hartshorne's book): projective ⇒ algebraic ⇒ Moishezon ⟺ bimeromorphically projective projective ⇒ Kähler ⇒ symplectic ⇒ non-zero $H^2$ algebraic ⇒ non-zero $H^2$ (exposited by David Speyer) Moishezon and Kähler ⟺ projective (Moishezon) Kähler and integrally symplectic ⟺ projective (Kodaira) In addition, projective and algebraic structure and the Moishezon property are all unstable with respect to analytic deformation. And bimeromorphic equivalence preserves $\pi_1$. Taubes found compact complex manifolds that have the wrong $\pi_1$ to be Kähler; indeed they can have any $\pi_1$. Voisin found compact Kähler manifolds with the wrong homotopy type to be projective, disproving Kodaira's conjecture that every compact Kähler manifold can be deformed to projective. And, way out in left field, a left-invariant complex structure (LICS) on a compact simple Lie group is a compact complex manifold that has no $H^2$ and can be simply connected too. Still, despite these beautiful non-projective compact complex manifolds, it's generally easier to study projective examples. It's generally easier to sidestep analysis and do algebra instead. 

With all of that, the idea is to first prove the refinement of Ado's theorem for $L'$. We need a particular refinement: Let $\tilde{A}$ be the maximal algebraic semisimple Lie group with Lie algebra $A$, and let $\tilde{B'}$ and $\tilde{N'}$ be the contractible Lie groups with Lie algebras $B'$ and $N'$. If we can find a closed embedding of $(\tilde{A} \times \tilde{B'}) \ltimes \tilde{N'}$ in a matrix group, then it will restrict to a closed embedding of the Lie subgroup of the original $L$. In the proof of Ado's theorem that follows, the action of $N'$ is nilpotent, so the representation of $\tilde{N'}$ is closed and faithful. The Lie algebra $L'$ has a representation which is trivial on $B'$ and $N'$ and generates $\tilde{A}$. It has another representation which is trivial on $N'$ and $A$ and for which the action of $B'$ is nilpotent. If I have not made a mistake, the direct sum of these three representations is the desired representation of $L'$. 

for small values of $n$, and I got the following answers: $$\chi_{T_3}(q) = q(q-1)(q-2)$$ $$\chi_{T_4}(q) = q(q-1)(q-2)(q^3-9^2+29q-32)$$ $$\chi_{T_5}(q) = q(q-1)(q-2)(q-3)(q-4)(q^5-20q^4+170q^3-765q^2+1804q-1764).$$ Evaluating at $q=-1$, I get that there are 1, 6, 426, and 542880 generic types of metrics on 2, 3, 4, and 5 points. This sequence is not in the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, although possibly it should be. I think that you can obtain the total number of faces of a graphical arrangement $A(G)$ from the Tutte polynomial of $G$, and therefore the total number of types of metrics, but I did not do the calculation. 

Since $A_n$ has index two in $S_n$, every conjugacy class in $S_n$ either is a conjugacy class in $A_n$, or it splits into two conjugacy classes, or it misses $A_n$ if it is an odd permutation. Which happens when is a nice undergraduate exercise in group theory. (And you are a nice undergraduate. :-) ) The pair $A_n \subset S_n$ is typical for this question in finite group theory. You want the conjugacy classes of a finite simple group $G$, but the answer is a little simpler for a slightly larger group $G'$ that involves $G$. Another example is $\text{GL}(n,q)$. It involves the finite simple group $L(n,q)$, but the conjugacy classes are easier to describe in $\text{GL}(n,q)$ . They are described by their Jordan canonical form, with the twist that you may have to pass to a field extension of $\mathbb{F}_q$ to obtain the eigenvalues. The group $\text{GL}(n,q)$ is even more typical. It is a Chevallay group, which means a finite group analogue of a Lie group. All of the infinite sequences of finite simple groups other than $A_n$ and $C_p$ are Chevallay groups. You expect a canonical form that looks something like Jordan canonical form, although it can be rather more complicated. If $G$ is far from simple, i.e., if it has some interesting composition series, then one approach to its conjugacy classes is to chase them down from the conjugacy classes of its composition factors, together with the structure of the extensions. The answer doesn't have to be very tidy. I suppose that finite Coxeter groups give you some exceptions where you do get a tidier answer, just because they all resemble $S_n$ to varying degrees. But I don't know a crisp answer to all cases of this side question. The infinite sequences of finite Coxeter groups consist only of permutation groups, signed permutation groups, and dihedral groups. (And Cartesian products of these.) In the case of signed permutation groups, the answer looks just like $S_n$, except that cycles can also have odd or even total sign. There is also the type $D_n$ Coxeter group of signed permutation matrices with an even number of minus signs; the answer is just slightly different from all of the signed permutation matrices, which is type $B_n$. The crisp answer that I don't have would be a uniform description that includes the exceptional finite Coxeter groups, such as $E_8$. 

The question was a bit confusing because it was not clear what was meant as the definition of "the field extension $K(A)$". Nick says that "the smallest field containing" is the definition that he wanted, to make the question non-trivial. (But still routine, in my opinion.) Let's agree then that both (1) and (2) are answered by this summary: The smallest field that contains $K$ and $A$ is the set of rational expressions in $A$ with coefficients in $K$. An element $\beta$ of this field $M$ can only use finitely many elements of $A$, so $\beta$ lies in the subfield generated by them. Moreover, $\beta$ is algebraic by the lemma that the sum or product of two algebraic numbers is algebraic, and the reciprocal of an algebraic number is algebraic. I'm putting this summary here to hopefully take the question off of the unanswered stack. 

Let's take the strictest meaning of "similar evaluation", i.e., a product formula. The by the remark, the answer is probably no, because for instance the Stirling number s(9,3) = 118124 = 2*2*29531. A different meaning is whether there is some explicit combination of nested sums and products for a Schur evaluation at consecutive integers. I don't know the answer to that. Unlike for a straight product formula, it is difficult to look for such formulas or rule them out. The loosest possible meaning is whether there is an efficient way to evaluate sλ(1, 2,...,n). The answer to that is an easy yes, because you can use the Jacobi-Trudi determinant. 

It's not correct, at least not in any obvious way. It is easy to check that $B$ is not only a subring, but is also closed under quotients with pointwise remainders. In order to compute how $b(x)$ divides into $a(x)$, you can reduce to the case in which $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ are both polynomials. Then for starters there is a quotient and a remainder in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$: $$a(x) = q(x)b(x) + r(x).$$ Since $r(x)$ has lower degree than $b(x)$, its values are smaller than those of $b(x)$ when $x \gg 0$, so that part is okay; but it may be negative and $q(x)$ may not be integral. We can fix all that by rounding $q(x)$, which creates quasipolynomial behavior; and by changing it by 1 to make $r(x)$ positive. Also since $r(x)$ might have odd degree, there may be a different quasipolynomial solution when $x \ll 0$. The part that is either not true or far from obvious is why $B$ is Euclidean. My argument for that fell apart. However, I can still show that the Euclidean algorithm for finitely many elements $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ of $B$ terminates in a finite number of steps, and consequently that the Hermite normal form stabilizes in a finite number of steps with trichotomous quasipolynomial entries. The proof is a two-stage induction. The outer stage is the sum of the degrees of $a_1,\ldots,a_n$. If $\deg a_j < \deg a_k$ for some $j$ and $k$, then dividing $a_j$ into $a_k$ reduces the degree of $a_k$. On the other hand, suppose that the degrees are all equal. Then we can pass to a congruence class for the input $x$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ and apply a linear change of variables so that the leading coefficients are all integers. Then (in the inner induction) the Euclidean algorithm on these polynomials, for $x \gg 0$, amounts to the Euclidean algorithm on their coefficients. It is important, in this inner inductive part, to only change the variable $x$ once; don't worry if the lower-order coefficients are not integers. Eventually a $0$ is produced and the degrees once again decrease. Alas, this is a very informal writeup, but this time I think that it works. 

Gjergji's answer, while it's a correct answer and a good answer, and the question itself only address the very first mention of plane partitions in the literature, and not the almost-first mention that was clearly in the air at the time. Yes, MacMahon had in mind generating function theory. However, plane partitions are also a special case of semistandard tableaux, which are used to enumerate basis of irreducible representations of the general linear group. They are a variation of standard tableau, which enumerate bases of irreps of the symmetric group and were first described by Alfred Young a little bit before MacMahon's work. I would say that semistandard Young tableaux are more like a fellow traveler of plane partitions than an "application". MacMahon must have known something about it. (But conceivably some of these connections were only cleaned up decades later.) 

On the other hand, there is no particular classification of hyperbolic homology 3-spheres, much less hyperbolic links in homology 3-spheres, other than in general terms that they all come from hyperbolic groups. For instance, part of geometrization establishes that if a finite group acts freely on $S^3$, then it is equivalent to an action by isometries on a round $S^3$ and is a subgroup of $\mathrm{SO}(4)$. Before geometrization, Milnor and Lee established severe restrictions on how a finite group $G$ can act freely on any homology 3-sphere, with the case of $S^3$ particularly in mind. Either $G$ is a spherical group, or it is one other family that hasn't been excluded. For all we know, if $G$ acts freely on any homology 3-sphere, then it acts on $S^3$ too. I think that this is still an open problem, and geometrization by itself doesn't settle it. The working description homology 3-spheres for many purposes, in particular quantum topological invariants, is rather different. In practice, a homology 3-sphere is often given by surgery on a link in $S^3$ (or in some other homology 3-sphere) whose matrix has determinant 1. The big drawback of course is that the description is far from unique.
