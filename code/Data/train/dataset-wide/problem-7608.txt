As far as I know, low-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebras are classified (along with non-semisimple ones) up to dimension 60, with the first example of a semisimple Hopf algebra not coming from a finite group in dimension 8. How well are low-dimensional Hopf superalgebras, that is, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded Hopf algebras or Hopf algebra objects internal to $\mathbb{Z}_2-\operatorname{Vect}$ understood? Up to which dimension are they classified? Are there interesting semisimple ones? Has someone worked out the representations? I could find an article on the classification of finite dimensional ones up to dimension 4, but it didn't mention semisimplicity or higher dimensional semisimple examples. Generally, how well are low-dimensional semisimple braided Hopf algebras (internal to a braided category) understood? 

Edit: I used to believe that there is a possible generalisation stemming from work of Altschüler and Bruguières. (See Appendix C in Drinfeld, Gelaki, Nikshych, Ostrik - On braided fusion categories I). But that was based on a flawed assumption. (I didn't realise that $A$ must be in the trivial degree for it to work.) With the correct assumptions, the following can be said: Sliding lemma Like in braided spherical fusion categories, the sliding lemma is closely related to the killing lemma. Lemma Let $Y \in \mathcal{C}_g, A \in \mathcal{C}_e$. Up to coherences in the $G$-crossed fusion category, we have: $$\Delta_{A,\Omega_h} \otimes 1_Y = c_{Y,A} \circ (\epsilon_Y \otimes \Delta_{A,\Omega_{hg^{-1}}}) \circ c_{A,Y}$$ In words, we can slide the $Y$-strand over the $\Omega_h$-encircling so that it links with the $A$-strand. If you draw a picture, it will become clear. Killing lemma Recall that the trivial degree $\mathcal{C}_e$ is a braided spherical fusion category, so the classical killing lemma applies to $\Delta_{A,\Omega_e}$. Lemma Let $A \in \mathcal{C}_e$ be a simple object. Then: $$\Delta_{A,\Omega_h}\colon A \to {}^hA$$ is nonzero, and thus an isomorphism, iff $A$ is in the symmetric centre of $\mathcal{C}_e$. (Note that this is a trivial statement if $\mathcal{C}_h \simeq 0$.) Proof By the previous comment, assume that $\mathcal{C}_h \not\simeq 0$. Then the statement is equivalent to the statement with $- \otimes 1_{\Omega_{h^{-1}}}$ applied to it (recall that $\mathcal{C}_h \not\simeq 0 \implies \Omega_h \neq 0 \implies \Omega_{h^{-1}} \cong \Omega_h^* \neq 0)$. By the sliding lemma, the left hand side is then equal to $c_{\Omega_{h^{-1}}, A} \circ (\epsilon_{\Omega_{h^{-1}}} \otimes \Delta_{A,\Omega_e}) \circ c_{A, \Omega_{h^{-1}}}$. Apply the killing lemma for $\Delta_{A,\Omega_e}$, yielding: $$\Delta_{A,\Omega_h} \otimes 1_{\Omega_{h^{-1}}} = \left\{ \begin{matrix} d(\Omega_e) \cdot \gamma_{A,\Omega_{h^{-1}}} && \qquad A \text{ is in the symmetric centre of } \mathcal{C}_e \\ 0 && \qquad \text{otherwise} \end{matrix}\right.$$ Observation This seems to prove that if all degrees of $\mathcal{C}$ are nonzero, all objects in the symmetric centre of $\mathcal{C}_e$ are automatically equivariant, i.e. possess a family of isomorphisms $A \cong {}^gA, \forall g \in G$. Surely, that result must have been known before? 

It is an open problem whether there exist smooth manifolds homeomorphic, but not diffeomorphic to the standard $S^4$. The same is true for the 4-torus and several other manifolds. Handle decompositions of 4-manifolds can be written down as Kirby diagrams: Dotted circles represent 1-handles, undotted, numbered links represent 2-handles. Is there a reference that lists candidate exotic manifolds, expressed in Kirby diagrams? Edit: I am mainly interested in diagrams for manifolds that are not known, but conjectured to be exotic. 

tetrapharmakon's hint is excellent. The article he refers to (and the earlier article $URL$ by some of the same authors) define "quasi-triangular Hopf monads" that are an abstraction of quasi-triangular Hopf algebras. For these monads, the Eilenberg-Moore category is indeed braided. (I didn't find that paper probably because they never mention "Eilenberg-Moore category" but only refer to "the category of $T$-modules".) Even better, my example $A \otimes -$ shows up there. This monad is quasi-triangular as a monad if $A$ is quasi-triangular as a Hopf algebra (a quantum group). They also define similar conditions for semisimplicity, sovereign structures, ribbon structures. In that article, another article by Moerdijk is mentioned ($URL$ and it seems that he established that comonoidal monads (he calls them "Hopf monads", Alain Bruguières calls them "bimonads") have a monoidal Eilenberg-Moore category. 

There is a nice theorem that for every simply connected, closed, smooth, oriented manifold $M$, we have for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$: $$M \# \left(\mathop{\#}^m \left(\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2} \right) \right) \cong \left(\mathop{\#}^{m+b^+_2(M)} \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2 \right) \# \left(\mathop{\#}^{m+b^-_2(M)} \overline{\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2} \right)$$ The $b^\pm_2(M)$ are the positive and negative eigenvalues of the intersection form. This has far-reaching consequences, for example any 4-manifold invariant that is multiplicative under direct sum $\#$ will only measure the intersection form on simply connected manifolds. Is there a similar statement for non-simply-connected 4-manifolds? What is the closest we can get? 

In Walker and Wang's article about (3+1)-TQFTs from premodular categories, they say on page 14 that you can take a quotient of a premodular category $\mathcal{C}$ by its symmetric fusion subcategory $\mathcal{S_C}$ consisting of transparent objects. That quotient is promised to be modular. I'm willing to believe this and I'd like to use it, but I can't find a mathematical reference for it, nor have I managed to work it out in all detail. Is this a known fact? Is it treated somewhere? My attempt of making sense of it, is the following: 

Mathematical physicists in solid state physics and topological insulators talk a lot about Walker-Wang models, which are a family of Hamiltonians defined on a 3d lattice. Unfortunately, the original paper is lacking a lot of mathematical details which were promised to appear in a later article, but (to my knowledge) never did. The model looks a lot like the 20 years older Crane-Yetter model, in that it needs a ribbon fusion category (also called "premodular, in that it doesn't need to be modular) as labelling data. An article treating (amongst many other things) the ground state degeneracy of Walker-Wang models suggests that for modular categories, the ground state is in fact nondegenerate for all spatial topologies, that is, the topological state space is 1-dimensional. This is the same behaviour as in Crane-Yetter for modular categories, where $CY(N) = n^{\sigma(N)} \implies CY(S^1 \times M) = 1$ also suggests 1-dimensional state spaces (the general case is, I think, unknown). The article briefly mentions the Crane-Yetter model for modular categories, but I fail to find a definitive statement like "Walker-Wang and Crane-Yetter are the same TQFT" or "they're different" in the article or elsewhere. Are they the same (as Turaev-Viro and Levin-Wen seem to be related as well) and Walker-Wang is just the hamiltonian formulation? 

Tannaka duality is essentially applying Yoneda twice. So a special case of Tannaka duality that doesn't require the Yoneda lemma would be Pontryagin duality. 

It is known that the 4-sphere does not have a symplectic structure. However, it does admit Poisson structures, for example the zero Poisson structure, which is quite boring. Does it have other, more interesting Poisson structures? For example, are there Poisson structures on $\operatorname{Spin}(5)$ (or $SO(5)$) such that $SO(4)$ is a Poisson subgroup, such that $S^4$ is a Poisson homogeneous space? edit: A Poisson homogeneous space $G/H$ is a quotient space of a Poisson Lie group $G$ by a Poisson Lie subgroup $H$. In this situation, $G/H$ inherits a Poisson bracket from $G$ by projection. I do not explicitly look for constant rank Poisson structure, as the below answer suggests. A definition is given for example in Chari & Pressley, "Quantum Groups", section 1.2.B. 

Maybe I'm ultimately after something like cohesive $\infty$-topoi, but the theory seem so abstract that I fail to understand whether simple things like handle decompositions work there. 

Introduction Axiomatic TQFTs An axiomatic $n$-dimensional TQFT is a symmetric monoidal functor $\mathcal{Z}\colon \operatorname{Bord}_n \to \operatorname{Hilb}$ from $n$-dimensional oriented bordisms to Hilbert spaces (other targets are certainly possible, but for the purposes of this question, we will stay with Hilbert spaces). It is unitary if $\mathcal{Z}$ is a unitary, or $\dagger$-functor. Written out, this means: Let $\Sigma\colon M_1 \to M_2$ be an (oriented) bordism. The orientation reversed bordism goes in the other direction, i.e. $\overline{\Sigma}\colon M_2 \to M_1$. The TQFT must then satisfy $\mathcal{Z}(\overline{\Sigma}) = \mathcal{Z}(\Sigma)^\dagger$, where $\dagger$ is the adjoint of maps of Hilbert spaces. Hamiltonian TQFTs An $(n+1)$-dimensional Hamiltonian TQFT is a local Hamiltonian lattice quantum system on an $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, that has a gapped ground state which is invariant under certain local perturbations. It is unitary in the sense that the Hamiltonian $H$ is self-adjoint, and thus the time evolution is unitary. The correspondence to axiomatic TQFTs lies in the lowest eigenspace. Any $n$-manifold has a (possibly degenerate) ground state, and it corresponds to the Hilbert space assigned to that manifold by an $(n+1)$-dimensional axiomatic TQFT. Question My question is now, how these two notions of unitarity fit together. Are they equivalent, or is one stronger? Observations Observation 1: Cylinders As a first observation, it's clear that the two notions of unitarity agree when we just consider cylinders, i.e. bordisms of the form $I \times M$. This is the typical situation for Hamiltonian TQFTs. (I'm not sure how the mapping class group is typically represented on Hamiltonian TQFTs, though.) Observation 2: Topology changes Most of the interesting information about axiomatic TQFTs is found in the way they behave on non-cylinder bordisms. If the boundaries to such a bordism are assigned Hilbert spaces of different dimensions, the bordism can never give rise to a unitary map of Hilbert spaces, though! From the Hamiltonian perspective, it's obvious that it can't. When topology changes, the Hamiltonian changes (even if the lattice stays the same), and thus the lowest eigenspace. Take the orthogonal decomposition of the physical Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ into eigenspaces: $$\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_0 \oplus \mathcal{H}_1 \oplus \cdots$$ $$1_{\mathcal{H}} = \pi_0 + \pi_1 + \cdots$$ $$\pi_k\pi_{k'} = 1_{\mathcal{H}_k} \delta_{kk'}$$ The projection $\pi_0$ onto the lowest eigenspace of the new Hamiltonian should correspond to $\mathcal{Z}(\Sigma)$, where $\Sigma$ is the non-cylinder bordism. But why should this map be unitary in the axiomatic-TQFT-sense? Question Assume we are given an axiomatic TQFT that can be modelled by a local Hamiltonian lattice system. (The Hamiltonian is of course assumed to be self-adjoint.) Is the axiomatic TQFT then automatically unitary in the sense of a unitary functor? What are the topology changing maps? 

To really find a manifold from a Poincaré complex, one needs to study $L$-groups, which are a whole huge subject in itself. (See e.g. this introduction by Wolfgang Lück or this book by Andrew Ranicki, or Wall's "Surgery on compact manifolds".) 

I've been thinking about this since longer already and just realised a really easy example. I was a bit of a blockhead in thinking that for any inclusion functor $F$, we must have that $F\Omega_\mathcal{C}$ is a subobject of $\Omega_\mathcal{D}$, which is not true. Consider the category of $U_qSU(2)$-tilting modules modulo the negligible ones at a root of unity. Its simple objects are labelled by spins $j \in \left\{0, \frac{1}{2}, 1,\ldots{}, r\right\}$. Consider the subcategory spanned by the objects $\left\{0, \frac{1}{2} \oplus \frac{1}{2}, 1 \oplus 1,\ldots{}, r \oplus r\right\}$. It's closed under the monoidal product, so we have a monoidal subcategory. Now the sum of all simple objects in the subcategory clearly contains all simple objects of the whole category, but with different multiplicities, the monoidal identity only once and the rest twice. 

Fact: $\mathcal{Z}_\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{M}_1 \boxtimes_\mathcal{C} \mathcal{M}_2) \simeq \mathcal{Z}_\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{M}_1) \boxtimes_{\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})} \mathcal{Z}_\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{M}_2)$ Proof: See e.g. Fusion categories and homotopy theory (Pavel Etingof, Dmitri Nikshych, Victor Ostrik), Proposition 3.11. Question: Is there a generalisation of this formula? There are at least two other cases where a similar formula might be expected: 

A twist is an automorphism $\theta$ of the identity functor of a monoidal category with braiding $c$, such that $\theta_{X \otimes Y} = c_{Y,X} c_{X,Y} (\theta_X \otimes \theta_Y)$. A braided monoidal category with twist is called balanced monoidal (not to be confused with a different notion of balanced). It is known that modular categories are ribbon fusion, and thus have a twist. So all Drinfeld centers of fusion categories are balanced monoidal. Furthermore, Drinfeld centers of pivotal categories are pivotal again (see Figure 2 in this article. Pivotal structures and braidings give a balanced structure again. (Although I wouldn't know or care for now if they're ribbon.) Are Drinfeld centers always balanced monoidal? If not, under which conditions are they balanced monoidal? If yes, how is the twist constructed? Note that Drinfeld centers of monoidal categories without duals for every object may not have all duals either, and therefore needn't be pivotal. They can nevertheless be balanced monoidal. For example, take the category of all (complex) vector spaces. Infinite dimensional vector spaces don't have dual objects, so this category does not allow a pivotal structure. I'm strongly suspecting that its Drinfeld center is vector spaces again (although I don't know a rigorous proof, since it's not fusion), which has a trivial twist. Edit: Drinfeld centers of rigid categories are always rigid (i.e. have all duals). Now since in a rigid braided category, twists are equivalent to pivotal structures. So a non-pivotal rigid category might potentially have a non-balanced Drinfeld center (although this is not certain, it might still "accidentally" have a balance if all nonpivotal objects for some reason don't have a half-braiding). I'm quite sure there are non-pivotal rigid categories (by an open conjecture, they'd need to be non-fusion, though) -- although I can't think of any right now -- so here is a place to look for counterexamples. 

Simplicial sets, CW complexes Simplicial sets can be described completely algebraically, by specifying a family of sets, and maps between them satisfying certain relations. This description can be directly derived from the nice abstract definition as presheaves over, or free cocompletion of, the simplex category. The standard definition CW-complexes is more homotopy-theoretic in nature at first glance, but if you build one up inductively, you can usually describe in a completely syntactic way which cells you attach to which ones. And indeed, there is a big computational topology machinery behind them. Furthermore, higher inductive types try to give (amongst many other things) a syntactical theory to CW-complexes, and use them for homotopy type theory. Handle decompositions I'm looking for something like this in the realm of handle decompositions. One often hears statements like "Handle decompositions are like CW-decompositions, but for manifolds", and in a lot of situations (e.g. calculating homotopy and (co)homology groups), this is an apt comparison. But the attaching maps of handles contain considerably more information than cell attachments in CW-complexes, they are usually some kind of generalised knots. Sometimes it is clear how to "discretise" this information, or present it syntactically (e.g. in 2 dimensions), but in general, I don't understand how this could be done. Special case: Kirby diagrams In 4 dimensions, I can imagine a procedure how to describe Kirby diagrams syntactically (by enumerating 1-handles and describing the 2-handle links as braid words), and define the handle cancellations and slides algorithmically. But this feels a bit ad-hoc, and I don't know how it generalises. Question Is there work describing handle decompositions in a detailed manner as a computational model? In particular, I'm looking not just for ad-hoc implementations to do some computations (I know of software to study PL isomorphism and such things in 3d), but rather a clean, general, abstract theory, ideally formally verified (as far as possible). Notes Possibly related: Simplicial complexes are to PL structures of manifolds as simplicial sets are to what?
