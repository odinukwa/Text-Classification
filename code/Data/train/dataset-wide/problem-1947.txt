The majority of the very well preserved ammonites are found in the limestone and can be found inside limestone nodules or lying loose on the beach. This rock is very hard and will require a good geological hammer and maybe a chisel to split. This is often easiest if you find a nodule with lines of weakness or cracks that you can split it along. It is also a good idea to look for signs that the rock contains a fossil before trying to break it, part of a fossil may be visible on the surface of the rock. You can identify the limestone by it's lighter grey colour and hardness, it should be quite hard to break without a hammer. 

This looks like a polymict (composed of fragments from different rock types) conglomerate, that has been polished. This rock is composed of many well rounded fragments of other rocks that have been eroded, transported and deposited in a new location. These fragments have then then undergone diagenesis (burial and compaction) to form the rock in the photograph. It is hard to tell for all the fragments from the photos but the fragments appear to be made from mostly metamorphic and some igneous rocks, such as gneiss and granite. 

This looks like a red sandstone, with the red colour coming from iron oxides in the matrix (similar process to rust). The layers represent periods of sedimentation and have different colours due to slightly differing composition and environment of deposition. 

Short answer: Oxygen atoms (not oxygen molecules) cause the dominant red and green auroral emissions at high altitudes. Although there is more atomic $\ce{O}$ at higher altitudes than nitrogen, the key to understand the different colours is the excitation energy. Auroral particles with higher energies penetrate deeper down into the atmosphere causing higher energetic emissions at lower altitudes. The excitation leading to the red $\ce{O}$ emission higher up needs less energy than the green $\ce{O}$ emission further down. Even more so, the purple $\ce{N2+}$ emission at the very bottom can only be excited by very energetic particles. Some more details: You are right to note that molecular oxygen ($\ce{O2}$) is heavier than molecular nitrogen ($\ce{N2}$). Hence, at altitudes above the turbopause at around 105 km, where turbulent mixing ceases to exist because the atmosphere gets too thin, there is relatively more $\ce{N2}$ than $\ce{O2}$ and the ratio between the two increases with altitude. However, there is also strong photodissociation of molecular $\ce{O2}$ to atomic $\ce{O}$. As the recombination of two $\ce{O}$ atoms is slow at high altitudes and the atoms are light, their concentration increases with altitude. Above about 200 km atomic $\ce{O}$ becomes more abundant than $\ce{N2}$. As stated before, auroral particles with higher energies deposit more of their energy at lower altitudes where they encounter more collisions with the air. Lower energetic particles don't get that far. The dominant red and green emissions of the aurora are basic excitions of the $\ce{O}$ atom. The red emission at around 630 nm peaks at above 200 km. altitude. It's caused by the excited state $\ce{O}^1D$ with an energy of $\sim5.6$ eV. The green emission at around 558 nm peaks at around 110 km, considerably lower than the red emission. The corresponding state $\ce{O}^1S$ has a higher excitation energy of around $10$ eV. Peaking even lower at around 90 km altitude, the violet $\ce{N2+} $ emission has a wavelength around 428 nm and an excitation energy of around $100$ eV. The combination of the concentrations of the chemical species and, most importantly, the altitude dependent energy deposition result in the altitude dependence of the colours of the aurora. The further to the violet the light, the higher its energy per photon. Note that these discussions about what colour is caused by what atom or molecule at what altitude are somewhat simplified. This all only refers to the dominant emission at a certain peak altitude which may overpower fainter colours. To a certain degree, most colours will be emitted from most altitudes, but not be visible to the ground observer. And there are many more colours emitted than the ones discussed. 

[I am going to preface this by saying that I am not in one camp or the other in this discussion, as I think there are pros and cons to each side] This links to the "Gaia Theory" proposed by James Lovelock, wherein the Earth is considered a self regulating organism. In this hypothesis, Earth is an organism in that it will try to maintain certain conditions. These conditions include temperature (within a range suitable for life as we currently understand it), oxygen content of the atmosphere, water availability etc. This does not mean that the ball of rock we are flying through space on is a living organism as we understand it, but rather that the various spheres of life (These are usually the biosphere (ecosystems), the atmosphere, the cryosphere (the poles, and other ice-bound areas), the hydrosphere(oceans), and the pedosphere(soil)) interact with each other in such a way that optimal conditions are maintained. Whilst the theory as a whole is not used today, it is recognised that feedbacks and interactions between different spheres occur, and are an important part of understanding Earth systems, and is studied in an area of science known as Earth System Science One of the initial arguments for this theory was that our atmosphere is not in chemical equilibrium, and that there must therefore be processes active to maintain oxygen levels at a steady state outside of equilibrium. This is a difficult topic, as it is important to stress that the Gaia hypothesis does not state the Earth is some sentient being consciously doing anything, rather that a complex set of interactions, abiotic and biotic, combine to maintain and regulate the planets temperature and atmospheric composition. An example of this regulation is chemical weathering, whereby carbon dioxide in the atmosphere falls in rain, and reacts with rocks, to form calcium bicarbonate, removing carbon from the short term carbon cycles. The more surface rocks there are which are capable of this reaction, the more CO2 is removed from the atmosphere. There is a hypothesis which says that at least once, the Earth has been covered largely in ice and snow, and this reaction (known as carbonation) is suspected to have played a part in the recovery of Earth. The hypothesis (Snowball Earth) goes like this: The Earth became cooler, whether due to Milankovich cycles, volcanic activity, or solar output changes. As this happened, ice began to form at the poles, changing the albedo, and reflecting more radiation back to space, this caused local cooling, and allowed for the growth of the ice sheets. As they spread, the albedo became higher on a larger scale, and the ice sheets eventually covered the two hemispheres, with a band of open ocean at the equator. The earth was now very cold, but not completely empty of life, or without volcanic activity. Life continued to respire CO2, and volcanoes continued releasing CO2. Without rocks to remove it from rain, or ocean to absorb it, Carbon dioxide began to build up in the atmosphere. As it built up (over millions of years), it began to warm the planet, which in turn began to melt the snow. As the snow and ice began to retreat to the poles, rocks, and open ocean were again available to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and more photosynthetic organisms were able to survive, and remove more CO2 through photosynthesis. This lead to a stabilisation of the planets systems again, although, it may have gone too far, and swung back to a glacial period (although not a frozen earth), then moving back to a warm period before stabilising due to the tectonic movement of the continents northwards The break-up of Rodinia, birth of Gondwana, true polar wander and the snowball Earth I hope this long ramble illustrates how there are a number of complex systems which all interact with each other to maintain conditions. Whether we consider the sum of these systems an organism is an ongoing discussion, but, all organisms have the ability to regulate via various systems, and each of these systems has the potential to lead to chaotic positive feedbacks, and spiral out of control, although negative feedbacks usually keep everything running as normal. I have linked the Gaia theory webpage, and if you search for Daisyworld model, you will find a model which you can run to simulate feedbacks It is up to you whether you think this collection of feedback systems is an organism, and this debate will likely run for decades more.
