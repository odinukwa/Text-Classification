It's known, from Ravenel's green book, as well as other sources, that we build formal group laws over a ring from n-buds, where an n-bud is essentially a truncated formal group law (sometimes called a formal group law n-chunk). It is also known that a map of ring spectra $X(n)\to E$ where $X(n)$ is the Thom spectrum associated to the map $\Omega SU(n)\to \Omega SU\simeq BU$, determines an n-bud over $E_\ast$. These spectra are also important in the proof of the celebrated Nilpotence Theorem of chromatic homotopy theory. My question is a rather general one, but begins with wondering why we use $\Omega SU(n)$ rather than $BU(n)$? How different is the former filtration of $BU$ from the latter? Moreover, if we take the Thom spectrum of the inclusion $BU(n)\to BU$, do we still get the $X(n)$? If so, why do Devinatz, Hopkins and Smith use $\Omega SU(n)$ at all? I have a number of questions surrounding this issue, but I guess that's probably enough for now. Thanks as usual! -Jon 

Here's a simple geometric example for a homotopy pushout. This is stolen from the Dwyer-Spalinski paper on model categories. We first look at the following diagram: pt <-- S^1 --> pt. The pushout of this diamgram is just a point. Now look at D^2 <-- S^1 --> D^2 where the maps are the inclusion at the boundary. The pushout of this diagram is S^2. What one notices is that the point and D^2 have the same homotopy type, but the pushout of the two diagrams have different homotopy types! So ordinary pushouts don't go well with homotopy theory. The right thing to do is to always replace the maps by cofibrations before computing pushouts. This is precisely what the homotopy pushout does. Replacing maps by cofibrations before computing pushouts is not just philosophy but actually a theorem. If you want to do things correctly you should put a model category strutcure on the diagram category such that the constant functor preserves fibrations and trivial fibrations and then take the derived colimit functor. Since you have a model category structure on the diagram category you replace diagrams cofibrantly! If you work out all the details you get replacing a diagram means exactly to replace the maps by cofibrations before taking the pushout. 

It is proven by Thom that for a finite cw-complex $X$, its $MU$-homology, which, in honor of the authors I'm currently reading, I'll denote by $\Omega_\ast^U(X)$, is a coherent module over $\Omega_\ast^U$ if $\Omega_\ast^U(X)$ has projective dimension 0 or 1 over $\Omega_\ast^U$. It is stated that in a series of lecture notes by Larry Smith that this result can probably be extended to other complexes (and spectra...). However, these lecture notes are from 1970. Does anyone know if this result has been fully generalized? I guess I mean, is it known precisely how far this result can be extended? Thanks! 

If there is a short answer to this question and someone can write it here that'd be wonderful, but if it's longer, I'm also perfectly happy with a reference. My question is regarding accessing data in non-trivial cohomological degree of a cosimplicial space. Ultimately, for me, this comes down to questions about looping and delooping cosimplicial spaces and/or quasicategories. 1) Given a cosimplicial quasicategory $C^\bullet$, can I take the homotopy pullback of $\ast\to C^\bullet\leftarrow \ast$ (with some chosen base point in $C^\bullet$), to obtain a notion of $\Omega C^\bullet$? 2) If so, can I then compute what should correspond to data in cohomological degree 1, and hence what would be in $\pi_{-1}Tot(\Omega C^\bullet)$ (using e.g. a Bousfield Kan sort of spectral sequence $\pi^s\pi_t\Rightarrow\pi_{t-s})$, of the connected component containing the base point, by somehow "delooping" $\Omega C^\bullet$ and attempting to compute $\pi_0Tot(B\Omega C^\bullet)$? Of course, without stability, it doesn't really make sense to talk about $\pi_{-1}$, that's just where this "information would live" if it did. My main issue is what the construction of "delooping" should be in the situation of a 1-fold looped cosimplicial quasicategory? Also, does the category of cosimplicial quasicategories admit an initial object? The motivation for this question comes from homotopical descent theory. Thanks, as usual! 

In the symplectic topology view on Gromov-Witten-Invariants some authors use what they call a Kuranishi structure on the moduli of stable maps. These were introduced by Fukaya and Ono and are also used in their big book on Fukaya categories.They are also used a lot in recent papers by Joyce. The key feature of the Kuranishi structure is that there locally exists a homeomorphism or a diffeomorphism, depending on whether you follow Fukaya or Joyce, to a zero set of a section of the "obstruction bundle". On the algebraic geometry side there also is something involving the term obstruction, namely the perfect obstruction theory on the moduli space of maps. This is a morphism [E-1 -> E0] -> LX, where L is the cotangent complex. Here's my question: To what does the obstruction bundle on the symplectic topology side correspond on the algebraic side? There are three candidates I can think of: 

Suppose given a cosimplicial ring $R^\bullet$ and a cosimplicial module $M^\bullet$ (i.e. a cosimplicial Abelian group such that $M^n$ is an $R^n$-(left/right/bi)module). I have seen it said that $M^\bullet$ is co-cartesian over $R^\bullet$ if it is true that for every map $[n]\to[m]\in \Delta$, we have that the maps $M^n\to M^m$ and $R^n\to R^m$ induce an isomorphism $M^n\otimes_{R^n} R^m\cong M^m$. On the other hand, suppose I've got a hypercover of simplicial presheaves (on some site, or maybe just simplicial sets, whatever) $Y_\bullet\to X_\bullet$. Then according to the nlab, being a hypercover of height zero means that means that the map $Y_n\to (\mathbf{cosk}_{n-1}Y_\bullet)_n\times_{(\mathbf{cosk}_{n-1}X)_n}X_n$ is an isomorphism. So, I might be wrong here, but can this latter statement be made in terms of the former? That is, can we make some kind of statement about $Spec(-)$ of a map of cosimplicial rings such that one is co-cartesian over the other along the given cosimpicial map, giving us a hypercover of height zero in simplicial schemes? I don't really have a good intuition for what I should think of the coskeleton as, which I think is part of why I'm having a hard time making sure of this. Thanks! 

Its only a reference, and I don't feel competent to give a summary. I think the answer to question 1 can be found in $URL$ . At least it mentions the analogy to the Duflo isomorphism, which is similiar to what you are asking about. It also takes a map of vector spaces, does some magic and it ends up being a map of algebras. 

I'm absolutely new to this stuff I'm asking about, so I hope this is not nonsense. If X is a smooth scheme over a perfect field k, I can study its motivic cohomology in the sense of Voevodsky and Morel. More precisely, to $\mathbb{Z}$ there is associated an Eilenberg-MacLane T-Spectrum. I'll write $H^{p,q}(X,\mathbb{Z})$ for the motivic cohomology of $X$ defined by Hom into this Spectrum. One fact for smooth $X$ now is that $$ H^{2p,p}(X,\mathbb{Z}) = CH^p(X). $$ Now I've got two questions: 1) Can I feed something singular into this Voevodsky-Morel machine? 2)If the answer to 1 is yes, are there some maps from $ H^{2p,p}(X,\mathbb{Z})$ to $CH^p(X)$? Maybe defined by some spectral sequence? I'm really interested just in some maps, no isomorphisms. 

Suppose given a well-generated triangulated category with a compatible symmetric monoidal structure, $\mathcal{T}$ (in the sense of Neeman). Is it clear that the image of a localization functor will also be well-generated? If not in true in general, is it easy to prove with respect to the $X$-acyclics (i.e. objects which tensor with $X$ to zero) for some element $X$? The main thing I'm worried about I suppose (though the second axiom for well-generated-ness is not obvious to me either) is the requirement for the generators to be $\alpha$-small for some cardinal $\alpha$. For instance, the $MU$-localization of the stable homotopy category has no small objects. But perhaps they are $\alpha$-small for some $\alpha$? My understanding of such issues is still somewhat superficial. 

I went ahead and made this a reference request, because I imagine it could a rather significant answer. 

First some indication that it really is a difficult problem: Both Vistoli and Gillet in their classics on intersection theory on stacks remark that their should be a Riemann-Roch theorem for proper representable morphisms, but that they are not able to prove it. I think thats more than enough evidence. The two existing proofs by Toen and Joshua both involve using not the naive Chow ring, but a modified version. This makes both proofs quite heavy on K-Theory, and I don't really get them. So what makes the proof using the naive Chow-Ring so difficult? If I remember correctly from reading Fulton-Langs "Riemann-Roch Algebra", the basic technique is to factor a morphism as a regular imedding followed by a projection. The cases of a regular imbeddings and projections are treated by a hands-on methods. Here are some reasons I can think of why this might not work for stacks: 

Given a monoidal model category $(M,\otimes, 1)$, and a monoid therein $A$, one can take the slice model category $M_{/A}$. This category has a natural monoidal structure induced by taking fibered products over $A$. However, it should admit another monoidal structure coming from the product on $A$. In particular, given two maps $X\to A$ and $Y\to A$, there should be an object $Y\otimes X\to A\otimes A\to A$. Moreover, it seems, that monoid objects in $M_{/A}$ should be precisely the monoid morphisms $A'\to A$ for $A'$ another monoid. Is this monoidal structure described anywhere? How does it interact with the slice-category model structure? The particular case I'm thinking of is the case when $M=sSet$ with the Quillen model structure, and $A$ is a strict monoid with respect to Cartesian product, but I'd be pretty happy with this kind of statement for any nice model category of topological spaces. 

There's a problem with identifying the Chow-Ring of a stack with the K-Group equipped with the gamma-filtration. 

If X is an algebraic scheme, K_0(X) has a filtration by taking the subgroups generated by coherent sheaves whose support as at most dimension k. The associated graded groups are the quotients, and there exists a natural map from the k-th Chow group A_k(X) to the k-th graded part Gr_k K_0(X), just by mapping [V] to [O_V]. This is example 15.1.5 in Fulton's book. This even becomes an isomorphism after tensoring with Q! That's Corollary 18.3.2 in Fulton's book. All of the definitions surely make sense for DM-stacks. We've got Chow-groups and K_0 can be graded in the same way. I'm not sure whether the natural map above actually passes to rational equivalence, but I'll just assume this to be true. Here's the question: Is the map still an isomorphism?
