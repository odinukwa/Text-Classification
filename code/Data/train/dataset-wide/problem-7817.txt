If there are no restrictions on $S$, one can apply the following construction. Let $$Q(x)=S(x)\prod_{j=1}^r(x-\lambda_j)^2\prod_{j=r+1}^m(x-\lambda_j).$$ We want to construct $S$. Consider first the case when $R$ does not change sign on the real line. Suppose it is positive. Then choose $S$ so that a) All double zeros of $Q$ are maxima. This is achieved by inserting zeros of $S$ at properly chosen places. b) That the minima of $Q$ on each interval between its zeros are less (more negative) than $-\max R$ (the maximum of $R$ is taken over some big interval that contains all zeros of $Q$). This can be achieved just by multiplying $S$ on a sufficiently large constant. Now when you graph $-R$ and $Q$ on the same picture, you see that the graphs intersect as many times as the degree of $Q$ is. So $R+Q$ has all zeros real. You also make them simple, by another multiplication of $Q$ on a constant. The general case is similar. Consider the real zeros of $R$, say $x_1,...,x_k$. On the intervals $(x_k,x_{k+1})$ where $R(x)>0$, you want all double zeros of $Q$ to be maxima. On the intervals $(x_k,x_{k+1})$ where $R(x)<0$, you want all double zeros of $Q$ to be minima. This is achieved by placing the zeros of $S$ at appropriate places. Each new zero of $S$ switches the sign of $Q$ at this place. Now after you achieved this (that all double roots of $Q$ are maxima where $R$ is positive, and minima where it is negative), it only remains to multiply $Q$ by a very large positive constant, to make sure that the graphs of $-R$ and $Q$ intersect as many times as needed. Finally, by slightly perturbing the constant multiple in $S$, you achieve that all these real roots are simple. But I don't now how useful this polynomial can be, as its degree can be larger than the number of interpolation nodes. You can try to minimize the degree of $S$, the answer will depend on the relative position of the double roots $\lambda_j$ among all $\lambda_j$. But roughly speaking the degree of $Q$ constructed with this method, can be about twice as large as that of $R$. 

I can propose an algorithm for doing this for ``Belyi curves'', the curves whose coefficients are algebraic numbers. According to Belyi's theorem, such a curve of genus $g$ is defined by a combinatorial triangulation of an abstract genus $g$ surface. And this triangulation can be explicitly computed (in principle). Then if you have a covering, it is defined by another triangulation which can be easily constructed from the first one. And passing from a triangulation back to the equation is a procedure which requires only solving algebraic equations. We obtain that a finite covering of a Belyi curve is a Belyi curve again, and coefficients can be (in principle) computed. Of course this is a theoretical possibility, the explicit algorithm can be hard. Belyi curves are dense in the space of all curves of given genus. When you slightly vary your curve, you may slightly vary the covering. This shows that in principle there are formulas which express the coefficients of the covering curve in terms of the coefficients of the original one in the general case. 

This is correct (if $f$ is real, of course). Use the Green formula to transform the LHS: $$\int_\Omega|\nabla u|^2dxdy=R\int_0^{2\pi}uu_rd\theta,$$ where $R$ is the radius of the disc. Now expand $$u(r,\theta)=\sum_{-\infty}^\infty r^{|n|}c_ne^{in\theta},$$ where $c_n=\overline{c_{-n}}$, because $f$ is real. Now compute, using orthogonality: $$R\int_0^{2\pi}uu_rd\theta=2\pi\sum_{-\infty}^\infty|n|R^{2n}|c_n|^2,$$ and $$\int_0^{2\pi}u_\theta^2d\theta=2\pi\sum_{-\infty}^\infty n^2R^{2n}|c_n|^2.$$ We conclude that LHS$\leq$RHS, with equality only if $c_n=0$ for $|n|\geq 2$. 

Possible or not, this should be a goal:-) Let me put it slightly differently: you should understand every result that you use. First of all, a theorem that you use can be wrong. So whenever you rely your proof on a theorem that you did not check, you take a risk. There are many known cases when a result was "accepted" by a mathematical community, and then turned to be either wrong or unproved. If your proof relies on a theorem that you do not understand this really means that you don't fully understand your own proof. In the cases like finite simple group classification, you should clearly state in your publication that your proof depends on it. And in general, if you write a proof which relies on the theorem that you do not fully understand, you should make as clear as possible, where exactly and how you use this theorem. EDIT. When you cite a result you endorse it. You are essentially saying that on your opinion it is correct. Now suppose you are simply asked to endorse some result: just to tell your opinion, whether it is correct or not. Would you endorse it publicly in print, without checking the proof ? On my opinion, citing a result in your paper without any comment is the same. 

The answer to all these questions is "no". Think of $S$ as an averaging operator. Initial temperature can be mostly positive on most of $\Omega$ but somewhere slightly negative. After some time $t_1$ it will be positive everywhere. This answers the first question. Second one is similar. 

MR1451624 Hummel, Christoph, Gromov's compactness theorem for pseudo-holomorphic curves. Progress in Mathematics, 151. BirkhÃ¤user Verlag, Basel, 1997. 

The simplest infinitely differentiable function with compact support is $f(x)=\exp\left(-1/x(1-x)\right), \; 0<x<1$. This is the first example given in textbooks. Its Fourier transform is $$F(z)=\int_0^1e^{-izx}f(x)dx.$$ Is this an "explicit" formula? In not, why is the infinite product in Terence Tao's answer "explicit"? (I think the word "explicit" (and "analytic expression", which some people think is synonimous) are very much abused on this site. These words always require a further explanation of their meaning). Back to $C^\infty$ functions with compact support. The inverse Fourier transform of $\mathrm{sinc}$ is the characteristic function of an interval. Thus the example in Tao's answer is an infinite convolution of these characteristic functions. (Is this explicit or not?) H/"ormander, Analysis of partial differential operators, vol. I, Chap I, sect 1.3 discusses at great length how to construct $C^\infty$ functions with compact support by taking infinite convolutions of characteristic functions, and surprisingly, obtains a proof of the Denjoy-Carleman quasianalyticity theorem by elementary methods:-) 

This is a classical problem of complex analysis which is usually stated as a problem on removable singularities. By definition, a Riemann surface (for example a plane domain) belongs to the class $O_{HB}$ if all bounded holomorphic functions on it are constant. For results on general Riemann surfaces, the reference is Tsuji, Potential theory in modern function theory, (which is old but very good), and more recent book Ahlfors and Sario, Riemann surfaces. For the case of plain regions of the form $C\backslash E$, the complement $E$ in this case is called "removable for bounded functions". For example, if $E$ is of zero logarithmic capacity, it is removable, but this is very crude statement. To characterize the removable sets, an Analytic capacity was introduced. (Analytic capacity is zero if and only if the set is removable). It is difficult to characterize the sets of zero analytic capacity in metric terms. See the Wikipedia article on Analytic capacity, to begin with; it contains some references. The problem of characterization of removable sets in the plane is called "Painleve problem". This is a hot research area, and the number of results is enormous. 

This is an entire function of order $1/\alpha$ when $\alpha>1$. So for irrational $\alpha$ it cannot satisfy any linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients. If $0<\alpha<1$, the order is $1$ but the type is minimal, so again it cannot satisfy any such equation. This excludes most special functions. (But does not exclude their compositions with some irrational power inside). Entire solutions of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients have rational order and normal type. One can obtain an integral representation of this function by taking the integral representation of the Mittag-Leffler function and then a sort of Laplace transform of it. Edit. If $\alpha=1$ it is expressed in terms of a Bessel function as the comment below shows. 

Even for the simplest equation of this sort, $y'=y(ax)$, there is no simple formula. Substitute a power series at $0$, and you obtain a series which is divergent when $|a|>1$. This shows that there is no solution analytic at $0$. (If $|a|\leq 1$ this series is convergent everywhere, but still no formula is known simpler than the series itself.) On the other hand, you can reduce to a differential-difference equation, as Anthony Quas recommends, and if $f$ and $g$ are constants, this differential-difference (DD) equation can be solved with Fourier or Laplace transform, depending on your assumptions about $y$. Of course the DD equation always has infinitely many simple discontinuous solutions, depending on an arbitrary function, but probably this is not what you are looking for. 

Here is a more conventional proof:-) Let $M(r)=\max\{|f(z)|:|z|=r\}$. Maximum principle implies that this function is strictly increasing (unless $f$ is constant). This gives a contradiction because |P(z)|>|z| when $z$ is sufficiently large, and $P$ is of degree greater than $1$. 

What do you mean by analytic? Analytic on the real line, or entire. The method you suggest can be used to obtain an entire example. Let $F$ be a Gaussian. Consider a series $$\sum a_nF(b_n(z-c_n))$$ with positive $a_n, b_n$ and $c_n$. If $a_n\to+\infty$ does not grow fast, but $c_n$ does grow fast enough, the series converges on every compact in the complex plane, and gives you an entire function with the properties you stated. EDIT. I corrected according to R. Israel suggestion. With $b_n=1$ and $a_n\to\infty$ it will not be in $L^1$. In fact, Carleman's theorem says that for every continuous function $\phi$ on the real line, and every positive continuous function $\epsilon$ on the real line, one can find an entire function $f$ such that $|f(x)-\phi(x)|<\epsilon(x)$. 

In the definition of bell-shaped it is better to say that ALL derivatives tend to $0$ as $x\to\pm\infty$. This makes more sense, and most authors define it like this. The large class of examples of bell-shaped functions is given by the so-called Polya frequency functions (Laplace transforms of reciprocals of Laguerre Polya functions), see Hirschman and Widder, Convolution Transform, Ch. IV, sect. 5.1. It seems reasonable to conjecture that all bell-shaped functions are of this kind. Assumption that the bell-shaped function is entire is a restrictive one. There are bell-shaped functions which are not entire, $1/(1+x^2)$ for example. If the function is assumed to be entire, AND of the form $g(x)e^{-x^2}$, where $g$ is a real canonical product of genus $1$, then it has derivative-interlacing property only if $g$ has all zeros real. This follows from a deep result of Haseo Ki and Young-One Kim, Duke Math J. 104 (2000), no. 1, 45â73. As a corollary, we obtain that $e^{-z^2}$ is the only bell-shaped function of this form. Hirschman (Proc. AMS, 1, (1950). 63â65.) proved the conjecture of Schoenberg that there are no bell shaped functions with compact support. But there are bell shaped functions which are zero on a ray. 

In your statement you said "let S be a surface". First of all one has to be careful about what is a "surface". It must be a) orientable, and b) separable (have a countable base of topology). (All Reimann surfaces automatically satisfy this but b) is non-trivial). So suppose that S is a Riemann surface. All of the statements 1, 2, 3 contain a "soft part" and a "hard part". 

Question 1 makes sense, and can be stated without "almost complex structure", just in classical terms. There is a Riemannian metric on your surface, induced from $R^3$. The distance between two points is the length of a rope on the surface stretched stretched between these two points. The length is measured as usual in $R^3$. Every Riemannian metric on a surface defines a complex structure. This is the same structure you are talking about. I agree with Igor that every complex structure arises in this way. 

If a trajectory $f^n(x)$ converges, the limit must be a fixed point, that is it satisfies $f(a)=a$. The number of fixed points is finite, and they can be all found by solving an algebraic equation. Now the question is for given $x$ and $a$ to decide whether $f^n(x)\to a$. This can happen in two ways: a) $f^n(x)=a$ for some $n$, so the sequence becomes constant from some place, and trivially converges, or b) $f^n(x)\to a$ but $f^n(x)\neq a$ for all $n$. Whether a) happens for a given $x$ might be difficult to decide. The set of all $x$ for which $f^n(x)=a$ for some $n$ is usually dense on the Julia set, and the Julia set is quite complicated. One can show that it is not semi-algebraic in most cases, with a few trivial exceptions when it is a circle or an arc of a circle. Of course one can give various meanings to the words "given $x$" and "to find out". The question can be easier if, for example, $x$ is rational, and coefficients of $f$ are rational. Or algebraic. Otherwise it is not clear in what form $x$ can be "given", etc. In the case $b$, there is a reasonable description of the sets of convergence. The fixed points are divided into several categories according to the multiplier $\lambda=f'(a)$. For convergence b) to happen, this multiplier has to satisfy $|\lambda|<1$, or $\lambda^n=1$. This is a very deep result of R. Perez Marco. In these two cases, convergence b) happens in the so-called "domains of attraction", which are open but not necessarily connected. The boundary of such domain of attraction coincides with the Julia set, so the "domains" can be quite complicated. But one can obtain very good pictures of them with a computer.

The problem is reduced to the case $n=2$. Indeed, let $\cap B(c_i,r_i)=(a,b)$. Changing the numeration we can assume $a=c_1-r_1$. Then $b=c_k+r_k$ for some $k$. Now it is clear that if $\cap B(c_i\alpha r_i)=(a',b')$ then $a'\geq c_1-\alpha r_1$ and $b'\leq c_k+\alpha r_k$. So it is enough to prove that $$c_k-c_1+\alpha r_k+\alpha r_1\leq \alpha(c_k-c_1+r_k+r_1),$$ that is $c_1\geq c_k$. But this last inequality is easy, just draw a picture of intersection of two intervals. 

First minimize the Rayleigh ratio $R(x)=(x^TAx)/(x^Tx).$ The minimum exists and is real. This is your first eigenvalue. Then you repeat the usual proof by induction in dimension of the space. Alternatively you can consider the minimax or maximin problem with the same Rayleigh ratio, (find the minimum of a restriction on a subspace, then maximum over all subspaces) and it will give you all eigenvalues. 

Classification. You do not specify what classification (what is your equivalence relation?) Topological classification is due to Kerekjarto. A reference is given in the answer of Richard Kent. Complete conformal classification is hopeless. There are many different notions of hyperbolicity. They all coincide in the simply connected case. 

I recommend to look in the book MR1117220 Alexandrov, A. D.; Reshetnyak, Yu. G. General theory of irregular curves. It deals with curves in $R^n$, but I suppose that when your surface is smooth, it must be similar. For the case when your surface itself is not smooth, look to MR1263964 Reshetnyak, Yu. G.
