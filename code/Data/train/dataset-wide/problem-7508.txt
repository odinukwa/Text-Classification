Set $w(x) = (1 + |x|^2)^{1/2}$ with $|\cdot|$ the Euclidian norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$. For $s,\mu \in \mathbb{R}$, we define the Sobolev space $$H_2^{s}(\mathbb{R}^n) = \left\{f : \lVert f \rVert_{s} := \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |\widehat{f}(\omega)|^2 w(\omega)^{2s} \mathrm{d} \omega \right)^{1/2} < \infty \right\}$$ with $\widehat{f}$ the Fourier transform of $f$, and the weighted Sobolev space $$H_2^{s,\mu}(\mathbb{R}^n) = \left\{f : \lVert f \rVert_{s,\mu} := \lVert w^\mu f \rVert_{s} < \infty \right\}.$$ I am looking for sufficient conditions on $(s,\mu)$ such that the identity operator $$ \mathrm{I} : H_2^{s,\mu}(\mathbb{R}^d) \rightarrow L_2(\mathbb{R}^d) $$ is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator. First of all, we should have $s,u \geq 0$, such that $H_2^{s,\mu}(\mathbb{R}^d) \subset L_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. If $(e_k^{s,\mu})$ is an orthonormal basis of $H_2^{s,\mu}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, then the identity is Hilbert-Schmidt if and only if $$ \sum_{k} \lVert e_k^{s,\mu} \rVert < \infty$$ where $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ is the $L_2$-norm. My problem is that I don't know a nice orthonormal bases on weighted Sobolev spaces such that the question becomes easy. Any help would be appreciate. 

We denote by $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ the space of smooth and rapidly decreasing functions. We define on $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ the family of semi-norms $$\lVert \varphi \lVert_{n,m} = \lVert (1+|\cdot|^m) \varphi^{(n)} \lVert_\infty.$$ This family of semi-norms defines a topology $\tau$ on $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$. The space $(\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}),\tau)$ is then well-known to be nuclear. If $\mathcal{M}(\mathbb{R})$ is the space of measurable functions in $\mathbb{R}$, I define the space $\mathcal{R}(\mathbb{R})$ of rapidly decreasing functions (without smoothness condition) by $$\mathcal{R}(\mathbb{R}) = \{ \varphi \in \mathcal{M}(\mathbb{R}), \ \lVert \varphi \lVert_{0,m} < \infty \}.$$ Moreover, the family of (semi-)norms $(\lVert \cdot \lVert_{0,m})_{m\in \mathbb{N}}$ defines a topology $\tau'$ on $\mathcal{R}(\mathbb{R})$. Question: Is $(\mathcal{R}(\mathbb{R}),\tau')$ a nuclear space? NB. The proofs I found for the nuclearity of $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ are essentially using the facts that the space $s$ of sequences with quick decay is nuclear and $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ is homeomorphic to $s$. Several authors are claiming that the nuclear structure is strongly related with the condition of infinite smoothness. The space $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R})$ of compactly supported and smooth function (with the inductive topology coming from the spaces $\mathcal{D}([-n,n])$), and the space $\mathcal{C}^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ (projective limit of the spaces $\mathcal{D}([-n,n])$) are other famous examples of nuclear structure that go in that sense. This suggests that the space $\mathcal{R}(\mathbb{R})$ may be not nuclear or at least that the usual technics are not available. 

I would like to know if there is a natural notion of Gaussian white noise that has been defined on the real projective space $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^n$ of dimension $n$. My impression is that it is doable, for instance as a limit of homogeneous polynomial functions of increasing degree, but I could not find such a construction. 

Partial answer: The only infinitely divisible distributions that decay faster than $\exp(−O(\lvert t \rvert \log \lvert t \rvert))$ are the Gaussians (see the Theorem 7 of this paper). Hence, for $\alpha>1$ and $\alpha\neq 2$, $p_\alpha$ is not infinitely divisible. I am interested to know what happens in the case $\alpha <1$? 

We consider the probability density, often called a generalized Gaussian density, $$p_{\alpha}(t) \propto \exp (- |t|^\alpha),$$ with parameter $0<\alpha<\infty$. For $p = 2$, we recognize a Gaussian distribution and for $p = 1$ a Laplace one. These distributions are known to be infinitely divisible. 

My question is about wavelets theory. Consider $\psi_n$ the Daubechies wavelet of order $n \geq 1$; that is, the Daubechies wavelet with $n$ vanishing moments. We also define the Shannon wavelet in Fourier domain by $$ \widehat{\psi}_{\mathrm{Shannon}} (\omega) = \chi_{[\pi, 2\pi]}(\omega) + \chi_{[- 2 \pi, - \pi]}(\omega)$$ where $\chi_A$ is the indicator function of $A$. Some authors are claiming that "Daubechies wavelets converge to the Shannon wavelet". But I could not find in which sense this has to be understood. Do we have the following convergences: 

Assume that $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ is a norm on the space of rapidly decaying functions $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$. Under which conditions on the norm can we say that the completion $\mathcal{X}$ for this norm is a Banach space such that \begin{equation} \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}) \subseteq \mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}), \end{equation} where $A \subseteq B$ means that the topological vector space $A$ is continuously embedded in the topological vector space $B$. This is typically valid for the norm $\lVert \cdot \rVert_{L^2}$ but not for the norm $\lVert \mathrm{D} \cdot \rVert_{L^2}$, where $\mathrm{D}$ is the derivative operator. NB. Here, the space of tempered generalized functions $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R})$ is endowed with the weak* topology. 

Let $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$ be a Gaussian vector in dimension $N$. I am interested by the probability density of the random variable $\lVert X \lVert_2$. If $\Sigma = {I}_N$, we recognize the $\chi$-law. We especially know that the probability density is given by $$p(x) \propto x^{{N} -1} \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} 1_{x\geq 0} .$$ In the general case, we can decompose the matrix $\Sigma = P^t D P$ with $P$ orthogonal and $D=D(\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_N)$ diagonal and $\lVert X \lVert_2 \sim \lVert \mathcal{N} (0,D)\lVert_2$. What can we say about the probability density of $\lVert X \lVert_2$ in this general case? Thanks by advance. 

Let $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ be the space of smooth and rapidly decaying functions and $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R})$ its dual, the space of tempered distributions. Let $\mathscr{P}$ be a probability measure onto $\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R})$. Its characteristic functional is defined, for $f\in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$, by $$\widehat{\mathscr{P}}(f) = \int_{\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R})} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \langle u ,f\rangle} \mathrm{d}\mathscr{P} (u).$$ There are strong connexions between the support of the measure $\mathscr{P}$ and the continuity of the characteristic functional of $\mathscr{P}$. For instance, if $\mathscr{P}$ is the measure associated with the Gaussian white noise with variance $1$, we have $\widehat{\mathscr{P}}(f) = \exp(-\frac{1}{2}\lVert f\rVert_2^2)$, that is continuous over $L_2(\mathbb{R})$. Applying for instance Theorem A.2 of [1], we deduce that $$\mathscr{P}\left( W_2^{-1/2-\epsilon}(\mathbb{R};(1+\lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{(-1/2-\epsilon)/2})\right) =1$$ for every $\epsilon>0$, with $W_2^{s}(\mathbb{R};(1+\lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{r/2})$ the weighted Sobolev space with regularity $s$ and weight function $(1+\lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{r/2}$. This means that the Gaussian white noise is located in $W_2^{-1/2-\epsilon}(\mathbb{R};(1+\lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{(-1/2-\epsilon)/2})$. This requires only to remark that the identity is an Hilbert-Schmidt operator from $W_2^{1/2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{R};(1+\lvert \cdot \rvert^2)^{(1/2+\epsilon)/2})$ to $L_2(\mathbb{R})$. Question: Is there a similar result if we know that the characteristic functional $\widehat{\mathscr{P}}$ of $\mathscr{P}$ is continuous over $L^p$ for $1 \leq p < 2$? NB. This is motivated by the fact that the characteristic functional of a S$\alpha$S white noise, of the form $\widehat{\mathscr{P}}(f) = \exp ( - \gamma^\alpha \lVert f \rVert^{\alpha}_{\alpha} )$, is continuous over $L^{\alpha}(\mathbb{R})$.

We consider the family of weighted Besov spaces $B_{p,q}^{s}(\mathbb{R}, \gamma)$, with $0<p,q \leq \infty$, $s \in \mathbb{R}$, and $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$. Here, $B_{p,q}^{s}(\mathbb{R})$ is the classical Besov space and the weighted space is defined as $$B_{p,q}^{s}(\mathbb{R}, \gamma) = \{ f \in \mathcal{S}’(\mathbb{R}), \ (1 + \lVert \cdot \rVert^2)^{\gamma /2} f \in B_{p,q}^{s}(\mathbb{R}) \}.$$ From now, we fix $0< p, q \leq \infty$ and will only consider Besov spaces with these parameters. My question is the following: In witch Besov space is embedded an intersection of two Besov spaces? More precisely, I would like to know for which smoothness and weight parameters $s_n, \gamma_n$, $n=1,2,3$ do we have the relation $$ \left( B_{p,q}^{s_1} (\mathbb{R}, \gamma_1) \cap B_{p,q}^{s_2} (\mathbb{R}, \gamma_2) \right) \subset B_{p,q}^{s_3} (\mathbb{R}, \gamma_3) ?$$ By usual embeddings, we know that $B_{p,q}^{\max(s_1,s_2)}(\mathbb{R}, \max(\gamma_1,\gamma_2) )$ is included in the intersection $B_{p,q}^{s_1} (\mathbb{R}, \gamma_1) \cap B_{p,q}^{s_2} (\mathbb{R}, \gamma_2)$. I am particularly interested to know in general how one can compare valids $s_3, \gamma_3$ with $\max (s_1,s_2) , \max (\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ when $s_1 \neq s_2$ and $\gamma_1 \neq \gamma_2$. 

Let $D(\mathbb{R})$ be the space of functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ that are right continuous with left limits (also referred to as càdlàg functions). $D(\mathbb{R})$ is often called the Skorokhod space and plays a crucial role for the theory of Lévy processes. I am curious about embedding relations between this space and the family of local Besov spaces $B_{p,q}^{s,\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R})$ with $0<p,q\leq \infty$ and $s\in \mathbb{R}$. To be more precise, I have two questions. 

Do you know a book that deals with this kind of problems, in the most complete possible manner? NB. I know that some mathematicians were studying the question of the nuclearity of sequences spaces in the 60's and 70's but I didn't find any systematic treatment focused on sequence spaces. 

$\psi_n$ converges uniformly to $\psi_{\mathrm{Shannon}}$ on any compact set $K \subset \mathbb{R}$? $\widehat{\psi}_n$ converges pointwise to $\widehat{\psi}_{\mathrm{Shannon}}$? $\lVert \psi_n - \psi_{\mathrm{Shannon}} \rVert_p \underset{n\rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow} 0$, for $1\leq p \leq \infty$? 

A tempered distribution $u\in \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R})$ is said to be rapidly decreasing if for every $f \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$, $u*f \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$. One rough way to motivate this definition is that $u*f$ has the best regularity between $f$ and $u$ (and thus, for $f$ smooth, it is smooth) and the worst decay between $f$ and $u$ (for $f$ rapidly decreasing, it has consequently the decay of $u$). I am wondering if we could define similarly the space of distributions with algebraic (or slow) decay in the following way. First, a smooth function $f$ has an algebraic decay if we have for every integer $n$ a bound $$|f^{(n)}(t)| \leq \frac{C}{1 + |t|^\alpha}$$ for some $C$ and $\alpha >0$. Then, $u \in \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R})$ is said to have a algebraic decay if for every $f\in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$, the smooth function $u*f$ has an algebraic decay.
