No. Let $B$ be a closed ball of radius 1/2 and $I$ a diameter of $B$. Construct a Cantor-like set $K\subset I$ of lengths $\mathcal H^1(K)=0.9$ (where $\mathcal H^1$ denotes the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure). We have $I\setminus K=\bigcup I_i$ where $I_1,I_2,\dots$ are disjoint open subintervals of $I$ and $\sum_{i=1}^\infty\mathcal H_1(I_i)=0.1$. Let $B_i$ be the open ball for which $I_i$ is a diameter, and let $X_k=B\setminus\bigcup_{i=1}^k B_i$. Then each $X_k$ is a closed connected set and the sequence $\{X_k\}$ Hausdorff converges to $X=\bigcap_{k=1}^\infty X_k=B\setminus\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty B_i$. The boundary of $X_k$ is a union of $k+1$ disjoint circles $\partial B$ and $\partial B_i$, $1\le i\le k$, hence $$ \mathcal H^1(\partial X_k) = \mathcal H^1(\partial B)+\sum_{i=1}^k \mathcal H^1(\partial B_i) = \pi+\sum_{i=1}^k\pi\mathcal H^1(I_i) \le \pi+0.1\pi =: C. $$ However the boundary of $X$ contains $K$, hence $\mathcal H^1(\partial X)\ge\mathcal H^1(\partial B)+\mathcal H^1(K)=\pi+0.9> C$. Thus the space of connected sets of perimeter $\le C$ is not closed. 

No, the Loewner ellipsoid is not monotone w.r.t. inclusion. Let $K$ be a square, whose Loewner ellipsoid is its circumcircle. Let $L$ be any other ellipse through the four vertices of $K$. The Loewner ellipsoid of $L$ is $L$ itself but it does not contain the circle. (I assume that the Loewner ellipsoid is the minimal circumscibed one. If you meant the maximal inscribed one, just consider the dual bodies.) The continuity of Loewner ellipsoid follows from its uniqueness via a standard compactness argument. Its volume is continuous for trivial reasons. If the Loewner ellipsoid $E(K)$ were discontinuous at some convex body $K$, then by compactness there would be a sequence $K_i\to K$ such that $E(K_i)$ converge to some ellipsoid other than $E(K)$ but of the same volume, contrary to the uniqueness. 

I doubt there is a nice "if and only if condition". UPDATE. As for your you second question (about examples), you may be a confused by terminology here. The term "closed manifold" usually means "compact and having no boundary". In this case, the set of focal points is indeed closed because the normal exponential map is proper. However, "closed submanifold" can also mean "a submanifold which is a closed subset of the ambient space" (this is what I meant above, although "properly embedded submanifold" would be a less confusing term). With this meaning, the set of focal points is not necessarily closed and can even be dense. For example, let $\{p_i\}_{i\in\mathbb N}$ be an enumeration of all rational points in the plane. Choose a sequence $\{R_i\}$ of positive reals that goes to infinity sufficiently fast. Construct a curve $\gamma:(-\infty,\infty)\to\mathbb R^2$ such that, for every $i$, $\gamma$ contains an arc of the circle of radius $R_i$ centered at $p_i$. This can be done so that $\gamma$ has no self-intersections and $|\gamma(t)|\to\infty$ as $t\to\pm\infty$. Then the image of $\gamma$ is a properly embedded one-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb R^2$ and all $p_i$'s are its focal points. 

Three regions is the minimum for any convex figure with a smooth boundary. To construct a partition, let $AB$ be the diameter of $R$. The segment $[AB]$ splits $R$ into two pieces $R_1$ and $R_2$. Let $C_i$ be a point at maximal distance from $[AB]$ in $R_i$, $i=1,2$. Draw perpendiculars $C_iD_i$ from $C_i$ to $AB$. The segments $[AB]$, $[C_1D_1]$ and $[C_2D_2]$ split $R$ into 4 regions which can be filled by parallel lines just like the 4 quarters of the circle. Then you can merge two regions by removing the segment $[D_1D_2]$ or using a zig-zag if $D_1=D_2$. Two regions are impossible. Indeed, parametrize $S^1$ by tangent directions of $\partial R$ (say, oriented counter-clockwise). For each region $R_i$, consider the set $R_i\cap\partial R$. The tangent directions of this set form angles at most $\pi/4$ with a fixed line, hence they belong to the union of two arcs of length $\pi/2$ in the circle of tangent directions. It is possible to divide $S^1$ into 2 pair of arcs like this, but then the two corresponding pairs of arcs in $\partial R$ cannot be connected by disjoint paths (I assume you don't want connected but not path-connected examples). The same arguments, modulo minor details, works for any $n$-gon with angles sufficiently close to $\pi$. For example, for a regular $n$-gon with $n\ge 10$. 

If you don't assume compactness, then no. Silly example: $\mathbb R^1$ and $(0,1)$. Example with complete metrics: $\mathbb R^2$ and $\mathbb H^2$ (they have essentially different volume growths and hence are not bi-Lipschitz equivalent). If $M$ and $N$ are closed, then yes, by Sullivan's uniqueness result pointed out to by Leonid Kovalev in comments (provided that the MR review is correct - I'm not an expert in any way and don't have access to the paper). The uniqueness means that for every two Lipschitz structures there is an isomorphism between them. And for Lipschitz structures defined by Riemannian metrics, isomorphisms are a locally bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms of the metrics. By compactness, locally bi-Lipschitz implies bi-Lipschitz. 

You are essentially asking whether a non-expanding linear map $A:(\pi,\|\cdot\|_\infty)\to(\mathbb R^3,\|\cdot\|_\infty)$ can be extended to a non-expanding linear map $B:(\mathbb R^3,\|\cdot\|_\infty)\to(\mathbb R^3,\|\cdot\|_\infty)$. (A linear map $f:X\to Y$ between normed spaces is non-expanding if $\|f(x)\|_Y\le \|x\|_X$ for all $x\in X$. Given $v_1$ and $v_2$ as in the question, the map $B$ sending every vector of the form $v+tv_1$, where $v\in\pi$, to $Av+tv_2$, is non-expanding.) The answer is yes, and the key is that the norm on the target space is of $\ell_\infty$ type. Let $P_i:\mathbb R^3\to\mathbb R$ denote the $i$-th coordinate projection, $i=1,2,3$. Consider linear functions $A_i:\pi\to\mathbb R$ given by $A_i(x)=P_i(Ax)$, $x\in\pi$. Since $A(Q\cap\pi)\subset Q$, we have $|A_i(x)|\le\|x\|_\infty$ for all $x\in\pi$. By Hahn-Banach, there exists an extension $B_i:\mathbb R^3\to\mathbb R$ such that $|B_i(x)|\le\|x\|_\infty$ for all $x\in\mathbb R^3$. Let $B:\mathbb R^3\to\mathbb R^3$ be the linear map whose coordinate functions are $B_1,B_2,B_3$. Then $\|Bx\|_\infty\le\|x\|_\infty$ for all $x\in\mathbb R^3$ and $B=A$ on $\pi$. Now let $v_1$ be any vector from $\mathbb R^3\setminus \pi$, define $v_2=Bv_1$, and we are done. 

A colleague asked me this question recently. Every injective continuous map between manifolds of the same (finite) dimension is open - this is Brouwer's Domain Invariance Theorem. Is the same true for complete boundaryless Alexandrov spaces (of curvature bounded below)? Alexandrov spaces are manifolds almost everywhere, and their singularities have special structure. In dimensions 1 and 2 there are no topological singularities (all Alexandrov spaces are manifolds). Higher dimensional singularities have a sort of inductive description: every point $x$ in an $n$-dimensional Alexandrov space has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the cone over an $(n-1)$-dimensional connected(!) Alexandrov space $\Sigma_x$ which carries a metric of curvature $\ge 1$. The last property implies that $\Sigma_x$ is compact and its fundamental group is finite. For example, in dimension 3 the only type of singularity is the cone over $RP^2$. In dimension 4 there are cones over lens spaces, $\mathbb R\times Cone(RP^2)$ and maybe other beasts. There is a similar purely topological question: is Domain Invariance Theorem true for "almost manifolds"? An "almost manifold" is a pseudo-manifold obtained from $n$-simlices by gluing their $(n-1)$-dimensional faces in pairs - that is, there are exactly two $n$-simplices adjacent to each $(n-1)$-simplex, and there are no extra identifications between lower-dimensional faces. I'm not sure that all Alexandrov spaces admit triangulations, but if they do, they are "almost manifolds" (of a special kind). 

The answer is yes, here is a proof. Let $k=2n$. The polynomial, regarded as a map $f:\mathbb R^k\to\mathbb R^k$, has the following properties: (1) The pre-image of every point if finite, moreover the cardinality of a pre-image is uniformly bounded by some constant $N$ (by Bezout's theorem, see comments). (2) The set $\Sigma$ of singularities of $f$ (i.e. points where $\det df=0$) is a union of finitely many smooth submanifolds of (real) codimension at least 2. This (along with smoothness and properness) implies the path-lifting property. First, observe the following facts: (3) $f(\Sigma)$ is closed (because $\Sigma$ is closed and $f$ is proper). (4) $\mathbb R^k\setminus f(\Sigma)$ is path connected. Moreover any path in $\mathbb R^k$ is a uniform limit of paths avoiding $f(\Sigma)$. This follows from the fact that $f(\Sigma)$ has Hausdorff dimension at most $k-2$. (5) For every compact set $K\subset\mathbb R^k$ and every $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that for every connected set $S\subset K$ of diameter greater than $\varepsilon$, the diameter of $f(S)$ is greater than $\delta$. Indeed, if this is not the case, there would be a sequence $S_i$ of connected subsets of $K$ with diameters at least some $\varepsilon_0>0$ and diameters of images going to zero. By choosing a subsequence, we may assume that the images converge to some $y_0\in\mathbb R^k$. Since $S_i$ is connected and has diameter at least $\varepsilon_0$, it contains a finite subset $P_i$ of cardinality $N+1$ such that all points of $P_i$ are separated away from one another by distance at least $\varepsilon_0/2N$. A subsequence of $\{P_i\}$ converge to a set $P$ of cardinality $N+1$, and all points of $P$ are mapped by $f$ to $x_0$, contrary to (1). Now, in order to lift a path $\gamma$, approximate it by paths $\gamma_i\subset\mathbb R^k\setminus f(\Sigma)$. The restriction of $f$ to the pre-image of $R^k\setminus f(\Sigma)$ is a covering map to $R^k\setminus f(\Sigma)$ because it is a proper local homeomorphism. So there are lifts $\tilde\gamma_i$ of $\gamma_i$. Now it suffices to find a converging subsequence of $\{\tilde\gamma_i\}$. To do this, it suffices to show that this sequence is equi-continuous. And this follows from (5): if you could find arbitrarily close pair of points on some $\gamma_i$ with lifts bounded away from each other, the lift of the segment of $\gamma_i$ between these points would have diameter bounded away from zero but the diameter of the image arbitrarily small, contrary to (5). To make sure that the limit lift starts from $z_0$, choose $\gamma_i$'s so that their starting points have pre-images near $z_0$ and start $\tilde\gamma_i$'s from there.
