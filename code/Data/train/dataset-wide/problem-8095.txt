As clarified in the comments, the question refers to positive operator valued measures, not quantum operations. Basically the issue is whether, for a given $A \in M_n = M_n(\mathbb{C})$ the map $B \mapsto ABA^*$ on $M_n$ has an eigenvector. A counterexample is given by the matrix $A = \left[\matrix{0&1\cr 0&0}\right]$; for any matrix $B = \left[\matrix{a&b\cr c&d}\right]$ we have $ABA^* = \left[\matrix{d&0\cr 0&0}\right]$, so that $0$ is the only eigenvalue. However, if $A$ is positive then taking $B$ to be any projection onto an eigenvector of $A$ belonging to a nonzero eigenvalue yields a solution. Slightly more generally, $B$ could be any operator which satisfies $PBP = B$ where $P$ is the orthogonal projection onto some eigenspace for $A$. Putting $A$ in diagonal form shows that these are the only solutions. 

It is a weak* homeomorphism because the predual of a W*-module is unique. If $T$ weren't a weak* homeomorphism then it could be used to transfer the weak* topology on $Y$ to a new, different weak* topology on $Z$. But $Z$ only has one predual, and hence it only has one weak* topology. For slightly more details on why the predual is unique, see Theorem 2.6 of this paper. 

Well, I would make sense of expressions like this by inserting $|e_n\rangle\langle e_n|$ between the operator and the measure and then summing over $n$. Say we want to give a meaning to $A = \int A(x)d\mu$. If we know how to integrate scalar-valued functions against a spectral measure then we can define $$\langle v|A = \sum_n \int \langle v|A(x)|e_n\rangle\langle e_n|d\mu = \sum_n \langle e_n|\int \langle v|A(x)|e_n\rangle d\mu$$ for any $v \in H$, and if we know how to integrate vector-valued functions against scalar measures then we can define $$A|w\rangle = \sum_n \int A(x)|e_n\rangle\langle e_n|d\mu|w\rangle$$ for any $w \in H$. So take your pick, say what the operator is by saying either what happens when you apply it to a vector or what happens when you apply a covector to it. Do these sums converge? No, not in general, even assuming $A(x)$ is a bounded operator-valued function and $\mu$ is the spectral measure coming from a compact self-adjoint operator. For example, consider the spectral measure coming from the operator of multiplication by $1/n$ on $l^2({\bf N})$. This is a spectral measure defined on $X = \{1/n: n \in {\bf N}\}$ with $\mu(\{1/n\}) = |e_n\rangle\langle e_n|$.` Define an operator-valued function on $X$ by setting $A(1/n) = |e_1\rangle\langle e_n|$. Then the integral $\int A(x)d\mu$ becomes a sum $\sum_n |e_1\rangle\langle e_n|e_n\rangle\langle e_n| = \sum_n |e_1\rangle\langle e_n|$ which does not converge. Edit: I just looked at their 2011 paper and I found that they have some discussion about how to make their integrals rigorous in Section 2.2. So I think the full answer is that integrals of this form don't always make sense, but there is a heuristic and one can prove convergence in some special cases. 

The case $M = L^\infty[0,1]$ seems like a simple measurability question. If every $x \in B(l^2)$ can be $K$-paved to $\|\sum P_ixP_i\| < \epsilon \|x\|$, then every $x \in B(l^2)\otimes L^\infty[0,1] \cong L^\infty([0,1],B(l^2))$ has a pointwise a.e. $K$-paving that does the same thing. So we just need a measurable selection. Surely one of the standard measurable selection theorems suffices here, have you checked this? I really disagree with your characterization of the problem as having been solved without operator algebra theory. You didn't mention the brilliant reduction of Akemann and Anderson that gets us down to this combinatorial question. That part of the solution is completely operator algebraic and it is quite nontrivial. In his paper "Filters in C*-algebras" Tristan Bice develops some very beautiful machinery for achieving this reduction, among other operator algebraic applications. It sounds as if you are not even aware of this part of the story. 

I think the answer is "no". Consider the operator $\bar{T} = \left[\matrix{0&0\cr T&0}\right]$ acting on $H \oplus H$. Then $|\bar{T}| = \left[\matrix{|T|&0\cr 0&0}\right]$ and $|\bar{T}^*| = \left[\matrix{0&0\cr 0&|T^*|}\right]$. So $$(|\bar{T}| - i)^{-1} - (|\bar{T}^*| - i)^{-1} = \left[\matrix{(|T| - i)^{-1} - i&0\cr 0& (|T^*| - i)^{-1} + i}\right].$$ To me this says that evaluating your expression is in general no easier than evaluating $(|T| - i)^{-1}$ and $(|T^*| - i)^{-1}$ separately, and it's hard to see how there could be any easier way to do this than by taking the absolute values in the usual manner. 

I remember not understanding the proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus. My teacher, who was otherwise very good, didn't cover the proof; she told us we could look at it ourselves if we were curious. (This was a high school class.) I did take a look, but I couldn't make heads nor tails of it. It so happens that I didn't encounter this proof again until I was a postdoc teaching second quarter calculus. I was relieved to learn that it was now quite trivial! If I were teaching calculus at the high school level I wouldn't leave the students entirely on their own, but I also don't think I would want to tell them anything like a real proof of the fundamental theorem. I would probably be satisfied with trying to get across the general idea in an intuitive way. 

Let $M_n^{sa}$ be the space of $n\times n$ complex Hermitian matrices, let $r < n$, and let $E$ and $F$ be (real) linear subspaces of $M_n$ with ${\rm codim}(E) < r^2$ and ${\rm codim}(F) = 1$. Let $V$ be the set of matrices in $E$ whose rank is at most $r$ and suppose $V$ is not contained in $F$. Is $V \cap (M_n\setminus F)$ dense in $V$? For this to fail, there would have to be some open subset of $V$ which is contained in $F$, while not all of $V$ is contained in $F$. I assume the answer is yes, but I think this is an algebraic geometry question and I know next to nothing about the subject $\ldots$ 

Let $R$ be a projection in $B(l^2)$ onto a subspace whose dimension and codimension are both infinite. Then $[P] \oplus [R] = [Q] \oplus [R]$ for any projections $P$ and $Q$ in $B(l^2)$, but not all such $P$ and $Q$ are equivalent. 

Hi, Mike. Take a look at the paper "Computing Norms in Group C*-Algebras" by Akemann and Ostrand, Amer. J. Math. 98 (1976), 1015â€“1047. For instance, if $g_1, \ldots, g_n$ are the standard generators of a free group, they calculate that $\|\sum_1^n g_i\| = 2\sqrt{n-1}$. It looks like that would (taking each $a_i = 1/n$, and with $n \geq 3$) already make your infimum less than one. Specifically, it would give an upper bound of $2\sqrt{n-1}/n$ for $\alpha(S)$ in this case. Edit: I stand corrected, that is the reduced group C*-algebra norm. 

Suppose $E$ is a dual Banach space whose predual is unique, and $E_0$ is a codimension 1 weak* closed subspace of $E$. Is the predual of $E_0$ necessarily unique? Okay, I will reveal the motivation. It is a long-standing problem whether the predual of ${\rm Lip}_0(X)$, for $X$ a pointed metric space, is unique. I can prove this for ${\rm Lip}(Y)$ spaces, an important special case. If the diameter of $X$ is finite then ${\rm Lip}_0(X)$ isometrically embeds as a weak* closed codimension 1 subspace of some ${\rm Lip}(Y)$, so a positive answer to my question would resolve the finite diameter case. I just noticed something else. In my case $E_0$ is also isometrically a quotient of $E$ by a complementary 1-dimensional subspace. Maybe that helps? 

Not sure if this should be an answer or a comment. If $M$ has nontrivial center then the flip automorphism is not inner: if $p$ is a nontrivial central projection then $p \otimes (1-p) \mapsto (1-p) \otimes p$, but $p\otimes(1-p)$ times anything in $M\otimes M$ lies under itself. On the positive side, I think that the hyperfinite $II_1$ factor implements its own flip automorphism, since this can be done on the approximating matrix algebras and you can take a weak* limit. Possibly this sort of argument works for any factor? 

There is no standard definition of the tensor product of subsets. If you want to take a tensor product of closed subspaces $E$ of $B(H)$ and $F$ of $B(K)$ there are a variety of choices (there's a nice survey at hrcak.srce.hr/file/1655). The simplest is probably the so-called "spatial" tensor product defined as the closed linear span of all operators of the form $A \otimes B \in B(H \otimes K)$ with $A \in E$ and $B \in F$. I would probably just define $C \otimes L$ to be the set of contractions in $B(H) \otimes B(K) \cong B(H\otimes K)$. 

The question is not clear. Are you asking whether the complete distributive law holds in (probably the unit ball of) $L^\infty(X,\mu)$? The answer is no: complete distributivity is characteristic of atomic measure spaces. An easy way to see this is to use the fact that a complete lattice is completely distributive iff it has the property that for all $c$ and $d$ with $c \not\geq d$ there exist $c' \not\leq c$ and $d' \not\geq d$ such that every element of the lattice lies above $c'$ or below $d'$. I refer you to Theorem 5.3.5 of my book Lipschitz Algebras for a proof. Let $A$ be a positive measure set that contains no atoms, find $B \subset A$ with $0 < \mu(B) < \mu(A)$, and take $c = \chi_B$ and $d = \chi_{A\setminus B}$. 

Yes. For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ even let "layer" $n$ consist of a single point, and for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ odd let "layer" $n$ consist of $n$ points. The ordering is the same as yours, one point is less than another if and only if it lies in a lower layer.
