We claim that the same thing happens in general. Expanding the product for $\Delta$, we can rewrite the sum as $$\sum_{\nu \in M} \int_T f(\theta) \sum_{\epsilon: \Phi_{+} \to \{ \pm 1 \}} \prod_{\alpha \in \Phi_{+}} \epsilon(\alpha) \cdot d\left( \nu - \sum_{\alpha \in \Phi_{+}} \epsilon(\alpha) \alpha \right) e^{\nu}(\theta)$$ Now, $d(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $|\Phi^{+}|$, and we have applied $|\Phi|$ partial difference operators to it. So $\sum_{\epsilon: \Phi_{+} \to \{ \pm 1 \}} \prod \epsilon(\alpha) d(x- (1/2) \sum \epsilon(\alpha) \alpha)$ is a constant, and I leave it as a challenge for the reader to compute that it is $|W|$. So our sum collapses to $$\mbox{constant} \cdot \sum_{\nu \in M} f(\theta) e^{\nu}(\theta).$$ Because the world is just, the constant works out. Stated more conceptually, $\Delta(\theta) e^{\nu}(\theta) f(\theta)$ is a $|\Phi_{+}|$-fold partial difference of $\int_{\theta} e^{\nu}(\theta) f(\theta)$, and $d(\nu)$ is a degree $|\Phi_{+}|$ polynomial. If we can justify summing by parts enough times, we should be able to turn $$\sum_{\nu} \int_{\theta} \Delta(\theta) e^{\nu}(\theta) f(\theta) \cdot d(\nu)$$ into $$\sum_{\nu} \int_{\theta} e^{\nu}(\theta) f(\theta) \cdot 1.$$ 

Ramakrishnan and Valenza's Fourier Analysis on Number Fields has all the topics you name, but doesn't prove the main theorems of class field theory. If you want a book which has all of this and also the class field theory proofs (but moves a lot faster) try Weil's Basic Number Theory. 

Here is an easy $5$ dimensional space of cycles: Inside $A \times A$, consider the subvarieties $\{ (a,b) : a=mb \}$, for $m=0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$. I will show that these are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$. By Kunneth and Poincare, $$H^4(A \times A, \mathbb{Q}) \cong \bigoplus_{i=0}^4 H^{i}(A, \mathbb{Q}) \otimes H^{4-i}(A, \mathbb{Q}) \cong \bigoplus_{i=0}^4 \mathrm{End}(H^{i}(A, \mathbb{Q})).$$ The graph of multiplication by $m$, in this presentation, has class $$(\mathrm{Id}, m \mathrm{Id}, m^2 \mathrm{Id}, m^3 \mathrm{Id}, m^4 \mathrm{Id})$$ Since the Vandermonde matrix $$\begin{pmatrix} 0^0 & 0^1 & 0^2 & 0^3 & 0^4 \\ 1^0 & 1^1 & 1^2 & 1^3 & 1^4 \\ 2^0 & 2^1 & 2^2 & 2^3 & 2^4 \\ 3^0 & 3^1 & 3^2 & 3^3 & 3^4 \\ 4^0 & 4^1 & 4^2 & 4^3 & 4^4 \end{pmatrix}$$ has nonzero determinant, the $5$ classes I listed are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$. 

Write $P$ in Smith normal form as $SDT$, where $S$ and $T$ have determinant $\pm 1$ and $D$ is diagonal with diagonal entries $d_1 | d_2 | d_3 | \cdots | d_n$. We may replace $(F, G, P)$ by $(S^{-T} F S^{-1}, T^{T} G T, D)$ and therefore assume $P$ is diagonal with entries $d_i$ as stated. Note that this replacement preserves all the hypotheses and the desired conclusion. Claim 1: We have $r^2 | d_k d_{n+1-k}$ for all $1 \leq k \leq n$. Proof: Suppose, to the contrary, that $p$ is a prime dividing $r^2$ more times than it divides $d_k d_{n+1-k}$. The condition $D^T F D \equiv 0 \mod r^2$ means $d_i d_j F_{ij} \equiv 0 \mod r^2$ for all $(i,j)$. So, for all $i \leq k$ and $j \leq n+1-k$, we have $F_{ij} \equiv 0 \mod p$. So the first $k$ rows of $F$ span a $\leq k-1$ dimensional space modulo $p$, contradicting that $p$ does not divide $\det F$. $\square$ Claim 1 is used only to prove the stronger: Claim 2: For all $1 \leq k \leq n$, we have $d_k d_{n+1-k} = r^2$. Proof: Since $D^T F D = r^2 G$ and $\det F= \det G$, we deduce that $\det D = r^n$. So $\prod_{k=1}^n d_k = r^n$ and $\prod (d_k d_{n+1-k}/ r^2) = 1$. By the previous claim, all of the factors in this product are positive integers, so they must all be $1$. $\square$ In particular, every $d_k | r^2$. This means that every principal minor $\det D/d_k$ must be divisible by $r^n/r^2 = r^{n-2}$, and the nonprincipal minors are zero, giving the desired conclusion. More conceptually, if we define $D'$ to be $D$ with the elements in the opposite order, then $D D' = r^2$. Conjugating back to the original basis, this $D'$ will turn into the matrix you called $Q_1$. 

You say above (and I agree) that conditions (1) and (2) are true in your setting, and condition (3) follows from the fact that your nodes always join two different components, not one component and itself. $^*$ Mumford must mean "unique up to conjugacy". 

This question is borderline between what is on topic and what isn't; if you want to do a number of computations like this you should pick up a book on representation theory. My standard recommendations for $SL_n$ rep theory are Chapter 8 of Fulton's Young Tableaux or Appendix II (by Fomin) in Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics Volume 2. You then just need someone to tell you that the finite dimensional representation theories of $SU$ and $SL$ are the same. Perhaps someone will recommned a book that works directly in $SU$. But I can easily imagine someone working in some other area just needing one answer and not wanting to open the book, so here is the computation. Irreducible $SU$ representations are indexed by partitions. The $6$ and $15$ dimensional representations you speak of are $\mathrm{Sym}^2$ and $\mathrm{Sym}^4$ of the standard representation, so they are represented by the partitions $(2)$ and $(4)$. Tensor products where one factor is a single horizontal row are computed by the Pieri rule. There are three components, each of multiplicity $1$, corresponding to the partitions $(6)$, $(5,1)$ and $(4,2)$. The first one is $\mathrm{Sym}^6$, with dimension $28$. The other two don't have simple descriptions, but their characters are the Schur functions $$s_{51}(x,y,z) = x^5 y + x^4 y^2 + x^3 y^3 + x^2 y^4 + x y^5 + x^5 z + 2 x^4 y z + 2 x^3 y^2 z + 2 x^2 y^3 z + 2 x y^4 z + y^5 z + x^4 z^2 + 2 x^3 y z^2 + 2 x^2 y^2 z^2 + 2 x y^3 z^2 + y^4 z^2 + x^3 z^3 + 2 x^2 y z^3 + 2 x y^2 z^3 + y^3 z^3 + x^2 z^4 + 2 x y z^4 + y^2 z^4 + x z^5 + y z^5$$ and $$s_{42}(x,y,z) = (x^2 + x y + y^2) (x^2 + x z + z^2) (y^2 + y z + z^2).$$ Their dimensions are $35$ and $27$. 

I'll put up a quick proof that the curve has the claimed number of points, in case it inspires anyone. For every $X \in \mathbb{F}\_{q^2}$, the left hand side $X^q+X$ is the trace of $X$, and is thus in $\mathbb{F}\_q$. The trace is an $\mathbb{F}\_q$ linear map, so each fiber has size $q$. For those $X$ where $Tr(X)=0$, there is one root $Y=0$. For the other $X$'s, there are $q+1$ roots of $Y^{q+1} = Tr(X)$ in $\mathbb{F}\_{q^2}$. So there are $q+(q^2-q)(q+1) = q^3$ points on the affine curve. I have no idea how to deal with that determinant though. I hope someone will have a better idea! 

I was just thinking about this the other day! Here is one solution. As in the original post, let $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$ and let $\theta$ and $\pi$ be distinct primary primes. Also, set $L = K(\sqrt[3]{\theta \pi})$ and $M = K(\sqrt[3]{\theta}, \sqrt[3]{\pi})$. We note that $M/L$ is unramified. The only primes which might ramify are those lying over $(\sqrt{-3})$, $(\pi)$ and $(\theta)$ in $K$. We can check that there is no ramification at these places using, respectively, a $3$-adic computation and the fact that $\theta$ and $\pi$ are primary, the presentation $M = L[T]/(T^3-\theta)$ and the presentation $M = L[U]/(U^3-\pi)$. Let $\pi'$ be the prime of $L$ lying over $\pi$, and let $\theta'$ be the prime of $L$ lying over $\theta$. Now, $\theta' \pi'$ is the principal ideal generated by $\sqrt[3]{\theta \pi}$. So Artin reciprocity gives the equation $$\mathrm{Frob}_{M/L}(\theta') \mathrm{Frob}_{M/L}(\pi') = \mathrm{Id} \qquad (\ast)$$ in $\mathrm{Gal}(M/L)$. Now, $(\sqrt[3]{\pi})^{N(\pi')} = (\sqrt[3]{\pi})^{N(\pi)} \equiv \left[ \frac{\pi}{\theta} \right]_3 \sqrt[3]{\pi} \bmod \theta$. So $$\mathrm{Frob}_{M/L}(\theta')(\sqrt[3]{\pi}) = \left[ \frac{\pi}{\theta} \right]_3 \sqrt[3]{\pi}.$$ Since $\sqrt[3]{\pi} \sqrt[3]{\theta} \in L$, it is fixed by $\mathrm{Frob}_{M/L}(\theta')$, so we compute $$\mathrm{Frob}_{M/L}(\theta')(\sqrt[3]{\theta}) = \left[ \frac{\pi}{\theta} \right]_3^{-1} \sqrt[3]{\theta}.$$ Similarly, $$\mathrm{Frob}_{M/L}(\pi')(\sqrt[3]{\theta}) = \left[ \frac{\theta}{\pi} \right]_3 \sqrt[3]{\theta} \quad \mathrm{Frob}_{M/L}(\pi')(\sqrt[3]{\pi}) = \left[ \frac{\theta}{\pi} \right]_3^{-1} \sqrt[3]{\pi} .$$ Plugging into $(\ast)$ and acting on $\sqrt[3]{\pi}$ we get $$ \left[ \frac{\pi}{\theta} \right]_3 \left[ \frac{\theta}{\pi} \right]_3^{-1} = 1$$ as desired. 

The analogous fact for smooth connections is (one direction of) the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence; see, for example, Theorem 2.6 here. 

Littlewood-Richardson coefficients are both multiplicities of $GL_n$ tensor products, and of restrictions of $GL_{m+n}$ representations to $GL_m \times GL_n$. I want to turn this equality of numbers into an equality of maps of vector spaces, and generalize it to quantum groups. In more detail: $\def\Part{\mathrm{Part}} \def\Hom{\mathrm{Hom}}$Let $\Part$ be the abelian category whose objects are collections of finite dimensional vectors spaces $(W_{\lambda})$, one for each partition $\lambda$, such that all but finitely many of the $W_{\lambda}$ are $0$. Here $$\Hom_{\Part}((W_{\lambda}), (X_{\lambda})) = \bigoplus_{\lambda} \Hom_{\mathrm{Vect}}(W_{\lambda}, X_{\lambda})$$ and composition is defined in the obvious manner. I'll write $[\lambda]$ for the element of $\Part$ which is $\mathbb{C}$ at $\lambda$ and $0$ everywhere else. There are two potential tensor structures on $\Part$, which I will call $\otimes^T$ (for tensor) and $\otimes^R$ (for restriction). Let $V_{\lambda}(n)$ denote the representation of $GL_n$ with highest weight $\lambda$. In $\otimes^T$, $$\left( [\lambda] \otimes^T [\mu] \right)_{\nu} = \Hom_{GL_n}(V_{\nu}(n), V_{\lambda}(n) \otimes V_{\mu}(n)) \ \mathrm{for} \ n\gg 0.$$ Part of the claim is that, for $n$ sufficiently large, the vector spaces which we say on the right hand side are isomorphic, and this isomorphism can be chosen to commute with the obvious commutator and associator. The definition of $\otimes^T$ for other objects of $\Part$ is forced by linearity. Similarly, $$\left( [\lambda] \otimes^R [\mu] \right)_{\nu} = \Hom_{GL_m \times GL_n}(V_{\lambda}(m) \boxtimes V_{\mu}(n), V_{\nu}(m+n)) \ \mathrm{for}\ m,n \gg 0.$$ I believe it is not too bad to show that these two tensor structures are equivalent (including the commutator and associator) by identifying them both with the same thing in the representation theory of the symmetric group, through Schur-Weyl duality, although I haven't actually done this. 

Usually, rather than triangulating algebraic varieties, it is better to find cylindrical decompositions. These are finite cellular decompositions that exist for every real semi-algebraic set and thus, restricting scalars, for every complex variety. See Algorithms in Real Algebraic Geometry for more. If you want a proof of finiteness of $H^{\ast}_{DR}$ without resolution of singularities and without topological tools, you can see Monsky, Finiteness of de Rham Cohomology. I wouldn't call it simple, though! 

The answer to the question in your title is "yes", we can decide whether $A$ is irreducible by knowing its $\zeta$ function. Fix a prime power $q$. Let $k$ be the field with $q$ elements. Let $W(q)$ be the set of irreducible monic polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}$ all of whose roots have norm $q^{1/2}$. The main result of Honda-Tate theory (Theorem 4.1 in Kirsten's notes) is that there is a bijection between isogeny classes of $k$-simple abelian varieties over $k$ and $W(q)$. For each polynomial $g$ in $W(q)$, there is some positive integer $n(g,q)$ such that the characteristic polynomial of the corresponding simple abelian variety is $f^{n(g,q)}$. The tricky point is that $n(g,q)$ is not always $1$. For example, in Denis's answer, what is going on is that $n(x-p, p^2)=2$. So it is true that $A$ is $k$-simple if and only if $f_A$ is of the form $g^{n(g,q)}$; you just need to know how to compute that $n$ function. I think you should be able to extract this from sections 4 and 5 of Kirsten's notes, but I don't know the details. UPDATE: Brian Conrad e-mails to spell out the recipe (hope I copied this correctly). Let $f$ be irreducible of the required form. Let $\pi$ be a root of $f$ and let $F$ be the field $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$. For every $p$-adic place $v$ of $F$, let $d_v$ be the denominator of $v(\pi) [F_v:\mathbb{Q}_p]/v(q)$ when written in lowest terms. Let $d = LCM(d_v)$ where the LCM ranges over all possible $v$'s. Then $f^d$ is the characteristic polynomial of the simple abelian variety. If I'm not mistaken, this condition can be stated in an elegant geometric way. For any polynomial $g$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$, let $N(g)$ be the $p$-adic Newton polytope of $g$. We will subdivide the path $N$ as follows: Recall that, if $h$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}_p$, then $N(h)$ is a line segment, and that, if $g$ factors as $\prod h_i^{r_i}$, then $N(g)$ is the concatenation of $r_i$ copies of each $N(h_i)$, ordered with increasing slope. We will decompose $N(g)$ into one piece for each distinct irreducible factor, with that piece being $r_i$ times $N(h_i)$. For example, $x^2-p^2$, $x^2+p^2$ and $x^2-2xp+p^2$ all have Newton polytope a line segment from $(2,0)$ to $(0,2)$. In the first case, we would subdivide this line segment into two line segments, touching at $(1,1)$, because the two factors $x+p$ and $x-p$ are distinct. In the second case, we would subdivide if $x^2+p^2$ factored in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ (i.e. if $p$ is $1 \mod 4$) but not if it remained irreducible (if $p$ is $3 \mod 4$). In the third case, we would not subdivide, because the factor $(x-p)$ is repeated. Then I believe the condition is that $f$ is the characteristic polynomial of an abelian variety if and only if all the vertices of $N(f)$, subdivided as above, have heights that are integer multiples of $v_p(q)$. 

The original question asked us to interpolate at $\deg A$ points. We have $\deg A = p+q-1$ if $p \neq q$, or $p+q-2$ if $p=q$ (because the leading terms of $P'Q$ and $P Q'$ cancel.) So the original question is asking for less interpolation than we would expect to be able to achieve. I will show that we cannot always achieve as much interpolation as we would naively expect; I do not know if we can always achieve the smaller amount you ask for. It is not always possible to perturb an interpolation. The simplest example is to start with $p(x)/q(x) = 1/(x^2+1)$ and $(w_1, w_2, w_3) = (-1, 0, 1)$. So $(a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1/2, 0, -1/2)$. I claim that we cannot perturb to $(1/2, 0, -1/2+\epsilon)$ for $\epsilon \neq 0$, with $\deg p=0$ and $\deg q = 2$. Proof: Such a perturbation is of the form $\phi(x)=1/q(x)$ for some quadratic polynomial $q$. Then $\phi'(x) = -q'(x)/q(x)^2$ and we have imposed that the derivative vanish at $0$. So $q'(x)=0$ and $q(x) = a x^2 + b$ for some $a$ and $b$. This shows that $\phi(x)$ is an even function, so $\phi'(x)$ is odd, and we have $\phi'(1) = - \phi'(-1)$, making it impossible to interpolate $(-1, 0, 1+\epsilon)$. If you want a counterexample with $p=q$, take $p=q=2$ with $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4) = (1, -1, 1/2, 2)$. Try to perturb $(x^2+1)/(x^2+x+1)$ while keeping $a_1=a_2=0$. The condition $\phi'(\pm 1) =0$ implies that $\phi(x) = \phi(1/x)$ so $\phi'(x) = (-1/x^2) \phi'(1/x)$ and we get $\phi'(2) = (-1/4) \phi'(1/2)$, and we can use this to show the impossibility of perturbing to $(0,0,a_3, a_4)$ for generic $(a_3, a_4)$. I don't have any counterexamples where the $a_i$ are all nonzero. I also don't have any counter-examples which involve interpolation at only $\deg A$ points. 

I'm not an expert here, but I'll try. Let $X$ be a proper irreducible variety and $K$ the field of meromorphic function on $X$. Let $v : K^* \to A$ be a valuation, where $A$ is a totally ordered abelian group. Recall that the valuation ring $R$ is $v^{-1}(A_{\geq 0})$, with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m} = v^{-1}(A_{> 0})$. So $R$ is a local ring with fraction field $K$. By the valuative criterion of properness, we get a map $\mathrm{Spec} \ R \to X$; the image of the closed point is called the "center" of $v$. We denote the center by $Z$. I'll start with the simplest cases, and move to the more general. The easiest case is that $X$ is defined over an algebraically closed field $k$, the point $Z$ is a closed point of $X$, and $A$ is $\mathbb{Z}$. Then the completion of $R$ at $\mathfrak{m}$ is isomorphic to $k[[t]]$; choose such an isomorphism. If $x_1$, $x_2$, ... $x_N$ are coordinates near $z$ then this isomorphism identifies $z_i$ with a power series $\sum x_i^j t^j$. Intuitively, we can think of $(x_1(t), x_2(t), \ldots, x_N(t))$ as giving an analytic map from a small disc $D$ into $X$, taking the origin to $Z$. (This interpretation makes rigorous sense if we are working over $\mathbb{C}$, and the power series $x_i$ converge somewhere.) The image of this map is the "branch" which Zariski speaks of. The valuation can be thought of as restricting a function to this branch and seeing to what order it vanishes at $Z$. Notice that, if there is a polynomial relation $f(x_1(t), \ldots, x_N(t))=0$ then we should have $v(f)=\infty$ and $v(1/f)= - \infty$. If you don't allow this then you need to require that the $x_i$ be algebraically independent; intuitively, this is the same as saying that the branch does not lie in any polynomial hypersurface. Since Zariski allows "algebraic" branches, I assume he IS permitting this and has some appropriate convention to deal with it. Now, what if $A$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$, but is no longer discrete? Then $R$ is going to embed in some sort of Puiseux field. The details here can be subtle, but the intuition should be that the $x_i(t)$ can have real exponents. For example, if $K=k(x,y)$, and $v(f(x,y))$ is the order of vanishing of $f(t, t^{\sqrt{2}})$ at $t=0$, then we can think of $v$ as the order of vanishing along the branch $(t, t^{\sqrt{2}})$. Maybe that is what Zariski means by a transcendental branch?? Suppose now that $Z$ is the generic point of an $s$-dimensional variety. Let $L$ be the field of functions on $Z$ and suppose, for simplicity, that $L$ and $K$ have the same characteristic. If $A=\mathbb{Z}$ then $R$ embeds in $L[[t]]$. Again, we can take coordinates $x_1$, ..., $x_N$ and write them as power series. How to think of these power series? One way is to think of them as giving a map $U \times D$ into $X$, where $D$ is again a small disc and $U$ is a dense open subset of $X$. The image is the $(s+1)$-dimensional branch which Zariski discusses. The valuation is to restrict to this branch and work out the order of vanishing of this restriction along $U \times \{ 0 \}$. Now, all of this is discussing the case where $A$ embeds (as an ordered group) in $\mathbb{R}$. In general, of course, there are more valuations. For example, let $A=\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ ordered lexicographically. Let $v:k[x,y] \to A$ send a polynomial to its lowest degree monomial, and extend this to a valuation on $k(x,y)$. The way I would think of that is that we have a little disc near $(0,0)$, and a little curve passing through $(0,0)$ along the $x$-axis. So our valuation is to, first, restrict to the curve and the order of vanishing at the point and, second, to restrict to the surface and take the order of vanishing along the curve. So here we have a flag of branches, not just one. I'm not sure why your Zariski quote doesn't discuss this possibility.
