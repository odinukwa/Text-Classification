There are many normal methods that we use to detect exoplanets, but none of them work well in the case of the 9th planet. Here are some of the main ones. 

The arrows indicate simulations where the system was stable over timescales greater than $\sim10^7$ years. Additionally, as Ford et al. note, 

There are a lot of instances (such as those you pointed out) in all of science and mathematics where a symbol can mean two different things. In mathematics, there's actually a good deal of this (and the article says that the list is incomplete!). Many are based on letters, although they may have deviated from the original shape in order to make a distinction regarding just what the heck the thing actually means. Eventually, you run out of letters. You can opt to use symbols from another language, the first choice for many being Greek. That roughly doubles the amount of letter-based symbols available to you. But there are still a lot of duplicates, as you can see by browsing through the lists here and here. To my knowledge, this is the most comprehensive list easily available. And yes, there are loads of duplicates. But the great thing is that you almost certainly won't have to use the same variable to mean multiple things in one equation, or set of equations. For example, I doubt you'll need to use $V$ for voltage, volume and shear force all in the same equation! 

So far, we have no definite confirmation that these stars were failed supernovae. However, they do seem plausible candidates, and there are many more possibilities out there. One group proposed monitoring one million supergiants in an attempt to catch failed supernovae. Perhaps they'll be successful. 

This is basically asking if the eccentricity (and therefore inclination) can be described by some periodic function. Again, this is given in the Wikipedia article. A slightly different but just as simple xpresison is given in Takeda & Rasio (2005): $$\text{Kozai Period}=P_{\text{perturbed}}\left(\frac{m_{\text{star}}+m_{\text{perturbed}}}{m_{\text{perturber}}}\right)\left(\frac{a_{\text{perturber}}}{a_{\text{perturbed}}}\right)^3(1-e_{\text{perturber}}^2)^{3/2}$$ In the approximation discussed above, in cases of extreme mass difference, $m_{\text{perturbed}}\to0$. 

For an overview, see Millan-Gabet (2011). As the authors note in section 3, the interferometer's primary observing wavelengths (about $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-7}\text{ m}$, the micrometer range) encompass the peak emission wavelengths of circumstellar dust. Additionally, the resolution at these wavelengths can resolve features of circumstellar disks. As we determined before, it's hard to build a telescope of comparable resolution operating in the near-infrared. Remember, our single-dish telescope operates largely in the optical range, although it would of course have near-infrared capabilities, to an extent. Therefore, an interferometer like the Keck Interferometer is our best choice - and perhaps our only choice, in the foreseeable future. However, it's certainly possible to build extremely large telescopes operating at slightly shorter wavelengths, with roughly the same angular resolution (to an order of magnitude, really). Plus, they'll gather more light, and - as I found shortly before posting this, in an excellent answer by Rob Jeffries - limitations of interferometer instruments and atmospheric issues makes them less versatile than large, single-dish telescopes. TL;DR There are a few takeaways here: 

In a nutshell . . . . . . we have good theories for the processes that make stars possible, one of which is nuclear fusion. We know very well how nuclear fusion should change elements over time and thus how the composition of any sample of material should change. We also know that fusion is the process the powers stars; therefore, we can create models that show how fusion in a star should cause it to change and evolve over time. Those models then match empirical data. 

As far as I can tell, that honor goes to Kepler-70b. Estimates for its surface temperature range up to 7,143 K. The other confirmed planet in the system, Kepler-70c, may also be extremely hot. The two orbit their parent star - a hot b-type subdwarf - at distances of 0.0060 and 0.0076 AU, respectively, and thus receive quite a lot of radiation. The discovery paper (Charpinet et al. (2011)) reported that the two are likely chthonian planets, having been engulfed in the star's envelope during its red giant phase. The Habitable Planets Catalog has lists of top exoplanet extremes. Kepler-70b and Kepler-70c top the list of hottest exoplanets, and are listed as having surface temperatures of 7,143 K and 6,351 K, respectively. I would imagine that planets close in would have much greater surface temperatures, as they are heated more; these two may also have residual heat from the engulfment. There are several other exoplanets on the lists that top 2,000 K (there are likely more): 

I ask partly because I know that the standard polytropic model (with $n=3$) begins to fail in the outer regions of a star, thanks in part to convection, as shown below, and I wondered if even a simple two-phase model could suitably describe a convective envelope. $URL$ 

I'm not aware if the "processing and analysis" was done by the RATAN team or an outside group, but it seems more and more like the signal is not in fact from an extraterrestrial civilization. We'll probably find out more details two weeks from now. 

78 years later, we have better data about the structure of the Sun, thanks in part to helioseismology. So I have two questions: 

All of these objects would have formed some hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang, however, so the light we see from them is much "younger" than that of the cosmic microwave background. 

I can't find a source for the answer to this, but I would expect there wouldn't be any problems. You should be able to undo any maneuvers that would change the orbit of the craft. 

The recent discovery of new planets around the star TRAPPIST-1 happened by observations from 7 ground-based telescopes, as well as the Spitzer Space Telescope. The team of astronomers responsible has noted that there are many relevant parameters which still have large uncertainties, including orbital information and planetary mass. There's also some excitement about possible atmospheric composition. Are there any definite planned future observations of the system? I assume that at some point it will be targeted by the James Webb Space Telescope, but that won't launch for another year and a half, and it has plenty of other targets. I'm not looking for detailed information - I know that cannot be easily gathered - but if there are any general mentions, like this one about the Subaru Telescope and Planet Nine, that would be fantastic. 

However, Mars may pass through the comet's coma and be hit by any dust particles there. It will certainly be observable from the Martian surface: The comet will have an apparent magnitude of -6 at its peak. It will be quite a show, but nothing extraordinarily special. The damage to orbiting spacecraft around Mars will likely be minimal. 90 minutes after the comet passes Mars, the worst of the dust particles will hit the spacecraft. The tiny barrage will only last about 20 minutes, though, and there is a low probability of damage. In fact, the various orbiters will take pictures of the comet and try to analyze it to learn more about its properties. I hope this helps. Other sources: $URL$ $URL$ Update: As of about an hour after the encounter, Mars still exists. Read this article for some not-so-juicy details. 

Wikipedia gives a good estimate for this: 1,200 degrees Celsius. For a planet, that's pretty hot! Any water there would evaporate very quickly. In fact, it is expected that a lot of the planet's surface is molten. Now, does this apply to the back side of the planet? I would think so. While only the front side of the planet would bask in the warmth of Alpha Centauri B, the heat should dissipate throughout the entire planet. 

The latest measurements suggest that their masses lie in a metastable region of the graph (which could be bad), although it's towards the stable end of the region (which is good). This vacuum catastrophe could still happen, but the odds aren't in its favor. I also suggest reading some of the excellent papers in the references section of the Wikipedia article. They're quite comprehensive. 

In general, the frequency of gravitational waves emitted by a binary system is $f=2f_{\text{orb}}$, where $f_{\text{orb}}$ is the orbital frequency of the system. In the late evolutionary phases during which gravitational waves from supermassive black hole binaries are detectable, the orbital periods are still comparatively large, measured in the months or years. Near coalescence, we still have an upper frequency bound, because the maximum frequency $f_{\text{max}}$ is proportional to $\sqrt{G\rho}$, where $\rho$ is some sort of density for the system. In the case of a black hole, $\rho\propto M/R^3$, and since the Schwarzschild radius $R_s\propto M$, we find that $f_{\text{max}}\propto\sqrt{M/M^3}=M^{-1}$. Therefore, the more massive the black hole, the lower the maximum orbital frequency. For supermassive black holes, this turns out to be in the nanohertz regime, give or take an order of magnitude. 

I think there's a misinterpretation here that's causing your confusion. There's a difference between the event horizon of a black hole and the cosmological horizon. The event horizon of a black hole is the place inside which nothing can escape from the black hole. The cosmological horizon, on the other hand, is the place beyond which an observer cannot "retrieve information." The difference between the two is basically that the event horizon of a black hole is in the same place for observers in different locations, while the cosmological horizon differs for observers in different locations. Also, if the cosmological horizon was the edge of a black hole, the black hole would have to be centered right where we are - which is highly unlikely! 

In the 2018 paper, the authors note that the conflict with the Planck data is even stronger - $3.7\sigma$. They haven't been able to point a figure at any single problem that could be behind the discrepancy; they do optimistically say that it could be the sign of new physics. 

In a few billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will collide. Chances are, there won't be many spectacular stellar collisions, and there's a pretty good chance that the Solar system (and most other stellar systems) won't be flung out into deep space, or be torn apart by incoming stars. But what about on a larger scale? The product of the collision - dubbed "Milkomeda" - will be an elliptical galaxy, unlike the Milky Way and Andromeda, which are both spiral galaxies. My question is this: How will the structure of the spiral arms be effectively destroyed by the collision? What mechanisms will cause them to coalesce, and what structures will take their place? 

On the whole, rotation will have a large impact, especially when it comes to core bounce and convection. This should be obvious; it creates an asymmetry before the collapse. Will we be able to detect those waves? It seems likely. Figure 132 of Kotake et al. indicates that some of our present detectors should be sensitive enough to detect neutrino- and matter- based gravitational waves from close sources ($\sim10\text{ kpc}$): 

It is true that a surprisingly large number of stars are smaller (and thus less massive) than the Sun. However, the stars that are bigger than the Sun are often much bigger. Look at this chart: 

I'm not sure what you mean by "heating effect". The amount another body is heated by a star with luminosity $L$ is quantified by its effective temperature: $$T_{eff}=\left(\frac{L(1-a)}{16\pi\sigma D^2}\right)^{1/4}$$ where $a$ is the albedo, $D$ is the distance to the other body, and $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. If the luminosity is given, then there is no direct dependence on the size of the star. The only thing that matters is the luminosity. You stated yourself that the luminosities are the same, which means that the red star in question is likely a red supergiant - a member of a group containing many of the largest stars in the universe. Why, mathematically, is this the case? Well, stellar models can tell us that this is the case, but we can also figure this out via the Stefan-Boltzmann law by assuming that the stars are black bodies. For an object of radius $R$ and temperature $T$, the luminosity is approximately $$L=4\pi\sigma R^2T^4$$ If star 1 is a blue supergiant and star 2 is a red supergiant, then, setting the luminosities equal, we have $$L_1=L_2\to R_1^2T_1^4=R_2^2T_2^4$$ We know that $T_2$ is much less than $T_1$ - possibly by an order of magnitude - so $R_2$ must be much larger for the luminosities to be the same. This matches what we observe and what models predict. 

Light scatters in the atmosphere; in fact, one type of scattering is why the sky is blue. The longer travel distance means that there is much more scattering of ultraviolent light, which in turn means that the light you see is less intense. Okay, you say. But doesn't the eclipse still block a lot of light? Well, unless there's 100% coverage - totality - there's still plenty of light coming from the uncovered part of the Sun, and that matters. The uncovered part is as bright as it normally is, and looking at that part is just as dangerous with or without the eclipse. There's one more thing to consider, which is that people watching a sunset don't look at the Sun; they look at the clouds and sky around the Sun. If you look directly at the Sun, your eyes will be damaged, no matter what's happening, an eclipse or a sunset. 

Tidal circularization is indeed a plausible mechanism for why Triton's orbital eccentricity is so low, and I believe it is in fact the prevailing theory, at the moment. In short, tidal forces from Neptune dissipate energy in Triton's interior, essentially "squeezing" the moon. This results in a loss of orbital kinetic energy. The exact calculations that lead to the decrease in eccentricity are a little complicated - and described in the paper you linked to - but in a nutshell, Triton's orbit could have circularized on a timescale of about $\sim10^7$ to $\sim10^8$ years (Ross & Schubert (1990), for instance, computed the latter order-of-magnitude timescale). Tidal circularization is not the only possible explanation for Triton's low eccentricity. Cuk & Gladman (2005) hypothesized that there was once a debris disk around Neptune, possibly caused by the collision of two or more other satellites after gravitational interactions with Triton. Interactions with the disk then contributed to energy loss from the moon in the same way that tidal circularization might have, thus leading to a smaller eccentricity. Interestingly enough, though, this could have happened within only $\sim10^5$ years! The authors have suggested that a hybrid of the two models may be the best explanation.
