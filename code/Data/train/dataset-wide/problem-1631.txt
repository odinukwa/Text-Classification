A recognizable example of this would be the brightest star in Taurus, Aldebaran. Aldebaran appears in the V-shaped bull's head, mostly formed by stars in the Hyades star cluster. However, while those stars are actually close to one another, Aldebaran is less than half as far away. 

I'm pretty sure that the stripe is there because the two sections of the image have different contrasts. Pluto and Charon are so bright relative to Nix, Hydra, P4 and P5 that to have one contrast, you'd either (a) not be able to see the smaller four, or (b) totally wash out the image with the light from the brighter two. So we simply superimpose two images at different brightnesses (or gains, I guess). 

The mean density of the star is really only defined by the formula $\bar\rho=M/V=3M/4\pi R^3$. The radius of a star is a generally a very complicated function of a star's other properties. When we determine the radius in stellar models, it's only because we've solved equations that describe the structure of the whole star, and read off the value at what we define as the surface. So no simple formula in general. That said, one can derive the approximate functional dependence for stars of various evolutionary states through the principle of homology. i.e. assuming that stars of a certain type are just rescaled versions of each other. Glancing at my old course notes, on the upper main sequence, where stars burn hydrogen principally through the CNO cycle and have radiative envelopes dominated by electron-scattering opacity, we derived $R\propto M^{15/19}$. The same principle (but with different assumptions about the star) is used to determine the location of the Hayashi track for pre-main-sequence stars, along which $R\propto M^{-7}T^{49}$. Particular formulae can be found for different types of star but the relationships between $M$ and $R$ vary wildly. Neither the two stars you mentioned are typical main-sequence stars. R136a1 is a Wolf-Rayet star, which is basically a star that has blasted away most of its hydrogen envelope. Mass-radius relations are usually strongly dependent on mean molecular weight, which is higher without hydrogen, so the relations break down (or, rather, would have to be derived separately). But usually higher mean molecular weight gives a more compact star. UY Scuti has probably finished burning hydrogen in its core and has moved off the main sequence. So again, it'll follow a different relation. 

One of the most massive Supermassive Black Hole observed is the one at the centre of the galaxy NGC1600 with a mass of 17 billion suns. It would have a density of âˆ¼0.01kg/m^3, or one part in 100,000 times the density of water, or 1% the density of earth atmosphere at sea level. But if there is so much gas why isn't the bh shrinking and becoming more dense as gravity would pull everything together? 

Of course scientists assume there would also be exoplanets in other galaxies besides our own Milkyway. Is it true that our telescopes are not good enough to see planets in other galaxies, nor by brightness changes of the stars nor by inclination changes of stars. If so could the total mass of those galaxies be an indication of the presence of exoplanets, or is dark matter a problem for that? 

In our Milkyway all the stars are orbitting around the black hole in the center. But what is the cause it this rotation and are there galaxies where the stars aren't orbitting a center? 

Neutrino's are very small though they have mass. Because of that it is probably that the don't have a speed faster than photons. But is it in all events, like supernova's or else events, where it is possible that we first receive their neutrino's instead of their light? Perhaps gravity or other interactions could change something in their way to earth? 

When galaxies move away from us (caused by the expanding spacetime) their light seems to show a redshift. But what is really needed for this? What time lap is for example needed to see a difference in frequency, and how does this precisely work? Is this also possible for gravitational waves, or are amplitudes the only solution to derive the redshift from? 

The changes of the sunrise and sunset times not expire regularly in a straight line but according to a sinusoid. Around the solstice (summer solstice on June 21st and winter solstice on December 21), the day length changes the least. The difference in sunrise and sunset in the days around the solstice is only a few tens of seconds per day. At equinox (March 20 and September 23), the length of day and night on earth is everywhere the same. The difference in day length from day to day around the equinox is changing rapidly. The difference in the length of day can rise around the time of equinox to 3 minutes per day. This asymmetrical lengthening and shortening of the days is because the "middle" of the day, every day a little shifts. This has to do with the fact that the earth does not describe a exact circle orbit around the sun, but an elliptical orbit. Because the Earth's axis at an angle to the orbit around the sun takes the shorter and longer are the days asymmetrical. As for the elliptical orbit, I understand that, for example,the sun is the farthest from the earth in the summer (on northern hemispere). Because of the (second) law of areas of Kepler is the speed of the earth there the slowest. In itself, I understand then that at that time the difference in day length also is shorter. That is during June 21 (summer solstice). But so is apparently also on the winter solstice on 21 December. Precisely at that time the earth is closest to the Sun (perihelion) so the earth has a higher speed. But because of the higher rate would you expect the day lengthening/shortening would therefore be greater. However, it appears not to be so. How is that possible? So the question in short terms: sunrise in june on the 21 at 5:30 and 22 at 5:31 etc sunrise in march on the 21 at 7:30 and 22 at 7:33 So the difference is in june one minute and in march it is 3 minutes. And the question is what causes that the difference is bigger in march then in june. See $URL$ for a bigger disquisition 

Basically you need to convert between luminosities (which you can add) and magnitudes using $$M-M_\odot=-2.5\log_{10}(L/L_\odot)$$ Let's call the total luminosity $L_0$ and magnitude $M_0$ and the individual luminosities and magnitudes $L_1$, $L_2$ and $L_3$ and $M_1$, $M_2$ and $M_3$. Then, you have the total luminosity of the system, directly $$L_0/L_\odot=10^{-0.4(M_0-M_\odot)}$$ and as the sum of the components $$L_0/L_\odot=(L_1+L_2+L_3)/L_\odot=10^{-0.4(M_1-M_\odot)}+10^{-0.4(M_2-M_\odot)}+10^{-0.4(M_3-M_\odot)}$$ Solving these equations for $M_3$ gives $$M_3-M_\odot=-2.5\log_{10}\left(10^{-0.4(M_0-M_\odot)}-10^{-0.4(M_1-M_\odot)}-10^{-0.4(M_2-M_\odot)}\right)$$ I'm assuming you have absolute magnitudes, but you can rewrite the formulae in terms of apparent magnitudes using $$M=m+5(1-\log_{10}d)$$ but I think the result then also depends on the distance. 

To answer the question, the point at which the "He burn" line intersects $10^8\,\mathrm{K}$ is around $4000\,\mathrm{g.cm}^{-3}$ but you can also see how the boundary varies somewhat as a function of temperature. As a disclaimer, I don't actually know where these numbers come from but I'm asking around about it. If I find out, I'll update this answer. 

It's pretty easy to put upper limits on how bright any nearer stars could be. As a rough guide, consider a survey like Hipparcos, which is complete to something like 9th magnitude. If there's another star closer than Alpha Centauri, the brightest possibility is if it's at the same distance. Wolfram|Alpha tells us that a magnitude 9 star at Alpha Centauri's distance would have a luminosity of about 0.0004 times solar. Using the rough main-sequence mass-luminosity relation, $L\propto M^{3.5}$, that would give a mass of about 0.11 times solar. So already, you can see that if there's anything out there it's barely a star even if it's as distant as Alpha Centauri, and otherwise almost certainly a brown dwarf. I'm sure more recent surveys will place even stronger limits. Admittedly, the catch here is that the brightness will be concentrated at longer and longer wavelengths as the mass decreases, so things could be a bit bigger on the ground that we may have only looked in the wrong band so far. But even so, I think the sum of present observations make it nearly impossible that there are any stars closer to us than Alpha Centauri. 

I don't know how common it is for a system to have two stars (or perhaps even more) but how do they arise? Is that due to the stellar accretion disc, or the composition of the stellar nebula? Or are most of them created by a collision of stars? 

I'm a right that the difference is that precession indicates the direction of the inclination of the Earth'axis and the tilt is the quantity of this inclination? So that when there is no tilt there can't be any precession? And are the inclination degrees of the precession and the tilt related or the same? It seems that the precession causes different possible polarstar, but is the tilt also have effect on this? Perhaps this above it not right, so what else is the difference? Is perhaps the precession just the changing of the tilt? 

A star emits energy through the fusion of hydrogen to helium in the core through the proton proton cycle or the carbon nitrogen cycle. Over time, hydrogen in the core is increasingly burned, which causes the fusion process to decrease over time. As a result, the star cools down and decreases the radiation pressure in the core. As a result, the core draws a little more together under the influence of its own weight, which increases the temperature. This temperature rise leads to a hydrogen fusion in a shell outside the core. But how is the temperature increased as the radiation pressure is decreased? Is this increase caused by conduction or convection or....? 

Of course it is not exactly known how big the universe is, but I thougt that the universe is about 100 billion lightyears in diameter. But if that is true can you also make an estimation of the volume of the universe? 

In the GR Einstein's interpretation was in terms of a deformation of the geometry of the space ending in a curvature of spacetime. I've thought that mass could do this by interacting with other mass and causes gravitational waves which makes the space curved. But a prof told me that this isn't the case. For example the gravitational waves caused between the earth and the sun is just a very tiny effect which causes spiraling earth to the sun which is of little effect. So mass is establishing the geometry of the space and the time. But the question remains how is mass doing that (curving spacetime)?
