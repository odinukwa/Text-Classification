The intuition is that given a lift of a path $\gamma$ through $p$, one can find a neighbourhood $U$ of the image of $\gamma$ and a neighbourhood $V$ of the image of the lift such that for every path in $U$ one can smoothly choose a lift to $V$. Here I suppose we need a submersion of Frechet manifolds to be a map that admits local sections through every point in the domain, if that is the 'correct' notion of submersion in that setting (certainly not the 'surjective on tangent spaces' version). I think the proof would use the characterisation of submersions as maps which look locally (on both the domain and codomain) like projections $U \times \mathbb{R}^n \to U$, and the existence of good open covers with smooth contractions. I think I'm able to prove that there are continuous sections through every point in the domain, thinking of everything as a topological space, and using the compact-open topology on the mapping spaces. But I don't know off the top of my head that the compact-open topology on the space of smooth paths is the same as the topology inherited from the Frechet manifold structure. (My guess is that it is.) My question: is the claim true? 

The topology is a preorder/post/lattice (amongst other things), and there are various topologies one can put on lattices: the Alexandrov topology the Scott topology the Lawson topology In general domain theory brings up lots of things along this line 

Recall that the geometric realisation functor $| - |: sSet \to Top$ preserves products (choosing $Top = k Space$ or similar). Thus any given singleton Grothendieck pretopology on $Top$ gives rise to a singleton pretopology on $sSet$. I have in mind three, no four, examples: 

Standard notation in graph theory? In category theory the analogous thing can be denoted $disc(V)$ where $V$ is the set of vertices. 

The space $X = \mathbb{R}^2 - \mathbb{Q}^2$ is not semilocally simply connected, and so in a sense the fundamental group is a poor measure of the homotopy 1-type of $X$. It is an exercise in Hatcher's book Algebraic Topology that this group is uncountable. Here is an attempt to motivate a different view of the fundamental group: Consider the space $X_{n,m}$ which is the complement in $\mathbb{R}^2$ of all points with coordinates $(p/n,q/m)$ where $n,m$ are positive integers and $q,p$ are integers. This forms a cofiltered diagram $\mathbb{N}^2 \to Top$ whose limit is $X$, and where each space in the diagram is semilocally simply-connected. There is a map $X_{n,m} \to X_{n',m'}$ when $n'|n$ and $m'|m$. The fundamental group of $X_{n,m}$ is free on a countable number of generators (a generator is given by a small circle around each deleted point, and connect this circle to the basepoint, $(\pi,\pi)$, say, by a path), and the maps between them kill off certain generators. Already, you can see how complicated $\pi_1(X)$ is going to be, since it has a countable number of quotients, each of which is free on a countable number of generators (actually, each of them is isomorphic to the free group on generators $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$). This system of groups is known as a (strict) progroup, and can be thought of as a formal limit This is usually the 'right' algebraic object to consider when one has a badly behaved space such as this one. It is this object which 'controls' what the covering spaces of $X$ look like, as $X$ doesn't have a universal covering space (which if it did exist, would have fibre $\pi_1(X)$, and other connected covering spaces would be quotients of this one). This gets into the realm of shape theory (wikipedia, nLab), developed to consider spaces with bad local homotopy properties. 

I've been wondering lately what sort of Grothendieck (pre)topologies there are on $Cat$ (the category of small categories) and $CAT$ (the v. large category of large categories - to forestall criticism I shall silently assume from now on enough universes to work around size issues). Neither are regular categories, so we don't have the usual pretopology consisting of regular epimorphisms, but we do have the canonical pretopology 1) What is the canonical pretopology on $Cat$? And by this I don't just mean 'the regular epimorphisms that are stable under pullback', but a characterisation of these. There are a number of model structures on $Cat$, namely the Thomason model structure and the canonical model structure (often called the 'folk' model structure) and presumably others. The fibrations in any of these model structures constitute a pretopology. Given a (blah) model structure, call the associated pretopology of fibrations the (blah) pretopology. 2) What do the sheaves look like for the Thomason and 'folk' pretopologies? If we consider $CAT$, then there are number of interesting classes of functors one could conjecture to form a pretopology, like those that are projections from a topological concrete category (these may be called 'topological' in the literature, but this is ambiguous terminology), functors with left (or right) adjoints, monadic functors, localisation functors (or families of localisation functors, as sometimes occurs in non-commutative algebraic geometry a la Rosenberg/Gabriel/et al, but strictly speaking this is a co-pretopology), bifibrations, and so on. If we look at subcategories of $CAT$ then there are more options: geometric morphisms (with certain properties) between topoi come to mind. 3) Do any of these (or any others you can think of) form pretopologies? Are their categories of sheaves interesting at all? 

Background Lurie has in DAG XI a definition (given below) of a Nisnevich cover for arbitrary commutative rings, which reduces to the usual one for Noetherian rings. It boils down to being a etale covering family admitting local sections over a different, finite, cover of a particular sort. In particular, we can assume wlog it is a finite etale family. The usual definition of a Nisnevich cover of schemes uses the (locally) Noetherian assumption and I would like to translate this into the Lurie style definition, but my algebraic geometry-foo is not up to scratch. This possibly is a simple question, but bear with me. Details We will work initially in $Ring$, so that what we are describing is really a cocovering family, but the translation to $Aff = Ring^{op}$ is of course trivial. Consider the following definition: 

The nLab casually remarks that locally convex tvs embed into diffeological spaces by (discussion around) a corollary in Kriegl and Michor, namely 3.14, but this deals with Boman's theorem and results about smooth maps from a euclidean space to a locally convex spaces. The definition of smoothness for maps $U \to V$ where $U$ is $c^\infty$-open in a lctvs $W$, and $V$ is a lctvs, is given so that smooth maps are automatically the same as between maps between the associated diffeological spaces. However, there is a notion of smoothness for maps between lctvs (due to Michal [1,2] and Bastiani [3]) not relying on K&M's definition, but I don't how they relate (Keller [4] treats this, I think, but I don't have access to that book at the moment). 

EDIT In the comments Ariyan Javanpeykar identifies this concept as a map of stacks being representable by algebraic stacks, which appears a few times in the literature without being formally defined and I guess must be a kind of folklore definition (it's not too difficult to guess, but I cannot find a paper that uses the phrase that also gives a definition). What I would like to use such a thing for is to look at geometric properties of maps of stacks that are representable by algebraic stacks, much as one can talk about geometric properties of maps that are representable (by schemes, or by algebraic spaces, even). It may be one gains nothing new, but it might allow for a more flexible definition in some cases. 

Addendum: in the special case that the groupoids have only one object, and so can be identified with groups, I think what I'm after is the (extension of the) pushforward map that takes an integrable function on the domain and gives back a measure on the codomain. But I'm aware that generalising to groupoids sometimes isn't quite so straightforward. 

So this is one of the things VV was hoping to prove, and formally, so this niggling issue could be put to rest. 

Part 1: How big is the category $TVS_{loc.conv.}$ of locally convex topological vector spaces (and continuous maps)? In other words (and less cheekily), is there a free locally convex TVS having any given set as basis? This would imply the functor $TVS_{loc.conv.} \to Set$ is essentially surjective and has an adjoint. Part 2: Consider now the intersection $T$ of $TVS_{loc.conv.}$ (as a subcategory of $Top$) with $CGWH$, the subcategory of $Top$ of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces. How big is $T$? (Or, is $T$ essentially small?) Note that a Banach space is locally compact iff it is finite dimensional, but I am being stupid and not remembering the relationship between local compactness and compact generation, so I can't immediately use this fact. 

Figure 1 on page 7 of these notes gives a few more of the less common (pre)topologies: cdp, fps$\ell'$ etc. 

To start with think of $Cat$ as a 1-category. The functor $Obj:Cat \to Set$ sending a small category to its set of objects is a fibration. This can be easily seen by constructing, given a category $C = (C_1 \rightrightarrows C_0)$ and a function $f:A \to C_0$, the set of arrows $A^2 \times_{f,C_0^2}C_1$ (the pullback of $(s,t):C_1 \to C_0^2$) of the category $C[f]$. The cartesian lift of $f$ is then the canonical functor $F:C[f]\to C$. Now given another function $g:A\to C_0$ -- giving rise to $G:C[g]\to C$ -- and a natural transformation $F \Rightarrow G$ there is a canonical isomorphism $C[f]\simeq C[g]$ over $C$. Thus if we think of Cat as a 2-category, there is something extra going on. For example, one gets a pseudofunctor $Set \to 2Cat$ on choosing specified pullbacks to define $C[f]$. My question(s): 

In the (whimsically written) article Division by three, Doyle and Conway describe a proof, (apparently) not using Choice, that an isomorphism $A \times 3 \simeq B\times 3$ of sets (where $3$ is a given three-element set) gives an isomorphism $A \simeq B$. The result is easy for well-ordered $A$ and $B$, but clearly assuming this isn't constructive. However, the authors seem (to me) to use excluded middle. Also, I don't know if I'm entirely convinced they avoid all forms of choice - it may be they are relying on some weak form of choice (aside from excluded middle). Has anyone given this any thought? The article is from the mid-90s despite its ArXiV date, and purports to have discovered a lost proof of Lindenbaum from the 1920s which predates a different proof given by Tarski in 1949. 

Question as in title (Diff = category of smooth manifolds and smooth maps) I thought I'd convinced myself this is true, so this is just a sanity check. Also, what about for settings other than smooth manifolds? (like analytic manifolds, complex manifolds, or less differentiable - say, $C^2$ manifolds) 

Quillen shows at the beginning of his article on higher algebraic K-theory that you can calculate the fundamental group $\pi_1(C,a)$ of a category $C$ at an object $a$ by forming the localisation $C[Mor(C)^{-1}]$ at all arrows, then by taking $Hom(a,a) = Aut(a)$ in this groupoid. There are size issues, clearly, but for essentially small $C$ these can be ignored. 

Less tongue in cheek, is it known what the relative consistency is for theorems proved with an automatic theorem prover? Of course this depends somewhat on what assumptions one makes with respect to predicativity and so on. But for concreteness take one of the popular packages with its standard installation. Perhaps this is a can of worms, or a piece of string of indeterminate length, but the recent surge of interest in Voevodsky's univalent foundations raises questions about the consistency strength of the system HoTT he (and others) propose. 

This question is a little vague, I'm afraid, because I'm not sure I expect there to be a complete answer; but there should be some sort of situations where it is possible. Consider a Riemannian manifold $M$ of bounded geometry and positive injectivity radius, so that we have plenty of geodesically convex charts. Let $K\subset M$ be a regular closed subset (i.e. is equal to the closure of its interior) such that the boundary is rough -- say at best Lipschitz. For instance, take (the closure of) a corkscrew domain, an NTA domain, John domain etc. I'm even willing to just consider the interior corkscrew condition. Now I am interesting in applying results that would hold if $\partial K$ were contained entirely in a chart to 'larger' $K$. This means I need to cover $\partial K$ with geodesic balls, and in my setup I would like to take balls $B_i$ of half the radius (still covering) so that the closures of said smaller balls form a closed cover. It is at this point my feeling for what might possibly go wrong fails me, and I have no idea if things can break at this point, due to bad behaviour of the intersection $\partial B_i \cap \partial K$, or what-have-you. As an example, this paper considers 'locally strongly Lipschitz domains', which have the pleasant property there exist transverse vector fields along the boundary, which I can see might ensure one could find 'nice' $B_i$ with 'nice' $\partial B_i \cap \partial K$. Ahlfors regularity seems to be prominent here. To give a concrete idea of what I'm doing, I'm considering extension operators for functions on $K$ to functions on $M$, and hoping to work locally and then patch together by smooth partitions on unity. The trouble is, I don't know that, when I restrict to the local problem, I get something resembling a reasonable set under the chart map: it seems to me to depend on making sure I have charts whose boundaries intersect $\partial K$ in a nice way. Once I have that out of the way, I seem to be able to proceed without issue. 

Recall that a singleton Grothendieck pretopology (henceforth 'singleton pretopology') on a category $C$ is a collection of maps $J$ containing the isomorphisms, closed under composition and stable under pullback (i.e. pullbacks of them exist, and they are stable). Each map is to be considered a covering family with a single element. Consider the following two conditions: 

Given a base site $S$ of schemes, consider a stack $\mathcal{C}$ on $S$ not assumed to be algebraic. Then in principle, given another stack $\mathcal{E}$ on $S$, together with a map of stacks $\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{C}$ over $S$, we could ask for $\mathcal{E}$ to be algebraic over $\mathcal{C}$. This would entail, aside from having an appropriate surjective map from a scheme or algebraic space, demanding that $\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{E} \times_{\mathcal{C}} \mathcal{E}$ was representable. At this point I'm being agnostic whether $\mathcal{E}$ is in fact a stack over $\mathcal{C}$, since the definition I give doesn't require this (and if $\mathcal{C}$ is not fibred in groupoids, which is conceivable, this is not always possible to organise). Has this concept appeared in the literature? I cannot find anything about it in the Stacks Project. 

Lurie, in his ICM 2010 proceedings paper Moduli Problems for Ring Spectra (pdf), says that one motivating problem (for him, I presume, and possibly others) for thinking about formal moduli problems is this: 

I will ignore the distinction here between the classifying space as a topological space or as a simplicial set. Fix for once and for all the adjunction $sSet \leftrightarrows Top$. Then giving the classifying topological space is 'just as good' as giving the classifying simplicial set. The 'classifying space' of a category qua simplicial set is then its nerve. Consider the example of the category $Set$, which is a large category whatever foundational workaround you use. The nerve of $Set$ is not a functor $\Delta \to Set$, so one is forced (no pun intended) to use some sort of formalism that allows you to 'jump up a universe'. One could take NBG set theory, with classes and sets, and the nerve of $Set$ will be a simplicial class. Or one could take algebraic set theory (which is a categorical axiomatic formulation of sets and classes), or resort to Grothendieck universes or models arising from inaccessible cardinals, as Martin says in the comments. I suppose one could try to work with simplicial classes informally, as a collection of sentences in first order logic, and the (explicitly given) maps between them, but I'm not sure how you can talk about class functions at this level. The only hope is that the face and degeneracy maps of the nerve of a category are very easy to describe, but I'm not an expert in that area.
