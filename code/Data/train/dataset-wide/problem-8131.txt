Let $P$ be a finite poset. Assign the following diagram to it - put the maximal element of $P$ on the first level, the maximal of the rest to the second level, etc. Assume that the diagram is connected, that is, that between each pair of elements in the diagram we have a chain connecting them. Let $L_n=P\times P\times\cdots\times P$ ($n$-times) to be the product poset, that is, one element in $L_n$ is larger than another if we have all inequalities coordinate-wise. Is it true that there exists and $N=N(P)$ such that for $n>N$ the following is true: In the diagram of L_n there is a perfect matching between all consecutive levels (from the one with smaller size to the one with larger size). Note: due to the useful feedback of Andres Caicedo and David Speyer the question was altered. 

Let $A$ be a finite set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ of $k^2$ elements and consider a set $B=\{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\}$ such that the points in $B$ are in general position (no three points on a line). Question 1: Is it true that $|A+B|\geq (k+1)^2$? Question 2: Is it true that $|\cap_{i}(A+x_i)|\leq (k-1)^2$? Question 3: If either of 1-2 are true, is it the case that one of the extremal sets $A$ is a discrete square? 

The proof goes as follows. The Kummer sequence gives the following commutative diagram with exact rows: $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} 0 @>{}>>\frac{\operatorname{Pic}(X)}{n\operatorname{Pic}(X)} @>{}>> H^2(X, \mu_n)@>{}>> H^2(X,\mathbf{G}_m) \\ {} @VVV @VVV @VVV {} \\ 0 @>{}>> \frac{\operatorname{Pic}(X_K)}{n\operatorname{Pic}(X_K)} @>{}>> H^2(X_K, \mu_n) @>{}>> H^2(X_K, \mathbf{G}_m) \end{CD} The middle vertical arrow is an isomorphism by the smooth base change theorem in \'{e}tale cohomology (Corollary 1.3.1 of this): 

Here is the argument I have written up in my thesis. It was suggested to me by my advisor Jarod Alper. We use the fact that a proper monomorphism is a closed immersion (EGA IV, 18.12.6). Furthermore, we will also use the functor of points perspective of the Grassmannian. Now because the Grassmannian is proper and projective space is separated, the Plucker embedding is proper (this is the property $\mathscr{P}$ exercise in Ravi Vakil's notes). Thus we just need to show it's a monomorphism. However, because : 

Since you know the answer to your last question in the case of an abelian variety $A$, I'll just treat the case of $H$. Now $k$ is algebraically closed, in particular perfect so we know that $$ H \cong D \times U$$ where $D$ is a diagonalizable group and $U$ is unipotent. Any unipotent $U$ group over a perfect field has a filtration with successive quotients isomorphic to $\mathbf{G}_a$. Therefore if $(\ell,p) = 1$ (as is the case here), $U[\ell^n] = 0$ and so $$H[\ell^n] \cong D[\ell^n].$$ In particular, we may assume that $H$ is connected diagonalizable and therefore isomorphic to $\mathbf{G}_m^q$ for some $q \in \mathbf{N}$ (there are no forms of $\mathbf{G}_m^q$ over an algebraically closed field). Hence $$\mathbf{G}_m^q[\ell^n] \cong (\mu_{\ell^n})^q$$ which has order $\ell^{nq}$. 

Let $Z_1,\ldots, Z_n$ be independent standard gaussian random variables. Is it true that $X=\max\{Z_1,\ldots,Z_n\}$ has a log-concave distribution function? 

If $p_i$ are all bounded away from $0$ and $1$ independently of $i$ and $n$ then, of course, the maximum is at most $C/\sqrt{n}$, where $C$ depends on how far the $p_i$'s are from $0$. Are there bounds that are good when the $p_i$'s are non homogeneous? Like, say, $p_i=1/i$ or even $p_i=c/n$? Are there any precise results known? Then is, can one in general obtain the exact result in some key situations? Say $p_i=1/2$? 

Let $A\subset \mathbb{R^2}$ be a finite set such that $|A|=k^2$. Let $x_i\in \mathbb{R^2}$, $i=1,2,3,4$, be four points in the plane in general position (no three lie on any line). Let us form the multiset of cardinality $4k^2$ out of the four translates $A+x_i$ and call it $M$. Question: Can we partition $M$ into four sets (not multisets) $A_i$, $i=1,2,3,4$ with cardinalities $(k+1)^2$, $(k-1)(k+3)$, $(k-1)^2$, $(k-1)^2$, respectively? Question: Are there any good references for problems of this kind? 

The solution is the following. Let's go back to situation where $F$ is a plain old sheaf, and let us think of the set $F(X)$ as a category where the only arrow $x \to x'$ is when $x = x'$, otherwise $\operatorname{Hom}(x,x') = \emptyset$. Then now to say that $F(Y) \to F(X)$ is injective is exactly equivalent to the statement that the functor $F(Y) \to F(X)$ is fully faithful. The upshot is that to make the right definition (of a prestack), we now know that: 

Let $\mathcal{O}$ be the ring of all algebraic integers in $\overline{\Bbb{Q}}$. It is a non-Noetherian integral domain of dimension $1$. For any non-zero prime $\mathfrak{p} \in \Bbb{Z}$, there are infinitely many primes $\mathfrak{p}_i$ in $\mathcal{O}$ lying above $\mathfrak{p}$, and so $\bigcap \mathfrak{p}_i \neq 0$. 

By Cohomology and base change, we know that $R^if_\ast \mathcal{O}_X|_{\eta_Y} = 0$. However, because $f$ is not assumed proper, we do not know if $R^if_\ast \mathcal{O}_X$ is coherent. This leads me to suspect that the statement may be false, but I cannot come up with a counterexample. 

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite graph and let $f$ be any positive function defined on the vertices. Put weights on the vertices $v_{i}$, way $w_{i}$ so that $\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\leq 1$. Assume that every independent set of vertices, say $I$, satisfies $\sum_{v_i\in I}w_{i}\leq 1/2$. I would like to maximize over all choices of the weights the following expression (the average of f):$\\$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(v_i)w_{i}.\\$$ Question: is it true, that at least one global maximum is achieved by either i) putting weights $1/2$ on a pair of two neighboring vertices or ii) putting a weight $1/2$ on one vertex and $0$ on all of the others? Remark: the second situation can arise, for example, in the case $G$ is the empty graph and the value of $f$ at one vertex is strictly larger than on the other vertices. 

Consider $m$ unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with positive coordinates so that $m>n$. How does one pick the $m$ unit vectors so that the largest inner product of them is the smallest? 

it is enough to show the base change $$ \textbf{Gr}(d,n)_I \to \Bbb{P}\big(\bigwedge\nolimits^{\!d} \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} \Bbb{Z}}^{\oplus n}\big)_I$$ is a monomorphism. One can view fact (2) above as the $\mathcal{O}_X$-module analog of the fact that a matrix is invertible iff its determinant is non-zero. Now given a scheme $X$ and quotient $\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\oplus n} \twoheadrightarrow \mathcal{F}$, we may always replace it with a quotient $\mathcal{O}_X^{\oplus n} \twoheadrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X^I$ such that the composition $\mathcal{O}_X^I \hookrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X^{\oplus n} \twoheadrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X^I$ is the identity. This follows from the definition of when two quotients are equal in $\textbf{Gr}(d,n)_I(X)$. Henceforth, we will only work with quotients $M : \mathcal{O}_X^{\oplus n} \twoheadrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X^I$ of the following form: $M$ is a matrix (with coefficients in $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$) such that the $d$ columns of $M$ corresponding to the subset $I$ are equal to the columns of the $d \times d$ identity matrix. Now let $X$ be a scheme and suppose there are two quotients $M,M' \in \textbf{Gr}(d,n)_I(X)$ such that $\bigwedge^d M$ and $\bigwedge^d M'$ are equal. This by definition means we have a diagram where the top, bottom rows are the identity and so is the left most column. Thus the displayed isomorphism is an honest equality. But now this means that the $d \times d$ minors of $M$ and $M'$ are equal and hence $M = M'$. In other words, the map $\textbf{Gr}(d,n)_I \to \Bbb{P}(\bigwedge^d \mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} \Bbb{Z}}^{\oplus n})_I$ is a monomorphism as claimed. 

Let $\varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_n$ be independent random variables taking values $0,1$ each with probability $1/2$. It is well known that $R_n=\varepsilon_1+ \cdots+ \varepsilon_n$ modulo a prime $p$ tends to the uniform distribution on $\mathbb{Z}_p$ (say, in total variation distance, but also in a lot of other senses). Is it known what the speed of convergance is? Let us say I want to bound $\delta_n=\sup_{k}|\mathbb{P}(\varepsilon_1+ \cdots+ \varepsilon_n=k)-1/p|$ in terms of $n$. Is it true that $\delta_n$ converges to $0$ exponentially? If this is true, could you provide a decent reference? Many thanks for the attention. 

Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be independent random variables in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $EX_i=0$ and $||X_i||_{2}\leq 1$. What is the best known exponential upper bound for $$P(||X_1+\cdots+X_n||_{2}>x)?$$ In particular, is it true, that the one dimensional case (Hoeffding's inequality) is the best? That is, is the latter probability at most $C_d\exp(-\frac{x^2}{2n})$? (the conctand $C=C_d$ is needed to account for the effects of the norm for $x$ small, that is, for $x<\sqrt{d}$ we can take all variables taking values $e_i$ and $-e_i$ with probability $1/2$, where $e_i$ stand for the usual basis of $\mathbb{R}^d$. 

I'll state what I understand of the result and then ask my question. Let $F$ denote the functor $\widehat{\operatorname{Br}}(X)$. Since $F$ is pro-representable by $\operatorname{Spf} k[[t]]$ (since $X$ is Artin supersingular), the identity element in $\operatorname{Hom}( k[[t]], k[[t]])$ gives an element $\alpha \in \varprojlim F\big(k[[t]]/t^n\big)$. It is now a question of whether $\alpha$ lies in the image of the map $$F\big(k[[t]]\big) \to \varprojlim F\big(k[[t]]/t^n\big).$$ This is what Lieblich claims in the paper when he speaks of "algebraization" in the paragraph after Proposition 4.1. However, I can't seem to find this result in the paper "Rational Curves in the moduli of Supersingular K3s" which is where he claims they're proved. My guess is that the proof of Proposition 4.1 is buried in the proof of the representability of $R^2\pi_\ast \mu_p$ in the second paper (Here $\pi : X \to \operatorname{Spec} k$ is the structure map of supersingular K3). What is the relevant thing in the second paper that pertains to this proposition? 

Let us start with what we know about sheaves, i.e. the "1-level". A sheaf on a (Grothendieck) site $\mathcal{C}$ is a contravariant functor $F : \mathcal{C}^\text{op} \to \textbf{Set}$ such that for any cover $\{ X\ \to Y\}$ , the diagram $$F(Y) \to F(X) \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} F (X \times_Y X)$$ is an equalizer in the category of sets. For the sake of exposition, I will only consider the case where the cover consists of a single element. Now suppose we want to move to the "2-level" and talk about stacks. Then we need to throw in the cocycle condition, so we can naively define a stack $F$ to be a contravariant functor $\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}} \to \textbf{Set}$ such that $$F(Y) \to F(X) \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} F (X \times_Y X)\stackrel{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}{\longrightarrow} F(X \times_Y X \times_Y X)$$ is an equalizer in the category of sets. The problem now is the following: 

Let $A$ be a set of $2k$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that no open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of diameter $2$ contains more than $k$ of these points. What is the largest possible distance $r_n>0$ one can guarantee so that for all $k$ we can pair up $2k$ points under the mentioned condition so that each pair of points is at least $r_n$ apart? It is not difficult to show that $1\leq r_n \leq 2$ ($2$ comes from just taking $|A|=2$ and proving that one can always have them at distance $1$, one can build a distance graph so that two point from $A$ are joined if they are at least $1$ apart - such graph has minimum degree at least $k$ and so has a Hamilton cycle). 

Let us say have a sequence of $n$ 2-$D$ random variables $X_i=(\varepsilon_i/\sqrt{n},i\varepsilon_{i}\sqrt{6}/n^{3/2})$, where $\varepsilon_{i}$ are independent random variables such that $\mathbb{P}(\varepsilon_i =\pm 1)=1/2$. Denote by $S_n$ their sum and take a $2$-dimensional Gaussian random variable $Z$ with the same covariance matrix as $S_n$. Any standard Berry-Esseen theorem (say by Gotze or Bhachattarya or Bentkus) gives us that for any convex set $C$ we have \begin{equation} |\mathbb{P}(S_n\in C)-\mathbb{P}(Z\in C)|\leq c\gamma, \end{equation} where gamma is the sum of third absolute moments of $X_i$, which in this case behaves like $n^{-1/2}$. Question: is there a standard way to pass from the distance between distribution functions to expectations of Lipschitz functions? That is, suppose $f$ is Lipschitz, can we still bound \begin{equation} |\mathbb{E}f(S_n)-\mathbb{E}f(Z)| \end{equation} in therms of $\gamma$? If so, does the same bound of magnitude $\gamma$ still apply? 

The following question was asked on math.stackexchange.com with no reply for the past week or so. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a morphism of smooth (integral) varieties over $\Bbb{C}$ with generic fiber equal to $\Bbb{P}^1$. 

Not exactly a book, but there are course notes on abelian varieties from a course that Brian Conrad taught a few years ago. It is definitely from the perspective of scheme theory/functor of points. 

$\require{AMScd}$ The following result holds in much more generality than asked by the OP. There is no characteristic zero/smoothness assumption. 

Since you're interested in the order of the group scheme $G[\ell^n]$, it is harmless to pass to $k = \overline{k}$ (a connected group scheme locally of finite type over $k$ is geometrically connected). Then $G_{\text{red}}$ is a closed reduced subgroup scheme of $G$ with $G_{\text{red}}[\ell^n] = G[\ell^n]$ as the latter is \'{e}tale over $k$. Therefore we may assume that $G$ is reduced, a fortiori smooth. By Chevalley's Theorem, we have an exact sequence $$0 \to H \to G \to A \to 0$$ where $H$ is a closed linear algebraic subgroup and $A$ an abelian variety.
