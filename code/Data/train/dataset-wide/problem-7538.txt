First, it may be better to ask which quivers have a maximal green sequence. Or ask which cluster algebras have a initial seed with a maximal green sequence. Greg Muller shows in The existence of a maximal green sequence is not invariant under quiver mutation that the existence of a maximal green sequence is a property of the quiver not the cluster algebra/mutation class of quiver. In this paper an example a two mutation equivalent quivers is given such that one quiver has a maximal green sequence while the other does not. Second I mentioned this post to Eric Bucher and he suggested the example of quivers coming from Le diagrams/reduced plabic graphs. In Green-to-Red Sequences for Positroids by Ford and Serhiyenko it is shown that cluster algebras arising from Le diagrams have a green-to-red sequence (a.k.a. reddening sequence). Note that the existence of a green-to-red sequence does only depend on the cluster algebra. Also it is worth noting that these cluster algebra arising from a Le diagram is thought to be the coordinate ring of the corresponding positroid variety. However, the existence of a green-to-red sequence is weaker than the existence of a maximal green sequence. The existence of a maximal green sequence in this case is still open. 

Here are a few other papers that solve the problem, but I have not been able to find any freely available paper. 

for some nontrivial $d$ and $n$. Of course one could replace "simplicial $d$-shpere" with some class between simplicial spheres and polytopal spheres and that would also be interesting. 

I believe this is still open. In Matroid Theory Second Edition by Oxley which was published in 2011 this is listed as an open problem. This problem is addressed twice in the book. First on page 219 Oxley writes: "Probably most basic unsolved problem in the study of algebraic matroids is the following..." He then lists exactly this question on the dual of an algebraic matroid. It then says Lindstrom (1985) shows that the question of whether the dual of an algebraic matroid is algebraic can be reduced to the following question: 

I have found a book available online which gives some answers to your question. The book is Graph Structure and Monadic Second-Order Logic: a Language Theoretic Approach by Courcelle and Engelfriet. I am not (at all) an expert on this topic, but the book seems like a good reference. It lists the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle as an example. Some additional interesting examples included in the book are: 

In The quantum chiral Minkowski and conformal superspaces by Cervantes, Fioresi, and Lledó the super Grassmannian of $(2|0)$ planes in $\mathbb{C}^{4|1}$ is considered. In Equation (4.9) some "super Plücker relations" are given for this particular super Grassmannian. The relations contain the classical Plücker relation for $Gr(2,4)$ plus some more relations. 

You want to partition the vertices into two parts and minimizing the number of edges between vertices in the same part. In other words you want to maximize the number of edges between the two parts. This is know as the max-cut problem and is NP-hard and APX-hard. 

What you are looking for in the number of oriented graphs on $n$ vertices. Just think of an undirected edge in an improper tournament as a missing edge in an oriented graph and vice versa. The number of oriented graphs on $n$ vertices is OEIS A001174. Note there are $7$ oriented graphs for $n=3$ vertices (not $6$). All $7$ are shown in the first link. You may also be interested in the paper The number of oriented graphs by Frank Harary. There are also the papers Asymptotic formulas for the number of oriented graphs and Asymptotic formulas for the number of oriented graphs (two papers both with same title). 

For rank 2 it is decidable since there is a combinatorial formula for cluster variables. This case is certainly simpler than the general case, but some nice properties on the rank 2 case are conjectured to hold more generally. So, I'll write a bit about the rank 2 case and a bit about how we may hope to generalize. This does not answer the whole question, but hopefully it is still useful to someone. See Theorem 1.11 of Greedy elements in rank 2 cluster algebras by Lee, Li, and Zelevinsky. For the rank 2 cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}(a,b)$ the theorem gives this formula $$x[a_1,a_2] = x_1^{-a_1} x_2^{-a_2} \sum_{(S_1, S_b)}x_1^{b|S_2|}x_2^{a|S_1|} $$ where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are defined in terms of certain Dyck paths (see the paper for details). For each $(a_1,a_2) \in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ the theorem describes corresponding the so call greedy element of the cluster algebra. It is known that each cluster variable is a greedy element, and it is known which pairs $(a_1,a_2)$ correspond to cluster variables (see Remark 1.9). As a result we can decide if a given Laurent polynomial is a cluster variable in any rank 2 cluster algebra. The $(a_1,a_2)$ is known as the denominator vector, and such denominator vectors exists in other cluster algebras too. It is conjectured that different cluster variables have different denominator vectors (see this MO question). It seems like a hard problem, but perhaps it's possible to classifying denominator vectors corresponding to cluster variables then give a combinatorial formula for the remaining polynomial like the rank 2 case. 

I am not an expert, but I would guess the reason you hear so much about 6th root of unity matroids is because there is the nice result that being a 6th root of unity matroid is equivalent to being representable over $GF(3)$ and $GF(4)$. I suppose if someone can prove a similarly nice theorem for another partial field we will hear more about them. One result which applies to the types of matroids in the question is Corollary 8.2 (b) of Homogeneous multivariate polynomials with the half-plane property by Choe, Oxley, Sokal, and Wagner which states: 

I was unable to find this master thesis through a quick google search. Some other references within the preprint may also be of interest to you. 

The cone spanned by $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)$ corresponds to a torus fixed point (which is the origin of $\mathbb{C}^3$). Subdividing this cone by adding the ray $(1,1,1)$ (the sum of the ray generators of this cone) corresponds to blowing up this $\mathbb{C}^3$ chart at the origin. Adding the ray $(-1,0,0)$ similarly blows up at the origin of another chart. In general a maximum dimensional cone in a fan corresponds to torus fixed point. If this cone is simplicial, subdividing it by adding the sum of the rays spanning a cone we obtain the blow up at this fixed point. As for a reference I know this is in Fulton’s book Introduction to Toric Varieties. I don’t have my copy of the book handy to give an exact reference. This is also discussed in Chapter 3 of the book by Cox, Little, and Schenck(see Proposition 3.3.15). Afterwards a similar construction for blowing up along larger dimensional torus invariant subvarieties is also given. 

Later on page 585 Oxley says that the intractability of the problem in the original post "prompted Lindstrom (1988) to proposed the following question." 

An explanation of important implications of these axioms happens directly after they are given in the paper. There importance is about the cluster dynamics (i.e. how things propagate from an initial seed). I will provide a few more details since the discussion in the paper is brief. The axiom E3 insures that the substitution $x_j \leftarrow \frac{M_0}{x_j}$ in E4 replaces $x_j$ with a monomial whenever the substitution actually happens. Note if at least one of $M_j(t_2)$ or $M_j(t_3)$ contain $x_i$, then $M_0$ is a monomial or zero since $x_i = 0$ in $M_0$. So, assume neither $M_j(t_2)$ or $M_j(t_3)$ involve $x_i$, then by E3 applied to $t_1 -^i t_2 -^j t_3$ and $t_2 -^j t_3 -^i t_4$ neither $M_i(t_1)$ nor $M_i(t_2)$ involve $x_j$ and the substitution never really happens. Now Remark 2.2 deals with E4. The point is a we choose our initial data many things are determined. That is pick $t$ and then fix $M_i(t)$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ and fix $M_j(t')$ for all $t -^j t'$. Then the ratios $M_i(t')/M_i(t'')$ whenever we have the situation $t -^j t' -^i t''$. To seen this ratio is determined look at $t''' -^i t -^j t' -^i t''$, then by E4 $$\frac{M_i(t')}{M_i(t'')} = \frac{M_i(t)}{M_i(t''')}|_{x_j \leftarrow M_0/x_j}$$ here the left side the ratio we claim is determined and the right side has the monomials we fixed. Also notice the monomials in $M_0$ are among the monomials we fixed. Addition: To address the question in the comments about the background of these axioms, the simple answer the to look at the absract of Fomin and Zelevinsky's Cluster Algebra's I: Foundations. The definitions and axoims for cluster algebras grew out of studying the dual canonical basis. From what I understand lots of examples (coordinate ring of $SL_2$, Grassmannian, etc.) were looked at, the cluster algebra axoims seemed to be the "right" generalisation of the relations these examples satisfied. So, when you want to make the abstract technical definition of cluster algebras more concrete you can think of it as "generalised Plücker relations." Maybe this a not a satisfying answer. I know it wouldn't matter how long a stared at these examples, I would never have come out with the definition of a cluster algebra. To see the cluster algebras aren't completely coming out of nowhere you can look at some of the papers in the references of Cluster Algebra's I: Foundations. For example in Parametrizations of canonical bases and totally positive matrices by A. Berenstein, S. Fomin and A. Zelevinsky you will see pseudoline arrangements and other things reminiscent of cluster algebras.

Positroid cells in $Gr(k,n)$ are indexed by many objects we often want to go between. The big cell will be given by the bounded affine permutation $i \mapsto i+k$. See Postnikov's original preprint (section 16). Note the positroid for the big cell will the the positroid consisting of all $k$ subsets of $[n]$. In the preprint decorated permutations are used, bounded affine permutations are the language of Knutson-Lam-Speyer. Section 16 of the preprint also makes use of Grassmann necklaces which are another object indexing positroid cells. Any other decorated permutation/bounded affine permutation of type $(k,n)$ gives a non-big cell. 

Homology groups can be computed with Smith normal form (see this survey). As for deciding if a simplicial complex is contractible, that is difficult. It is undecidable to tell if a simplicial complex is contractible (see appendix A of this paper). The same paper shows that it is NP-hard to decide if a simplicial complex is collapsible (a condition which implies contractible). 

If an undirected graph has a negative weight cycle, then the Bellman-Ford algorithm will detect it. However, if an undirected graph does not have a negative weight cycle the Bellman-Ford algorithm may still detect one. So, the answer to your specific question in the body is no (there are no false negatives) while the answer to the general question is yes (there may be false positives). In fact Bellman-Ford can only really be used with nonnegative weights for undirected graphs. The Bellman-Ford algorithm works on directed graphs. To make it work with undirected graphs we must make each undirected edge into two directed edges (one in each direction) with the same weights as the original undirected edge. Now any negative weight undirected cycle is transformed into a negative weight directed cycle, and hence would be detected. In any negative weight edge is transformed in a negative weight cycle of length two! Thus Bellman-Ford will always detect a negative cycle if there is any negative weight edge. 

A polynomial has the half plane property if it is nonvanishing on a half plane. A matroid has the half plane property if its basis generating function does. Of course having all minors $n$th roots of unity is stronger so perhaps more can be said, but this at least gives a result which applies to the matroids in the question. Maybe knowing this will help in your literature search. 

The spanning tree $T$ gives us another basis $C^*_{e_1}, \dots, C^*_{e_{n-1}}$ of the cut-space consisting of fundamental cuts. That is, $C^*_{e_i}$ is the set of edges of $G$ crossing the partition of vertices given by the connected components of $T \setminus e$. We observe that $e_i \in C^*_{e_i}$ for all $i$ and $e_i \not\in C^*_{e_j}$ for all $i \ne j$. Since the fundamental cuts form a basis we have $$ \begin{bmatrix} & \vdots &\\ \cdots & a_{ij} & \cdots\\ & \vdots & \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} C^*_{e_1}\\ \vdots \\ C^*_{e_{n-1}} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} C^*_1\\ \vdots \\ C^*_{n-1} \end{bmatrix} $$ for $A = [a_{ij}] \in \mathbb{F}_2^{(n-1) \times (n-1)}$. Notice $a_{ij} = 1$ if and only if $e_j \in C^*_i$. So, we must find a permutation $\sigma \in S_{n-1}$ such that $a_{i,\sigma(i)} = 1$ for all $i$. The matrix $A$ is invertible since $C^*_1, \dots, C^*_{n-1}$ is also a basis. So, $$\det A = \sum_{\sigma \in S_{n-1}} \prod_i a_{i,\sigma(i)} \ne 0$$ and it follows such a $\sigma$ exists. Now this generalizes the OP's observation within the graphic matroid setting. For general matroids cut-sets become cocircuits. However, the cocircutis of general matroids do not form a vector space with symmetric difference. So, the argument above does not extend, but perhaps something can be said looking that cocircuits or fundamental cocircuits For an example consider the non-graphic matroid $U_{2,4}$. The symmetric difference of the cociruits $123$ and $234$ is $14$ which is not a cocircuit but a base. However, the fundamental cociruits of $12$ are $134$ and $234$, and every base of $U_{2,4}$ can be decomposed over these cocircuits.
