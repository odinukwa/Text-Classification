The generalization covers the case $\xi=1$ as every continuous function is of Baire Class $0.$ When $\xi = 2,$ it is well-known that $\chi_\mathbb{Q}$ is of Baire Class $2$ as it is a pointwise limit of $(g_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ where $g_n(x) = \max\{0,1-n d(x,K)\}$ and $K$ is a finite collection of rationals. (extracted from Wiki) Since $\chi_\mathbb{Q}$ is discontinuous everywhere, so it is not of Baire Class $1.$ This MSE post also contains other Baire Class $2$ functions. However, I fail to obtain any Baire Class $3$ function and above. 

What is the status of these questions? Any progress on each of them? If yes, any reference is appreciated. .......................................................................................................................................................... Definitions: Let $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^p$ be an open subset and $E$ be a Banach space. Denote $C^n(\Omega,E)$ the space of $E$-valued functions $f$ on $\Omega$ that are of class $C^n.$ $T:C^n(\Omega,E)\to C^m(\Omega',F)$ is called biseparating map if $T$ is bijective and $$\|Tf\| \|Tg\|=0 \text{ if and only if }\|f\|\|\|g\|=0$$ 

We say that $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is of Baire Class $1$ if it is a pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions. One can generalize the definition above by taking pointwise limit of each 'previous' level(s) to obtain 'next' level. More precisely, 

After stating the problem, authors mentioned that the problem holds true for finite-dimensional spaces but not for non separable spaces. Then they point to the reference,page $255$ which contains the problem above. 

In $1990,$Kechris and Louveau conducted an investigation on three types of ordinal ranks acting on the class of Baire Class $1$ functions on a compact metric space (recall that $f$ is Baire Class $1$ if it is a pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions). The three ranks are separation rank (introduced by Bourgain), oscillation rank and convergence rank (introduced by Zalcwasser, Gillespie and Hurwicz). They measure complexity of the respective definition of Baire Class $1$ functions (Baire Class $1$ functions have three equivalent definitions). $26$ years later ($2016$), Elekes, Kiss and Vidnyánszky generalised from compact metric space to Polish space and the three ranks to Baire Class $\xi$ functions where $\xi$ is any countable ordinal (Recall that $f$ is Baire class $\xi$ if it is a pointwise limit of a sequence of Baire Class $\xi_n$ functions where $\xi_n<\xi$ for all natural number $n$). One of the generalisations is through topology refinement (For interested reader, please refer to section $5$ of their paper). 

$2018$ Abel prize is awarded to Robert P. Langlands for his visionary program connecting representation theory to number theory. In particular, his program predicts the existence of a tight web of connections between automorphic forms and Galois group. 

Notations: Recall that $\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal. Let $X$ be a Polish space (completely metrizable and separable) and $F(X)$ be the collection of all real-valued functions on $X.$ A function $\rho:F(X)\to \omega_1$ is called an ordinal rank. In other words, ordinal rank assigns an ordinal to a function, typically measuring complexity of the function. 

It is known that $C_b(Q)$ is linearly isometric isomorphic to $C(\beta Q),$ thanks to the following proposition. The following extension theorem is taken from Carothers's A Short Course in Banach Space Theory, Chapter $15$ Theorem $15.1.$ 

So it seems that we can also have a similar definition of the above function in terms of $\varepsilon.$ However, I couldn't obtain it. 

We know that $\beta(f)=1$ if $f$ is continuous, $\beta(f)<\omega_1$ (the first uncountable ordinal) if $f$ is Baire Class $1.$ However, I am unable to construct a Baire Class $1$ function whose oscillation rank falls between $\omega$ and $\omega\cdot 2,$ which is $n=1$ in my question. 

I would like to ask whether the reverse inclusion holds, that is, does $$\{ x^* \circ \psi_t:x^*\in ext(E^*), t\in K \}\subset ext(X^*)$$ hold? If yes, can provide a proof or its reference? Otherwise, can I have counterexample? 

Joseph, I believe that there is not a simple linear smooth mapping. My short explanation for it is that the morph from $S_0$ to $S_1$ does not really consist of a single continuous deformation, but instead of the concatenation of a sequence of multiple piece-wise linear deformations consisting of more than three separate steps: $S_0 \to S_a \to S_b \to S_c... \to S_1$ Your $S_0$ is the frame of an octahedron. 

So this doesn't answer your question, but does prove that a scenario exists in a deterministic perfect momentum-conserving billiards game such that an oscillatory cycle is entered and never ends. So with your conditions that we can make the rolling friction arbitrarily small, we'd end up scratching even if a configuration were found that was capable of sinking all fifteen balls and then the cue ball would be alone on a table moving until it fell into one of the pockets. Unless we could adjust $\mu$ for each starting configuration so that after sinking all fifteen balls, the cue ball glides to a stop. But that's just setting up too many parameters and free variables. This is why physicists recommend that we not live in a world without friction. (edit 2 bold claim retracted by strikethroughs) Actually, I've reread your revised question, and I think that this actually is the answer you seek, and the answer is no. There is no shot that you can make in the game on the table you have defined such you will sink the specified ball and also not scratch. Your conditions make it such that if you do not enter an infinite loop, the cue ball will keep moving. To hit a ball into a pocket, the cue ball will cycle around and find a changed world, and will most likely end up scratching ultimately. and if you allow rolling friction $\mu_R$ to be a specifiably small value, perhaps the answer is yes. But the condition of allowing 14 other balls in the mix turns it into an extended type of problem like the 3-body problem for gravitational attraction, with wacky chaotic dynamics that are not easily tractably gotten around. ... 

This question is equivalent to asking if a finite-state-automaton can decide or accept a particular language, or if a push-down automaton could. I believe the only way to deduce the self-intersection or self-avoiding nature of a walk based on relative moves of {turn left, move forward, turn right} is to turn them into a sequence of absolute moves and simulate them on the square lattice, keeping track of state along the way. Summary: Convert the sequence of relative moves into a sequence of absolute moves. This step is not absolutely necessary but helps to make the next step easier to understand. for any sequence of $n$ absolute moves $m_1 m_2 ...m_n,$ with $m_i \in$ {N,S,E,W}, it self-intersects if it contains a subsequence $m_a m_{a+1}...m_b$, such that $1 \le a\lt b \le n$ such that the subsequence contains exactly the same number of $N$ as it does of $S$ and exactly the same number of $E$ as $W$. This is equivalent to and can be restated as $N^cE^dS^cW^d$, or as saying $\Delta$(Longitude)$=0$ and $\Delta$(Latitude)$=0$. Deciding a regular language $x^n y^n$ (or in this case $N^c S^c E^d W^d$ ) can not be decided by a FSA (finite state automaton) but can be decided by a push-down automaton, which keeps track of state in the push-down stack. My reference for computability or acceptability by a Finite State Automaton is (for me, in this case) Papadimitriou and Lewis Elements of the Theory of Computation, which I remember from my undergraduate course in computation theory. I don't remember the original source described in the book, though. In this case, the push-down stack is keeping track of the state of either the number of N,S,E,W, via the direction traveled or the state of which squares have been visited thus far. Either way is equivalent, and effectively requires simulating the walk. 

Let $A = k[x_1,\ldots,x_r]$, let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the ideal $(x_1,\ldots,x_r)$ in $A$ and let $I$ be the ideal $(p_1,\ldots,p_t)$ in $R$. The assumption $\sqrt{AI} = \mathfrak{m}$ implies that $\mathfrak{m}^u \subseteq AI$ for some integer $u \geq 1$. Hence $A / AI$ is a finite dimensional vector space over the ground field $k$. Since the polynomials $p_i$ are homogeneous, $A / AI$ is actually a graded $k$-vector space. Choose homogeneous elements $v_1,\ldots, v_n \in A$ whose images span $A / AI$; then these images also generate $A / AI$ as a graded $R$-module, so we may write $A = AI + \sum_{i=1}^n Rv_i$. Let $Q = A / \sum_{i=1}^n Rv_i$. This is a positively graded $R$-module such that $QI = Q$, by construction. If $Q$ is non-zero, let $t \geq 0$ be least such that $Q_t \neq 0$; then for any $j \geq t$, $Q_jI$ consists of homogeneous elements of degree strictly greater than $t$ (since $\sqrt{AI} = \mathfrak{m}$ forces $\deg p_i \geq 1$ for all $i$). Then $QI \subseteq \oplus_{j > t} Q_j$, a contradiction. (This argument is called the graded Nakayama Lemma). So in fact $Q = 0$ and $A = \sum_{i=1}^n Rv_i$ is a finitely generated $R$-module. Therefore $A$ is an integral extension of $R$. 

No; it is not abelian in general. Let $R$ be a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal generated by an element $\pi$, let $k := R / \pi R$ be the residue field of $R$ and let $\mathcal{O}$ be the inverse image in $M_2(R)$ of the scalar matrices in $M_2(k)$. Note that $\mathcal{O}$ is free of rank $4$ as an $R$-module, with basis $\{e_{11} + e_{22}, \pi e_{11}, \pi e_{12}, \pi e_{21}\}$ say. So $\mathcal{O}$ is, in particular, finitely generated and projective as an $R$-module. For every $g \in GL_2(R)$, you have the invertible fractional ideal $\mathcal{O}g$. Note that $\mathcal{O}g \cdot \mathcal{O} h = \mathcal{O} gh$ since $GL_2(R)$ normalises $\mathcal{O}$ inside $M_2(R)$. Note also that $\mathcal{O} g = \mathcal{O} h$ if and only if $gh^{-1} \in \mathcal{O}^\times$, which is the preimage in $GL_2(R)$ of the group of scalar matrices in $GL_2(k)$. So we obtain an injective group homomorphism from $PGL_2(k) \cong GL_2(R) / \mathcal{O}^\times$ into the group $I(\mathcal{O})$ of invertible fractional ideals of $\mathcal{O}$. In the positive direction, if $K$ is the field of fractions of a Dedekind domain $R$ and if $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal order in some finite dimensional separable $K$-algebra, then $I(\mathcal{O})$ is abelian. See Theorem 12 and Theorem 13(c) of this paper by Frőhlich, which gives a thorough discussion of the Picard group of a noncommutative ring. 

Suppose that $A$ is a not necessarily commutative ring, which is both left and right Noetherian. Given a left $A$-module $N$, and a right $A$-module $M$, there is a general (fourth quadrant, cohomological) spectral sequence due to Ischebeck, with $E_2$ term $$E_2^{p,-q} = \operatorname{Ext}^p_A(\operatorname{Ext}^q_A(N,A),M)$$ which converges to $$\operatorname{Tor}^A_{q-p}(M,N)$$ whenever $M$ has finite injective dimension. If, in addition, $A$ has finite injective dimension $d = \operatorname{id}(A) < \infty$, then whenever $n = q-p$ with $0 \leq q \leq d$ and $p \geq 0$, we must have $n \leq d$. Thus $\operatorname{Tor}^A_n(M,N)$ vanishes for any left $A$-module $N$ and any $n > d$. So, if $M$ has finite injective dimension, then $$\operatorname{fd}(M) \leq \operatorname{id}(A)$$ which gives a positive answer to your question because your ring $A$ is assumed to be Gorenstein, hence has finite self-injective dimension. You can find an English translation of Ischebeck's paper here; see Theorem (1.8). 

I don't have a full answer, but the following calculation may be useful. Consider the example $G = SL_3$ so that $N$ is the Heisenberg group on three generators and in characteristic zero, $\bar{U}(N)$ is the enveloping algebra of the three-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra. Thus $\bar{U}(N) = k[x,z][y ; z \frac{d}{dx}]$ is a skew polynomial algebra. This notation means that every element in $\bar{U}(N)$ can be written uniquely in the form $\sum_{i=0}^r f_i y^i$ for some $f_i \in k[x,z]$ and $y$ satisfies the commutation relation $ad(y)(f) := y f - f y = z \frac{df}{dx}$ for any $f \in k[x,z]$. Note that $z$ is a central element in $\bar{U}(N)$. Now consider the element $y^a \cdot x^b$ for any $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$. Let us rewrite it in standard form as follows: $y^a x^b = l_y^a(x^b) = (r_y + ad(y))^a(x^b) = $ $\left(\sum_{i=0}^a\binom{a}{i} r_y^{a-i} ad(y)^i \right)(x^b) = \sum_{i=0}^a \binom{a}{i} \frac{b!}{(b-i)!}z^i x^{b-i} y^{a-i}$. Here $l_y$ and $r_y$ are operators of left-multiplication by $y$ and right-multiplication by $y$, respectively. Note that they commute, so $r_y$ and $ad(y) = l_y - r_y$ also commute, so the application of the binomial theorem is legal. So in this case you can take $f(a,b) = a + b - \max(a,b)$.
