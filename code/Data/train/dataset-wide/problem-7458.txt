This doesn't exactly answer your question but... If $A$ is any upper bound for the arithmetic degrees then $0^{(\omega)}$ is recursive in $A^{\prime\prime}$. Enderton and Putnam proved that there upper bounds with $A^{\prime\prime}=0^{(\omega)} $ Dave 

I think the answer is no, but let me first give a precise version of the question (which I think Daniel's argument doesn't quite address). Fix some reasonable listing $P_0,P_1,\dots$ of recursively enumerable sets of polynomials. [See below for a ``reasonable" coding.] I claim that there is no algorithm to determine if $V(P_e)=\emptyset$. Let $K$ be the diagonal halting set. Namely, $K=$ {$e$: the $ e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $e$}. For each $e$ let $P_e=\{p_0,p_1,\dots\}$ be the recursively enumerable sequence of polynomials where $p_i=0$ if the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine has not halted by stage $i$ and $p_i=1$ if has. Then $V(P_e)=\emptyset \Leftrightarrow e\in K$. Since $K$ is undecidable there is no algorithm to decide if $V(P_e)$ is empty. One way to code sequences of polynomials would be to let $q_0,q_1,\dots$ list all polynomials, and let $P_e$ be {$q_i:$ the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $i$}. To get to Ian's setting we could view $P_e$ as the sequence $p_0,p_1,\dots$ where $p_{(i,j)\}$ is 0 unless the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input i at stage $j$ in which case it is $q_i$ and $(i,j)$ is some computable pairing function. 

Wilkie's proof of o-minimality of exponentiation tells you (without needing to assume Schanuel's Conjecture) that for each $k$ there is a bound $M_k$ such that any exponential polynomial $\sum_{i=1}^k c_ie^{\alpha_i x}$ has at most $M_k$ real zeros [assuming that the $c_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are real.] Perhaps Khovanskii's work gives an explicit bound on the $M_k$. 

We will always have ${\rm ZF}^M\supseteq {\rm ZF}$. The problem comes if $M$ contains nonstandard sentences--which is equivalent to the question of whether $M$ contains nonstandard natural numbers since we can identify formulas with their Godel codes. If there are no nonstandard integers, then they type of externl induction you are doing works fine, but if there aren't it might break down at a nonstandard stage. 

Another spin on this question, that gets around the fact that there are only countably many second order sentences, is to look at categoricity in $L^2_{\kappa,\omega}$ where we allow conjunctions of size less that $\kappa$ and second order quantifiers. Hyttinen, Kangas and Vaananen (see $URL$ show that, for suitable cardinals $\kappa$, all models of a complete first order theory $T$ of size $\kappa$ are characterized by and $L^2_{\kappa,\omega}$-sentence if and only if $T$ is ``classifiable" in the sense of Shelah's Main-Gap i.e., $T$ is stable, NDOP, shallow, and NOTOP. 

Without the restriction on the lie algebra, certainly. There are interesting examples of families of abelian varieties with (generically) no extra endomorphisms but whose generic Mumford-Tate group is not the whole of $GSp_{2g}$. I believe the first example, a family of fourfolds (the smallest dimension in which such a phenomenon arises) was given at the end of a short paper of Mumford "A note on Shimura's paper "Discontinuous groups and abelian varieties." $URL$ The idea is to take a division algebra $D$ over a cubic totally real field $F$ whose corestriction along $F/\mathbb{Q}$ is split, giving a natural map $Nm: D^* \rightarrow GL_8$. If $D$ ramifies at two of the three places at infinity, one shows that this map has symplectic image and can use the image to define a Hodge type Shimura datum. However, the representation is also absolutely irreducible which implies the underlying Hodge structure (hence abelian variety) attached to a general point in the family doesn't admit any extra endomorphisms. However here I think the group is a $\mathbb{Q}$-form of $SO(4) \times SL(2)$, which maybe isn't what you are looking for (though I suppose its Lie algebra is of type $C_1=A_1$). [P.S. to abz: unless I'm mistaken, $PGL_2$ only gives a Shimura variety of abelian type.] 

You can always map $(T,h)$ to the trivial Shimura datum and then this into the Siegel one. I assume this isn't what you want however. May I therefore modify the question to ask whether a zero dimensional variety can be embedded in a Siegel variety. I.e. You want to know if all zero dimensional Shimura varieties are of Hodge type. I think this is certainly false and can give two quick reasons. 1) every Hodge type datum has weight defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and has compact centre modulo the image of this weight. In general neither condition need hold for a zero dimensional Shimura datum. 2) consider the 'cyclotomic' Shimura datum $T=\mathbb{G}_m$ and $h(z) = z\bar{z}$. Any representation of T will induce a hodge structure of even weight but if it admits a Siegel embedding then this must yield a representation giving the weight 1 Hodge structure defining an abelian variety. 

Yes. For elementary reasons. Suppose it weren't dense. Then there would be some little interval not hit, of some positive length say $1/N$. But this cannot happen. Divide the circle into N little equal intervals and consider $0,r,2r,...,Nr$. By pigeonhole some two of them lie in the same interval, say $ar,br$ (and these elements are distinct since $r$ is not rational). Then modulo $\mathbb{Z}$, $-1/N < (a-b)r < 1/N$, and so some multiple of this will lie in the interval we supposed contained no element. 

This is really a comment, but I need a bit more space. If $\phi$ is a sentence of ${\cal L}_{\omega_1,\omega}$ that is $\aleph_0$-categorial, there is a complete first order theory $T$ in an expanded vocabulary such that the models of $\phi$ are exactly the reducts atomic models of $\phi$. The expansion is done in such a way that two structures will be isomorphic in the original language if and only if they are isomorphic in the expanded language. So your question is really the same as: For $\phi$ a sentence of ${\cal}L_{\omega_1,\omega}$ is ``$\phi$ is $\kappa$-categorical for all infinite $\kappa$" absolute? This is, as far as I know, still an open question. It is also open if ``$\phi$ is $\aleph_1$-categorical" is absolute. John Baldwin in his paper ``Amalgamation, Absoluteness, and Categoricity" addresses some issues around this. Here is a link $URL$ 

The classical argument Andres mentions can be taken one step further to show that if every uncountable $\Pi_1^1$ set contains a perfect subset then $\aleph_1$ is inaccessible in $L$. This follows from the same fact for $\Sigma^1_2$-sets since, by the uniformization theorem, every $\Sigma^1_2$-set is the injective projection of a $\Pi^1_1$-set. 

This was intended to be a comment to SJR's post, but was too long. Here is a proof that any formula that is preserved downwards in models of $T$ is equivalent in $T$ to a universal formula, from which we deduce that formulas preserved upwards are equivalent to existential formulas. Let $T$ be an $\cal L$-theory. Suppose $\phi(\bar v)$ is preserved downwards in models of $T$. Let $\Gamma(\bar v)=\{\psi(\bar v): \psi$ is universal and $T\models \phi(\bar v)\rightarrow \psi(\bar v)\}$. We claim that $T+\Gamma(\bar v)\models \psi(\bar v)$. If that happens then there are $\psi_1,\dots,\psi_n\in\Gamma(\bar v)$ such that $T\models \phi(\bar v)\leftrightarrow (\psi_1(\bar v)\land\dots\land\psi_n(\bar v)$. Suppose not. Then there is ${\cal M}\models T$ and $\bar a\in \cal M$ such that ${\cal M}\models \psi(\bar a)$ for $\psi\in\Gamma$ and ${\cal M}\models \neg\phi(\bar a)$. Let $T_1= T+ \phi(\bar a) + $ atomic diagram of $\cal M$. If $T_1$ is satisfiable there is ${\cal N}\models T$ with ${\cal M}\subset {\cal N}$ and ${\cal N}\models \phi(\bar a)$, contradicting the fact that $\phi$ is preserved downward. Thus $T_1$ must be unsatisfiable. Thus there is a quantifier free formula $\theta(\bar v,\bar w)$ and $\bar b\in \cal M$ such that $$T\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)\rightarrow \neg\phi(\bar a).$$ Since the parameters $\bar a$ and $\bar b$ don't occur in $T$, $$T\models \forall \bar v\ (\phi(\bar v)\rightarrow\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w))$$ But then $\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w)\in \Gamma$ contradicting the fact that ${\cal M}\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)$. 

Suppose I have a smooth non-proper algebraic variety $X/\mathbb{C}$. A vector bundle with flat connection (``differential equation'') on $X$ extends, as was noted by Grothendieck, to a coherent crystal on the infinitesimal site of $X$, realising an equivalence between these two types of object. Deligne's comparison of differential equations on $X$ and $X^{an}$ leads one to restrict one's attention to the subcategory of differential equations on $X$ with regular singularities along the boundary divisor of a good compactification of $X$. My question: is there a clean way to describe this category as a subcategory of the category of crystals on $Inf(X)$? My guess (fear?) is the answer might have something to do with log-geometry, but I know very little about such things so would also appreciate a good reference suggestion if indeed it is the required tool. 

Fix a scheme $S$, a group scheme $G/S$ (let us say smooth, maybe even affine with some finiteness conditions if you like), and suppose I have some other $S$-scheme $P$ with a right $G$-action. We want to investigate the question of whether $P$ is a $G$-torsor (in the fppf topology). If I understand correctly, then since $G$ is smooth it is equivalent for $P$ to be a torsor in the etale topology, which is a priori a relatively strong condition. On the other hand, an a priori weaker statement is that it be a torsor in the fpqc topology. My question is: suppose I can find an fpqc (but not finitely presented) cover $\{S_i \rightarrow S\}$ with $P\times_S S_i \rightarrow S_i$ isomorphic to the trivial $G\times_S S_i$-torsor. Are there circumstances under which I may conclude that $P$ is in fact an fppf torsor? One (perhaps silly) example is if I have $S$ equal to the spectrum of some small field $k$ with an interesting Galois group, and I am able to find some huge complicated transcendental extension $K/k$ over which $P$ becomes a trivial torsor. Under what conditions does this imply the existence of a finite separable extension over which $P$ becomes a trivial torsor? 

Perhaps this is a bit too 'standard' for MO, but I'm struggling to dig it out of the literature (and maybe other people have had a similar experience), so it feels like a useful thing to ask and I hope people don't mind. 1) Harish-Chandra's theorem classifies all discrete series reps, which are defined to be the things occurring discretely in the spectrum of G. What is the correct definition of a 'limit of discrete series rep' and the corresponding classification result? Is it simply any non-discrete series tempered representation? (And if not, can I say anything intelligent about the other tempered representations?). 2-3) In his Ann Arbor paper, Harris mentions a theorem along the lines of: let G be a real Lie group admitting a Shimura datum. Then all representations contributing to the (appropriate) cohomology of the Shimura variety are 'nondegenerate' limits of discrete series. 2) What does 'nondegenerate' mean, and is the resulting theorem the strongest general result known in this direction? 3) Is any converse known/conjectured? Can we describe all cohomological representations at least for classical groups? (Where I guess it would be good to have answers interpreting 'cohomological' in both possible ways: coefficients in a local system or in coherent cohomology). If clear references exist that treat things in full generality (not just GL2 or GLn) that would be helpful to know. Thanks, Tom.
