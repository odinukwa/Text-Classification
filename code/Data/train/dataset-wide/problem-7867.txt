This, you will notice, is what appears on nLab. So the difference between strict comma objects and (bicategorical) comma objects is elsewhere – in fact, it is in the 1-dimensional universal property: one has to replace the uniqueness clause with an appropriate up-to-isomorphism version so that the resulting notion is invariant under equivalences in $\mathfrak{K}$. 

If by "additive" you mean an $\mathbf{Ab}$-enriched category with a zero object and biproducts, then yes. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be model category that is additive in this sense, let $\mathcal{M}_c$ be the full subcategory of cofibrant objects, let $\mathcal{M}_f$ be the full subcategory of fibrant objects, and let $\mathcal{M}_{cf} = \mathcal{M}_c \cap \mathcal{M}_f$. Here are the relevant facts: $\DeclareMathOperator{\Ho}{Ho}$ 

The theorem of Butz and Moerdijk is that $\mathcal{B} M$ is equivalent to the topos of equivariant sheaves on this topological groupoid $\mathbb{G}$. Note that the domain and codomain maps $G_1 \to G_0$ are locally connected, hence open a fortiori. 

What is the state of the art in the rectification of homotopy-coherent structures, in the general sense suggested above? I am especially interested to hear about results concerning the rectification of homotopy-coherent diagrams in (not necessarily simplicial) model categories. This appears to be a crucial step toward showing that homotopy limits and colimits in the sense of derived functors agrees with homotopy limits and colimits in the Joyal–Lurie sense. (See e.g. §4.2.4 in [Higher topos theory].) 

Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the language of intuitionistic propositional logic generated by some atomic propositions $t_1, t_2, \ldots$. The Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra of $\mathcal{L}$ can be regarded as a bicartesian closed category in which there is an arrow $p \to q$ if and only if there is a proof of $q$ assuming $p$. Unfortunately it is a somewhat dull category, as there is at most one arrow between any two objects. Question. Is there a categorification of the Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra which enables a category-theoretic form of the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation of intuitionistic propositional logic? In particular, 

I would say no. Indeed, consider $\partial \Delta^2$. Its geometric realisation is the circle $S^1$, so $\pi_1 (\partial \Delta^2)$ is supposed to be $\mathbb{Z}$. Recall that for a pointed Kan complex $(K, x)$, $\Omega (K, x)$ is defined by the following pullback diagram, $$\begin{array}{ccc} \Omega (K, x) & \to & [\Delta^1, K] \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ \Delta^0 & \to & [\partial \Delta^1, K] \end{array}$$ where $[-, -]$ is the internal hom of simplicial sets and the bottom arrow corresponds to the constant morphism $\partial \Delta^1 \to K$ with value $x$; $\pi_1 (K, x)$ is then defined to be $\pi_0 \Omega (K, x)$. If we take this definition and apply it to $\partial \Delta^2$ we end up with a finite set – in fact, a singleton. The problem here is that there are nowhere near enough morphisms $\Delta^1 \to \partial \Delta^2$ to represent all paths in the circle (even up to homotopy). You can try to fix this by allowing subdivisions of $\Delta^1$, but to get all the paths you will need subdivisions iterated arbitrarily many times. At that point, you may as well just apply Kan's $\mathrm{Ex}^{\infty}$ functor to $\partial \Delta^2$ and get a Kan complex. 

Recursion principles are usually special cases of induction principles in dependent type theory. For example, for the boolean type $\mathbf{2}$, given $a_0, a_1 : A$, we may form (using the induction principle) the function $f : \prod_{x : \mathbf{2}} A$ where $f (0_{\mathbf{2}}) \equiv a_0$ and $f(0_{\mathbf{1}}) \equiv a_1$; but $\prod_{x : \mathbf{2}} A \equiv (\mathbf{2} \to A)$ (see §1.4 of the HoTT book; formally, the RHS abbreviates the LHS), so we we deduce the recursion principle. One can then use $\lambda$-abstraction to obtain the recursor $\mathsf{rec}_{\mathbf{2}}$ if so desired. Alternatively, we could take $$\mathsf{rec}_{\mathbf{2}} \equiv (\lambda C : \mathcal{U}) (\lambda c_0 : C) (\lambda c_1 : C) (\lambda x : \mathbf{2}) \mathsf{ind}_{\mathbf{2}} ((\lambda y : \mathbf{2}) C, c_0, c_1, x) $$ and then verify that it does what we want. 

A 2-category has an underlying ordinary category, so we may just reuse the standard definition of initial object. A 2-category can be regarded as a category enriched over categories, so we may use the definition of initial object in an enriched category. Concretely, this refers to an object $a$ such that the hom-category $\mathfrak{K} (a, b)$ is the terminal category for all objects $b$ in $\mathfrak{K}$. Clearly, every enriched initial object is an initial object in the underlying ordinary category, but the converse is not true. (For example, the unique object of $\mathfrak{K} (a, b)$ may have non-trivial endomorphisms.) This definition is standard: see e.g. [Kelly, Basic concepts of enriched category theory]. We can do things up to isomorphism in a 2-category, so we might define an initial object to be an object $a$ such that the hom-category $\mathfrak{K} (a, b)$ has only one object up to isomorphism. This is the same thing as an initial object in the "homotopy category" $\operatorname{Ho} \mathfrak{K}$ obtained by identifying all isomorphic morphisms in $\mathfrak{K}$. Clearly, an object that is initial in the underlying ordinary category of $\mathfrak{K}$ is also initial in this sense, but the converse is not true. As far as I know, this definition is not used. Every 2-category is also a bicategory, so we can take the definition from there. A bicategorical initial object in $\mathfrak{K}$ is an object $a$ such that the hom-categories $\mathfrak{K} (a, b)$ are contractible groupoids. More concretely, this means there is a morphism $a \to b$ for every $b$ and there is a unique 2-cell between any parallel pair of morphisms $a \to b$. Every bicategorical initial object is also initial in the sense of (3). This definition is a special case of the general notion of bicolimit: see e.g. [Kelly, Elementary observations on 2-categorical limits]. Every 2-category can be regarded as a simplicially enriched category by replacing each hom-category with its nerve. We could therefore define an initial object in $\mathfrak{K}$ to be an object $a$ such that the nerve of $\mathfrak{K} (a, b)$ is contractible for all $b$. It is not hard to see that bicategorical initial objects are also initial in this sense, but the converse is not true. (For example, $\mathfrak{K} (a, b)$ might have non-invertible morphisms.) I have not seen this definition before, but it may be useful if $\mathfrak{K} (a, b)$ is actually standing in for a homotopy type. 

There are many proposed models for the theory of $(\infty, 1)$-categories and it has now been shown that many of these theories have Quillen-equivalent model categories, i.e. that they are equivalent as homotopy theories. But what about as category theories? For example, suppose I have a homotopical category $\mathcal{C}$ and a homotopically initial object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$, in the sense of [Dwyer, Kan, Hirschhorn, and Smith, Homotopy limit functors on model categories and homotopical categories]. That means, there are endofunctors $F$ and $G$ on $\mathcal{C}$ such that $\Delta A$ is weakly equivalent to $F$, $G$ is weakly equivalent to $\textrm{id}_{\mathcal{C}}$, and there is a natural transformation $\alpha : F \Rightarrow G$ such that $\alpha_A : F A \to G A$ is a weak equivalence. It is straightforward to show that $A$ descends to an initial object in $\operatorname{Ho} \mathcal{C}$, but what about in, say, the hammock localisation $L^H \mathcal{C}$ – is the hom-space $L^H \mathcal{C}(A, Z)$ contractible for every object $Z$ in $\mathcal{C}$? More generally, how are the notions of homotopy limit/colimit, adjunction, Kan extension etc. in the different theories (where defined) related? Pointers to relevant literature would be much appreciated. 

It is true. You can reduce to the case of simplicial sets by using the fact that $\mathbf{R} \mathrm{Hom} (T, -)$ preserves homotopy limits and (allowing $T$ to vary) is jointly conservative. Finding where this is written down is another matter altogether... I'll just sketch something more concrete for the case of a simplicial model category $\mathcal{M}$. Let $X : \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{M}$ be any diagram such that each $X i$ is fibrant. Using the cobar construction of homotopy limits (see e.g. Chapter 18 in [Hirschhorn]), it is immediate that $$\underline{\mathcal{M}} (T, \operatorname{holim} X) \cong \operatorname{holim} \underline{\mathcal{M}} (T, X)$$ for all cofibrant $T$ in $\mathcal{M}$. On the other hand, $\underline{\mathcal{M}} (T, Z)$ is a model of $\mathbf{R} \mathrm{Hom} (T, Z)$ when $T$ is cofibrant and $Z$ is fibrant. Thus, $\operatorname{holim} X \to X i$ is a weak equivalence in $\mathcal{M}$ if and only if $$\operatorname{holim} \underline{\mathcal{M}} (T, X) \to \underline{\mathcal{M}} (T, X i)$$ is a weak homotopy equivalence for every cofibrant object $T$ in $\mathcal{M}$. Hence, the claim reduces to the case where $\mathcal{M} = \mathbf{sSet}$. The same strategy can be used for many other questions about homotopy (co)limits. 

The coproduct of a family of cofibrant objects is automatically a homotopy coproduct, so the localising functor $\mathcal{M}_c \to \Ho \mathcal{M}$ preserves coproducts. Dually, the localising functor $\mathcal{M}_f \to \Ho \mathcal{M}$ preserves products. Hence, the localising functor $\mathcal{M}_{cf} \to \Ho \mathcal{M}$ preserves the zero object and biproducts. (Note that $\mathcal{M}_{cf}$ is an additive subcategory of $\mathcal{M}$.) A category with a zero object and biproducts is automatically enriched over commutative monoids in a unique way, and a functor that preserves zero objects and biproducts is similarly enriched. Thus, there is a unique enrichment of $\Ho \mathcal{M}$ over commutative monoids that makes the localising functor $\mathcal{M}_{cf} \to \Ho \mathcal{M}$ an enriched functor. Since $\mathcal{M}_{cf}$ is actually $\mathbf{Ab}$-enriched and the localising functor $\mathcal{M}_{cf} \to \Ho \mathcal{M}$ is full and essentially surjective on objects, $\Ho \mathcal{M}$ is also $\mathbf{Ab}$-enriched. 

However, I do not know if this is true. What I do know is that embeddings of Grothendieck universes are adequate for $\mathcal{M}$; in fact, locally presentable categories and adjunctions between them are very well behaved under this kind of universe enlargement. 

In other words, the weighted colimit $F \star G$ (resp. the weighted limit $\{ F, G \}$) always exists if $F$ is a representable $\mathcal{V}$-enriched functor $\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathcal{V}$ (resp. $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{V}$). A standard adjointness argument can be used to show that ${-} \star G$ (resp. $\{ {-}, G \}$) preserves colimits (resp. limits) in a strong sense; so, for instance, if $F$ is a conical colimit of a finite diagram of representables and $\mathcal{A}$ has conical colimits of finite diagrams, then $F \star G$ exists and is the conical colimit of the obvious diagram. Very explicitly: let $C : \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{C}$ be a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched functor and let $F : \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathcal{V}$ be $\varinjlim \mathcal{C} (-, C)$; then $F \star G$ exists in $\mathcal{A}$ if and only if $\varinjlim G C$ exists in $\mathcal{A}$, and they are isomorphic. Indeed: \begin{align} \mathcal{A} (F \star G, a) & \cong [\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}, \mathcal{V}](F, \mathcal{A} (G, a)) \\ & \cong [\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}, \mathcal{V}](\varinjlim \mathcal{C}(-, C), \mathcal{A} (G, a)) \\ & \cong \varprojlim [\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}, \mathcal{V}](\mathcal{C}(-, C), \mathcal{A} (G, a)) \\ & \cong \varprojlim \mathcal{A} (G C, a) \\ & \cong \mathcal{A} (\varinjlim G C, a) \end{align} Of course, there are also "two-sided" or "parametrised" versions of these: so given a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched functors $F : \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op} \otimes \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{V}$ (a.k.a. a bimodule) and $G : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{A}$ we can define $F \star_\mathcal{C} G$ to be a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched functor $\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{A}$ equipped with isomorphisms $$[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op} \otimes \mathcal{D}, \mathcal{V}](F, \mathcal{A}(G, H)) \cong [\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{A}](F \star_\mathcal{C} G, H)$$ that are $\mathcal{V}$-enriched natural in $H$; and similarly, $\{ F, H \}^\mathcal{D}$ is in turn defined to be a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched functor $\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathcal{A}$ equipped with isomorphisms $$[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op} \otimes \mathcal{D}, \mathcal{V}](F, \mathcal{A}(G, H)) \cong [\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}, \mathcal{A}](G, \{ F, H \}^\mathcal{D})$$ that are $\mathcal{V}$-enriched natural in $G$. In particular, when $F \star_\mathcal{C} G$ and $\{ F, H \}^\mathcal{D}$ both exist, then: $$[\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{A}](F \star_\mathcal{C} G, H) \cong [\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}, \mathcal{A}](G, \{ F, H \}^\mathcal{D})$$ For your situation, take $\mathcal{V}$ to be the category of $k$-modules. In this special case, there is no difference between "natural" and "enriched natural", nor between "conical colimit" and "(ordinary) colimit". The question of existence is easy here: a functor $F : \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \operatorname{Mod} k$ is finitely presented if and only if it can be obtained from representable functors by iterated colimits of finite diagrams. (In fact, two steps suffice: first form a finite direct sum of representable functors, then take a cokernel.)
