The dimensions of the stalks of Lusztig's sheaves give the coefficients when a canonical basis element is expanded in a PBW basis. These stalks satisfy a parity vanishing condition. For these positive results, see Corollary 10.7 of Lusztig's "Canonical Bases Arising from Quantized Enveloping Algebras". The first example of a 2-dimensional stalk at zero occurs in type A2, in dimension vector (2,2). If X is the variety of 2x2 matrices of rank at most 1, then it is not hard to see (e.g. using the Deligne construction) that IC(X) is one of Lusztig's sheaves and has a 2-dimensional stalk at zero. Alternatively the canonical basis computation can be carried out, which is implemented in GAP via the package QuaGroup. 

Suppose that $x\in \mathbf{f}$ and $r(x)=x\otimes 1+1\otimes x$. Recall $\mathbf{f}$ is graded by $\mathbb{N}I$, WLOG $x$ is homogenous, $x\in \mathbf{f}_\nu$. We know we get primitive elements if $\nu=i$ for some $i\in I$ so let us assume that $\nu$ is not of this form. Then $\mathbf{f}_\nu$ is generated by products of the form $yz$ with $y\in \mathbf{f}_\lambda$, $z\in \mathbf{f}_\mu$ with both $\lambda$ and $\mu$ nonzero. Now we consider the symmetric bilinear form on $\mathbf{f}$ and compute $$(x,yz)=(r(x),y\otimes z)=0$$ since $x$ is assumed primitive. This shows that $x$ is orthogonal to all of $\mathbf{f}_\nu$. But the bilinear form is nondegenerate, so $x=0$. Thus the Chevalley generators give a basis of the primitive elements of $\mathbf{f}$. 

Let G be a p-adic group, U a (n appropriate) unipotent subgroup and I an Iwahori subgroup. Then there are Iwahori decompositions I\G/I=U\G/I=W where W is the affine Weyl group. I suspect that $$Uw_1Iw_2I=Uw_1w_2I$$ whenever $\ell(w_1)+\ell(w_2)=\ell(w_1w_2)$. Is this true? 

I can't speak for an original motivation, but from a modern (geometric) point of view, the reason the preprojective algebra is an interesting object is that the moduli stack of representations of the preprojective algebra is equal to the cotangent bundle of the moduli stack of representations of the original quiver Q. 

Since this recently got bumped by the community user, I thought I'd have a go at constructing an answer. The central extension (of G(ℂ((t))) by ℂ×) is algebraic. In particular it is a group ind-scheme, which I believe is strict and ind-affine. However, there does not seem to be a great place in the literature to find information about this central extension (so the OP is not being stupid in his searching). What immediately came to mind for me is Beilinson and Drinfeld's unpublished manuscript "Quantization of Hitchin's Integrable System and Hecke Eigensheaves." I can't say with truth that I am an expert on the contents within, but I believe the answers sought are contained within. Also worth looking at, as mentioned by abx, is the paper by Beauville and Laszlo, "Conformal blocks and generalized theta functions." On the Kac-Moody side, there is the paper "Construction d’un groupe de Kac-Moody et applications" by Mathieu. However once this is constructed, there is the question of comparing it to the loop group, which I don't know where to find an answer to. (On the other hand, Kumar's book doesn't seem to go as far as to construct the Kac-Moody groups as ind-schemes). Since cocycles were brought up, let me point out that for central extensions of group objects in a category C, for cocyles to exist, there must be a splitting in C (not as groups) of the map to the quotient. There will be no cocyle within the cateogry of ind-schemes. However at the level of R-points for some R, you could reasonably expect to find a cocycle. The paper "Block-compatible metaplectic cocycles" by Banks, Levi and Sepanski may be useful to some readers wanting to try their hand at certain explicit cocycles (I've found it useful myself in the context of metaplectic groups over local fields). Hopefully some intrepid MO reader will see this and be motivated to produce a thorough, reliable and accessible exposition of this field. 

Consider the complex algebraic torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ where $\mathbb{C}^*$ stands for $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$. Fix a finite set of lattice points $A = \{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_r\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ and define the map $$\phi_A: (\mathbb{C}^*)^n \to \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r,$$ by $x \mapsto (x^{\alpha_0}:\cdots:x^{\alpha_r})$. Let us assume that $\phi_A$ is an embedding and equip the torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ with the Kahler form $\omega_A = \phi_A^*(\omega_{FS})$ which is the pull-back, via $\phi_A$, of the standard Kahler form (the Fubini-Study form) on the projective space $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r$. We regard $((\mathbb{C}^*)^n, \omega_A)$ as a symplectic manifold. The compact torus $(S^1)^n$ acts on $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ in a Hamiltonian fashion and the image of its moment map is the interior of the convex hull of the finite set $A$. Two important notions of capacity for a symplectic manifold are the Gromov width and the Hofer-Zehnder capacity. One can give estimates for the Gromov width of $((\mathbb{C}^*)^n, \omega_A)$ in terms of the moment polytope, i.e. the convex hull of $A$. My question is: are there any estimates known for the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of $((\mathbb{C}^*)^n, \omega_A)$ in terms of the finite set $A$ or its convex hull? Any statement in this regard would be interesting. 

Hi, Let $I$ be an ideal in a polynomial ring $S = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Fix a term order on $S$ (e.g. a lexicographic order) and let $in(I)$ denote the initial ideal of $I$, that is, the monomial ideal generated by all the initial terms of elements of $I$. It is clear that for any $k > 0$ one has $in(I)^k \subset in(I^k)$, with equality if $I$ itself is a monomial ideal. 

Let $\{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_r\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ be a finite subset of lattice points and let $\Phi: (\mathbb{C}^*)^n \to \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r$ be the corresponding map from the algebraic torus to the projective space defined by: $$\Phi(x) = (x^{\alpha_0}: \cdots : x^{\alpha_r}).$$ Here $x^\alpha$ is short for $x_1^{a_1} \cdots x_n^{a_n}$, $\alpha = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$. For simplicity let us assume that $\Phi$ is an embedding. Consider the standard Fubini-Study metric on $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r$ and equip the torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ with the pull-back metric which we call $g$. It is clearly a metric invariant by the action of the compact subgroup $(S^1)^n$. Let us decompose $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ as $\mathbb{R}^n \times (S^1)^n$ by $(r, \theta) \mapsto e^{r+i\theta}$. Then we can consider $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a subset of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$. My question is if one can describe the geodesics of $g$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$? Is it true that the geodesics are straight lines? 

Since this question was first asked, nontrivial decomposition numbers for Quiver Hecke algebras (=KLR algebras) have been discovered in finite type. Thus there is an alternative family of examples where the canonical and KLR basis disagree, if one is willing to accept ones algebras living over a field of positive characteristic. Known examples are not always explicated in the literature right now. The historically first example is due to Geordie Williamson - see $URL$ or $URL$ 

I assume all groups are discrete and ignore Q3. Also I assume that π comes from a group homomorphism from H to G. By Poincaire-Verdier duality π! is the same as π*. Both of these are identified with restriction. Then π* is the right adjoint of restriction, hence is what I would call coinduction, while π! is the left adjoint of restriction, hence induction. In some contexts (e.g. p-adic groups), I've seen the right adjoint be called induction. The dualising sheaf is the same as the constant sheaf, hence corresponds to the trivial representation. 

Suppose f:X→Y. If I decorate that first sentence with appropriate adjectives, then I get a pushforward map in cohomology H*(X)→H*(Y). For example, suppose that X and Y are oriented manifolds, and f is a submersion. Then such a pushforward map exists. In the de Rham picture, we can see this as integrating a form over fibres. In the sheaf cohomology picture, we can see this via the explication of the exceptional inverse image functor. The question is how else can we think of this pushforward map. I'd be particularly interested in an answer from the algebraic topology point of view, because I'm hoping that such an answer would eludicate the appropriate level of generality in which a pushforward in cohomology exists (perhaps not only answering the question of for which maps f, but also answering the question of in which cohomology theories can we carry out such a construction). 

Consider the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian of k-planes in complex n-space. It has a standard presentation as a quotient of the ring of symmetric functions. In this presentation, the Schur functions are mapped to the Schubert classes, thus have a nice geometric interpretation. One can generalise the Schur functions to skew-Schur functions. Do these also have a nice geometric interpretation? 

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $k$. I was wondering if there is a standard terminology for a function $v: V \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$ which is invariant under multiplication by nonzero scalars and satisfies non-Archimedean inequality $v(x+y) \geq \min\{v(x), v(y)\}$? In the paper "Newton-Okounkov bodies, semigroups of intergral points, graded algebras and intersection theory", the authors call such a function a "pre-valuation", I was wondering if this concept has been introduced before and if there are other terms used for it. Of course, this is related to the notion of ultra-metric. Thanks 

I was wondering what are some standard general references/books/survey articles about: (1) crystal bases, and string parameterizations and (2) Demazure modules, and Schubert varieties (containing basic definitions and proofs of most of the basic statements). I need to cite some general references on these subjects in a paper of mine. 

Let $X_\sigma$ be an affine toric variety for an action of a torus $T$ and let $\mathcal{P}$ be a toric principal $G$-bundle over $X_\sigma$ where $G$ is an affine algebraic group (here base field $k$ is algebraically closed and characteristic $0$, in fact I am content with $k = \mathbb{C}$). By a toric principal $G$-bundle $\mathcal{P}$ we mean $T$ acts on $\mathcal{P}$ lifting its action on $X_\sigma$ and the $T$-action and $G$-action on $\mathcal{P}$ commute. My question is wether $\mathcal{P}$ is $T$-equivariantly trivial. By this, we mean the following: there exists a homomorphism $\phi: T \to G$ such that $\mathcal{P}$ is $T$-equivariantly isomorphic to $X_\sigma \times G$ where $T$ acts on this product diagonally by acting on $G$ via $\phi$ and left multiplication, that is, $t \cdot (x, g) = (t \cdot x, \phi(x)g)$. It is well-known and not difficult to show that this is true when $G = GL(n)$ (that is, one has a toric vector bundle). As far as I know by a result of Biswas-Dey-Poddar (2015) which itself relies on an earlier result of Heinzner-Kutzschebauch (1995), this is true for when $X_\sigma$ is complex affine space. I was wondering if this is known for other affine toric varieties. 

Hi, Can one define a Fubini-Study metric/Kaehler metric on the projective space of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, i.e. using the formula $\partial \bar{\partial} \log |Z|^2$? This should be very well-known to the experts. Anyhow I don't have much experience with infinite dimension and worried that something may go wrong. I appreciate any comments or references. 

Renormalizations in QFT Renormalizations as discarding perturbative corrections to masses and charges were not easily accepted, even by their inventors, because of being obviously anti-mathematic. It remains to be a prescription, lucky in some rare cases and wrong in the others. In Physics we use a perturbation theory where the perturbation is supposed to be small but it is "big" in QFT. First we write down a non perturbed Hamiltonian, let's say: $\hat H_0 = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \hat{V}_0 (x)$ (1) Everything in it is quite physical including the electron mass. Then we "develop" our theory and include, as we think, a small interaction that has also a kinetic and a potential term: $\hat H_{int} = -\epsilon\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \hat{V}_1 (x)$ (2) The kinetic term shifts the particle mass, it is obvious. But our mass is already good in (1) and any its shifting worsens agreement with experiment. Discarding this correction "restores" the right kinetic part of the Hamiltonian, and taking $\hat{V}_1$ into account improves agreement with experiment. So the discarding practice became a part of QFT calculations. Appearance of a kinetic perturbative term is due to our misunderstanding interactions. Some part of interactions cannot be treated perturbatively but should be present in the zeroth-order approximation. Discarding is a very bad practice. For (2) it may luckily work, but for other our guesses of interactions it can be more complicated and be just "non renormalizable". Although shown on a simplest example, the renormalizations in QFT have nothing else in their meaning but repairing a wrongly guessed Hamiltonian via repairing the corresponding solutions. Normally it is difficult to see explicitly that some part of guessed interaction, namely a "self-action" term, is of a kinetic nature. That is why presently they "explain" renormalizations differently. A correct theory development should not include kinetic perturbative terms. Then the perturbative series will be reasonable, in my opinion. 

It is the physical model that fails. The physical model leads to certain equations that do not have physical (as well as mathematical) solutions. Even zeroth-order approximation fails. This property does not belong exclusively to QG. Any QFT fails because of bad physical model. It is seen first in the zeroth-order approximation (it is too "far" form the exact solution); next it is seen as divergences of perturbative corrections (IR and UV infinities). Normally one cannot proceed without patching and repairing the originally obtained solutions. Sometimes such "doctoring" numbers works but it is just a huge luck and in the end this luck turns into a bad luck - people (even mathematicians!) get used to patching and repairing solutions (???!!!) and try to apply such "prescriptions" to all models. Fortunately it does not work in many cases so not all people get smug. There are several ideologies of justifying "renormalization" but even they fail. Nevertheless many keep smiling and "explaining" even in that case ("effective theory" ideology) like a failed magician. It is practically impossible to find a reasonable attitude to all that. I was trying to understand and explain "success" of renormalizations myself and I even succeeded but my work needs further development.
