Are there stars - in our galaxy, as stars in other galaxies are not individually visible - that are 'dead' but still alight to us. The Slate article you linked is rather good in this respect: i) the lifespan of a given star is much longer than the time taken for light to reach us so it is unlikely that this is the case and ii) most stars have an extended extinction compared to the time taken for light to reach us, with few going out in a supernova flash. Hence it is pretty unlikely that this is the case at the moment - but it will happen on occasion If there is a specific star which is 'dead' but still alight to us - could we know? Not really, as no useful information will be travelling to us faster than the speed of light. The best we might do is to observe a supernova and then say "this event happened x years ago" 

The Gary Seronik website that you cite is a good one - it's not leading you astray! There are a couple of important things to look at: 

This is a slightly tricky one. For a conventional Newtonian reflector, shining a laser collimator back over the secondary to the primary should present a small dot on the primary - the task then is to adjust the secondary to center the dot on the primary - there is hopefully a mark on the primary. This is a reasonable general primer: $URL$ HOWEVER, the 114 is special, having a Barlow lens embedded in the bottom of the focuser. This would have the effect of spreading the laser light back into the telescope, leading to a projected shape (a disk or oval) on the primary. It's not really possible to conclude whether the collimator is collimated from this. Reading the manual ( $URL$ ), the manufacturer recommends a simple sight test: remove the eyepiece, and look down the focuser, adjusting the primary to center your eye (hence not worrying about the secondary alignment). Alternatively, you should be able to remove the Barlow lens by racking the focus tube all the way out and unscrewing it (do remember which way around it is mounted ...), which would allow the use of the laser. Simplest solution would be to use a low tech Cheshire collimator, I think. These forum discussions might give useful background: $URL$ $URL$ 

I don't think stellar parallax would directly help us as it (in the modern day) just tells us that we are in orbit around the sun and little about the Earth-Moon system itself. Let's look at how a Ptolemy equivalent on the Moon (call him Moon-Ptolemy) might see it. He would have no way of distinguishing the Earth-Moon system from his assumption that he is just sitting on a solid object at the center of creation. Of course he wouldn't see a "moon" in orbit around him, but he would see the Sun, stars and major planets. Stellar parallax (to him, the Sun "moving through the Zodiac) would just tell him that Sun is rotating around his Moon, as are the planets. The existence of planetary epicycles would be a curiosity required to make his model work - but it does work and he has no notion of the Earth Moon-Galileo might (or might not) be able to develop the heliocentric model - he misses out on one key insight that Earth-Galileo had: that the Earth wasn't special because other planets also had moons. Moon-Galileo would find the orbital system of Jupiter interesting but not a key insight, so he might not develop the new model. Even so, someone else would. Nevertheless, in a qualitative scientific world, there would still be nothing to help the Moon observer deduce the existence of the Earth behind the horizon. I suspect the truth would become unavoidable when orbital mechanics developed sufficiently to incorporate mass and gravity into calculation. It might have been around the time of Moon-Kepler. I'm not sure I agree with the comments looking at observations of the planets - I don't see how they help distinguish between an Earth-Moon system as opposed to a simple, very large, rotating Moon body with no co-orbiter (which would be a natural assumption to make). Even the monthly changes in parallax caused by the rotation of the Moon around the Earth might be waved away by suggesting the simple rotation of a much larger Moon body - though our hero might certainly question the compatibility of this with the apparent curvature and distance to their Moon horizon. 

As @RobJeffries mentions, you can calculate the difference from the equations which define magnitude and flux. But this particular case is even covered in the Wikipedia article on apparent magnitude: 

Well, this radiation is way too small to be detected by itself, even if the black hole would be at our doorstep. However, the radiation makes the black hole less massive and smaller and finally it will vanish, producing a gamma ray flash which we hope is detectable, even from a very large distance. As @JamesK notes in the comments, this evaporation will take extremely long for the 'common' black holes caused by supernovae and those found in galaxy centers, but smaller primordial black holes, formed in the very beginning of the universe, could be evaporating now and that's why we have a telescope looking for those gamma ray flashes. 

Is it moving straight to the west (i.e. it keeps the same distance from the horizon) or does it 'move with the stars'? Have you checked an online planetarium like The Sky Live? Based on the current information, it could just be Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, or even Venus which is currently in her Evenstar period (but planets generally don't twinkle). 

This is not really known; while the rotation period of most of the larger satellites is known, and they're mostly synchronized, for the smaller ones it's harder to determine and they're less likely to be synchronized: 

The major axis is just the sum of the distance at perigee plus the distance at apogee. This is 400 km + 1500 km + the diameter (not radius) of the Earth, and the semi-major axis is half of that. However, the semi-minor axis is harder to determine. Therefore, why not use an alternative method to calculate the eccentricity? $$e = \frac{r_a-r_p}{r_a+r_p}$$ Here, the $r$'s are the distance to the center of the Earth, not the apside altitudes. Can you take it from here? 

Does Polaris have a trail in the sky timelapse? Yes. Every star has a trail, but it's smaller if it's closer to the pole. Polaris is close to the pole but it's still 45 (arc)minutes away. I don't think it's visible with the naked eye; no star trail is visible with the naked eye as you only see one 'instance' of the sky. What perhaps would work, and is more feasible for stars closer to the celestial equator, is trying to see the movement of a star compared to an object on Earth, e.g. a tree, a building or the horizon. The exposure times of the photos are different, as @J.Chomel notes in the comments. You can calculate the exposure time by looking at the arc length; in 23 hours and 56 minutes (a 'sidereal day'), a star will make a full circle. The trails on the last photo have an arc length of about 8 degrees, corresponding to about 30 minutes; the first two photos are more like 9 resp. 5 hours. Also, the zoom factor (of the lens) may play a role; if a photo is zoomed in more, Polaris' movement is more likely to be visible. I'm not sure if this plays a role in this photos, though. 

Phone cameras just aren't designed to take good photographs of astronomical objects. The sensor is too small and the configuration options (like exposure time) are minimal. For astronomical photography, a better option is to use (the body of) a DSLR (or the analog version); the lens is provided by your telescope. Another option is a specialized CCD camera. 

As discussed here, the path of the Sun resembles a sine wave (see the image below), with a (semi-)amplitude equal to the axial tilt of the Earth, usually denoted $\varepsilon$, about 23.4 degrees. A simple formula, which might be accurate for your purposes, is the following: if $a$ denotes the right ascension (in hours), the declination $\delta$ is given by the following formula: $$\delta = \varepsilon \sin(2\pi\frac{a}{24h})$$ The actual formula is more complicated. From the formulas linked to by @barrycarter: $$\alpha = \arctan(\cos\varepsilon \tan\lambda)$$ $$\delta = \arcsin(\sin\varepsilon \sin\lambda)$$ we obtain $$\tan\alpha = \cos\varepsilon \tan\lambda$$ $$\frac{\tan\alpha}{\cos\varepsilon} = \tan\lambda$$ so $$\lambda = \arctan\frac{\tan\alpha}{\cos\varepsilon}$$ Plugging this into the declination formula, and using the fact that $\sin(\arctan(x)) = \frac{x}{\pm\sqrt{x^2+1}}$, we get $$\delta = \arcsin(\sin\varepsilon \frac{\tan\alpha}{\pm\sqrt{\tan^2\alpha+\cos^2\varepsilon}})$$ (here the right ascension $\alpha$ is measured in radians or degrees, not hours). 

Firstly, if you're planet spotting, don't worry too much about light pollution. The planets are some of the brightest objects in the sky and some (especially Jupiter) can easily be observed even with a full Moon - the full Moon (along with the Sun!) is the biggest contributor to light pollution! Take a look at the list of brightest stars ( $URL$ ), which also contains estimates for the brightness of the Sun, Moon and major planets. There aren't typically any stars brighter from Earth than Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Mercury and precious few brighter than Saturn. I'm going to suggest you probably have seen many of the planets - but just didn't recognise them. +1 for Stellarium ( $URL$ ). It's free, intuitive and very visual to use. You can put in your local viewing location and it gives you a view for any time of the night, future or past. At the time of writing (23 July 2017), Saturn and Jupiter should be looking good for the Southern Hemisphere. This rotates throughout the year, and Stellarium will help with this. Do a web search for "the sky at night in the southern hemisphere" and you'll find a number of examples of websites with highlights to look for when you get out. Couple of final suggestions: 

Hmm - good question, Michael; and thanks for sharing your images with us. For me, it's about eliminating possible causes: 

Yes, you can. I use a Newtonian reflector, 200mm objective, 1000mm focal length. Uranus is sometimes right on the fringe of naked eye but looks a lot clearer as a small but recognisable blueish disc. Neptune, sadly, just looks like a star to me ... but you can find it. 

You said "The thing that I am really puzzled about is that through the lens the image did not look like either of these pictures" - please could you clarify what you meant by lens here; were you talking about using the scope, Barlow and a separate eyepiece, or were you using scope, Barlow and DSLR with live preview lens? It is much more common for people to image the planets using a video stacked approach. The idea behind this is that they are very bright (so exposure times can be very short) and the limiting factor is random blurring caused by atmospheric seeing. If you take a video file of say 1000 frames at 20fps then there is software available that can combine these into good shots (e.g. AutoStakkert, Registax). What DSLR are you using? For what it's worth, the human eye is very good at picking details and resolving out the seeing on bright objects, so my first photo attempts were dreadful compared to what I could see in the eyepiece. I'd recommend you try reading up on this approach for inspiration. Some (but not all) DSLRs do allow video recording modes, so it might be worth a try. Saturn is definitely a tricky object to go for - at the time of writing Jupiter isn't in a good Northern Hemisphere space (I'd normally suggest trying it out as a somewhat easier target). Have you tried practising by imaging parts of the Moon - it's a much easier target to build confidence and practical experience? Please don't be disheartened ... it took me a couple of years to get semi-decent pictures of Saturn 

In theory, yes; in practice probably not ... i) It's perhaps helpful to take the Andromeda galaxy as a first working example. It is somewhat bigger than our own Milky Way galaxy but not so big as to be a problem. When we look at Andromeda, it appears to occupies an area about 3 degrees by 1 degree. By comparison, the Moon appear about 0.5 degree across. Andromeda is a good target to see, a little faint but it is just about visible with the naked eye on a good night. Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away so, even travelling at the speed of light, it would take 2.5 million years to get far away enough from the Milky Way so we could look back and see our galaxy like we see Andromeda today. ( In Star Trek, the writers seemed broadly to limit themselves to adventures within our galaxy for the same reason: within the realms of sci-fi, perhaps they could justify getting around the Milky Way within a reasonable period of time - not so to travel between the galaxies ) ii) To reduce the apparent size of our galaxy to a dot would require travelling at least 10x further or probably more - depending on how you are observing. 50 million light years, anyone?
