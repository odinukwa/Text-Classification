I apologize if this question doesn't make any sense. I'll just go ahead and delete it if that's the case. But the question is just the title. Is there a notion of forcing in homotopy type theory? Presumably we do homotopy type theory in some $(\infty,1)$-topos, so we can axiomatize the notions accordingly? Does anyone know of a reference for this kind of thing if it does exist or makes sense? Thanks 

If there is a short answer to this question and someone can write it here that'd be wonderful, but if it's longer, I'm also perfectly happy with a reference. My question is regarding accessing data in non-trivial cohomological degree of a cosimplicial space. Ultimately, for me, this comes down to questions about looping and delooping cosimplicial spaces and/or quasicategories. 1) Given a cosimplicial quasicategory $C^\bullet$, can I take the homotopy pullback of $\ast\to C^\bullet\leftarrow \ast$ (with some chosen base point in $C^\bullet$), to obtain a notion of $\Omega C^\bullet$? 2) If so, can I then compute what should correspond to data in cohomological degree 1, and hence what would be in $\pi_{-1}Tot(\Omega C^\bullet)$ (using e.g. a Bousfield Kan sort of spectral sequence $\pi^s\pi_t\Rightarrow\pi_{t-s})$, of the connected component containing the base point, by somehow "delooping" $\Omega C^\bullet$ and attempting to compute $\pi_0Tot(B\Omega C^\bullet)$? Of course, without stability, it doesn't really make sense to talk about $\pi_{-1}$, that's just where this "information would live" if it did. My main issue is what the construction of "delooping" should be in the situation of a 1-fold looped cosimplicial quasicategory? Also, does the category of cosimplicial quasicategories admit an initial object? The motivation for this question comes from homotopical descent theory. Thanks, as usual! 

Given a map of spaces $f:X\to BGL_1(R)$ for $R$ an $E_\infty$-ring spectrum (of course this can be done more generally) one can produce a Thom spectrum $Mf$ by a number of methods. Let's denote such a datum by $(X,f)$ and let $(X,\ast)$ denote the datum $X\to \ast\to BGL_1(R)$, whose associated Thom spectrum is $R\wedge\Sigma^\infty_+X$, which we will denote by $R[X]$. There is a morphism in $Top_{BGL_1(R)}$, which we might denote $(\Delta,-\times\ast):(X,f)\to (X\times X,f\times\ast)$ which Thomifies to the morphism of spectra $Mf\to Mf\wedge R[X]$ (note that the target of this map is an object of $Top_{BGL_1(R)}$ because we can multiply the two maps together using the multiplicative structure on $BGL_1(R)$). It is not hard to show that the map $(X,\ast)\to (X,\ast\times\ast)$ induces a co-$E_\infty$ comultiplication on $R[X]$. However, it seems much less clear to me that the Thom diagonal in general exhibits $Mf$ as an $E_\infty$-comodule over $R[X]$. This would follow from showing that the above diagonal map exhibits $(X,f)$ as a co-$E_\infty$-comodule in $Top_{BGL_1(R)}$. Intuitively, I believe this to be true because all of the necessary coherences exist on the diagonal map, and on the morphism $f$ we're simply crossing with the trivial map. Note that the above is not the trivial coaction, which would be given by $X\simeq X\times\ast\overset{id_X\times\ast}\to X\times X$. For me, being a co-$E_\infty$ comodule simply means being an $E_\infty$-module over the $E_\infty$-algebra $R[X]$ in the opposite of the category of interest. Note also that in the category $Top_{BGL_1(R)}$ the symmetric monoidal structure is given by the infinite loop space structure of $BGL_1(R)$. I have been playing with this for some time but have not been able to prove it with the tools I have. 

Let $0 < \delta_1 \leq \delta_2 \leq \delta_3 \leq 1$, and consider the box $B := [0,X^{\delta_1}] \times [0,X^{\delta_2}] \times [0,X^{\delta_3}] \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$. Let $X > 3$ say. Is it possible to pack $B$ with cubes (box which has equal side lengths) $J_1, \ldots, J_N$ contained in $B$ satisfying the following property: 

I have a question related to geometry of numbers, which although seems quite basic, I was rather confused by it so I decided to ask here. Let $\Lambda$ be a lattice in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $R_1, ..., R_n$ be the successive minima of $\Lambda$ and $\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, ..., \mathbf{x}^{(n)}$ be the minimal points of $\Lambda$. In "Analytic Methods for Diophantine Equations and Diophantine Inequalities", by Harold Davenport, in Lemma 12.2, he proves that if $d(\Lambda)=1$, then $$ 1 \leq R_1...R_n \leq 2^nJ_n, $$ where $J_n$ is the volume of a sphere of radius $1$ in $n$ dimensions. The very first step of the proof is to "rotate the $n$-dimensional space about $O$ until" the matrix $[\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, ..., \mathbf{x}^{(n)}]$ is upper triangular. What I was wondering was that in stead of rotation, could we instead: change coordinates via elementary row operations so that, in the new coordinate system, the minimal points have the given shape? (Since elementary row operations have a non-zero determinant, we can divide the resulting transformation by their determinants to obtain a transformation which has determinant $1$.) I felt perhaps there may be some issues with this, but I was not quite sure. I would appreciate any clarification. Thank you! 

Let $\mathbf{p}$ be a primitive point in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^J$ and denote the $J-1$ dimensional vector space $V = \mathbf{p}^{\perp} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^J$. Let $\Lambda' = \mathbb{Z}^J \cap V $, which is a lattice of rank $J-1$. What I am interested in is : does there always exist an integral basis $\{ \omega_1, ..., \omega_{J-1} \}$ of $\Lambda'$ such that for each $j$, $ |\omega_j | \leq |\mathbf{p}|$? The statement is definitely true when $J=2$. I was curious for $J>2$. I thought it is maybe true, but I haven't been able to show it yet (or disprove it). I would appreciate any hint/solution! (I apologize in advance if this question happens to be not at the mathoverflow level.) 

There are many results in number theory, where the existence of some $B \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with certain properties is proved by a probabilistic argument employing "random sets". One such example would be the result of Erdos and Renyi, where they proved the existence of a "think" $B_2[g]$ sequence. My question is are there certain known properties, so that if $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ satisfies them, then $A$ is considered to behave like a random set? or what properties would make $A$ considered to be close to being random? Thank you! 

Let $q$ be a prime power and $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the field of $q$ elements. Let $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ be the polynomial ring over $\mathbb{F}_q$. I am working on a research project, where I bounded a certain expectation $E$ by $E \ll S + S'$, where $$ S = \sum_{ \substack{ x_i \in \mathbb{F}_q[t] \backslash \{ 0 \} \ (1 \leq i \leq 6) \\ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 =n \\ x_1 + x_4 = x_5 + x_6 } } q^{ -\gamma (\deg x_1 + \deg x_2 + \deg x_3 + \deg x_4 + \deg x_5 + \deg x_6 ) }, $$ $$ S' = \sum_{ \substack{ x_i \in \mathbb{F}_q[t] \backslash \{ 0 \} \ (i = 1,2,3,5,6 ) \\ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 =n \\ x_1 + x_2 = x_5 + x_6 } } q^{ -\gamma (\deg x_1 + \deg x_2 + \deg x_3 + \deg x_5 + \deg x_6 ) }. $$ I managed to find a bound for $S$ and $S'$ by "brute force" and found a bound for $E$. What I Was wondering was is there possibly an easy or obvious way to see that $S' \ll S$? The reason why I ask is I had many cases to consider and I am looking for a way to cut down on the amount of computation I wrote up (and many of the cases look like what I have here). I would greatly appreciate any advice. Thanks! ps Let $\gamma > 0$ be a positive real number sufficiently large so that both sums converge. 

Descent cohomology for a comonad is defined at degrees 0 and 1 by Mesablishvili in his paper "On Descent Cohomology" (as well as by many other authors in many other contexts). For a comonad $\bot$ on a category $\mathcal{B}$ and a $\bot$-comodule $b$ with structure map $\theta$, he says that the 0th cohomology of $(b,\theta)$ is the group of comodule automorphisms $(b,\theta)\to (b,\theta)$. The 1st descent cohomology is the pointed set of isomorphism classes of $\bot$-comodule structures on $b$, if I'm reading him correctly. Mesablishvili goes on to show that if the comonad is the free-forgetful one on the category of $\top$-algebras for some monad $\top$, one can compute the descent cohomology of that comonad in terms of a certain Amitsur cohomology associated to the monad $\top$. Many parts of this generalize quite nicely to the case of $\infty$-categories. Does anyone know if someone (I'm thinking Jacob Lurie primarily) has defined a similar sort of descent cohomology in the case of comonads on $\infty$-categories? I feel like this sort of thing could be somewhere in DAG or Higher Algebra. I believe that the analog is most certainly true in the homotopical setting, and that this is probably known to many experts. I only wonder if it's written down anywhere. If not, I guess I'll write it down. 

Is the stable homotopy category idempotent complete? I have not been able to prove it, and the proof for abelian groups seems to strongly rely on looking at elements. Thanks, Jon 

In Section 4.4 of his book Higher Algebra, Lurie introduces, for a monoid object $A$ of a monoidal quasicategory $C$, and right and left $A$-modules $M,N$, the relative tensor product $M\otimes_AN$. As I've stated it, this object is only a $(1,1)$-bimodule, where I'm using $1$ to indicate the monoidal unit of $C$. If $M$ and $N$ have left and right $A'$ and $A''$-actions respectively, then $M\otimes_A N$ is an $(A',A'')$-bimodule. In general, this construction (see Construction 4.4.2.7) is done over an arbitrary $\infty$-operad $O^\otimes$. This uses Lurie's $\infty$-operad $Tens^\otimes$ in an essential way. Specifically if we have a commutative diagram $$\matrix{ Tens^\otimes_{[2]} \to& C^\otimes\\ \downarrow & \downarrow\\ Tens^\otimes\overset{f}\to& O^\otimes}$$ where the top horizontal map picks out the pair of modules and the algebra we wish to tensor them over, then the relative tensor product is given by a lift $Tens^\otimes\to C^\otimes$ as a diagonal arrow in this diagram, whose restriction to a certain subcategory of $Tens^\otimes$ picks out the object in $C$ which is the tensor product itself. My Question is the following: What sorts of maps are there $f:Tens^\otimes\to O^\otimes$? For instance, since $Tens^\otimes$ is produced, it seems, from $N(\Delta)^{op}$, I cannot see how one might get a map $f:Tens^\otimes\to E_n^\otimes$ to produce the relative tensor product over an $E_{n-1}$-algebra in $C$. Is there a way around this? Does Lurie describe how to produce more than maps $Tens^\otimes\to Ass^\otimes$? 

All of the notations created to simplify writing category theory. For instance, the idea of drawing a circular arrow inside of a diagram to indicate that that diagram is commutative. As well as the idea of putting an angle in the top left or bottom right of a square diagram to indicate that it is a pushout or pullback. And finally, the notation of augmenting any of these notations with $\simeq$ to indicate that the diagram is only "up to homotopy". 

I have been thinking about some set that is equidistributed modulo $q$, uniformly in $q$ in some sense. I was starting to think this particular condition, which I describe below, is too strong and that I am starting to doubt if any such set even exists. However, I haven't been able to prove no such set exists. I was wondering if someone could tell me how to prove that such set does not exist (or that does exist). I would also appreciate any input or discussion on whether such set exists or not. It would be great if I could get a better understanding! Thank you very much! Let $\gamma >\theta >0$, and some $\epsilon >0$ small. Let $B \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $B \cap [1,X] \sim X^{\gamma}$. Suppose given any $q \in \mathbb{N}$ and any partition of the residue class modulo $q$, $\{ J_l \}_{l=1}^L$, such that $|J_l|X^{\gamma}/q > X^{\epsilon}$, we have $$ \sum_{l=1}^L| \ \# \{ u \in B : u \leq X, u \equiv J_l (\text{mod }q) \} - (|J_l|X^{\gamma})/q \ | \ll X^{\gamma - \theta}. $$ I am wondering does such a set $B$ exist? If $J = \{ r_1, .., r_k \}$, by $u \equiv J (\text{mod }q)$, I mean $u \equiv r_j (\text{mod }q)$ for some $j \in \{1, ..., k \}$. Thanks! 

Obtaining a non-trivial estimate for $\sum_p (\log p) e(p \alpha)$ over the minor arcs is one of the estimates required for obtaining the ternary Goldbach for $n$ sufficiently large via the circle method (at least for the 'classical' proof I am aware of). We know by Vaughn's identity that if $|\alpha - a/q| < 1/q^2$, $(a,q)=1$, $q \leq n$ then we have an estimate of the form $$ \sum_{p \leq n} (\log p )e(p \alpha) \ll (n q^{-1/2} + n^{4/5} + n^{1/2}q^{1/2}) (\log n )^4, $$ and in case when $(\log n)^{c_1} \leq q \leq n/(\log n)^{c_2}$ we obtain a non-trivial estimate for the above sum. My question is: are there other examples of sequence say $M = \{m_1, m_2, .. \} \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that we have an estimate of the above type if we replace the primes with $M$. In other words, are there examples of sequences $M$ (and possibly with a suitable weight function $f(m)$ ) such that for $$ \sum_{m \in M, m \leq n} f(m) e(m \alpha) $$ we have a similar estimate as above where we can obtain a non-trivial estimate when $q$ is in the appropriate range? Thank you very much! 

Let $S \subset \mathbb{N}$. We say $S$ is of type $B_2(g)$ if the number of representation of the form $n = s_1 + s_2 \ (s_1 \leq s_2)$ is bounded by $g$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Let $S(n)$ be the number of elements of $S$ not exceeding $n$. There is a theorem by Erdos and Renyi, which states that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $g =g(\epsilon)$ and a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $S$ is of type $B_2(g)$ and $$ S(n) > n^{1/2 - \epsilon} $$ for $n$ sufficiently large. My question is, is this best up to $\epsilon$? In other words, if $S$ is of type $B_2(g)$, then does it follow that $$ S(n) \ll n^{1/2} $$ for $n$ sufficiently large? I am guessing that this is the case, but I was wondering if someone could possibly explain this to me. Thank you!
