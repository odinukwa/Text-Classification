I think the answer is no, but let me first give a precise version of the question (which I think Daniel's argument doesn't quite address). Fix some reasonable listing $P_0,P_1,\dots$ of recursively enumerable sets of polynomials. [See below for a ``reasonable" coding.] I claim that there is no algorithm to determine if $V(P_e)=\emptyset$. Let $K$ be the diagonal halting set. Namely, $K=$ {$e$: the $ e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $e$}. For each $e$ let $P_e=\{p_0,p_1,\dots\}$ be the recursively enumerable sequence of polynomials where $p_i=0$ if the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine has not halted by stage $i$ and $p_i=1$ if has. Then $V(P_e)=\emptyset \Leftrightarrow e\in K$. Since $K$ is undecidable there is no algorithm to decide if $V(P_e)$ is empty. One way to code sequences of polynomials would be to let $q_0,q_1,\dots$ list all polynomials, and let $P_e$ be {$q_i:$ the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $i$}. To get to Ian's setting we could view $P_e$ as the sequence $p_0,p_1,\dots$ where $p_{(i,j)\}$ is 0 unless the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input i at stage $j$ in which case it is $q_i$ and $(i,j)$ is some computable pairing function. 

The classical argument Andres mentions can be taken one step further to show that if every uncountable $\Pi_1^1$ set contains a perfect subset then $\aleph_1$ is inaccessible in $L$. This follows from the same fact for $\Sigma^1_2$-sets since, by the uniformization theorem, every $\Sigma^1_2$-set is the injective projection of a $\Pi^1_1$-set. 

A minimax theorem is a theorem which states that under certain conditions on $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ and $f$: $$ \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}}{\sup_{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{f(x,y)}} = \sup_{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}}{f(x,y)}}$$ All minimax theorems rely strongly on convexity: the sets $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are usually required to be convex subsets of vector spaces, and $f$ to be convex-concave. My question is: of course one cannot expect much without some convexity, but is it possible to get rid of the convexity of the domain in any way? For example, consider the simplest minimax problem: $\mathcal{X}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mathcal{Y}$ a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f(x,y) = \langle x,y \rangle$ is the usual scalar product. Are there any minimax results in this setting (with of course additional assumptions on $\mathcal{X}$ or $\mathcal{Y}$, but $\mathcal{X}$ should not be assumed to be convex) ? 

I'm interested in estimating the mean $\mu$ of a distribution given i.i.d samples. The empirical mean is a totally acceptable estimator (and can even be shown to be asymptotically/close to optimal under certains models) for the typical squared loss function. But now let's say my loss function is very unbalanced/asymmetrical (underestimating is much more costly than overestimating for example), so that the empirical mean is not acceptable anymore. For example, take: $$L(\mu,\hat{\mu})= \frac{2 \ \mu^2 + \hat{\mu}^2}{3 \ \mu^{\frac{4}{3}}\hat{\mu}^{\frac{2}{3}}}$$ which is a positive convex function which is minimized when $\hat{\mu} = \mu$ and is quite unbalanced. How is this field called? Can anyone point me to a good/seminal paper about this kind of question so I can work my way from there? Thank you in advance! PS: It does not have to be about the mean specifically, nor about this loss function. PS2: I am only interested in a nonparametric setting, so no parametric methods please. 

Pillay and Scanlon gave an example showing Morley rank isn't definable in elementary extensions in: Compact complex manifolds with the DOP and other properties, J. Symbolic Logic, vol. 67 (2002), pp. 737–743. In a different direction Dale Radin showed the you do have definability of dimension in the standard model in: A definability result for compact complex spaces. J. Symbolic Logic vol. 69 (2004), pp. 241–254. 

This is really a comment, but I need a bit more space. If $\phi$ is a sentence of ${\cal L}_{\omega_1,\omega}$ that is $\aleph_0$-categorial, there is a complete first order theory $T$ in an expanded vocabulary such that the models of $\phi$ are exactly the reducts atomic models of $\phi$. The expansion is done in such a way that two structures will be isomorphic in the original language if and only if they are isomorphic in the expanded language. So your question is really the same as: For $\phi$ a sentence of ${\cal}L_{\omega_1,\omega}$ is ``$\phi$ is $\kappa$-categorical for all infinite $\kappa$" absolute? This is, as far as I know, still an open question. It is also open if ``$\phi$ is $\aleph_1$-categorical" is absolute. John Baldwin in his paper ``Amalgamation, Absoluteness, and Categoricity" addresses some issues around this. Here is a link $URL$ 

Another way to do this is to use the Hensel-Rychlick version of Hensel's Lemma. This says that if you have $f\in {\mathbb Z}_p[X]$ and $a\in{\mathbb Z}_p$ such that $v(f(a))>2v(f^\prime(a))$, then $f$ has a zero in ${\mathbb Z}_p$. As in Jerome's answer we can find an integer $n$ such that $x=n+p^3\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is a unit. Let $f(X)=X^p-{x\over n}$. Then $v(f(1))=3$ while $v(f^\prime(1))=1$. Thus $x\over n$ has a $p$-th root. Indeed, the Hensel-Rychlick Lemma says you can find a zero $c$ with $v(c-a)\ge v(f(a))-v(f^\prime(a))$. 

This question deals with approximating a convex body (a compact convex set of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with non-empty interior) by convex polytopes. For a given $\delta$, let $n_\delta$ be the number of faces needed to approximate any convex body by a contained convex polytope with at most $n_\delta$ faces and Hausdorff distance at most $\delta$. I'm interested in non-asymptotic upper-bounds on this number $n_\delta$ of faces. In the following survey: $URL$ the author gives in (6) a non asymptotic upper bound, on the number of vertices $n_{\delta,v}$ needed to approximate a convex body by a polytope with Hausdorff distance at most $\delta$: $$\delta \leq \frac{C}{n_{\delta,v}^{\frac{2}{d-1}}} $$ He then states "Certainly the same estimates hold for" approximation by polytopes contained in/containing the convex body, and also replacing vertices by faces. So when taking "faces" and "contained in", this is exactly the result I want. Unfortunately, there is no clear reference given to such results. Since this problem is really far from my field, I don't have access to many sources through my department's subscriptions to scientific journals and through my libray. If I knew a precise reference, it would be no problem for me to ask my department to purchase the precise reference or my library to borrow the precise book, but it is very difficult for me to find such a precise reference. So I'd be very grateful if anyone could point a precise reference to this result out to me. 

We will always have ${\rm ZF}^M\supseteq {\rm ZF}$. The problem comes if $M$ contains nonstandard sentences--which is equivalent to the question of whether $M$ contains nonstandard natural numbers since we can identify formulas with their Godel codes. If there are no nonstandard integers, then they type of externl induction you are doing works fine, but if there aren't it might break down at a nonstandard stage. 

The theory of the natural numbers with addition and $x\mapsto 2^x$ is decidable. One reference is the Cherlin-Point paper "On extensions of Presburger arithmetic". It can be found on Francoise Point's webpage: $URL$ 

Wilkie's proof of o-minimality of exponentiation tells you (without needing to assume Schanuel's Conjecture) that for each $k$ there is a bound $M_k$ such that any exponential polynomial $\sum_{i=1}^k c_ie^{\alpha_i x}$ has at most $M_k$ real zeros [assuming that the $c_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are real.] Perhaps Khovanskii's work gives an explicit bound on the $M_k$. 

The classical example is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ sets of reals. We say that $X\subset \mathbb R$ is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ if the complement of the projection of a Borel set in ${\mathbb R}^n$. Any such set of cardinality greater than $\aleph_1$ has cardinality continuum. 

This doesn't exactly answer your question but... If $A$ is any upper bound for the arithmetic degrees then $0^{(\omega)}$ is recursive in $A^{\prime\prime}$. Enderton and Putnam proved that there upper bounds with $A^{\prime\prime}=0^{(\omega)} $ Dave 

As I recall, McAloon's method for proving that there are no computable nonstandard models of $I\Delta_0$ was to show that there are initial segments that are nonstandard models of PA. The usual Tennenbaum tricks can then be used to show that addition and multiplication are not computable. Additional Comment-- Here are references for McAloon's paper and the paper of Wilmers that proves a similar result for $IE_1$ the fragment of $I\Delta_0$ where you only have induction for formulas with bounded existential quantifiers McAloon, Kenneth, On the complexity of models of arithmetic.

I eventually found the answer to my question. The answer is no: take $\nu$ the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. Let $\hat{\nu}_n$ be the empirical distribution obtained from $n$ samples of $\nu$. Let $\Gamma$ be the set of all discrete signed measures. It is a convex subset of the set of all signed measures. For $x \in \Gamma$, $I(x) = KL(x,\nu) = +\infty$ so $\inf_{x \in \Gamma}{I(x)} = +\infty$ and $$e^{-n \inf_{x\in \Gamma}{I(x)}} = 0$$ Yet $$\mathbb{P}\left(\hat{\nu}_n \in \Gamma\right) = 1$$ since the empirical distribution is of course discrete. (Note that it is possible to find a topology making the space considered a Polish one, see Dembo and Zeitouni for example.) So topological arguments are needed, at least in the infinite dimensional setting. Still wondering if the result holds in finite dimension though (it does hold in dimension $1$). 

Let $X_1,\dots,X_n$ be $n$ i.i.d random variables taking values in a Polish vector space $\mathcal{X}$ and with (Borel) probability distribution $\mu$. For any convex, compact $\Gamma \subset \mathcal{X}$, it can be proved using Sion's minimax theorem (see for example Exercice 4.5.5 in Dembo and Zeitouni) that: $$ \forall n \quad \mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}{X_k} \in \Gamma\right) \leq e^{-n \inf_{x\in \Gamma}{I(x)}}$$ with $I$ the Fenchel Legendre transform of the moment generating function. Using the concept of dominating point (see for example the works of Ney), it can also be shown that for any convex, open set $\Gamma$ (and a few more assumptions): $$ \forall n \quad \mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}{X_k} \in \Gamma\right) \leq e^{-n \inf_{x\in \Gamma}{I(x)}}$$ The additional assumptions are actually needed to ensure the existence of a dominating point which implies a much stronger result than just the inequality. It is not obvious to me whether the additional assumptions are needed if we're just interested in this inequality? Actually, let me ask a more general question: are there examples of convex (measurable) $\Gamma$ such that: $$ \forall n \quad \mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}{X_k} \in \Gamma\right) \leq e^{-n \inf_{x\in \Gamma}{I(x)}}$$ doesn't hold? Thank you for your insights.
