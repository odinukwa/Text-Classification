To answer my own question: no, not that I can find. Here is an attempt to identify them by image search. Let me know if there is an image/legend match that seems wrong. I can upload a higher resolution (466x426 px) version of the image. The images were cropped from the original image when it was oriented so the the 'HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE' message read from the bottom to top of image, and I will try to identify them in the same order. As such, we do 1 column at a time from top to bottom, starting from the right most. The column is marked in red above/below. But first, here is the captioned video created from combining the captions with a video slideshow of the images! Column 1 

This is a tricky question, not immediate. If we talk about Main Sequence stars, yes, you can constrain your fictional star by two parameters. The crucial parameters in the diagram, as you said, are the mass and the radius. This is why the HR diagram well represents the stellar population with two axis. Of course, for your scope, we need to do some assumptions. For example, the metallicity, that for your purposes can be fixed as the Solar one. Or, that the initial mass is already in a condition to contract. You can see it this way: the luminosity is connected with the radius (because it depends on the irradiating surface), while the temperature is connected with the mass (the more is the mass, the more is the pressure at the center of the star). If you have $L \sim RT$ and $L \sim M$, then you also have $RT \sim M$. The degeneracy from one parameter can be overcame if you have your reference star (the Sun), which allows you to trace isoradii lines on the HR diagram. See here for example: 

This is a very well posed question, thanks! The problem is, we still don't know. What we suppose, is that dark matter came first. Primordial fluctuations of dark matter made the right conditions to accrete enough mass to build SMBHs, and then the surrounding galaxy. But still we don't know if, the SMBH comes from merging, of other SMBHs or galaxies, or from high massive BH that are called seed (of the order of $100\,M_{Sun}$). Perhaps, there are very recent developments, which could be known by the experts, but until few years ago, this was the scenario. About the mass issue, we could have a better reasoning if we think to the influence spheres. We discovered a relation between the SMBH mass and many bulge properties (i.e., the luminosity, the velocity dispersion, and others). This means that an object of the order of $\sim1$ pc, influences an object of the order of $\sim1$ kpc (maybe $\sim3$). Plus, the bulge structure is essential to the formation and characterization and classification of the host galaxy.

The key for stellar classification is the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (or HRD for brevity), also know as the color-magnitude diagram. 

It is clear that the star undergoes a change in position. Then usually, the radial measurements go along with astrometrical measurements, to identify the position of the star along the planet's orbit. Of course, you need some conditions are verified to allow this measurement. First of all, you planet must be massive enough to bring a sensible change in the position of the star. Then your instrument must be sensible enough to resolve the tiny effect originated by this change. Possibly, also other conditions play a role, but I am not an expert (you can take a look at here).

As far as I know, this is an only theoretical object, it has never been observed. In the original paper from the authors, they provide some observable characteristics of these objects, like some peculiar emission lines. You can imagine the chemistry of such an object would be really unique. Here an article for a possible identification link 1, very recent work (2014). And here some calculations link2.

In a homogeneous and isotropic Universe (even if recent observations challenge this hypothesis), you can derive the Friedmann equations, which describe the evolution of the Hubble constant with time: $\frac{\dot{a}}{a} = H(t) = \frac{8 \pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{k}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{3}$ (with $c=1$) (Equation $1$) where $a=a(t)$ is the scale factor, $\dot{a}$ its derivative, $G$ the gravitational constant, $\rho$ the matter density, $\frac{k}{a^2}$ the spatial curvature (a parameter that describes the metric of the Universe), and $\Lambda$ the cosmological constant (an integration constant added by Einstein). It could be useful to rewrite the equation as: $H^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3}(\rho + \rho_{\Lambda}) - \frac{k}{a^2}$ where $\rho_{\Lambda} = \frac{\Lambda}{8 \pi G}$ is the "density of cosmological constant". We can also expand the matter density as $\rho = \rho_{matter} + \rho_{radiation}$. So we have a "total" density $\rho_{tot} = \rho_{matter} + \rho_{radiation} + \rho_{\Lambda}$. The destiny of the Universe depends on this amount. In case of $\rho_{tot} > \rho_{crit}$, or equivalently a closed Universe ($k=+1$), the equation $(1)$ becomes: $\dot a^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3}\rho a^2 -1$ Which points out that the scale factor must have an upper limit $a_{max}$ ($\dot a^2$ must be positive). This in turn means that the second derivative $\ddot a$ of the scale factor must be negative, when approaching $a_{max}$, that is the scale factor function inverts its behavior:

I have a 6000px x 4800 px version of this image (reduced & rotated to 480x600 here) that I use for an image slide show. I would like to add the description of each image into the slide show software. On this system the file name is but I suspect I coined that title (it was a long time ago it was downloaded). The original image is 5,150,779 bytes in size. Searching on the smaller, rotated version of the image points to pages like Astronomy Printshop, but there is nothing closely related to NASA in the first pages of the search, and the pages listed did not have much detail (certainly no legend). It might possible to search on the clipped, individual images, but I was hoping to avoid having to do that 88 times. 

I am not expert of GRBs, but this high-oscillation behavior seems a characteristics of GRBs: you can see few examples here. In fact, the BAT time resolution is very high ($\sim100\mu s$), then you can resolve very tiny details of the source's timing event. About the source variability, this is something more theoretical (so I can not be of much help), and there is no accepted theory, but qualitatively, in some models the gamma rays are produced by clumpy clouds of relativistically ejected material, which could account for the high variability indeed.

You have plenty of choices! I am specialized in X-ray astronomy, then I can suggest you many facilities: they usually give at least some of their data publicly available. Tipically, you have data for light curves (photon count rates versus time), and/or spectra (that is flux versus energy). I suggest you to work on the light curves: they are easily available, already reduced (you don't have to play with the data to make them usable, you can directly use them), and they fit your request of conforming to a regression model. Also spectra are enjoying, still I know some theoreticians who are not familiar with spectra, plus they usually need some more knowledge, because of response files, spectral fitting packages, etc. It is up to you (and your available time)! Here a list of some facilities with available data: Rossi X-ray Time Explorer Swift/BAT INTEGRAL Chandra MAXI Also here you can find a list of many facilities with NASA participation, so the list is much larger. Of course you can also use other kind of data (optical, infrared, radio) by the MAST project, but I have no experience on those. I guess, in the optical band, the Hubble Space Telescope will have a huge amount of data! If you need a hand, beyond the SE vote up/vote down neurotic fashion, let me know. Good luck!

Not really. Quasars do indeed need a SMBH to be powered, and this is a necessary condition. But, Quasar phase only lasts for tens millions to few billions years. This means that, in a more recent universe, Quasars are turned off but the host galaxy... is still there. And the SMBH also do. This is exactly as our Galaxy case ($Sgr A^*$), where the evidences for the presence of a SMBH are among the strongest ones, but still no nuclear activity is present. However, there are tons of study to infer the proper amount of AGNs in the whole Universe by using luminosity functions. 

Or, that is equivalent, you can express your first equation (Stefan-Boltzmann), in Solar units as well (as shown here). Try it out just by your self: choose a mass, or observationally speaking, choose a luminosity. Then trace your line on the HR diagram, and find your star. That star has a defined temperature (spectral class), Mass and Radius as well. If you need the exact equations, feel free to ask please. Nice aim, anyway. Have fun!
