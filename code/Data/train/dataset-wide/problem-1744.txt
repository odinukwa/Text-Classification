Antimatter is present on Earth and is being naturally created all the time (by Beta decay) as well as being created as product of cosmic ray collisions and in particle accelerators. However the universe appears to be principally made of matter and so the antimatter thus created is annihilated: and although the production of antimatter through nuclear decay is essentially continuous, it is not of a high volume so the energy created in this way is not significant in the normal course of events. The real question is why is matter so much more abundant than antimatter: which is an open question though various theories have been proposed about why we might live in such a universe. 

It's not possible to see photons from "beyond" the cosmic microwave background (CMB), because (assuming our cosmology is generally correct) the CMB is the result of recombination of electrons with protons in the early universe. Photons from before that era were absorbed in the plasma. Essentially then, the earliest matter we can see (in photonic terms) is this glowing hot hydrogen, but massively red-shifted so it looks like hydrogen at 3K. We see the CMB in every direction. 

The CMB is the oldest thing we can observe directly The cosmological red shift tells us how "old" something we are observing is 

Stars are, to all intents, infinitely far away and hence present themselves as points - thus the small changes in the atmosphere's refractive index caused by different patches of density and temperature of air make them appear to twinkle. Planets, on the other hand, are relatively close by and (with the exception of the Moon and the Sun itself) whilst we cannot resolve any solar system body into a disk with the naked eye, they are still larger than (most) variations in the atmosphere, hence they don't appear to twinkle or the twinkling is much reduced. The evidence suggests you saw a planet, quite likely Jupiter or Saturn. 

Would an object with mass traveling the speed of light destroy the whole universe because it would have infinite energy / mass? According to $URL$ and other sources, it takes infinite energy to go the speed of light, which should be impossible. However, for the sake of the question, let's assume it were somehow achieved: (e.g. potentially as described here: $URL$ My premise behind it possibly destroying the whole universe is that an object with infinite energy should also have infinite mass (E=mc^2, and infinity / c^2 is still infinity). Infinite mass should have infinite gravity, which may well destroy the entire universe (although, would this destruction travel at the speed of light, so it would "slowly" destroy the universe vs. instantly?). One thought is that it could just form a black hole instead, but as I understand it, a black hole is an infinitely small (singularity) of infinite density, with a "net mass" equal to the net mass that it has ingested. 

I personally found Stephen Hawking's "A Breif History of Time" to be very interesting and informative. It is a little bit advanced, but is put forward in plain English. Here is a link to it on Amazon, and you can "look inside" to see part of the book and see what you think. $URL$ After reading your comments / clarifications, you might like "A Field Guide to Stars and Planets." It appears to be a good introduction into astronomy. $URL$ As far as covering astronomy from a more mathematical perspective, you might like "A Student's Guide to the Mathematics of Astronomy." $URL$ You can take a look inside each of these books to see what you think. 

Is dark matter trapped near / in black holes, like regular matter is, or does something different happen with dark matter? 

Yesterday night I have tried find comet 45P, that should be still easily visible with my equipment at hand, however I was unable to find it. I used data provided by this website. Today I've checked the website's data against the Minor Planets Center's data loaded into Stellarium (the program) and found the predicted positions of the comet to differ by more than 7Â°. That is totally unacceptable when trying to find the comet with a FOV of a few tens of arcminutes (the finder presumably is too light-weak). So does anybody know a definite, reliable source for the position data of 45P? I'm gonna try again today anyway with the positions provided by Stellarium, but it might be good to have another alternative. 

That's it for now. I think with this description it is clear that the whole problem is not chicken-and-egg, but if you think otherwise then please comment. 

I want to expand on Rob Jeffries answer: As pointed out in the comments you need to observe a planet over time as it continues in its orbit. The reason why you cannot take a simple image to estimate $a$, is that although you observe the planet somewhere in its orbit, this orbit could be elliptical, and thus the distance where you see it would tell you nothing. However observations over time are already possible and have been done, as in the example of the four-planet HR8799 system. Here I just wanna leave that result from Pueyo et al. 2015 (fig. 9) with their best-fit orbits: 

Fig. 1: CMB temperature fluctuations as seen by WMAP. Those variations can be translated into density fluctuations, given a physical model. To our current understanding the form the seeds of galaxy growth. 

Here's the how: very energetic charged particles interact with the Earth's magnetic field, and when they do so they emit electromagnetic radiation. If the energy of this radiation was high enough then when it reached wires/conductors at the Earth's surface the opposite effect would take place: ie the EM radiation would result in the flow of charged particles (a current). Such currents, if strong enough, could damage very many electronic and electric devices. As to the possibility: it seems unlikely that such a high energy event would take place (ie to destroy all/nearly all electronic equipment), but it could be possible. We don't have sufficient data. 

There are lots of reasons. First of all because we can see that a typical galaxy is a spiral galaxy and we seem to live somewhere pretty typical. Secondly because we can see the arms of the spiral through close examination of the Milky Way (ie the band in the sky) - through stellar distances and measurements of hydrogen cloud red shifts and so on. But you your question is a perfectly good one because, ultimately, we are guessing a bit as we cannot see the galaxy from anywhere other than one vantage point. 

No part of the universe, at least on a large scale, is believed to be accelerating away from a central point. And, in any case, the movement of stars in galaxies is dominated by the effect of galactic gravitation rather than the expansion of spacetime. The universe as a whole is believed to be expanding (the observational evidence for this is generally not questioned these days), but this is also believed to be happening everywhere at once. The big bang - the moment at which this expansion started also occurred everywhere at once and so there is no central point of the expansion. My favourite analogy - which I have used on this site a few times now - is of the surface of a balloon as it is blown up - all the points on the surface move away from each other but there is no central point on the surface. 

There's another good and relatively short book (so it's maybe fit as introductory reading) from R. Kippenhahn - Stellar Structure and Evolution. 

So I was looking at the pp-chain reactions that take place inside stars in a bit more detail. I got confused about the massive differences in reaction efficiencies concerning two reactions $^{3}_{2}He$. In the lecture notes I've googled (the ones that I've understood best so far), the reaction $$^{3}_{2}He + ^{3}_{2}He \rightarrow p + p + ^{4}_{2}He$$ has an efficiency factor $S_1 \approx 6MeV-barn$ and being quoted as 'strong reaction'. While the other reaction I'm confused about in contrast is $$^{3}_{2}He + ^{4}_{2}He \rightarrow ^{7}_{4}Be + \gamma$$ with a way lower reaction probability of $S_2 \approx 4\cdot 10^{-4} Mev-barn$ and being quoted as 'electromagnetic interaction'. So my question: How can we understand the huge discrepancy between $S_1$ and $S_2$? Particularly, when is a reaction a 'strong' interaction? Isn't the strong force necessarily always involved, else there wouldn't be a potential minimum in the nucleus to tunnel to... Note: The S-Factor is just a part of the velocity dependent reaction cross-section $\sigma(v)$ so that $\sigma(E) = \frac{exp(-\tau)}{E} S(E)$. Here $\tau$ is the tunneling probability from Quantum theory. I would also appreciate any good textbook reference, as so far I'm working with google and random lecture notes I'm finding. Edit: Thoughts on this: In both cases particles must tunnel towards each other first. Also we know that $^{4}_{2}He$ is a bound state for the nuclear force. So what might be happening is that in $^{3}_{2}He + ^{3}_{2}He$ the nuclei rearrange themselves into the energetically favoured bound state, kicking out the surplus protons. In the case of $^{3}_{2}He + ^{4}_{2}He$ the bound state already exists, and thus in most cases the reaction will be reversed. Only a few of those reactions (why?) allow the spontaneous formation of a higher-shell object like $ ^{7}_{4}Be$, thus the much lower reaction rate. If this story so far makes sense, then I still don't understand when and why $^{7}_{4}Be$ is formed, I'd be grateful for explanation. 

If we were to make telescopes with Fresnel lenses instead of regular lenses, would it be more practical? Would this also allow for much bigger telescopes to be made? Here is an example of the type of lens I am talking about from $URL$ 

I inputed James K's value into my game for the lighting for my earth lit moon level, and here is what it looks like: 

Second part of my theory: I also believe antimatter somehow constantly ejects space back into the universe. I believe when matter and antimatter form, they are somehow "linked" so that space absorbed by matter is ejected by the corresponding antimatter particle. This would give antimatter a "negative" gravity effect. I believe there is equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the universe, and the antimatter is in a diffuse cloud spread throughout the universe, where matter is not present. I believe this accounts for dark energy - the accelerating expansion of the universe. 

Main question: Could dark energy (the mysterious accelerating expansion of the universe) be explained by "negative gravity"? "Spin off" questions: 

I would expect that the further away a supernova is, the "longer" we observe it will be active because of an increased red shift. Objects in the universe that are further away are generally going away from us faster than objects that are close, hence the increased red shift. This increase in time due to redshift is very similar to the Doppler effect, where a siren is high pitched (and faster) when approaching you (e.g. blue shift with light), and low pitched (and slower) when going away from you (e.g. red shift with light). The faster the siren is moving away, the more the effect (both lower pitch and longer time) will be increased, likewise with light. Here are some sources that may help with what you are looking for (although I haven't been able to find a list exactly like you are looking for): $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

Now we can choose variables other than temperature to characterize the atmosphere. Like ionization state, mixture state, dynamical movements, chemical makeup and then define layers that make sense only when talking about this particular variable. Summarizing: Layers can be defined, even physically meaningful, but only in the context of a particular variable. 

As OP still didn't react to the posted answers, I'll try my shot at this. First of all, I'm not sure what you mean by hyperbolic. A simple Hyperbola $f(x,y) \in R^2$ can be defined by a relation $$x^2 - y^2 = a^2$$ with some constant $a^2$. One can plot this. Now the simple Minkowski spacetime metrics from special relativity states that there is a quantity $ds^2$ which stays invariant if an object is observed from different points in spacetime. This invariant quantity can be locally computed from $$ ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2$$ which is a hyperbolic relation and also results from general relativity (the more general variant of special relativity) if one imposes a flat universe. Now Planck-observations show our universe to be approximately flat, expect for the ripples here and there. By ripples I mean sources of gravity, near which the relation between $dt$ and $dx$ becomes more complicated, and in particular non-hyperbolic. So if you want to make any statement about 'spacetime', you can only do that about the 'spacetime of our current idea of the universe on a global scale'. 

The answer is chemistry in this case. In terms of Hydrogen and Helium the atmospheres of the gas giants have atmospheres that most likely didn't change much since the formation of the solar system. In heavier elements however the gas giants are enriched (compared to the sun's atmosphere, which we think is the most original gas still around). Such a mixture of elements, given at the pressures and temperatures in Saturn's atmosphere (as well as in Jupiter's) will form large amounts of Ammonia naturally by equilibrium chemistry. If then the amount of Ammonia reaches vapour saturation, clouds will form as a result.
