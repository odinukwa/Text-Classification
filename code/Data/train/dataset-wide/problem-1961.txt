A classic non-crystalline example would be volcanic glasses such as obsidian, which fracture to produce extremely sharp edges and were historically used by some cultures for making blades and other sharp tools. 

Both of them. The composition of the atmosphere, crust, mantle, core and bulk earth are all notably different. The atmosphere is composed of ~78% nitrogen and ~21% oxygen, with small amounts of other gases. 

Radiation here has nothing to do with radioactivity. In this context it is refers to a diversification of marine mammals. It is a common term used in evolutionary biology. 

My guess is that since ice (and the liquid water underneath it) is much better at absorbing thermal radiation than air, then even if the air temperature is below zero, the ice can heat up in the sun and melt a little bit. It will presumably then refreeze at night when there is no sun to keep it warm. This was probably also happening on the surface of the snow as well before you cleared it but you didn't notice it because there was no colour change. 

This report on the stratigraphy is probably a good place to start. Additonally, searching Google Scholar for Wasatch Range geochronology brings up a number of papers on the geochronology of specific formations if you are interested in that. 

Is the mantle solid? It's all a matter of timescales. The mantle is undoubtedly solid (except locally in the uppermost regions where melting can occur) but on a long enough timescale it can display plastic behaviour under high temperatures and pressures, with a viscosity on the order of $\text{~}\mathrm{10^{21}~Pa~s}$ (based on estimates from isostatic rebound after melting of ice sheets). Think of plasticine - it is obviously solid but it deforms easily under stress. This is how the mantle behaves on long timescales at high temperatures and pressures. On short timescales the mantle is a brittle solid and this is what allows it to transmit seismic S-waves. Why does the crust 'float' on top of the mantle? The answer to this is quite simple - the crust is less dense than the mantle and so on the long timescales, where the mantle is ductile, the crust does not sink into the mantle (except at subduction zones but that's another story). Granitic continental crust has an average density of around $\mathrm{2.6~g~cm^{-3}}$, basaltic oceanic crust is around $\mathrm{3~g~cm^{-3}}$, and the upper mantle is around $\mathrm{3.5~g~cm^{-3}}$. How does convection work in the mantle? The details of mantle convection are a subject of active research but all geologists agree that the mantle does convect vigorously and that this is the major form of heat transport from the core to the crust. If you calculate the Rayleigh number for the mantle you come out with $R_a~\text{~}~10^6$ which indicates that convection should be vigorous. On the other hand, the thermal diffusivity of the mantle is very low ($\text{~} \mathrm{10^{-6}~m^2~s^{-1}}$) and so conduction is not the dominant form of heat transport. 

This is the centroid moment tensor published by the USGS as of 01/10/18 (it will likely be updated in the future). As you can see this was an almost pure strike-slip mechanism on a near vertical plane. Tsunamis are generated when the ocean floor is displaced upwards by an earthquake, displacing the water above it in the same pattern. This displaced water then spread out laterally to form the tsunami. Thrust faults tend to produce large seafloor uplifts and so most (maybe all?) tsunamis are associated with thrust faulting earthquakes. There was no tsunami in this case because a strike slip fault like this does not produce a significant uplift of the seafloor. Instead the seafloor slides past each other. With regard to the second part of the question; yes there have been tsunamis in the Caribbean before. This website provides a good list of known ones. 

(image source) Earthquakes occur on the subduction interface when the two plates are locked together (referred to as strong coupling) and cannot move past each other, leading to accumulation of strain which is eventually released in an earthquake. The amount of coupling on the subduction interface can vary strongly along its length. Chlieh et al., 2008 says this about the Sumatran megathrust: 

It looks like your coordinates are written in decimal degrees but with the decimal points omitted. 34.144442 -118.654084 corresponds to 34°08'40.0"N 118°39'14.7"W. Google maps shows this to be a location just outside LA. 

The premise of your question is entirely wrong. There are many examples of sharp corners in nature, the most obvious being well formed crystals. Pyrite is a classic example that was mentioned by @wienein in the comments. In a ideal situation it forms cubic crystals with sharp edges. 

As I understand it, the metamorphic field gradient is the PT line traced out by the maximum temperature points of a series of PTt paths of rocks from the same metamorphic event. What exactly is this useful for? It seems that it doesn't really describe anything of physical significance since the $\mathrm{T_{max}}$ points can occur at different times so it doesn't represent a snapshot of the geothermal gradient at any fixed time. 

Since it seems like the OP isn't going to reply to my requests for information I'll take a stab at this based on what I can see. The white rock has a pitted and slightly dusty appearance that looks very much like chalk to me. The BGS description for the Ulster White Limestone which lies nearby shows that it contains chalk: 

There's no need to invoke stretching here. This is just a simple case of dipping sedimentary beds which have been eroded by the sea. The stepped geometry may be caused by small variations in the hardness of the beds such that the harder beds weather out more prominently and create the steps. Alternatively, at least some of the larger steps may be wave cut terraces formed during periods of stable sea level. In the background on the left of the picture you can see two large terraces separated by a ramp which look very much like wave cut terraces. Such terraces are well known from central Greece, where they have been uplifted by activity on faults and I would speculate that a similar process has occurred here. 

Trench has a specific meaning in plate tectonics. It doesn't just refer to any valley; it specifically refers to the features formed at subduction zones by the flexure of the downgoing oceanic plate. A classic example is the Marianas Trench which is the location of the deepest point in the ocean 

All you need is two valleys draining in opposite directions, which is not really a particularly interesting or uncommon occurrence. Note the grid squares are 1 km x 1 km so these are pretty close. Here's a bigger example I found from southern Greece. The two valleys are about 4 km apart in this example. The basic topographic setup is exactly the same as the previous example. 

Some subduction interfaces are thought to be almost entirely decoupled and do not generate megathrust earthquakes but large earthquakes can still occur on splay faults in the accretionary prism (Shaw et al., 2008). With regards to the second part of the question, earthquakes are seismic waves generated by rupturing of rocks in response to accumulated stress. Every earthquake creates a rupture patch with a certain area. The 2004 Sumatra earthquake had a rupture patch that was over 1300 km long which is enormous, hence why it had a such a large magnitude. The rupture started at the southern end of the fault and propagated northwards at 2-3 km/s, taking around 9 minutes to fully rupture. The epicentre is the location of the initial rupture. The seismic moment of an earthquake ($\mathrm{M_0}$ is related to the area of the rupture patch ($\mathrm{A}$), the average displacement on the fault ($\mathrm{D}$) and the friction coefficient on the fault plane ($\mu$) by: $$\mathrm{M_0 = \mu A D}$$ 

As for the orange crystal embedded within the chalk, it looks like it is a nodule that has grown in the chalk because it has rounded edges and seems to radiate out from a central point. I'm not really an expert on this type of thing but my best speculation is halite (which is very easy to test just by licking it!). Someone will probably come along and correct me though. This paper suggests that diagenesis involved marine fluids so I guess halite is an option, though it doesn't mention it there.

Fast spreading ridges do indeed have valleys at their centre but these are not usually referred to as trenches to avoid confusion. In slow spreading ridges the valley is often filled up with erupted lavas. However, the valley sits on top of a much larger ridge, which is the surface expression of hot mantle upwelling below the spreading axis. 

A formation is a unit of stratigraphy. It refers to a set of sedimentary layers which are somehow distinct from those above and below them in the stratigraphic sequence. This may be because they have a different lithology, different sedimentary structures, or different fossil assemblages, or something else entirely. A sedimentary facies is a set of rocks which where deposited in the same sedimentary environment. Typically deposition in this environment will leave behind distinctive signatures in the rock which can help to identify the environment of deposition. Within a formation the facies can change both vertically and laterally. Equally, the facies may not change at all over several formations. 

This is a good observation. The reason we can measure S-wave (transverse) propagation in the inner core is because P-waves can set up S-waves and vice versa. When an S-wave hits the mantle-outer core boundary at an angle it has a vibration component which is normal to the boundary and this sets up a P-wave in the liquid inner core. The opposite happens at the outer core-inner core boundary, where the P-wave at the boundary sets up an S-wave in the solid inner core. In this way, we can measure S-wave transmission through the inner core. 

I think you are confused about the timescales and the magnitude of the impact that is being talked about here. The collision between the early Earth and a roughly Mars sized body, Theia is thought to have happened between 4.4 and 4.45 billion years ago. The Pangaea supercontinent had fully assembled by around 250 million years ago. Previous to this there are a number of other supercontinents which have been recognised, the oldest speculative ones dating back to around 3 billion years ago. The Earth's crust is constantly being reshaped by plate tectonics and so the location of an impact at 4.4 billion years ago has no bearing whatsoever on the orientation of the Pangaea (or any other) supercontinent. In addition, based on computer simulations of the impact, we know that the impactor mass must have been on the order of 0.1 Earth masses and the initial impactor velocity must have been something like 5 km/s. This means that a colossal quantity of energy would have been released by the impact which would completely reshape any surface structure (and much of the internal structure) that the Earth may have had at that early stage. Indeed, a significant quantity of the mass of the two impactors was put into orbit around the Earth by the impact, either as solid debris, some of which coalesced to form the Moon, or as vaporised rock. Due to the complete lack of direct evidence, it is difficult to determine the exact impact parameters, including the impact angle. Some simulations suggest a fairly moderate angle of impact of around 45° [1], but there is some geochemical evidence from the Moon to suggest a higher angle of impact, with higher energies involved [2][3].

It is different to density but they are closely related. This is easily seen by considering the dimensions of the two quantities (side note: always consider the dimensions of quantities - it is invariably useful). If you read your definition carefully you will realise that specific gravity is defined as the ratio of the density of the material to that of water. $$\mathrm{SG = \frac{\rho_{sample}}{\rho_{water}}}$$ Historically I suspect that specific gravity was used rather than density because it is easy to measure by measuring the mass of the displaced water when you place the sample into a jar of water, and the mass of the sample itself. You don't actually need to know the density of water in order to calculate the specific gravity. 

When you take a seismic reflection profile you take multiple shots and then stack them together around a common midpoint. Due to the extra distance travelled by the wide angle shots there is a moveout on time profile which you have to account for. Apparently, in order to apply the moveout correction you have to know (or guess) the velocity structure of the layers. I am confused as to why this is. Surely you know the extra distance travelled from the geometry of the shot you know the extra time because it is recorded in the arrivals so you should calculate the average layer velocity after lining up all the arrivals at the same time, not the other way around. If someone can provide a detailed explanation of how common midpoint stacking and the moveout correction works that would be very helpful. 

The elevation of oceanic crust is controlled by Pratt isostasy, whereby hotter crust is elevated because it is less dense. Oceanic crust is produced at mid-ocean ridges and cools as it moves away from the ridge. Mid-ocean ridges are hot and therefore they are elevated above the colder, more dense adjacent crust. In continental rifts, the dominant process controlling the topography is normal faulting, which leads to subsidence of the rift valley floor and uplift of the sides, leading to the formation of mountains either side of the active rift. Continental rifts form valleys because they have not yet reached isostatic equilbrium and their topography is controlled by extensional faulting. 

After about a minute of searching in what I thought was a likely place, here is an example from northern England. 

The propagation of seismic waves is described by the wave equation: $$\mathrm{\nabla \cdot \sigma = \frac{\partial ^2 u}{\partial t^2}}$$ Where $\sigma$ is the stress and $u$ is the displacement. Geometric ray theory is an approximation to the full wave equation where the length scale of variation in seismic wavespeed is much larger than the seismic wavelength (i.e. a high frequency approximation). Typical seismic wavelengths are anything from $\mathrm{\text{~}50-5000~m}$ depending on the application so the ray approximation is generally valid, unless you are trying to resolve very high resolution structure. It is used widely because it is computationally much less expensive than solving the full wave equation. This book has a very detailed explanation of many aspects of seismic inversion if you need more detail.
