Let $A \otimes B$ be the algebraic tensor of two $C^{\ast}$ -algebras, and an element x in $A\otimes B$ is positive if $x=yy^{\ast}$. Then is it always possible to write x in the form $x=\sum a_i\otimes b_i$, where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive elements? 

Let G be a finite subgroup of U(n), the unitary group acts on $\mathbb{C}^n$. If there is a unit vector $x$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ such that g(x) is almost orthogonal to x, for all $g\in G$ except the identity, can we perturb x so that g(x) is exactly orthogonal to x, for all $g\in G$ except the identity? More precisely, can we find a very small number $\epsilon>0$, so that if there exist a unit vector $x$ and the inner product $|(g(x),x))|<\epsilon$ for all $g\in G$ \ {1}, then we can find another unit vector $y$, such that $(g(y),y)=0$ for all $g\in G$ \ {1}? Is it possible to further require that $||x-y||$ be small too? 

This question arises from a discussion with my friends on a commonly encountered IQ test questions: "What's the next number in this series 2,6,12,20,...". Here a "number" usually means an integer. I was wondering whether there is a systematical way to solve such problems.Let us call a point on a plane integer point if all the components of it are integers. I want to know the following: Give a finite set of integer points, Can we always find a corresponding polynomial that passes all these points and maps integers to integers? 

This is actually something in a paper but the author claimed it without proof. Let x be a positive elment of norm 1 in a $C^*-$algebra A, and Her(x) is the hereditary subalegbra generated by x. Given $\epsilon>0$,let $f_\epsilon$ be thecontinuous function on R defined as follow: $f_\epsilon \equiv 0 \quad on \quad [-\infty,\epsilon/2]$ $f_\epsilon \quad is \quad linear \quad on\quad [\epsilon/2,\epsilon]$ $f_\epsilon \equiv 1 \quad on\quad [\epsilon, +\infty]$ So $f_\epsilon$ increase to the identiy function on [0,1] when $\epsilon$ decrease to 0, and $Her(x)=\overline{\cup_{\epsilon>0} f_\epsilon(x)Af_\epsilon(x)}$. Let p be a projection in Her(x). then how do we know that there must exist a $\epsilon$ such that $p\in \overline{f_\epsilon(x)Af_\epsilon(x)}$? Or more generally, Let A be the inductive limit of {$A_n$}, and p is a projection in A,does it follow that p is actually in some $A_n$? 

Assume that $f:[0,2\pi]\to [0,2\pi]$ is a continuous function such that $f(0)=f(2\pi)$ and define the function $$g(s)=\int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{\sin f(t+s)-\sin f(s)}{\sin t/2} dt.$$ Is $g$ continuous or bounded? Probably not. It is related to Marcel Riesz's famous theorem. 

Is there a L-Lipschitz homeomorphism of the Elipse $x^2/4+y^2=1$ onto the unit circle $x^2+y^2=1$ such that $L<1$? 

Assume that $f$ is harmonic in the unit disk $|z|<1$, with boundary function of bounded variation, such that $$\lim_{r\to 1}f(re^{it})= 0$$ for $t\in[0,\pi]\setminus \mathbf{Q}$, where $\mathbf{Q}$ are rational numbers. Can we then state the following $$\lim_{r\to 1}f(re^{it})= 0,\ \ \ t\in[0,\pi]. $$ 

Is the following statement true. Assume that $f:[0,1]\to [0,1]$ is a continuous function such that $$\sup_t\lim\sup_{s\to t}\frac{|f(s)-f(t)|}{|t-s|}<\infty,$$ then $f$ is Lipchitz continuous. 

Assume that $M\subset R^n$, $n\ge 3$, is a boundary of an open bounded set $D$ containing $0$, which is starlike w.r.t. 0, meaning that each ray $[0,x]$ from $x\in M$ to $0$ meets $M$ only once. Is $M$ smooth almost everywhere? 

Assume that $(X,\tau)$ is a topological space and assume that every continuous mapping $f$ of $X$ into real line $\mathbb{R}$ achieves its maximum. Under which conditions on $\tau$, the space $X$ is compact. It can be easily prove that, $X$ is compact, provided that $\tau$ is a metric topology in $X$. Is for example this true for the Hausdorff spaces? 

This is well-known result by Kellogg (O. Kellogg: On the derivatives of harmonic functions on the boundary, Trans. Amer.Math. Soc. 33 (1931), 689-692.), and Warschawski (On the higher derivatives at the boundary in conformal mapping,} Trans. Amer. Math. Soc, {\bf 38}, No. 2 (1935), 310-340.), where they prove even more, that the if the boundary is C^{n,\alpha}, then the conformal parametrization is C^{n,\alpha} up to the boundary. 

a) How to solve, or at least to prove the existence of a solution to differential equation for given initial condition $y(s)=y_0>0$ and $y'(s)=y_1$, $s<0$, $$y''+(2-n)\coth(t) y'=\frac{(n-1)\sinh(2y)}{2}, t<0.$$ Here $n$ is an integer $>2$. b) Can the previous equation have two different solution (with different initial conditions) in $(-2,-1)$, such that one is bounded and the second is not bounded? 

If $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, then $L^1(\Omega)$ is not the dual of any normed space since the closed unit ball of $L^1(\Omega)$ is convex with no extreme points. I'm sure you're familiar with the usual argument, but for interested readers who aren't: If $L^1(\Omega)$ were the dual of a normed space, then Alagolu's Theorem shows that the closed unit ball of $L^1(\Omega)$ is wk*-compact. But then by Krein-Milman, since the closed unit ball of $L^1(\Omega)$ is convex and (wk*-)compact, it admits an extreme point. But, since the closed unit ball of $L^1(\Omega)$ doesn't admit any extreme points, it must be the case that $L^1(\Omega)$ is not the dual of some normed space. It follows similarly that $C_0(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the family of continuous real-valued functions that vanish at infinity, is not the dual of any normed space. The closed unit ball of $C_0(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is convex with no extreme points. The proof of this is pretty slick (just add on small bumps when $f$ is small enough). 

Greetings. Suppose that $H$ is a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and that $M$ is an infinite dimensional closed subspace of $H$. Suppose that {$v_{n}: n\ge 1$} is an infinite linearly independent subset of $M$ that is bounded and bounded away from zero (in the case I'm considering, the collection {$v_{n}: n\ge 1$} is somewhere dense in M, so the set of norms is dense "between" its infimum and supremum). In general, I'm trying to determine if there necessarily exists an bounded linear operator $S$ on $M$ and some element $x\in M$ with {$S^{n}x: n\ge 1$} $= $ {$v_{n}: n\ge 1$} (or {$S^{n}x: n\ge 1$} $\subseteq $ {$v_{n}: n\ge 1$} and {$S^{n}x: n\ge 1$} is somewhere dense). I'm familiar with the results of S. Grivaux, who shows that every countable dense linearly independent subset of a separable Banach space is the orbit of a bounded linear operator. But I don't want to assume that {$v_{n}: n\ge 1$} is dense (also, extending it to a dense linearly independent set doesn't help because we get the wrong inclusion). What I attempted in this. Extend {$v_{n}: n\ge 1$} to a basis for $M$, call it $B$. Define a map $S$ on the basis $S(z)=\bigg\{\begin{array}{cl} v_{n+1}&\text{if } z=v_{n}\text{ for some }n\in \mathbb{N}\\\ 0&\text{otherwise.}\end{array}$ and extend it by linearity to a linear operator on $M$, which we'll still call $S$. It would follow then that $\{S^nv_{1}: n\ge 1\}=\{v_{n}: n\ge 1\}$ But I'm unsure if this operator derived from the extension is a bounded operator. Intuitively, I believe that this operator is bounded, since {$v_{n}: n\ge 1$} is bounded and bounded away from zero. However, the proof is eluding me. EDIT: There are some hypothesis/background I find irrelevant, and they're omitted. So if anyone would like any more information, please let me know.
