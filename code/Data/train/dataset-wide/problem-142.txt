Have you ever heard of the Einstein-de Haas effect? Take a large piece of iron, cylindrically shaped. Now, put it in an external magnetic field. The bar should become magnetized. Given that magnetization arises from the orientation of electron spins inside the bar, there's a change of spin angular momentum. However, spin angular momentum is just another form of angular momentum, and angular momentum must be conserved. Therefore, the bar will begin to rotate a small bit, to keep the total change in angular momentum zero. Whether you could do this on a large enough scale is something else entirely. However, using a very, very large magnetic field and the right object, under optimal conditions, perhaps you could have a shot at doing what you want. There will, of course, be problems: 

I've considered making a shared world, a world with a setting that can be used by more than one writer or worldbuilder. I have a basic story planned out, and it has certain requirements of the world's geography, natural and anthropogenic history, layout, climate, and one or two other minor things. All of these elements are necessary for the story to make sense. At the same time, I think that this world could be used by other authors for other stories, because it has some rather singular elements to it that have interesting features. I'd also like to make it open for use because I won't be able to explore all of it (for some time), and it might be cool for others to do that instead. So, how do I make a world more sharable, even though I need to set some rather restrictive guidelines for it? Another way of phrasing the question is: How can I make a world more sharable? 

Here, it is useful to treat the planet as a black body. The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that a black body will have a luminosity $L$ directly related to its temperature $T$ and radius $R$: $$L=4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4$$ where $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. We have to be careful picking $R$ and $T$, though, because the atmosphere and climate have to be considered. I would suggest using the mean radius of Earth and the mean temperature of Earth - not just the surface temperature. This shows us that luminosity is a function of temperature. Luminosity is expressed in units of watts per second, meaning that it is a energy over time: $$L=\frac{U}{t}$$ The $U$ here is the thermal energy of the Earth. Now you can write time as a function of temperature: $$t=\frac{U}{4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4}$$ and pick the temperature you want. There are other corrections you have to make, though - for example, taking the atmosphere into account, as well as the fact that the Dyson Sphere, too, will radiate. 

Spaceflight osteopenia: In microgravity, there is less stress on the bones in the body. Therefore, they become less dense. Back on Earth, the bones must support weight. However, they are too weak, and it is extremely hard for astronauts to walk again after long stays in space because of this loss. On Mars, a human would have low bone density; they wouldn't be able to stay upright without much effort on Earth. To counteract this, Wikipedia gives the following: 

Alternatively, you could (well, not in our universe) do what Hactar did in Life, the Universe and Everything, the third (but not final) book in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy trilogy: Create a junction connecting the heart of every star, turning the universe into a supernova. In this case, you could simply connect the Sun to another star, or - even better - the Earth to another star. 

I completely forgot about explaining this part. My "toroidal" space station wouldn't be a perfect torus. As I said, it would be made of segments. However, I didn't explain that the segments would be closer to cylinders than slices of a torus. Think of small cylindrical pieces connected by wedges. Each piece rotates, creating artificial gravity. The torus isn't perfect; it's an approximation. 

Image in the public domain. It's nearly impossible to look at every orbit in that image, but it's safe to say that most have high eccentricities, likely due to constant perturbations by the four inner planets, and possibly Jupiter. More specifically, given that your asteroid crosses earth's path, it's either an Aten asteroid (semi-major axis less than 1 AU) or an Apollo asteroid (semi-major axis greater than 1 AU). You can search through the JPL Small Body Database with parameters that include one or both of these groups, and pick one that seems suitable. The Minor Planet Center also has excellent data; here, for instance, are the Aten asteroids. Note that many have relatively large eccentricities. 

As Neil pointed out, there is no absolute frame of reference, so I'll pretend that the frame of reference is relative to something - in some scenarios, the Sun; in others, the Earth, and in others, the center of the Milky Way. 

In this period, you cannot have a lasting, stable state if your rulers continue to produce plenty of children - which the Carolingians seem to do, at an unfortunately large pace. We saw that Louis the Pious only kept the Empire together because his siblings died. I'd argue that any of his sons could have done the same, had the other two died. Essentially, you need to have a family tree with only one or two heirs per generation which survive. There are a couple ways you could do this: 

Many creatures - humans among them - have binocular vision, where two eyes side by side allow good depth perception. There are quite a few other advantages over one eye, including a larger field of view, as well as redundancy (an injury leading to blindness in one eye won't cripple the creature's sight entirely). I want to develop an Earth-like world where a group of humanoid creatures evolve with a sort of double binocular vision, with eyes in both the front and backs of their heads. Besides this, they would have relatively human-like cranial structure - only one nose, one mouth, one set of ears, and a fairly normal brain. The eyes in the back are perhaps slightly less developed than the front ones, but still quite functional. I'm assuming that this sort of adaptation occurs in many other creatures in this world that would otherwise have normal binocular vision. An extra set of eyes requires a more complicated system of nerves and muscles, and it seems likely that this evolved quite slowly over time. Therefore, I'd bet that more than one species has evolved with this sort of property. My question, then, is this: Under what sort of relatively Earth-like conditions would humanoids develop eyes in the backs of their heads? If you think there's no possibility for this to happen, then an answer supporting that would be, in my opinion, valid (and helpful!). 

At different points in history, commodities have been at different levels of supply, and therefore have been at different prices. One good might be valuable in the present while another is nearly worthless; a century ago, this could have been switched. Therefore, any time traveler with an eye for making a profit could realize that there's an easy way to become rich: 

You clearly can't just let berserkers run loose, because, as you noted, there would be severe violent outbreaks. You therefore have two options: Control the power or get rid of it. Option 1: Kill them I'll talk about the latter option first, because it is less savory and is not the best option. The only way to guarantee that a berserker will not go berserk is to kill him or her. The process is simple: 

Models of such planets exist, courtesy of Unterborn et al. (2014). They discuss planets of similar composition to yours - looking at the value of the mass fraction given by $(\text{Mg}+2\text{Si}+\text{Fe}+2\text{C})/\text{O}$. A model planet like yours that would orbit 94 Ceti (HD 19994) would have a composition of 38.1% oxygen, 29.9% carbon, and the rest magnesium, silicon, and iron (see Bond et al. (2010)). We can also look at a ternary plot of $\text{O}$, $\text{C}$, and the sum $\text{Mg}+2\text{Si}+\text{Fe}$ (Unterborn et al.'s Fig. 5). I've added a circle to mark approximately where your planet lies: 

The safest orbital radius is as far away from the black hole as possible. Orbiting in the rotational plane of the black hole could mean crossing paths with an accretion disk, while orbiting around the poles could hit astrophysical jets. Neither are too good for life. 

Assume that you have a sample of $N_0$ atoms of element $A$ at time $t=0$, and that no atoms enter or leave the sample during the period of study. Assume also that the atoms have a constant rate of exponential decay, i.e. $N$ behaves as $$N(t)=N_0e^{-\lambda t}$$ for some positive constant $\lambda$. Young-Earth creationists have disputed radiometric data measurements by saying that $\lambda$ can change over time. This is patently false - or, as I like to put it, a load of fetid dingo's kidneys. At some time $t'$, measure $N(t')$. Then, solve for $t'$ using the equation $$t'=-\frac{1}{\lambda}\ln\left(\frac{N(t')}{N_0}\right)$$
