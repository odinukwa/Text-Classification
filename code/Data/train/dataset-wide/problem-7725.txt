(After the original question was edited). Now this is simply $URL$ Your words are in one-to-one correspondence to those mentioned in a comment by David Scambler. To come from your words to his, you need to add $d$ after each $u$, and then to replace $k$th $u$ by $k$ consecutive $u$'s. 

The answer is $n^{3/2}(1+o(1))$. For the upper bound, observe that there are at most $n\cdot{n\choose 2}$ pairs of vertices lying in one edge. Thus, if $|V|>n^{3/2}(1+o(1))$, then there are two vertices not belonging to an edge, and we may identify them harmlessly (they will be of the same color). Repeating the procedure, we eventually get at most $n^{3/2}(1+o(1))$ vertices, so this number of colors suffices. The lower bound (from the comment above). Take a prime power $q$, take $q^2+q+1$ sets of order $q$ and one more vertex. The edges form a projective plane on the sets, and each edge contains an extra vertex. Thus there are $n=q^2+q+1$ edges of order $n$, and $q^3+q^2+q+1$ vertices, all these vertices should be of different colors. Thus the chromatic number should be at least of orde $n^{3/2}$. This works only for special $n$, surely, but the prime powers are dense enough to provide the lower bound of the form $n^{3/2}(1+o(1))$ for all values of $n$. 

It seems that the answer is yes. Denote by $M_q$ the space $M$ equipped with the $L_q$-norm; by the closednedd condition, it is a Banach space for both $q=1$ and $q=4$. The identical mapping $M_4\to M_1$ is bounded; by the bounded inverse theorem, so is its inverse. Thus there exists $\mu$ such that $\|g\|_4\leq \mu\|g\|_1$ for all $g\in M$; surely $\mu\geq 1$. We claim that $C=2+2\mu$ works. To show this, take any $f\in L_4(0,1)$ and denote $\alpha_q=\rho_q(f,M)=\inf_{h\in M}\|f-h\|_q$. Choose $g_1,g_4\in M$ such that $\|f-g_q\|_q\leq 2\alpha_q$ and set $g=(\alpha_4g_1+\alpha_1g_4)/(\alpha_1+\alpha_4)$. We claim that $g$ fits the goal. Firstly, notice that $$ \|g_1-g_4\|_1\leq \|g_1-f\|_1+\|f-g_4\|_1\leq 2\alpha_1+2\alpha_4, $$ so $\|g-g_1\|_1=\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_1+\alpha_4}\|g_4-g_1\|_1\leq 2\alpha_1$. On the other hand, since $\|g_1-g_4\|_4\leq \mu\|g_1-g_4\|_1\leq 2\mu(\alpha_1+\alpha_4)$ we have $\|g-g_4\|_4\leq 2\mu\alpha_4$. Therefore, $$ \|f-g\|_1\leq \|f-g_1\|_1+\|g_1-g\|_1\leq 4\alpha_1\leq C\alpha_1 $$ and $$ \|f-g\|_4\leq \|f-g_4\|_4+\|g_4-g\|_4\leq (2+2\mu)\alpha_4=C\alpha_4, $$ as required. 

$\def\ZZ{\mathbb Z}\def\conv{\mathop{\rm conv}}\def\vol{\mathop{\rm Vol}}$Yes, such a constant exists. We prove just the existence, not trying to optimize it. When we mention a `xonstant' we mean the quantity dependent on $d$ only. Set $D=d^2$, and let $\ZZ_D^d=(\ZZ/D\ZZ)^2$. To each point $a\in \ZZ^d$, let $a^*$ be its residue class in $\ZZ_D^d$. For every $z\in \ZZ_D^d$ and every $A\subset \ZZ^d$ set $A_z=\{a\in A\colon a^*=z\}$. Let $K'=K\cap \ZZ^d$. One of the values $|K'_b|$ is at least $|K'|/D^d$, and we may pass from $K$ to $\conv K_b$, reducing the number of integer points in it by at most $D^d$ times (which is constant). Thus from now on we assume that $K$ is a polytope whise vertices lie in $(D\ZZ)^d$ (we have also applied a shift mapping one of the vertices into $0$). Now take a simplex $S\subseteq K$ of maximal volume; its vertices $a_0,\dots,a_d$ are the vertices of $K$ and thus lie in $(D\ZZ)^d$. We may assume that $a_0=0$. Then $K$ lies in the simplex $S'$ bounded by the hyperplanes parallel to the hyperfaces of $S$ passing through their opposite vertices. The simplex $S'$ also has integer vertices, and its (linear) size is $d$ times the size of $S$. Let $Q$ be the parallelepiped spanned by the vectors $a_1/D,\dots,a_d/D$ with $0$ as the common origin of these vectors (we assume that $Q$ is not a closed set: its hyperfaces not containing $a_0$ are removed); so $Q\subseteq S$. Then $S$ contains all translations of $Q$ by the vectors $\frac1D\sum_i \alpha_ia_i$ with $\alpha_i\in\{0,1,\dots,D-d\}$, and $S$ is covered by such translations for $\alpha_i\in\{0,1,\dots,D\}$. The ratio of quantities of such tuples $(\alpha_i)$ is constant, and each such translation contains the same number $q$ (dependent on $Q$!) of integer points. Thus the number of integer points in $S$ is approximated (up to a constant factor) by $\frac{\vol S}{\vol Q}q$. Similarly, the number of integer points in $S'$ is approximated by $\frac{\vol S'}{\vol Q}q=d^d\cdot \frac{\vol S}{\vol Q}q$. Thus the number of integer points in $S$ is not smaller than a constant factor times such a number for $S'$, which is not smaller that such a number for $K$. Finally, by similar reasons the parallelepiped $P=\frac{D}dQ$ contains at least a constant portion of the integer points in $S$, and thus at least a constant portion of those in $K$. 

This is not an answer, just elaboration of what really happens. $\def\OP{\mathop{\rm OP}}$Denote by $\OP(n)$ the odd part of $n$, i.e. the maximal its odd divisor. 1. Once your process comes to an odd square $(2t+1)^2$ (which happens soon), the next few steps lead to an odd square $(\OP(t(t+1)))^2$. If neither $t$ nor $t+1$ is a power of $2$ (in particular, $t>1$), then this new square is at least $(3t)^2>(2t+1)^2$. So, if we never obtain a number of the form $(2^k\pm1)^2$, then these squares increase, and the process diverges. (One may notice that the number $(2^k\pm 1)^2$ is transformed into $(2^{k-1}\pm 1)^2$, so in this case we finally arrive at $0$.) So, our process starting from an odd square may be reformulated as iterating the function $g(1+2t)=\OP(t(t+1))$. Let us try to see when these iterations starting from an odd number not of the form $2^t\pm 1$ may come to a number of the form $2^t\pm 1$. (The process under consideration starts from $13$.) 2. Assume now that $g(M)=2^a\pm 1$. We have $g(M)=\OP(M^2-1)$, so $M^2-1=2^b(2^a\pm1)$, where $b\leq a+2$ if $M$ is large enough, say $M>7$. If $a+b$ is even, then $M^2$ is too close to another square $2^{a+b}$, which is impossible (unless $M$ itself has our form); so $a+b=2k+1$, $b\leq k+1$, $M^2=2^{2k+1}\pm 2^b+1$. Thus the only values of $M$ which lead to $2^m\pm1$ are square roots of the numbers of the form $2^{2k+1}\pm 2^b+1$, where $b\leq k+1$. Surely, $M$ is the closest odd integer to $2^k\sqrt 2$. And this is where I am stuck. There are few small cases, namely $(k,M)=(3,11), (4,23), (7,181);$ indeed, $g(11)=2^4-1$, $g(23)=2^5+1$, $g(181)=2^{12}-1$. My program claims no other examples for $k\leq 4000$... Surely, our equation may be rewritten as Pell equation $2\cdot (2^k)^2-M^2=\mp 2^b-1$, but how can one analyze it? By the Ramanujan--Nagell theorem, there are no larger solutions for $x^2+7=2^n$ (smaller ones do not count in our case). 

Now, since we know that there exists a set of Wang tiles admitting non-periodic tilings only, this shows that the maximal density arrangement can indeed be aperiodic. 

Denote $d_A(v)=|N_G(v)\cap A|$, $d_B(v)=|N_G(v)\cap B|$. Set $S_A=\{(a,b)\in A\times B\colon N_G(a)\cap N_G(b)\cap A\neq\varnothing\}$ and $S_B=\{(a,b)\in A\times B\colon N_G(a)\cap N_G(b)\cap B\neq\varnothing\}$. Clearly, $S_A,S_B\subseteq S$. Now we claim that $|S_A|\geq 2|E(G[A])|$ and, similarly, $|S_B|\geq 2|E(G[B])|$; this yields the required inequality. To prove the first inequality, consider any edge $e=(a_1,a_2)$ with $a_1,a_2\in A$; denote $d_i=d_B(a_i)$ and notice that $d_i\geq d_A(a_i)\geq 1$. For each neighbor $b_1\in B$ of $a_1$ (there are $d_1$ such), we say that $e$ contribures $1/d_2$ to the pair $(a_2,b_1)\in S_A$. Similarly, for every neighbor $b_2$ of $a_2$ (there are $d_2$ such), the edge $e$ contributes $1/d_1$ to the pair $(a_1,b_2)\in S_A$. Thus, the total contrivution of $e$ is $d_1/d_2+d_2/d_1\geq 2$, and the total contribution of all edges is $\geq 2|E(G[A])|$. On the other hand, the total contribution to any pair $(a,b)\in S_A$ is at most $d_A(a)/d_B(a)\leq 1$. Hence, the total contribution of all edges is at most $|S_A|$. Therefore, $|S_A|\geq 2|E(G[A])|$, as required. 

Take a $3k\times 3k$ square, divide it into 9 congruent squares and paint as $$ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline B&B&W\\ \hline W&B&W\\ \hline W&B&B\\ \hline \end{array} $$ Fisrtly, we mention that it contains no black $(k+1)$-permutation $(1,2,\dots,k+1)$ and no white $(k+1)$-permutation $(k+1,k,\dots,1)$. Next, it contains no monochromatic $(k+2)$-permutation $(2,k+2,\hbox{(anything)},1,k+1)$. So, if a square should contain every $t$-permutation in a monochromatic way, its side should be of order at least $3t$. In fact, it seems that this order should be superlinear. 

We identify opposite vectors (or we may factor $S^{2}$ by $\{\pm 1\}$). We claim that all finite ortho-closed sets on $S^2$ are coplanar after removing one vector. (I think the same argument works in higher dimension as well.) Firstly, one useful property: If $a,b,c\in X$, where $c$ is not orthogonal to $a$, then the (normalized) projection of $c$ onto the plane spanned by $a$ and $b$ also lies in $X$. Indeed, $X$ contains the vector $x\perp a,b$; next, it contains the vector $y\perp x,c$; finally, it contains $z\perp x,y$, and $z$ is the required projection. Now, starting from any two vectors $a,x\in X$, we find in $X$ the vectors $b\perp a,x$ and $c\perp a,b$, thus $X$ contains an orthogonal triple $a,b,c$. If all vectors from $X$ distinct from $a,b,c$ lie in exactly one of the planes $\langle a,b\rangle$, $\langle a,c\rangle$, and $\langle b,c\rangle$, then our claim is true. Otherwise, using the property, we find two such planes containing some other vectors from $X$. We ay assume that these vectors are $u_0\in\langle a,b\rangle$ and $v_0\in\langle a,c\rangle$. Notice that $a$ forms acute angles with $u_0$ and $v_0$. Now, let $a_0$ be the projection of $a$ onto $\langle u_0,v_0\rangle$, and let $u_1$ and $v_1$ be the projections of $a_0$ onto $\langle a,b\rangle$ and $\langle a,c\rangle$, respectively. Then $\angle (a,u_1)<\angle (a,u_0)$ and $\angle(a,v_1)<\angle(a,v_0)$. Repeating the process we find an infinite number offvectors in $X$.
