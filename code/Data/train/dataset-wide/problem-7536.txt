According to the book of Helmut Koch "Zahlentheorie" also the following refereence is of importance, because there $p$-adic valuations and completions are studied before. The paper is: Über sogenannte perfekte Körper, in Journal der reinen und angewandten Mathematik $147 (1917), 191-204$. 

Here is an answer as I understood the question (it was changed in the meantime). The $R$-module $A$ has an injective hull (or envelope) $E(A)$ containing $A$. Then we ask about conditions ensuring that the injective module $E(A)$ has a decomposition (as a direct sum of indecomposable submodules). One possibility to ensure this is the following result of Bass, and Papp: Theorem (Bass, Papp): Every injective (left)-module has a decomposition as a direct sum of indecomposable, injective submodules if and only if $R$ is left Noetherian (i.e., every left ideal is finitely generated). 

Also the following can be said about $P$ and $Q$. Your relation implies that the two matrices $PDP^{-1}$ and $QDQ^{-1}$ have the same diagonal elements for any diagonal matrix $D$. For $n=2$ this is a necessary and suffcient condition for the equality $(P^{-1})^T\circ P=(Q^{-1})^T\circ P$. Here is a Reference: $URL$ 

Every real symmetric matrix is similar to a diagonal matrix by the spectral theorem. The only nilpotent matrix which is similar to a diagonal matrix is the zero matrix. Hence if you mean principal submatrices then the answer is trivial, as Chris Godsil has pointed out. If you consider arbitrary submatrices, the question seems to be quite vague. For finding in the sense of counting nilpotent symmetric matrices, it seems to be more interesting to consider other fields than $\mathbb{R}$. Indeed, let the field be $\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $a(n,k,q)$ be the number of nilpotent matrices of rank $k$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Then $$ a(n,k,q)=\frac{\Phi_n(q)\Phi_{n-1}(q)}{\\Phi_{n-k}(q)\Phi_{n-k-1}(q)\Phi_k(q)}q^{\binom{k}{2}} $$ for $k \le n-1$, where $\Phi_r(q)=\prod_{1\le i\le r}(q^i-1)$. This is due to G. Lusztig. Then count the nilpotent, symmetric ones of rank $k$, see $URL$ . 

1.) No, the weight systems are not classified in general. However, the weight systems for complex nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension $n\le 7$ have been computed by Roger Carles, in "Weight systems for complex nilpotent Lie algebras and application to the varieties of Lie algebras", in $1996$. Another reference, in addition to Pasha's references, is this paper of Magnin of $1998$. 2.), 3.) I think no. 4.) There are several books (e.g., by Goze, Onischik, Vinberg, etc.). Also, several articles discuss nilpotent Lie algebras in general, e.g. the article by E. M. Luks, What is a typical nilpotent Lie algebra ? For faithful representations of nilpotent Lie algebras, see, for example, here. 

There is some list on Thistlethwaite's knot page, I think, see "the knot atlas". Kanenobu has shown that there are infinitely many distinct knots with the same HOMFLY polynomial: Kanenobu, T. "Infinitely Many Knots with the Same Polynomial." Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 97, 158-161, 1986. For knots with "similar" HOMFLY polynomial, in particular the Alexander polynomial, the Conway polynomial and the Jones polynomial coincide. For torus knots there are easy formulas, e.g., the Jones polynomial for a $(m,n)$-torus knot is $$ V(t)=\frac{t^{{(m-1)(n-1)}/2}(1-t^{m+1}-t^{n+1}+t^{m+n})}{1-t^2}, $$ and the Alexander polynomial is $$ A(t)=\frac{(t^{nm}-1)(t-1)}{(t^m-1)(t^n-1)}. $$ This shows that the polynomials are different (except for obvious symmetries). In general, the HOMFLY polynomial for torus knots is computed in section 3 of the paper "The HOMFLY polynomial for torus links from Chern-Simons gauge theory", by J.M.F. Labastida and M. Marino (see formula $3.1$). 

The proof can (more or less) be found in section $4$ of Rubin's and Silverberg's article Twists of elliptic curves of rank at least four. They write $w_d(E)$ for the root number of the quadratic twist $E^{(d)}$; if $p\nmid dN_E$, then $E^{(d)}$ has good reduction over $\mathbb{Q}_p$, so the local root number $w_{E,p}(d)$ equals $1$, and one can use the representation of a product of local root numbers on both sides. The congruence condition in Lemma $4.3$ can be expressed via the Dirichlet character $\psi_d$. 

This is explained in the article of Beno Eckmann and Urs Stammbach "On exact sequences in the homology of groups and algebras". The Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence for homology of Lie algebras, applied to the short exact sequence $0\rightarrow N \rightarrow G \rightarrow Q \rightarrow 0$ of Lie algebras, and every $Q$-module $M$ yields long exact sequences in homology, see $(I)$ to $(VIII)$ in Eckmann's and Stammbach's paper: $(I)$ is $H_2(G,M)\rightarrow H_2(Q,M)\rightarrow \cdots H_1(G,M)\rightarrow H_1(Q,M)\rightarrow 0$, $(VIII)$ is $H_n(G,M)\rightarrow H_n(Q,M)\rightarrow H_{n-2}(Q,H_1(N,M))\rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow H_1(Q,M)\rightarrow 0$. 

Let $A=(a_{ij})$. Then we obtain a system of polynomial equations in the variables $a_{ij}$, given by determinant conditions $\det A(\alpha)=\det A^{-1}(\alpha)$. If one determines a Groebner basis for such a system with a given $n$, we see that the dimension of the variety given by the polynomial equations is rather high. We see that there are always many other solutions for $A$, which do not satisfy $A=A^{-1}$ or $A^{-1}=A^T$. One reason is, that many determinants of the submatrices of size less than $n$ can be chosen to be zero, for $A$ and $A^{-1}$. I know this does not answer the question how to give a nice characterization for this variety other than by determinants. Therefore, let me just give a typical example for $n=3$, with $a,b\in \mathbb{R}$ and $b\neq 0$: $$ A=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -1/b \cr a & 1 & 0 \cr b & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad A^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1/b \cr 0 & 1 & -a/b \cr -b & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}. $$ 

I have only some simple remarks here, valid also for non-compact Lie groups. Let $G$ be a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. A first remark is that for $X\in Z(\mathfrak{g})$ and $Y\in \mathfrak{g}$, $\exp (X)$ and $\exp(Y)$ commute. Hence we have $\exp(Z(\mathfrak{g}))\subseteq Z(G)$. However, $\exp$ need not be injective, even if $G$ is simply connected. Also, $\exp$ need not be surjective (but there is a classification of all simple Lie groups with surjective exponential). There are some special cases, where we can say which elements do not exponentiate to the centre of $G$. As an example, the following is true: Lemma: Let $G$ be a real or complex connected Lie group whose Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is linear and centerfree. If $X ∈\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent and $\exp(X) \in Z(G)$, then $X =0$. Proof: By assumption $\exp({\rm ad} X)Y=Y$ for all $Y\in \mathfrak{g}$, so that $[X,Y]=0$ for all $Y\in \mathfrak{g}$. It follows $X=0$ because $Z(\mathfrak{g})=0$. 

I think it has first been considered by A.A. Albert in $1948$, in connection with so-called Lie-admissible algebras. An algebra $(A,\cdot)$ is called Lie-admissible, if $[a,b]=a\cdot b-b\cdot a$ defines a Lie bracket on the vector space of $A$. The bracket $[a,b]=axb-bxa$ has been considered later (around $1967$ for the bracket $[a,b]=\lambda ab-\mu ba$ for scalars $\lambda,\mu$, and $1978$ for the bracket $[a,b]=apb-bqa$ for fixed $p,q$ in an associative algebra) in physics (Lie-Santilli bracket). For references see (for example) here, page $8$. 

The following result is proved in Bourbaki's book on Lie algebras: Theorem (A converse to the First Whitehead Lemma). Any finite-dimensional Lie algebra over the field of characteristic zero such that its first cohomology with coefficients in any finite-dimensional module vanishes, is semisimple. Now it suffices to say that $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ is not semisimple. 

In general, there is the following result on upper bounds for the degree of elements in the (reduced) Groebner basis: Let $G$ be a reduced Groebner basis of an ideal $I=\langle f_1,\ldots, f_r\rangle $. Let $d$ be the maximal degree (with respect to some monomial order) of $deg(f_1),\ldots ,deg(f_r)$. Let $n$ be the dimension of the ring (the number of variables). Then we have $$ max \lbrace deg(g) \mid g\in G \rbrace \le 2\left(\frac{d^2}{2}+d\right)^{2^{n-1}}. $$ The result is due to Thomas W. Dubé (1990). Of course, for the equations $f(x,y)=g(x,y)=0$ we may just take the resultant $h_1(x)=res(f(y)(x),g(y)(x))$ with respect to $x$. No Groebner basis is needed then, and the degree can be estimated easily. 

In general, we can write down the polynomial equations for two $S$-modules being isomorphic. By considering characteristic polynomials of similar matrices one can sometimes get necessary conditions which simplify the equations. Also, the non-vanishing of the determinant is useful (the morphism is bijective). If the dimension of $S$ is not too high, then the equations can just be solved by computing a Groebner basis. This works in the same way as testing Lie algebras for isomorphism. The book of Willem de Graaf has a discussion on this. Of course, if one has additional information in form of invariants which are easy to compute, this will make the computations much easier. Also, the dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^n(L,M)$ are useful invariants. Sometimes however this does not help too much, e.g., the invariants could just be identical. 

A small addition to Abhinav's nice answer: the discriminant $\Delta=b^2-4ac$ is the fundamental invariant of $Q(x,y)=ax^2+bxy+cy^2$. Equivalent forms have the same discriminant, and represent the same integers. If $\Delta <0$, then then $Q(x, y)$ has no real roots.. Hence $Q(x, y)$ takes on either only positive values or negative values (and zero if $x = y = 0$). Accordingly $Q$ is either a positive definite form (e.g., $x^2 + y^2$ for $\Delta=-4$), or a negative definite form (e.g., $−x^2 − y^2$). If you have a form with $\Delta=-4$, then you can construct an equivalent form, which is reduced. For example, $$ Q(x,y)=458x^2+214xy+25y^2 $$ has discriminant $-4$, and the reduced equivalent form is $x^2+y^2$. If $\Delta > 0$, then $Q(x, y)$ has a real root and $Q(x, y)$ takes on positive and negative values. That is, $Q$ is an indefinite form (e.g., $x^2-y^2$). 

It depends on the definition of a reductive space $G/H$. Some authors require that in addition to $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{h}+\mathfrak{m}$, $[\mathfrak{h},\mathfrak{m}]\subseteq \mathfrak{m}$, we have that $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h})$ is a reductive pair of Lie algebras, by which they mean that $\mathfrak{g}$ is reductive, and $\mathfrak{h}$ is reductive in $\mathfrak{g}$. In this case, since $\mathfrak{h}$ is a $\mathfrak{h}$-submodule of $\mathfrak{g}$, this would imply that $\mathfrak{h}$ itself is reductive. 

It is, for example, explained in paragraph $8$ (Appendix) of the book Unipotent Algebraic Groups, Lecture Notes in Mathematics Volume 414, 1974, by Tatsuji Kambayashi, Masayoshi Miyanishi, and Mitsuhiro Takeuchi, which is accessible online. It is also discussed in the first chapter On the theory of unipotent algebraic groups over an arbitrary ground field, with the reference to § $8$, where it is referred to Lazard's original proof. 

Even for commutative associative algebras it is not true. The article of Björn Poonen "Isomorphism types of commutative algebras of finite rank over an algebraically closed field" gives a classification in dimension $n\le 6$ for algebraically closed fields of arbitrary characteristic, where there are only finitely many isomorphism classes. Then there are examples given in dimension $7$ of infinitely many different algebras. 

There are necessary and sufficient conditions in the literature for a (left) partial order $\le$ on $G$ to extend to a (left) linear order $\le^{\ast}$ on $G$. This shows in particular, that not every partial left order extends to a linear left order in the non-abelian case, even though the group is orderable. In the paper "Right-orderability of groups" by Richard Kaye (1998) these conditions are called "a sort of mini completeness/soundness theorem". In the paper "Compactness of the space of left orders" of Dabkowska et al, these conditions are referred to as Conrad's theorem (P. F. Conrad, Right ordered groups, Mich. Math. J. 6(3), 1959, pp. 267–275.) This paper also gives an explicit example of a partial order on the fundamental group of the Klein bottle that does not extend, even though the group is orderable. Remark: I have edited the answer to include Alexander's useful comments, which helped to clarify the answer. 

Kac and Peterson have classified all inequivalent Heisenberg subalgebras of a loop algebra. This is explained in the book "Lie Algebras, Part 2: Finite and Infinite Dimensional Lie Algebras and Applications in Physics" by de Kerf, Bäuerle and ten Kroode, chapter $26$. 

Write the modified CYBE as $B_R(x,y)+\lambda [x,y]=0$ with $$ B_R(x,y):=[R(x),R(y)]-R([R(x),y]+[x,R(y)]), $$ and $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$. Then note that the bracket $[x,y]_R:=[R(x),y]+[x,R(y)]$ satisfies the Jacobi identity if and only if $$ [B_R(x,y),w]+[B_R(y,w),x]+[B_R(w,x),y]=0 $$ for all $x,y,w\in \mathfrak{g}$. 

There is the following GAP package (and related ones), which I would recommend: Willem de Graaf and Serena Cicalo, LieRing — a GAP package. The command "FreeLieRing" enables definition and computations in the free Lie algebra, including Hall bases. 

Yes, finite cyclic groups are exactly the finite groups whose lattices of subgroups are distributive. The lattice of subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}/n$ is isomorphic to the dual of a divisibility lattice (which is distributive). 

There is the following result of Wolke from $1967$ (which is perhaps not the best, but quite good). Theorem: Let $p$ be an odd prime, and $L(s,\chi)$ the $L$-series for the Dirichlet character $(n/p)$. If $t(p)$ is a positive function with $L(1,\chi)>t(p)/\log(p)$, then there are absolute constants $c_1,c_2>0$ with $$ r(p)\le c_1 p^{c_2/\sqrt{t(p)}}. $$ Here one should mention the result of Elliott: if we have for an integer $k\ge 0$ and real $c>0$ $$ L(1,\chi)\ge \frac{c(\log \log p)^k}{\log p}, $$ then for every $\epsilon >0$ we have $r(p)\le c(\epsilon)p^{1/4(1+\epsilon)(k+2)^{-1}}$. For $n(p)$ see the the report of Terence Tao, and $URL$ 

I can add one more example from geometry, topology and physics, where simple modular Lie algebras arise. In John Milnor's article On Fundamental Groups of Complete Affinely Flat Manifolds there was an open question for Lie algebras $L$, namely which Lie algebras admit a bijective $1$-cocycle in $Z^1(L,M)$ with $\dim(L)=\dim (M)$. For the adjoint module, this asks for a non-singular derivation. Jacobson proved that in characteristic zero such a Lie algebra must be nilpotent. The question was formulated there also for Lie groups, namely which connected Lie groups admit a left-invariant affine structure. It can also be formulated in terms of Yang-Baxter groups, or left braces, see the article Counterexample to a conjecture about braces by D. Bachiller. From the first Whitehead Lemma it follows that a simple Lie algebra of characteristic zero does not admit such a $1$-cocycle. In prime characteristic, this is no longer true. For modular simple Lie algebras there are such examples, see First Cohomology Groups for Classical Lie Algebras by Jens-Carsten Jantzen. This has then interesting applications to $p$-groups, Yang-Baxter groups, left braces, pre-Lie algebras, post-Lie algebras, and other things. Benkart, Kostrikin and Kuznezov classified Finite-Dimensional Modular Simple Lie algebras with a Nonsingular Derivation. 

The condition $c_N=0$ does impose a restriction on a Lie algebra $L$ in general (with the exception of cases where, say, $L$ is nilpotent of class $c$, so that all terms of $c_N$ are trivially zero for $N>c$). In the theory of identities one searches for a "basis" of identities. Yu P. Razmyslov found a finite basis for the identities of the simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(2,K)$, see his article "Simple Lie algebras satisfying the standard Lie identity of degree $5$" and the references therein. For simple Lie algebras of rank at least $2$ (over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero) an identity $c_N=0$ should not hold for $n\ge 5$, I think. For solvable and nilpotent Lie algebras these identities are more difficult to understand. Related to $c_4=0$, but different, is the trilinear Malcev-identity $$ [[x,y], [x,z]]=[[[x,y],z],x]+[[[y,z],x],x]+[[[z,x],x],y], $$ which generalises the Jacobi identity. Another related topic consists of Filippov $n$-ary Lie algebras. 

Here is a really basic example. Suppose that $\phi:M_n(K)\rightarrow K$ satisfies $(a)$ $\phi$ is multilinear, $(b)$ $\phi$ is alternating and $(c)$ $\phi(E_n)=1$. Then it follows $(d))$ $\phi(A)=\det (A)$. 

The existence of integral quadratic forms with prescribed “local” data (i.e., essentially the genus) has been also proved by Nikulin. For a proof of Nikulin's existence theorem, see for example $URL$ Theorem $5.2$. On the other hand, Conway and Sloane do provide some references - perhaps they are helpful. They write at the beginning of section $7$: "No proofs will be offered. For $p\neq 2$ several accounts are readily available (e.g. Cassels, [Cas3]), and all cases are handled by O'Meara [O'Me 1], ... etc.". 

Cohen has already discussed such noncommutative analogues of exterior algebras much earlier, e.g., in the book Handbook of Algebraic Topology from $1995$, see the section before Theorem $13.1$. Note that this reference is not cited in Cohen's preprint "Combinatorial Group Theory In Homotopy Theory I". Another reference is the paper Natural transformations of tensor algebras and representations of combinatorial groups by Grbic, and Wu; but again this is based on Cohen's definition. 

I can recommend the article of Louise Dolan, "The Beacon of Kac- Moody Symmetry for Physics", and the references given therein. From the summary: In addition to (this) wide application to physical theories, the Kac-Moody algebras are also relevant to number theory and modular forms. The link is $URL$ 

The classification of associative algebras in low dimensions has a long history, beginning with work of Peirce. A good survey, and a classification of all nilpotent associative algebras of low dimension, over an arbitrary field, also of characteristic two, can be found in the paper of W. de Graaf, see $URL$ I do not know if an "explicit list" of representatives is possible for the general case. 

Yes, the first congruence was conjectured by Chowla and Cowles in $1980$ and proved by Y. Mimura in $1983$, see $URL$ For $B_n$ the sequence begins $(1,3,19,147,1251,11253,104959...)$, which is $(1,0,1,0,0,0,1...)$ modulo $3$. It seems we have $B_{2^k}\equiv 0 \mod 3$ and $B_n\equiv 1 \mod 3$ otherwise. Perhaps the recurrence $$ (n + 1)^2B_{n + 1} = (11n^2 + 11n + 3)B_n + n^2B_{n-1}. $$ is useful. Edit: I found a reference here: $URL$ See Theorem $5.8$.
