Orthogonal arrays were mentioned in another answer, but you are not requiring that each $k$-tuple occurs exactly once in every set of $k$ columns, but rather that each $k$-tuple occurs at least once in every set of $k$ columns. What you are looking for is called a covering array. In the usual notation for covering and orthogonal arrays, $v$ is the size of the alphabet ($2$ in this case), $k$ corresponds to your $n$, and $t$ corresponds to your $k$. Some known upper bounds for the number of rows for small values of $t,k,v$ are listed in $URL$ - you are interested in the numbers for $(t,k,2)$. 

René Thom proved that for any topological space $X$, any integral homology class of $X$ (of any degree) has an odd multiple that is the pushforward of the fundamental class of a smooth compact oriented manifold mapping contin to $X$. So, if we pass to $rational$ homology, then any rational homology class of $X$ is the pushforward of an at most rational multiple of the fundamental class of a smooth compact oriented manifold mapping to $X$. Have there appeared other, different proofs (i.e. different from Thom's) of this last rational result since? 

The question is essentially the title. In other words, is there some universal property that the Amitsur complex for a morphism of rings $\phi:A\to B$ satisfies as a cosimplicial ring, or cosimplicial $A$-algebra? Suppose that the limit of the Amitsur complex for $\phi:A\to B$ is isomorphic to $A$, then given another cosimplicial $A$-algebra $C^\bullet$ whose limit is isomorphic to $A$, can we say that $C^\bullet$ is isomorphic to the Amitsur complex? Or that it at least admits a map to the Amitsur complex? In particular I'm interested in the case that all of this is happening in some model category (or quasicategory) so the limits above are homotopical and the isomorphisms are just equivalences, but I just want to know if this is true in any setting. 

For $k=7,\dots,11$, you can fulfil the two first conditions using a set of $6$ mutually orthogonal Latin rectangles (MOLR) of size $6\times k$ (actually $5$ would be enough, see note at the bottom). They exist when $k\geq 7$ is a prime power and apparently also when $k=10$ (see Table 3.118 in Handbook of Combinatorial designs). An $m\times n$ Latin rectangle ($m \leq n$) is an $m\times n$ array of symbols from a set of size $n$ (say $0,1,\dots,n-1$) such that every row contains each symbol exactly once and every column contains each symbol at most once. Two Latin rectangles are mutually orthogonal if there is no pair of positions that have the same symbol in the first rectangle and have the same symbol in the second rectangle. Here, each position corresponds to a player and each rectangle corresponds to a round. The symbol tells the player's team in the round. There are $6$ of each symbol in every rectangle so the teams have $6$ players, and orthogonality means that no pair of players is on the same team twice. Note: The requirement that the rectangles are Latin is not necessary in this case (as rows and columns don't mean anything), only the condition that each symbol occurs $6$ times in each rectangle is used. This can be used to add another round using a rectangle that has $0$ in the first column, $1$ in the second column etc., so in general you need only $n-1$ MOLR for $n$ rounds. 

Is it known whether or not the endomorphism rings (or ring spectra) of the localized sphere spectra in $L_nSp$ and $L_{K(n)}Sp$ are Noetherian or not? Are they well understood? Perhaps, in the vein of making it an algebraic stable homotopy category, we should instead look at $[L_{K(n)}F(n),L_{K(n)}F(n)]$ for some finite, type-n spectrum. If we do indeed have that either one of these rings is Noetherian, can we use Hovey, Palmieri and Strickland's ideas about Noetherian stable homotopy categories to better understand these rings or the localized categories (though in some sense they are sort of simple categories)? Are the ideals of these rings connected at all to the localizing subcategories of the respective stable homotopy categories, or maybe to collections of tensor ideals? 

Let $A$ be a commutative $\mathbb{C}$-algebra, and consider $C_{\bullet}(A,A)$ the simplicial Hochschild homology module of $A$ with respect to itself (i.e. $C_{n}(A,A)=A^{\otimes (n+1)}$). This is a simplicial commutative $\mathbb{C}$-algebra and we can take its $Spec$ levelwise, to get a cosimplicial $\mathbb{C}$-scheme $X_A :=Spec(C_{\bullet}(A,A))$. If $A$ is of finite type over $\mathbb{C}$, then we may take levelwise the associated topological space for the analytic topology, and get a cosimplicial topological space, denoted $X_{A}^{top}$. My question is whether somebody knows what the geometric realization of $X_{A}^{top}$ looks like (e.g. any relation to the topological free loop space of $(Spec(A))^{top}$?). 

In their book, Elmendorf, Kriz, May and Mandell describe a useful category of spectra, called S-modules, where S is the sphere spectrum. Ring objects in this category can be identified with spectra with an action of an $A_\infty$-operad (if I understand correctly) and commutative rings can be identified with spectra with an action of the $E_\infty$-operad. Has anyone written about $E_n$-rings in this category? In particular, are there nice model category structures on categories of $A$-modules and $A$-algebras if $A$ is only an $E_n$-algebra? Can this perhaps be shown by somehow trapping this model structure between the nice model category structures on commutative rings and associative rings? Thanks! 

Asymptotically $$ p(n) \sim \frac{1}{4 n \sqrt{3}} \exp\left(\pi \sqrt{\frac{2n}{3}}\right), $$ which gives (Well, technically this is valid only for even $n$, but odd $n$ wouldn't be much different.) $$ \frac{p(n/2)^2}{p(n)} \sim \frac{1}{n\sqrt{3} } \exp\left( (2-\sqrt{2}) \pi \sqrt{\frac{n}{3}} \right). $$ Because $p_2(n)>p(n/2)^2$, we know that $p_2(n)/p(n)$ grows faster than any polynomial, as Amritanshu Prasad suggested in a comment. 

The problem is equivalent to the set cover problem and thus NP-hard. The set formulation you gave is: 

A dominating set of $(K_n)^{\square \,d}$ is equivalent to a $n$-ary covering code of length $d$ and covering radius $1$: just take the positions of the rooks to be the codewords. Known optimal sizes of covering codes are listed for example in Gerzson Kéri's website, although I don't know how up-to-date that information is. The notation is such that $K_q(n,R)$ is the optimal size of a $q$-ary covering code of length $n$ and covering radius $R$. With the notation in this question, you are looking for $K_n(d,1)$. In particular, the answer for $(K_4)^{\square\,4}$ is $K_4(4,1)=24$, given in "Bounds for quaternary and quinary covering codes, listed for n <= 11, R <= 8 ". (Yes, the $K_x$ part of the notation happens to be the same in both cases, which might be confusingly non-confusing; on the other hand the meaning of $n$ is different here and there.) 

Okay, so maybe I'm being naive here, but I think this is probably a naive question. The answer might be a little complicated by the fact that I don't have any good way to drawcommutative diagrams on here. Also, this is all pretty much lifted directly from Mahowald's paper on the subject and Eric Peterson's notes on that paper. Recall the "shear" map for an $H$-space $X$ given by $\sigma: X\times X\to X\times X$, $\sigma(x,y)=(x,x^{-1}y)$. This is a homotopy equivalence, with homotopy inverse given by $(x,y)\mapsto (x,xy)$, I believe. However, notice that if we compose with the multiplication map, we don't get the same maps, i.e. $(x,y)\mapsto (x,x^{-1}y)\mapsto y$ rather than $xy$. Now let's say we've got some map $f:X\to BF$. Then we've got a few maps floating around, $ff:X\times X\overset{\mu}\to X\overset{f}\to BF$ whose Thom spectrum is $Th(f)\wedge Th(f)$ and $f0:X\times X\overset{\sigma}\to X\times X\overset{\mu}\to X\overset{f}\to BF$ whose associated Thom spectrum is $Th(f)\wedge \Sigma^\infty_+ X$. But since $\sigma$ is an equivalence, we must have that its Thomification is an equivalence, hence $Th(f)\wedge Th(f)\overset{\sim}{\underset{\sigma}\to}Th(f)\wedge \Sigma^\infty_+X$ is also an equivalence (inducing the Thom isomorphism). But notice that the map $\mu\circ \sigma$ also Thomifies to a map $Th(f)\wedge\Sigma^\infty_+\to Th(f)$. And basically by drawing out the commutative diagram, you'll see that this "action" of $\Sigma^\infty_+ X$ on $Th(f)$ is the same thing as going backwards along the Thom isomorphism and then applying the multiplication. I hope I'm not saying anything silly here... =P The general case for a spectrum which is $X(n)$-oriented or whatever, follows from the fact that $\Omega SU(n)\to \Omega SU(n+1)$ is an inclusion (and so we can factor the map $\Omega SU(n)\to BF$ through $\Omega SU(n)\to\Omega SU(n+1)\to BF$).
