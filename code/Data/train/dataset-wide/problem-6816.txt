According to The Economist, 2015-09-26, pornography (the "adult" industry) may be one such industry. Due to the entrance of YouTube-like porn aggregators, industry revenues have shrunk dramatically in recent years: 

And if so, to what extent? Also, how does the extent of China's subsidies compare internationally? (I understand this is a broad question but I can imagine that some economists somewhere have come up with some convenient measures or indices for this purpose.) 

Keynes (1936, Chapter 2) says that based on the classical theory, "there are only four possible means of increasing employment", the fourth of which is: 

Summary of version in Camron & Ariely (2000): In their "Study 1", their subjects are students who signed up for a lottery. However, there is no mention that these students had to queue or camp for tickets. More importantly, contrary to what's stated in Predictably Irrational, Study 1 contains no analysis that compares lottery winners to the lottery losers. Instead: 

which would be consistent with the previous quote, since £1 = 240p. So according to Smith, 6,000 sestertii ≈ £50 "of our present money". The Wealth of Nations was first published in 1776. Using the Bank of England's inflation calculator, £50 in 1776 = £7,519.57 in 2016, or about US\$10,000 at current conversion rates (according to Google). So 6,000 sestertii ≈ US\$10,000 in 2017 or 1 sesterti ≈ US\$1.67? Thus 

What does the above quote mean? What are wage-goods and non-wage-goods? And why would an increase in the price of non-wage-goods increase employment? P.S. Keynes's discussion here is with reference to AC Pigou's Theory of Unemployment (1933), which I can't find online. It seems that Pigou makes a distinction between "wage-goods" and "non-wage-goods". Keynes mentions very briefly that "non-wage-goods" is "Professor Pigou's convenient term for goods upon the price of which the utility of the money-wage depends", but I'm not sure I understand this. 

The other oft-cited examples are East Asian economies like Japan, Korea, and Taiwan in the postwar era. 

As Tim Harford points out, this is FALSE. In recent decades, energy growth per person in many countries has actually been falling, even as GDP per capita has risen. Graph (data from World Bank, June 1st 2017 update): 

Fallacy #2. "Bad things (like the consumption of food or resources) will grow rapidly or even exponentially. In contrast, offsetting good things (like technology) can at best grow arithmetically. Therefore, there are necessarily limits to growth." This fallacy is not new. Here's an example of doom-and-gloom predictions from each of the past three centuries, all of which proved to be wrong. 

So, would most economic historians agree with the above claims? Or have any openly disagreed with the above claims? 

Elsewhere, I find a statement which, together with the above, would seem to identify "fixed assets" with "fixed capital": 

Example: A soldier is paid \$50,000 a year to serve in the army. So \$50,000 worth of defense services are produced and consumed. In this example, who is the consumer (C) and who is the producer (P)? Possible interpretations: 

Say the consumer has a standard convex, monotonic preference over Apples and Bananas. (Update: I'd like the preference to be as 'standard' as possible. So ideally we have diminishing MRS everywhere and we also have "more is better" everywhere.) Say his preference can be represented by some utility function $u(A,B)$. He must satisfy some budget constraint $p_AA+p_BB=y$, where $y$ is his income. Then what is an example of a utility function in which $\frac{\partial A}{\partial y}<0$, at least under some circumstances? This seems to me a very simple question but briefly Googling I'm unable to find anything. 

The Econ 101 demand-and-supply story serves to illustrate a simple point: Markets tend to move/adjust towards equilibrium. However, such adjustment is neither instantaneous nor perfect; rather, it takes time. 

Example. In 2016, India produces 10 bananas, each valued at ₹10, for a total value of ₹100. India also imports 5 bananas ($M = ₹50$). Private consumers consume 4 bananas ($C = ₹40$), government consumes 5 bananas ($G = ₹50$), and 6 bananas are stored for consumption in future years ($I = ₹60$). There are no exports ($X = ₹0$). $GDP = C + G + I + (X - M) = ₹40 + ₹50 + ₹60 + (0 - ₹60)= ₹100$. Total final consumption ($C + G$) was ₹40 + ₹50 = ₹90. Hence, $S = ₹10$. But $I = ₹60$. So $S < I$. How is this possible? The reason is that the gap between investment and savings of $I - S = ₹60 - ₹10 = ₹50$ is made up for precisely by imports. So our shortfall in savings (relative to investment) is made up for by borrowing from abroad, in this case through imports. 

I suspect your confusion is merely because you don't know what an annuity is. An annuity pays you a regular stream of income until your death (e.g. $10,000 every year until you die). So say there's a man and a woman. Each is aged 65 and each has \$100,000 in pension savings. Each person uses their pension savings to buy an annuity. Suppose the financial institution (usually an insurance company) selling them the annuity estimates that the man's life expectancy is 20 years, while the woman's is 40 years. Then the actuarially-fair payout would be \$5,000 per year for the man and \$2,500 per year for the woman (if we ignore interest rates, discount rates, and similar complications). Hence, for the same amount spent on the annuity (\$100,000), the man gets a highly yearly income (\$5,000 per year) than the woman (\$2,500 per year). This is what your quoted passage means. 

Increased dexterity. Saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another. The invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many. 

One example that I was hoping could work (but didn't) came from the book/movie Sophie's Choice, where Sophie is made to choose between the following two alternatives: 

I don't think any economist believes it is "bad to pay it off and have zero national debt". Instead, as with most questions in economics, the answer is "It depends." You can have too much debt or too little debt. Having zero national debt is neither always ideal nor always bad. But in practice (i.e. in the real world), many governments tend to err on the side of having too much debt.
