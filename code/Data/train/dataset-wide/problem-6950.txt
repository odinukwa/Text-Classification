I'm not sure specifically what data you have but it sounds like you have enough data to calculate a rough gini estimate. Gini is equal to: (The average variance for incomes) / (2 * the mean) Since Gini is a standardized indicator and not dependent on the level of income, just the variance, you can construct a rough gini metric using your data. If you assume 0-25K = 0, 25K-50K = 1, 50K-75K = 2 etc. You can treat the buckets as incomes. You can then calculate the average variance between the incomes weighted by the number of individuals in each bucket and divide it by 2 X the average income (bucket). In doing so you've created a rough gini coefficient for each zipcode. You should note that this statistic is rough and not perfectly accurate since it ignores any variation in distribution of income within the bucket. It may be that the 25K-50K bucket has most of its individuals at 40K income and few in the 25K income which would negatively bias your gini estimate. Assuming this is for a research paper this methodology should be discussed and the possible flaws with this estimate should be disclosed. It does however provide the best approximation for inequality given the information you have. 

Let $T > 0$, and let $(\Omega, \mathscr F, \{\mathscr F_t\}_{t \in [0,T]}, \mathbb P)$ be a filtered probability space where $\mathbb P = \tilde{\mathbb P}$ (risk-neutral measure) and $\mathscr F_t = \mathscr F_t^{{W}} = \mathscr F_t^{\tilde{W}}$ where $W = \tilde{W} = (\tilde{W_t})_{t \in [0,T]} = ({W_t})_{t \in [0,T]}$ is standard $\mathbb P=\tilde{\mathbb P}$-Brownian motion. Define forward measure $\hat{\mathbb P}$: $$A_T := \frac{d \hat{\mathbb P}}{d \mathbb P} = \frac{\exp(-\int_0^T r_s ds)}{P(0,T)}$$ It can be shown that $\exp(-\int_0^t r_s ds)P(t,T)$ is a $(\mathscr F_t, \mathbb P)-$martingale where $r_t$ is short rate process and $P(t,T)$ is bond price. We are given that $$\frac{dP(t,T)}{P(t,T)} = r_t dt + \zeta_t dW_t$$ where $r_t$ and $\zeta_t$ are $\mathscr F_t$-adapted and $\zeta_t$ satisfies Novikov's condition. I don't think $\zeta_t$ is supposed to represent anything in particular. Define the stochastic process $\hat{W} = (\hat{W_t})_{t\in[0,T]}$ s.t. $$\hat{W_t} := W_t + \int_0^t -\zeta_s ds$$ Use Girsanov Theorem to prove $\hat{W_t}$ is standard $\hat{\mathbb P}$-Brownian motion. 

@EnergyNumbers aptly points out that Bearer bonds do exist and act in some way as a currency like you are describing. This does not answer the question of why aren't bearer bonds used instead of fiat currency? First we should understand what a bearer bond is. A bearer bond (or any bond really) entitles its holder to fixed payments over years (coupon payments) and the ability to have a pre-agreed upon amount paid at a later date (principal payment). It is essentially an agreement that a company or individual will pay the holder of the bond back the money that the bond was purchased for plus some agreed on interest. Unlike some types of bonds a bearer bond is special in that whoever holds the piece of paper owns the bond, whereas other bonds are generally in someone's name and must be transferred on paper not just physically. Theoretically it makes sense that you could go into a store and pay them in bearer bonds instead of cash assuming the store was willing to accept them. There are two big reasons for why you couldn't just stop using the fiat currency and switch over to bearer bond based exchanges. 1) Bearer bonds are not necessarily a good holder of wealth. Bonds are a promise by a company to pay back a debt over time with interest. If the company goes bankrupt as most tend to do over time the bond becomes worthless. If you had your life savings in the form of bonds and the company that backs the bonds disappears you suddenly have no money. As an employee or shop owner I may be reluctant to take payments in a currency that may have no value tomorrow. This volatility in price and the potential to lose all value overnight is why only wealthy people generally invest in securities since they can tolerate this risk. 2) Bearer bonds are worth currency. What gives bearer bonds value is that they can be exchanged for fiat currency. A bearer bond entitles me to plus interest payments. If you don't have some fiat currency what does that mean? There needs to be some agreed on value for this type of debt and some sort of unit. Even if all transactions take place in the form of transferred securities (most large corporate transactions already do) there needs to be some agreed upon unit of measurement to compare a bond from one company to the next. These same points apply to securities in the form of stocks and ownership in companies. They are simply too volatile and impossible to compare value without some underlying fiat currency. The reason the dollar works so well is that you know the US government is going to be around for a long time. You can trust that the government is going to accept payments in dollars and be paying in dollars meaning that the dollar has some intrinsic value unlike a highly volatile stock or bond. With all of this said many transactions do take place using an exchange of securities and bonds. Most corporate transactions as well as large transactions among wealthy people take place by transferring ownership of these types of investments. For small transfers (such as buying milk at the store) these types of transactions simply don't make sense for the reasons stated above. 

Some restaurants particularly fast food ones offer breakfast food only during, well, breakfast hours. Other restaurants however offer breakfast food throughout their opening hours. Some restaurants are specifically breakfast only so of course they do. What's up with that? What would make a restaurant offer some food only sometime while others (besides breakfast restaurants) offer said food throughout opening hours? I was thinking that this might have something to do with low demand or something, but then why do all-day breakfast restaurants, like, not go out of business? 

This is not done by solving $$TR(Q) = TC(Q)$$ which merely gives the quantities that give us zero profit ie $$\pi(Q) := TR(Q) - TC(Q) = 0$$ We want to maximise $\pi(Q)$ so we get the first derivative and set it to zero: $$0 = \frac{d}{dQ} \pi(Q) = MR(Q) - MC(Q)$$ Btw, solving $$0 = MR(Q) - MC(Q)$$ gives us some value $Q_0$, but this is not necessarily give $Q^{*}$. We must check the value of $\pi''(Q_0)$ 

You seem to be confused between Reserves and Deposits. If you don't read anything else just remember: 

One way to think about it is to treat loans and reserves as the banks' assets and deposits as its liabilities. If the bank has 1000 at the start it means it has 1000 in deposits. It makes 900 in loans and keeps 100 in reserves. Loans: 900 | Deposits: 1000 | Reserves: 100 If someone else deposits 900 into the bank and the bank loans out 90% of 900 = 810 then we have Loans: 1710 | Deposits: 1900 | Reserves: 190 

I really like Jamzy's explanation and believe I am not offering any new points but would like to offer additional detail. Demand We see that other than in North America, economies all over the world are in a bit of a slump. Growth rate is low in Europe due to the Eurozone crisis. China's growth rate has steadily declined this decade due to a decrease in worker productivity which in turn is attributed to investments in infrastructure and real estate not having the same effect as in the past. The fall in metal ore prices has led to decreased growth on ore exporting countries like Chile and Brazil. This means aggregate demand for countries all over the world is not increasing as fast as expected. AD low (for various reasons in various countries) -> less need for inputs into economy -> drop in demand in global petroleum market -> drop in price Also, we have vehicles becoming increasingly efficient and a transition away from oil across the globe. See this chart ($URL$ which shows dramatic increases in vehicular fuel efficiency in recent years. Lastly, we have countries trying to diversify their energy sources, either to reduce exposing their economies to geopolitical risk (e.g. China) or to protect the environment (e.g. Europe). Supply Libya and Iraq - Libyan oil production recovered in September and Iraq's production was not affected by unrest, contrary to expectations. OPEC's Statement OPEC made a decision in November 2014 to maintain collective oil production at 30M b/d despite a glut in supply due to all the other factors mentioned. The intention here is pretty clear: to put American Shale and other unconventional sources of petroleum out of business. By producing extracting petrol at low prices, they force any method of production with higher costs to shutdown either temporarily or for good, depending on how long they can maintain 30M b/d. See ($URL$ for the cost curves. On a side note, the economics of oil storage are interesting as well. Oil traders are currently keeping full oil tankers offshore due to unprofitable prices (and also because these tankers would not be needed to bring oil anywhere anyway due to lackluster demand). On the other hand, we have strategic petroleum reserves which (in the case of the US) are difficult to get oil OUT of (~45 days to fill 5M barrels from storage), leading to people arguing that the US govt should not bother refilling them. 

I would argue that these types of goods should be considered capital because they are increasing employee productivity as a factor of production for knowledge workers. In classical economics a capital good has these 3 characteristics: 

The financial bill you're describing exists. It's called the Dodd-Frank act and was enacted after the 08' crisis to further regulate securities which includes derivatives. $URL$ Before the Dodd Frank Act which passed in 2010 the main source of legislation for regulating the financial industry was The Securities Exchange act of 1934 which codified the government regulation on most financial instruments and is still the primary source of financial regulation today. $URL$ 

GNP (Gross national product) measures all of incomes of every citizen in a country. This means that if I as a citizen have a business outside of my home country my income from that business still applies to the GNP. GDP, which is the more common measure is the measure of all economic activity within a country's borders. Meaning that my income from my foreign company would not be counted towards GDP. GDP is generally used as the standard for economic activity because it provides a good look into what is going on within a country's borders, without potentially inflating economic activity of a country by looking at foreign investments.
