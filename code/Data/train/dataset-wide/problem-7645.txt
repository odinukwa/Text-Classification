Here is a lighthearted attempt at generalizing the discussion of Hurwitz' formula in Hartshorne to higher dimensions. Let $f:Y\to X$ be morphism of schemes over a field $k$. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are integral and smooth of dimension $n$, and that $f$ is finite, dominant and separable. Consider the exact sequence \begin{equation*} f^* \Omega_X \to \Omega_Y \to \Omega_{Y/X} \to 0. \end{equation*} Separability of the extension of fields $k(X)\subseteq k(Y)$ is equivalent to the vanishing $\Omega_{k(Y)/k(X)}=0$. Thus the map $f^*\Omega_X\to \Omega_Y$ is surjective at the generic point of $Y$. It follows that it is also injective there, since the two sheaves involved are locally free of the same rank. We conclude that $f^*\Omega_X\to \Omega_Y$ is injective everywhere, since $Y$ is integral. Exterior powers of injective maps of modules that are finite and free over a ring are again injective. Thus the natural map $f^*\omega_X\to \omega_Y$ is injective. Tensoring with $\omega_Y^{-1}$, we obtain an invertible ideal sheaf $f^*\omega_Y\otimes \omega_Y^{-1} \subseteq \mathscr O_Y$. The corresponding effective Cartier divisor $R$ is called the ramification divisor of the cover $f:Y\to X$. By construction there is a natural isomorphism $f^*\omega_X(R)\xrightarrow\sim \omega_Y$. Let $P\in Y$ be a point of codimension 1. We next show that \begin{equation*} \operatorname{length}_{\mathscr O_{Y,P}}\mathscr O_{R,P} = \operatorname{length}_{\mathscr O_{Y,P}} (\Omega_{Y/X})_P. \end{equation*} (I apologise in advance for the inelegant proof.) This will imply the Weil divisor associated with $R$ is \begin{equation*} \sum_{F\subseteq Y} (\operatorname{length}_{\mathscr O_{Y,F}} \Omega_{Y/X}) \cdot F, \end{equation*} where the sum runs over all prime divisors of $Y$. In particular, the complement of $R$ in $Y$ is the largest open subset restricted to which $f$ is unramified. Denote $A:=\mathscr O_{Y,P}$ and let $t\in A$ be a uniformizer. Choose bases around $P$ for the rank-$n$ locally free sheaves $f^*\Omega_Y$ and $\Omega_Y$. The map $(f^*\Omega_Y)_P\to (\Omega_X)_P$ is then given by a matrix $\alpha$, which we may assume to be in Smith normal form: \begin{equation*} \alpha = \begin{bmatrix} t^{a_1} & & \\ & \ddots & \\ & & t^{a_n} \end{bmatrix}, \end{equation*} where the $a_i\ge 0$ are integers. Here there are no zeroes along the diagonal because $\alpha$ tensored with $\operatorname{Frac}(A)$ must be surjective. It easy to see that \begin{equation*} \mathscr O_{R,P} \cong A/(\det \alpha) = A/(t^{\sum a_i}), \end{equation*} while \begin{equation*} (\Omega_{Y/X})_P\cong \oplus_{i\ge 0}^n A/(t^{a_i}), \end{equation*} so these two modules have the same length $\sum a_i$. Let $r(P)$ be the ramification of $f$ at $P$: this is the valuation of the image of any uniformizer of $\mathscr O_{X,f(P)}$ in $\mathscr O_{Y,P}$. Assume that the characteristic of $k$ does not divide $r(P)$, that the finite field extension $k(f(P))\subseteq k(P)$ is separable, and that the finitely generated one $k\subseteq k(f(P))$ is separably generated. We show that under these circumstances \begin{equation*} \operatorname{length}_{\mathscr O_{Y,P}} (\Omega_{Y/X})_P = r(P)-1. \end{equation*} Denote \begin{align*} r &:= r(P), \\ A &:= \mathscr O_{X,f(P)}, \\ B &:= \mathscr O_{Y,P}. \end{align*} Thus we have inclusions $k\subseteq B\subseteq A$. Denote the maximal ideal of $A$ by ${\frak m}_A$, its residue field by $k_A$, and similarly for $B$. Thus ${\frak m}_A = (t_A)$ and ${\frak m}_B = (t_B)$ with $t_B = u t_A^r$, where $u\in A^\times$ is a unit. By hypothesis there is a transcendence basis $\bar f_1,\dotsc, \bar f_{n-1}$ of $k_B$ over $k$ such that the extension $k_B/k(\bar f_1,\dotsc,\bar f_{n-1})$ is separable (hence has no relative differentials). Choose lifts $f_1,\dotsc, f_{n-1}\in B$ of the elements of this transcendence basis. Looking at the exact sequence \begin{equation*} {\frak m}_B/{\frak m}_B^2 \xrightarrow{d} \Omega_B \otimes k_B \to \Omega_{k_B} \to 0 \end{equation*} and applying Nakayama we see that the map $B^{\oplus n} \to \Omega_B$ that sends \begin{equation*} e_i \mapsto \begin{cases} df_i & \text{if }i\le n-1\\ dt_B & \text{if }i = n \end{cases} \end{equation*} is surjective. Let $K$ denote its kernel. Then $\operatorname{Tor}_1^B(\Omega_B,k_B)$ surjects onto $K\otimes_B k_B$. From the fact that $\Omega_B$ is free, it follows that $K=0$. Thus the free $B$-module $\Omega_B$ has $df_1,\dotsc, df_{n-1}, dt_B$ as a basis. From the fact that $k_A/k_B$ is separable, it follows that $k_A/k(\bar f_1,\dotsc, \bar f_{n-1})$ is as well, so by the preceding argument the free $A$-module $\Omega_A$ has $df_1,\dotsc, df_{n-1}, dt_A$ as a basis. The relative differentials $\Omega_{A/B}$ are thus the quotient of $\Omega_A$ by the submodule generated by $df_1,\dotsc, df_{n-1}, dt_B$. Denote by $M$ the itermediate quotient of $\Omega_A$ by $df_1,\dotsc, df_{n-1}$. Then $M$ is freely generated by the image of $dt_A$. Write \begin{equation*} dt_B = t_A^r du + u r t_A^{r-1} dt_A \end{equation*} in $\Omega_A$. In $M$ we have $du = f dt_A$ for some $f\in A$, so $dt_B = u' t_A^{r-1}dt_A$, for some $u'\in A$. From the fact that $r\ne 0$ in $k$, it follows that $u'$ is a unit. Hence the map \begin{equation*} A/(t_A^{r-1}) \xrightarrow{\cdot dt_A} \Omega_{A/B} \end{equation*} is an isomorphism and $\operatorname{length}_A \Omega_{A/B} = r-1$ as claimed. 

First of all, by Morse theory you know that $\mathcal{M}^+$ is obtained by attaching an $m$-cell to $\mathcal{M}^-$, i.e. $\mathcal{M}^+=\mathcal{M}^-\cup_{\phi}e$, where $e=D^m$ is an $m$-cell and $\phi:\partial(e)=S^{m-1}\to \mathcal{M}^-$ is some attaching map. Therefore you can compute $H^{\*}(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)$ by excision (you excise $\mathcal{M}^-\setminus\phi(S^{m-1})$), and get that $H^{\*}(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)\simeq H^{\*}(D^m,S^{m-1})$ that has exactly one nonzero cohomology in degree $m$. As for the second question, I think it's more intuitive looking at homology (it's the same since we are looking at coefficients in a field). There you have the sequence $0\to H_m(\mathcal{M}^-)\to H_m(\mathcal{M}^+)\to H_m(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)\stackrel{\partial}{\to} H_{m-1}(\mathcal{M}^-)\to M_{m-1}(\mathcal{M}^+)\to 0$. Moreover, the generator of the unique nonzero class of $H_m(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)$ can be thought of the fundamental class $[e]$ of the cell you attached, and $\partial[e]=\phi_*[\partial e]$. In other words, the boundary operator sends $[e]$ essentially to the class of its topological boundary. If $\partial[e]=0$, it means that $\phi_{\*}[\partial e]$ is a boundary in $\mathcal{M}^-$, i.e. there exists an $m$-cycle $e_-$ entirely contained in $\mathcal{M}^-$ such that $\partial[e]=\partial[e_-]$. In particular $\partial[e-e_-]=0$ and you can say that $e$ can be completed to a cycle, contained in $\mathcal{M}^-$ away from the critical point}. Think of the usual example of the torus, with the morse function being the heigth $z$. Let $p_1$ be the second critical point (the first critical point of index one) with critical value $z_1$, let $\mathcal{M}^-=z^{-1}([0,z_1-\epsilon])$ and $\mathcal{M}^+=z^{-1}([0,z_1+\epsilon])$. Then $\mathcal{M}^+$ is obtained by attaching a $1$-cell $e$, that is a little segment passing through $p_1$ and "going down". Its boundary $\partial[e]$ is just two points in $\mathcal{M}^-$. You can check that $\partial:H_{1}(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)\to H_0(\mathcal{M}^-)$ is zero, and in fact $\partial[e]$ is the boundary of an arc $e_-$ entirely contained in $\mathcal{M^-}$ (for example the arc through the minimum point). it's quite clear that we just "completed" $[e]$ to a cycle $[e]-[e_-]$ (that you can see as a closed nontrivial closed curve in the torus) that is "almost entirely contained in $\mathcal{M}^-$ away from the critical point. If $\partial\neq 0$, this means that we are killing some cohomology, that we created at some point before. Take for example the sphere $S^2$, embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the shape of a "$\bigcap$", and again with $z$ as a Morse function (just wiggle it a bit so that the two minima have different values). Then from bottom-up, you first see two index $0$ points (the two minima), that give you two 0-cells. Then, as you go to the third critical point (the first critical point of index 1), you notice that $\partial \neq 0$ and so the contribution of that critical point is to kill something we created before. In some sense then, this morse function is not "efficient", in the sense that creates too many critical points, that will be killed later anyways. An "efficient" Morse function only creates critical points when they really contribute to the homology of the space. "Efficient" Morse functions are called perfect. Here is the formal definition of perfect morse function: as you said, every critical point of index $m$, might give rise to at most one new generator of $H_{\*}(\mathcal{M}_+)$. So if $c_m$ denotes the number of critical points of index $m$, we have that $c_m\geq \dim H_{\_*}(M)$, where $M$ is our manifold. The Morse function is called perfect if the inequality above is an equality, for every $m$. 

Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, and let $$ F=(P_1,\ldots, P_m):\mathbb{K}^n\to \mathbb{K}^m $$ be a polynomial map. I would like to know under what conditions the preimages $F^{-1}(y)$ of $F$ depend continuously on $y\in Im(F)\subset\mathbb{K}^m$, with respect to the Hausdorff topology. For example, this holds when $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$, and $P_1,\ldots P_k$ generate the algebra of polynomials invariant under the action of some compact group $G\subset O(n)$. However, I do not even know if the condition holds in the complex setting (i.e., $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$ and $G$ complex reductive group). Although my interest is closely related to the group action case, I am primarily looking for conditions on the algebra generated by $P_1,\ldots, P_n$. Any reference would be welcome! 

Let's consider the domain $U=[-\pi,\pi]\times[-1,1]$. Assume that we have two functions $f\in H^2$ and $g\in H^{1/2}$. I wonder if the following bound is true: $$ \|f g_{x_1}\|_{H^{-0.5}(U)}\leq C(\|f\|_{H^2})\|g\|_{H^{1/2}}.\quad (1) $$ I tried using the duality pairing. Then, for a given $h\in H^{1/2}$ with $\|h\|_{H^{1/2}}\leq 1$, we have $$ \langle fg_{x_1},h\rangle_{<H^{-1/2},H^{1/2}>}=\int_{-1}^{1}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} fg_{x_1}hdx_1dx_2=- \int_{-1}^{1}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} |D|^{1/2}(f h)|D|^{1/2}Hgdx_1dx_2, $$ where I used the notation $H$ for the (periodic) Hilbert transform in the variable $x_1$ and $|D|u=H u_{x_1}$, i.e. $$ |D|=\sqrt{-\frac{d^2}{dx_1^2}}. $$ Then, $$ \int_{-1}^{1}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} |D|^{1/2}(f h)|D|^{1/2}Hgdx_1dx_2\leq \|fh\|_{H^{1/2}(U)}\|g\|_{H^{1/2}(U)}. $$ So, if multiplication by a $H^2(U)$ function is a continuous operator in $H^{1/2}$, i.e. $$ \|fh\|_{H^{1/2}(U)}\leq C\|f\|_{H^2(U)}\|h\|_{H^{1/2}(U)},\quad (2) $$ then, the previous bound (1) would hold. Consequently, my questions are A) Is (1) true? B) Is (2) true? PD: Note that $f$ is not Lipschitz (otherwise, I will have the desired result). 

Certainly the size of the domain can play a role. For the classical case $$ \partial_t u=\partial_x^2 u+u^2, \text{ $x$ in }[-L,L] $$ with Dirichlet BC I recomend Evan's book (Chapter 9, I think). in this case the condition for blow up is that the initial data projected on the first eigenfunction should be larger that the first eigenvalue. As the eigenvalue/eigenfunction depends on the size of the domain this size plays a role. For another example, let's define $$ \sqrt{-\partial_x^2}u(x)=\int_{-L}^L \frac{u(x)-u(x-y)}{y^2}dy. $$ If we consider a $L-$periodic solution to $$ \partial_t u=-\sqrt{-\partial_x^2} u+u^2, \text{ $x$ in }[-L,L] $$ with positive initial data of fixed mean equal to 1, we have $$ \frac{d}{dt}\|u\|_{L^\infty}\leq (1-C/L)\|u\|_{L^\infty}^2, $$ and we obtain that hte size plays a role again. I don't know if this clarify something. 

For the sake of simplicity, let me pick $f(u_x)=\frac{1}{2}u_x^2$ and $u_0\in H^5$. We have that, in the new variable $f=u_x$, the equation reads $$ f_t-\alpha f_{xx}-\beta f_{xxx}=ff_x $$ We have that $$ \frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dt}\|f\|_{L^2}^2+\alpha\|f_x\|_{L^2}^2=0, $$ so $$ \|f(t)\|_{L^2}^2+2\alpha\int_0^t\|f_{x}\|_{L^2}^2ds\leq \|f(0)\|_{L^2}^2. $$ If we test the equation against $-f_{xx}$, then $$ \frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dt}\|f_x\|_{L^2}^2+\alpha\|f_{xx}\|_{L^2}^2\leq \frac{1}{2\alpha}\|ff_x\|_{L^2}^2+\frac{\alpha}{2}\|f_{xx}\|_{L^2}^2. $$ Using that $$ \|ff_x\|_{L^2}^2\leq \|f\|_{L^4}^2\|f_x\|_{L^4}^2\leq C\|f\|_{H^{0.25}}^2\|f\|_{H^{1.25}}^2\leq C\|f\|_{L^2}^{3/2}\|f_{x}\|_{L^2}^{1/2}\|f_x\|_{L^2}^{3/2}\|f_{xx}\|_{L^2}^{1/2}, $$ thus, $$ \|ff_x\|_{L^2}^2\leq C\|f_{x}\|_{L^2}^{4}+\frac{\alpha}{2}\|f_{xx}\|_{L^2}^{1/2}. $$ Using Gronwall and the finiteness of $\int_0^t\|f_{x}\|_{L^2}^2ds$, we conclude. In this way, you can get a priori estimates for any Sobolev norm. After that you can just mollify your equation appropriately and pass to the limit in the approximate problems. 

I've encountered the following sequences $$ a_k=2^{k+1}\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}a_{k-1-j}a_j,\;a_0=1 $$ $$ b_k=(k+1)\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}b_{k-1-j}b_j,\;b_0=1. $$ I would like to have an estimate of the growth of these sequences as $k$ grows. After looking here and there, I found the Catalan's numbers defined by $$ C_k=\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}C_{k-1-j}C_j,\;C_0=1. $$ They have an asymptotic growth of $$ C_k=2^{k+1}k^{-3/2}. $$ I tried (unsuccesfully) to manipulate my original series to recover some form of the Catalan's numbers. Any idea is very welcome. 

I don't know if this is useful, but anyway: Let's compute $$ \partial_t \partial_x u=\partial_x u\partial_x^2 u+u\partial_x^3u, $$ and $$ \partial_t \partial_x^2 u=\partial_x^2 u\partial_x^2 u+\partial_x u\partial_x^3u+\partial_x u\partial_x^3 u+u\partial_x^4u. $$ Now notice that if $u_0(x_0)=0$ then $u(t,x_0)=0$ as long as the solution remains $C^2$. Assume that we have a non-negative initial data such that there exists $x_0$ such that $u_0(x_0)=0$. Then $x_0$ is a point of minimum ($\partial_x u(x_0,t)=0$) and $u(x_0,t)=0$. The equation evaluated at this point is $m(t)=\partial_x^2 u(x_0,t)$ with ODE $$ m'(t)=m(t)^2, $$ and this ODE has finite time lifespan. Thus, the classical solution is not global. 

Well, I'm not sure if I got your question correctly. If I understood apropriately, you are asking for real life models where the test functions have restrictions as being divergence/curl free. Fluid dynamics is one of the fields where this restriction appear, not only on the solution, but also on the test function. Check the book "Navier-Stokes Equations and Turbulence" by Foias, Manly, Rosa and Temam for instance. Let me also copy the link to the appropriate page (the page is in google books) $URL$
