In dynamic programming, the method of undetermined coefficients is sometimes known as "guess and verify." I've periodically heard there are canonical guesses one might make. In particular, I've seen $V(k) = A + B\ln(k)$ $V(k) = \frac{Bk^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}$ The former applies to log utility while the latter is related to CRRA preferences. What other canonical guesses exist, and are these generally tied to the particular form of the return function? Edit: For those not familiar with dynamic programs, what we're trying to do here is come up with closed-forms for the coefficients (e.g. $A$ and $B$). To over-simplify, the functional equation typically takes the generic form $V(k) = \max\bigl\{F(k,u) +\beta V\bigl(g(k,u)\bigr)\bigr\}$, where $g(\cdot,\cdot)$ describes the evolution of the state variable $k$. Essentially, the value of being in state $k$ today depends on today's return function $F(k,u)$ and some discounted value of whatever $k$ is going to be tomorrow $\beta V\bigl(g(k,u)\bigr)$. $u$ represents whatever other non-state variables you think influence the return. Sometimes it's possible to get a closed-form solution for $V(k)$ (...note: we don't just solve for $V(k)$ since the right-hand side is a maximized quantity). This typically involves knowing something about the return function $F(k,u)$ and then making a guess about the functional form of $V(k)$. We can then iterate to see if our guess yields a closed-form solution for $V(k)$. In particular, this would include closed-forms for the coefficients in the guess (hence the method of undetermined coefficients). 

Here's a non-technical answer: Bonds are a form of debt. What the issuer is selling is essentially a promise to repay the principal (i.e. whatever price the buyer paid) and some interest to the buyer. (Note: since we're talking about debt, you could also think of the buyer as a lender.) In return, the issuer gets to use the money from the sale for whatever current projects needed funding in the first place. Skirting some technical stuff, assume the yield is the same thing as the interest rate. When lenders think there's a higher risk of not getting their money back, they'll either 1) not lend in the first place, or 2) if they do lend, demand higher a higher interest rate to compensate them for the higher probability of not getting repaid. When someone downgrades your credit, it's a statement about you: they believe you're at a higher risk of not fulfilling your promise to repay the lender. So any lender that does decide to take a risk and loan you money (i.e. buy your bond) is going to be in situation #2 above: they'll demand you pay more interest on the loan (here, higher bond yield) to compensate them for your riskiness. That makes borrowing more expensive for you since you now have to pay a higher interest rate than you would have if you had better credit. Rollovers are a type of reinvestment. At the heart of the matter, credit downgrades happen when lenders lose faith in your ability to fulfill your promises. This happens for a multitude of reasons. As an example, S&P's 2011 downgrade of U.S. debt happened because they believed 1) that the pattern of running deficits most years might eventually put the U.S. at risk of not repaying (that is, the debt-to-GDP ratio might not be sustainable), and 2) that political leaders lacked a credible plan to tackle the problem. 

So if they can find another customer, they can get back to where they started before you made the early payment. That's not an advantage, that's an opportunity to break even. 

The fundamental reason, beyond any details about shifting interest rates, is that lenders are in the business of lending money. If you pay off the loan early, then they're doing less business. If you pay off part of the loan, you're paying less interest, which means they have to go out and find another source of income to replace you. Extreme case, suppose you pay off the full loan the very first day, and they don't charge any fees, it's as if they never made a loan at all. They could have stayed in bed. The thought of getting out of bed for nothing makes them so angry (I exaggerate) that they may well charge fees for early repayments and/or setting up the loan in the first place, to ensure that (aside from being paid for their capital) they still get paid for their time. You can think of early repayment fees as making up for any part of the cost of their time that they rolled into the interest rate, although that's not all there is to it. Addressing your specific points: 

If they wanted to avoid risk then they could not lend money to you in the first place. They made the loan because they think the interest rate in return for the risk is a good deal. You're ending something they thought was a good deal for them. Lenders do like people who've demonstrated that they can pay off loans, but mainly because it proves that they might be able to take bigger loans in future and generate more income for the lender. What lenders really want, above all else, is the interest[*]. And who they like, most of all, is people who borrow money from them and make the payments. If you pay off early, you're not that person any more. So, why do they even let you make early payments? Firstly because in many cases the law says so, and secondly because they have to offer customers enough flexibility that they'll actually take the deal. This is all in general, of course. There might be specific circumstances where a lender does have a liquidity problem and does want to solve it (in part) by taking as many early repayments as they can. But that's akin to a retailer solving a short-term problem by closing stores: if the solution to your problem is "do less business" then things are pretty bad. Speaking of the market in general rather than retail lending in particular, there are loans that can't be repaid early under the terms that banks might offer for personal loans. For example, a government acting as a borrower can buy back its bonds on the market, but the terms of the bond don't (usually?) allow it to just "pay off the loan early" by requiring the bold holders (lenders) to give them back in return for the bond's face value. They have to pay the market price. [*] For a while they used to like above all else the ability to trade and use as capital reserve, obscure derivatives of the loans, for prices and ratings that amounted to a wild-ass-guess and therefore in many cases were way too high ;-) That became suddenly less respectable in 2008. 

Your errors aren't the same anymore. For example, instead of writing $Y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X + U$, you're actually writing $Y = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 X + \alpha_3 X^2 + V$. There is no expectation that they should be the same. In other areas, the trouble is that the error term is likely correlated with your regressors. Fear not: running wages on education is a common specification. Searching for something like 

It sounds like you've basically eyeballed the groups to decide they're similar. A more advanced way of eyeballing would be to plot the distribution of each characteristic to see how similar they look. In order to move beyond eyeballing, though, you'd need recourse to statistics. One common method--that comes up frequently in two-group studies--is to do a statistical test to verify that the groups are similar. Broadly speaking, you'd look at each characteristic, say height, and assert your hypothesis: average height is the same in both groups. Then you could do a hypothesis test to see if the average height is actually the same or if it's different. The specific statistical test you'd use depends on the data in your possession. For example, see the t-test or the chi-squared test for a difference in means (or just search for "difference in means test"). You'd run the test (statistical software generally has a feature like this) to determine if it shows a significant difference. If so, you might be comfortable saying the groups are not similar inasmuch as that characteristic (height) is concerned. Then you'd repeat the procedure for weight and each of the other characteristics. At the end, many researchers make a little table that shows the $p$-values (which you get from running the test) for each of the characteristics. This gives your readers the ability to see and decide for themselves whether the groups are similar.
