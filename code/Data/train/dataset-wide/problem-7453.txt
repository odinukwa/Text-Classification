For instance, I am sure that $Z$ cannot be finite, but can it be Dedekind finite ? Must it be "big" in any appropriate sense ? 

The reverse implication can be proved as follows: first notice that $\forall n\in Z$ $AC(\{n\})$ implies $AC(\{p\})$ for each prime $p$. Then, apply the following general result (Theorem 7.15 in Jech's book): 

Any Lindelöf non-metrizable Hausdorff space will do (EDIT: you need that the space is C-closed as well, see below), but more generally, a space is called isocompact iff every closed countably compact subset of X is compact, cl-isocompact iff the closure of a countably compact subset is compact, and C-closed iff any countably compact subset is closed. This paper by Cho and Park contains various results on (cl)-isocompactess, as well a other references: $URL$ And this one by Ismail and Nyikos has good informations on C-closed spaces: $URL$ 

There is a maximal connected Hausdorff topology for the reals, according to this paper of Guthrie, Stone and Wage. I haven't read it, some googling led me to the paper "Problems on (ir)resolvability" of Oleg Pavlov in "Open problems in Topology II" which lists some open questions and cites the above paper (among others). 

It seems that the counting of elements in $S_i$ can be made in the same way as the counting of those in $S$. For simplicity, I rename $y=r$, $z=\hat b$. Let $T=\{k<a\}\setminus S$. Then it is easy to see that $$ S=\left\{k<a\colon \left\{k\cdot \frac{py}{px}\right\}+\left\{k\cdot \frac{z}{pr}\right\} =1+\left\{k\cdot \frac{py+z}{px}\right\}\right\} $$ and $$ T=\left\{k<a\colon \left\{k\cdot \frac{py}{px}\right\}+\left\{k\cdot \frac{z}{pr}\right\} =\left\{k\cdot \frac{py+z}{px}\right\}\right\}. $$ Thus, $$ |S|=\sum_{k<a}\left\{k\cdot \frac{py}{px}\right\} +\sum_{k<a}\left\{k\cdot \frac{z}{px}\right\} -\sum_{k<a}\left\{k\cdot \frac{py+z}{px}\right\}. $$ Similarly, $$ |S_i|=\Sigma_i(py)+\Sigma_i(z)-\Sigma_i(py+z), \qquad \text{where}\quad \Sigma_i(d)=\sum_{k<a,k\equiv i\pmod p}\left\{k\cdot \frac{d}{px}\right\}. \qquad(*) $$ Now let $d$ be any integer. Set $\mu=\gcd(d,x)$, $d'=d/\mu$, $x'=x/\mu$ and choose $j<p$ with $id'\equiv j\pmod p$. When $k$ runs over the numbers congruent to $i$ modulo $p$, the residue of $kd'=id'+(k-i)d'$ modulo $px'$ runs over all the numbers of the form $j+p\ell$ with $\ell<x'$. Then we have \begin{align*} \Sigma_i(d)&=\sum_{k<a,k\equiv i\pmod p}\left\{\frac{kd'}{px'}\right\} =\mu\sum_{\ell=0}^{x'-1}\frac{j+p\ell}{px'} =\frac{\mu j}p+\mu\cdot\frac{x'-1}2=\frac{\mu j}p+\frac{x-\mu}2. \qquad (**) \end{align*} Return to $(*)$. Using $\gcd(py+z,x)=\gcd(z,x)=1$ and $iz\equiv i(py+z)\pmod p$, from $(**)$ we get $\Sigma_i(py+z)=\Sigma_i(z)$. Thus from $(*)$ and $(**)$ we obtain \begin{align*} |S_i|=\Sigma_i(py) =\frac{x-\gcd(py,x)}2, \end{align*} as required. 

$\def\conv{\mathop{\rm conv}}$Your condition is almost sufficient. Let $g\colon S^1\to S^{n-1}$ be the given path on the sphere. The `no half-sphere' condition tells that $0$ lies in the convex hull of $g(S^1)$ (if a half-shpere is open) of that $0$ lies in the interior of $g(S^1)$ (if a half-sphere is closed). The latter condition is not necessary for a path lying in a hyperplane (but then we may pass to a subspace!). The former one is not sufficient: if $0$ lies on the boundary of $\conv(g(S^1))$, but the interior of this convex hull is nonempty, then a required path does not exist. So, let us assume that $\mathop{\rm lin}(g(S^1))$ is the whole space; then the necessary condition is that $0$ lies in the interior of $\conv(g(S^1))$. Let us show that it is also sufficient. To perform this, we need to find a positive smooth density function $p$ on $S^1$ (say, parametrized by angle) such that $$ \int_{0}^{2\pi}p(x)g(x)\,dx=0; $$ then $S^1\ni t\mapsto \int_0^t p(x)g(x)\,dx$ is a required path. But the set of values of such integrals is convex and meets any neighborhood of any point on $g(S^1)$; thus it covers the whole interior of $\conv(g(S^1))$. 

They are different since there is (for instance) a model of $\forall n\in \omega$ $AC(\{n\})$ which does not satisfy $AC(\omega)$, see Theorem 7.11 in Jech's "The axiom of Choice". Notice that $AC(Z)\Rightarrow\forall n\in Z$ $AC(\{n\})$ and if $Z$ is finite, then of course both are equivalent. Will Sawin gave the correct answer for Question 1: 

Let $T$ be a Suslin tree and $f:T\to Y$ be continuous. ($T$ is endowed with the order topology.) Assume that the image of $T$ is contained in a Lindelöf subset of $Y$. Then, force with $T$. Which properties of $f$ and/or $Y$ ensure that the image of $T$ is still contained in a Lindelöf subset of $Y$ in the forcing extension ? I know that spaces which remain Lindelöf after a countably closed forcing are called indestructibly Lindelöf and have been recently well studied. The preservation of Lindelöfness after adding Cohen or random reals has also been investigated, with some interesting results. It might be that some of these results hold as well when one forces with a Suslin tree, but I must admit that my knowledge of forcing is not very "hands on" and I am not able to see quickly if this is the case. My motivation is to try to extend an old result of Steprans which says that a continuous real valued map on a Suslin tree has a countable image. 

You want positive integer solutions. Necessary conditions are that you can solve the first equation for c and the second for d. The discriminants must be squares, so 1+36*a^2-12*a+36*b^2-12*b = square1 1+36*a^2-12*a-36*b^2+12*b = square2 whereas one expects this to give an elliptic curve, it also allows for a quick and dirty computer search. Searching, I found quite a few integer solutions, but in the range 0 < a < 4001 and 0 < b < 4001 there was only one positive integer solution: (a,b,c,d) = (2167,1020,2395,1912) 

Edit: perhaps my header question was something of a troll. I am not interested in lists. But if anyone could shed light on the answers to the portion of my question starting with "E.g.". it would be appreciated. (I could answer it in 1990, but what is the status today?) 

There is George Hart's online Encyclopedia of Polyhedra, which is not a database but is very likely something you will want to consult. Also not a database, but something you should surely know about if you intend to create one, is the software program called Great Stella. There is a free version and a commercial version (use google). Originally intended to allow to you to create stellations (as for example "The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra" of Coxeter et al) for any polyhedron, and visualize, generate nets, duals etc, this program is now much larger containing information about and the ability to manipulate literally hundreds of polyhedra including Platonic, Archimedean, Kepler-Poinsot, convex prisms and antiprisms, Johnson solids, "near misses (of Johnson solids)", Stewart toroids, compounds, geodesic domes, all uniform polyhedra, zonohedra, Waterman polyhedra, Bruckner polyhedra, rectangular isohedra, duals, nets, facetings, stellations, and much more. 

Your property implies in particular: "Every nowhere dense closed subset of $X$ is compact." (A nowhere dense closed subset is the boundary of its complement.) This in turn is equivalent to compactness for $T_1$ spaces with no isolated points, as shown by Katetov in 1947. Interestingly, the result holds as well for Lindelöf spaces, or more generally for $[\lambda,\kappa]$-compact spaces (a space is $[\lambda,\kappa]$-compact if every cover of it by $\le\kappa$ open sets has a subcover of cardinality $<\lambda$). This is due to Mills and Wattel, a very nice short proof can be found in Blair's "Some nowhere densely generated topological properties" (easily found online). Completely unaware of these results, I actually recently published a paper whose main result is weaker than Mills and Wattel's, and with a more complicated proof than Blair's. 

As I wrote in my comments, D.N. Sarkhel constructs such examples in Section 4 of "Some generalizations of countable compactness" (Indian J. pure appl. math 17 (6), 1986). It works as follows. Fix some $n\ge 2$. Take a partition of $[0,1]$ into pairwise disjoint dense subsets $A_i$, $i = 1,\dots, 2n$. If $x\in[0,1]$ there is a unique $n(x)$ such that $x\in A_{n(x)}$. Then set $E_i=A_i$ when $i$ is odd and $E_i = A_{i-1}\cup A_i\cup A_{i+1}$ if $i$ is even, where $A_{2n+1} = A_{2n}$. Then $G$ is open if for each $x\in G$ there is an interval $I(x)$ such that $x\in I(x) \cap E_{n(x)} \subset G$. Sarkhel proves on page 782 that this space is Hausdorff and $n$-star compact but not $n-1$-star compact. It is not possible to obtain regular such spaces since $2$-star compactness is equivalent to $n$-star compactness for any $n\ge 2$ in this class, and to pseudocompactness in the class of Tychonoff spaces. This is shown by van Douwen, Reed, Roscoe and Tree in "Star covering properties" (top. app. 39 issue 1, 1991). 

Here is a bit more pedestrian argument. We may assume that $p_i$ are irreducible. Take $\alpha_i$ a root of $p_i$; then $\mathbb Q[\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n]=\mathbb Q[\xi]$ by the primitive element theorem. Taking $q$ to be the monic minimal polynomial of $\xi$, we have $\alpha_i=r_i(\xi)$, so $q(x)\mid p_i(r_i(x))$. Now we may take any prime divisor $p$ of the values of $q$ which does not appear in the denominators of the coefficients of $q$ and $r_i$; $p$ divides appropriate values of $p_i$ as well. 

This was an answer to a previous version of the question, when $H$ was not claimed to be a tree. It is well-known that a maximal number of edges in a $C_4$-free graph is $\Theta(n^{3/2})$ (since every pair of vertices is connected by at most one path of length 2, so the average square of a vertex degree is at most $\Theta(n)$; this is reached, e.g., by the incidence graph of a projective plane). Thus the conjecture fails for $H=C_4$, $T=K_2$. 

Perhaps this is not what you want, because I do not realize which restrictions you put on ``infinite sums''. They are not defined in a usual semiring, so right now I assume that you merely wish all the elements $a^*$ to exist. In order to fulfill the third condition you simply need that $2^*+1^*=2^*$. Here is one of the ways to perform this. Let $S=\{0\}\cup (\mathbb R_{>0}\times \mathbb R)$. Zero is isolated, so the operations with it are trivial. For all other elements, we put $(a,b)\cdot (c,d)=(ac,b+d)$ and $$ (a,b)+(c,d)=\begin{cases} (a,b), & b>d;\\ (c,d), & b<d;\\ (a+c,b), &b=d. \end{cases} $$ This is a semifield, $(1,0)$ is multiplicative identity, and $\{0\}\cup (\mathbb R_{>0}\times\{0\})$ is a subsemifield isomorphic to the probability semiring. Now we may define $a^*$ as $(1,a)$. 

I believe that $\omega_1$ with the order topology is a counter example. Call a subset of $\omega_1$ bounded if it is contained in some initial interval $[0,\alpha]$ and unbounded otherwise. Lemma: Any cover of $\omega_1$ by bounded open subsets is not minimal. I am sure that this is standard, but here is a proof. It contains way too many notations and is a bit clumsy, I am afraid, but I hope it is readable. We can assume that such a cover is is of cardinality $\omega_1$. Let thus $\mathcal{V} = \{V_\alpha\,:\,\alpha\in\omega_1\}$ be a cover of $\omega_1$ by bounded open subsets. By a standard argument the sets below are closed and unbounded in $\omega_1$: \begin{align*} C_1 &= \{\alpha\,:\, \cup_{\beta<\alpha} V_\beta\subset[0,\alpha)\}\\ C_2 &= \{\alpha\,:\, \cup_{\beta<\alpha} V_\beta\supset[0,\alpha)\} \end{align*} Hence their intersection $C = \{\alpha\,:\, \cup_{\beta<\alpha} V_\beta =[0,\alpha)\}$ is closed and unbounded as well. We may assume that each member of $C$ is a limit ordinal. When $\alpha\in \omega_1$, let $\alpha^*$ denote the smallest element of $C$ which is $>\alpha$. For each $\alpha\in C$ choose $V_{s(\alpha)}\ni\alpha$ with $s(\alpha)\in[\alpha,\alpha^*)$. Since $V_{s(\alpha)}$ is open and $\alpha$ is limit, $V_{s(\alpha)}$ contains some interval $[\gamma(\alpha),\alpha]$. By Fodor's Lemma, there is some $\gamma\in\omega_1$ such that the set $S$ of $\alpha\in C$ such that $\gamma(\alpha) = \gamma$ is stationary and in particular unbounded. For any $\alpha\in S$ with $\alpha>\gamma^*$, $V_{s(\alpha)}$ contains in particular the interval $[\gamma^*,\alpha]$. Fix now $\eta\in[\gamma^*,\gamma^{**})$. Choose $\alpha \ge \gamma^{**}$ in $S$. Then $$ V_\eta \subset V_{s(\alpha)} \cup \left(\cup_{\beta<\gamma^*}V_\beta\right). $$ Notice that $\gamma^*\le\eta<\alpha\le s(\alpha)$, hence the indices in the union at the righthand side do not contain $\eta$. It follows that $\cup (\mathcal{V} \backslash \{V_\eta\}) = \omega_1$. Corollary: The cover of $\omega_1$ by the intervals $[0,\alpha]$, $\alpha\in\omega_1$, has no refinement that is a minimal cover.
