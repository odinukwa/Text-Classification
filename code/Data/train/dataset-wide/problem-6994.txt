I have a very general question. I am reading this paper : $URL$ There is a catastrophic event probability and after the catastrophic event the consumption level is reduced to zero. However, authors are making a steady state analysis prior to the catastrophic event. The catastrophic event probability is $h\left(X\right)$ (let s say that it follows a Poisson process.) $X$ stands for the pollution for example. Let $T$ be the event occurrence time and denote $F\left(t\right)=Pr\left\{ T\leq t\right\}$ and $f\left(t\right)=F^{'}\left(t\right)$ as the corresponding probability distribution and density functions respectively. $$h\left(S\left(t\right)\right)\Delta=\frac{f\left(t\right)\Delta}{1-F\left(t\right)}=-\frac{d\left[ln\left(1-F\left(t\right)\right)\right]}{dt}$$ where $\Delta$ is an infinitesimal time interval. The term $h\left(S\left(t\right)\right)\Delta$ specifies the conditional probability that an abrupt event will occur between $\left[t,t+\Delta\right]$. My question is that : Due to this specification, the probability distribution function will be equal to 1 when $t$ tends to $\infty$. Then, in this case, for sure that catastrophic event will occur at the long run. So, how is it possible to discuss about a steady state with catastrophic events ? At some moment in time, the economy will change regime with the catastrophic event and this steady state will not be a "permanent" one. How can it be possible to justify this ? 

One of the very fast explanation would be made by canonical growth model of Robert Solow. In this model, the countries with different levels of saving converge to their own steady state (convergence clubs), which means that countries with different savings rate would have different steady states. (so the capital level $K$ and income level $Y$ would be different.) In this case, with capital accumulation, there would be an income inequality. This can be a basic theoretical explanation. Also, there exists some growth models with technological progress. For example, the South-North economic model. Basically, north is supposed to create the technology by investing in high-tech and there exists some spillovers from North countries to South countries. (You can easily find the formal mathematical model in literature.) By this simple model, there exists a divergence of economies in terms of their steady state levels of capital and income. Also, there exists another recent findings of Thomas Piketty which states the famous equality $r>g$ which says that interest rates have been higher than the growth rates of economies, which basically states that people having money have earned more money. Edit : All points mentionned above is about the inequality between countries but at some point, the inequality between countries could also explain the inequality within country. As between countries, inequality rises, probably, inequality rises in a one country (US or other). Because the inequality in my explanation stems from capital accumulation. So, it is straightforward to say that, people in a given country, having more savings make investment, accumulate capital and this could probably increase income inequality between capital holders (who have savings) and workers (who have not sufficient savings for investment in technology, machines etc.) Also, there will be some cycles. People having interest rate from their capital will invest these interests in other investments again from which they could increase more their wealth (I mean capital from wealth.) This also will create more income inequality within a country and I think this explanation is valid not only for US but also for other countries. 

Normally, in the very basic endogeneous model of growth. It is said that all variables grow at a constant rate. Let's take the basic capital accumulation ; $$\dot{K}=Y-C$$ If I write this in following way ; $$g_{K}=\frac{\dot{K}}{K}=\frac{Y}{K}-\frac{C}{K}$$ Normally, at balanced growth path (BGP), $g_{K}$ grows at a constant value (an arbitrary constant) In this case, this means that variation of $g_{K}$ according to time at BGP should be equal to zero. So ; $$\frac{dg_{K}^{BGP}}{dt}=\left(g_{Y}-g_{K}\right)-\left(g_{C}-g_{K}\right)=0$$ which implies at BGP ; $$g_{Y}=g_{K}=g_{C}$$ Is this reasoning correct ? Because in fact, it seems me weird to differentiate a growth rate $g_{K}$ according to time. 

Another aspect is a little bit about network effect. Suppose for a one moment that there are two researchers, one in USA and another in Asia, having both the same paper, do you really think that two researchers have the same chances to publish in Econometrica or in another top journal ? So, the term of productivity is highly biased by this network effect. It is a little bit close to ChinG's response. People not having chance to publish a very good high impact paper in Econometrica, publish in another good journals like Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, Journal of Economic Theory and etc. For me, a guy publishing in Econometrica being in Europe and another guy in USA with an Econometrica paper are not same. 

In which context did you have this question ? Is it an homework ? It is interesting. What happens with this reparations ? Are they redistributed in the economy by some social system ? the more crucial question is if these reparations make increase savings of people. Also, how this money is redistributed between different social classes ? as propensity to save changes according to social classes, the increase in savings will be different. In the classical solow growth model, countries with different levels of savings will converge to their "own" steady state, which we name as "conditional convergence". So, the long term equilibrium is dependent on the structural characteristics of this economy. In this case, for sure, a country receving huge amounts of money will have another steady state. (by the channel of increase of savings, there could be other structural changes other than changes in savings) 

I try to find the limit of the following expression of a weighted mean of a series of discount rate $\rho_{i}$ Here is the expression ; $$\rho_{\eta}\left(t\right)=\frac{\sum_{i}^{N}\rho_{i}\left(\omega_{i}e^{-\rho_{i}t}\right)^{\frac{1}{\eta}}}{\sum_{i}^{N}\left(\omega_{i}e^{-\rho_{i}t}\right)^{\frac{1}{\eta}}}$$ where $\omega$ is the weight for each $\rho$ and $t$ stands for time and $\eta$ is intertemporal elasticity of substitiution and let's say for $\omega_{i}\rightarrow\rho^{k-1}e^{-\frac{\rho}{\theta}}$ which is so-called Gamma distribution, where $k$ and $\omega$ are shape and scale parameters. Conceptually, I have understood that continuum limit is the case where $N\rightarrow\infty$ and we should approximate the term by a continuum, which is probably an integral but I can not figure out how to find the continuum limit of this expression. Any suggestion or hint ? PS. The question comes from the following paper (page 14, equation 37) : $URL$ 

I think about a dynamic problem where social planner maximizes the following utility ; $$\underset{c\left(t\right)}{max}\int_{0}^{\infty}u\left(c\left(t\right)\right)e^{-\rho t}$$ subject to two constraints $$\dot{K}\left(t\right)=AK\left(t\right)-c\left(t\right)$$ $$\dot{S}\left(t\right)=\left(1-S\left(t\right)\right)S\left(t\right)-\gamma AK\left(t\right)$$ where $S(t)$ and $K(t)$ hold for natural capital (seas, lakes, forests etc.) and physical capital respectively. $c(t)$ represents consumption. In this $AK$ model, physical capital generates some wastes which are harmful to natural resource stock with a constant parameter $\gamma$. This feature is close to Wirl (2004) in environmental economics literature. The Hamiltonian of the problem is $$\mathcal{H}=u\left(c\left(t\right)\right)+\lambda\left(t\right)\left(AK\left(t\right)-c\left(t\right)\right)+\mu\left(t\right)\left(\left(1-S\left(t\right)\right)S\left(t\right)-\gamma AK\left(t\right)\right)$$ $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are co-state variables for physical and natural capital. Dynamics of co-state variables are $$\dot{\lambda}=\rho\lambda+\mu\gamma A-\lambda A$$ $$\dot{\mu}=\rho\mu-\mu\left(1-2S\right)$$ In fact, in this model, it is easy to remark that natural capital don't have any amenity value don't provide any positive utility and it is just like a "sink". As the social planner just takes into account the negative effect of capital accumulation (it creates wastes), I think natural capital enters in this model as a "cost". Then, is it possible to say that $\mu$ could take a negative value as natural capital represents a cost for capital accumulation ? 

You can see the applications in microeconomics. A tiny example could be on elasticity of demand. Let's say $$ D = \frac{tC}{P+t} $$ where $P, t, C$ are respectively price, tax and constant. If you like to see the effect of tax change on demand you can use the difference quotient ; $$\Delta D = \frac{(t + \Delta t C)}{P + t + \Delta t} - \frac{tC}{P + t}$$ I skip the intermediary calculations. This one yields ; $$\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t} = \frac{P.C}{(P+t)^{2}+\Delta t.(P+t)}$$ Hope that it helps. 

I try to simulate a growth model with two state (capital $K$ and resource stock $S$) and two control variables. (consumption $C$ and resource extraction $R$ ) When I try to find steady state from which I could find after the initial conditions for $K_{0}$, $S_{0}$ and $R_{0}$ , $C_{0}$. For $S_{0}=1$ I find a negative value for $K_{0}$ and all other initial conditions are positive. Is that possible ? I think mathematically, a negative initial condition can be fine but economically I have doubts. I have found nothing about this issue on literature. 

Especially, the first one is a great one. Simple and gives the fundamentals of economics. The second one is an intermediate textbook. Personally, I did not read it but as the author is Blanchard, I am pretty sure that it is a great book. 

It depends on what you like to do in environmental economics. There are lots of people who are working on moral hazard issues on environmental economics by principal-agent models. More specifically, an interesting question arises from non-point source pollution. Let's say farmers are using pesticides which cause pollution. Probably, you don't know specifically which of farmers are responsible. How could you create "incentives" in order to avoid this situation(pollution) ? You can look at the Segerson (1988), published in Journal of Environmental Economics and Management in order to understand this issue more precisely. Another field could be about social choice theory (and decision theory) in environmental economics, especially on equity between individuals and generations. These issues can be included in microeconomics but more in applied math as they use topology etc. (Geir Asheim, Stéphane Zuber's papers could be interesing for this subject.) Just to finish, I think there are more things to do in environmental economics at a macroeconomic level. (Note that my opinion could be biased as I am working at macro level.) 

Another reason could be based on the discount factor of people, when people accumulates more capital, they have tendancy to be more patient, which let them to save more and invest more. So, countries with higher initial stock of capital tend to be more patient in this case. This explains in some part why these rich countries remain rich. 

I would rather say no. In an endogenous growth model (like Schumpeterian model), you can have a constant population with a sustained growth rate at long term. An example : $URL$ 

I am asking to myself if we must use a different discount rate on rival and non rival goods. In standard Solow-Swann model, we use generally the discount factor $\rho$. More formally, let's give the workhorse model used in environmental economics. $$max \int_{0}^{\infty} u(c(t),s(t)) e^{-\rho t}$$ where $c(t)$ is consumption (rival good) and $s(t)$ is the environmental quality (or amenities) which is a non rival good by definition. Let's say that $u(c(t),s(t))$ is an additive utility function which could be defined as $$u(c,s)=\frac{c^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}+\frac{s^{1-\phi}}{1-\phi}$$ where $\phi$ and $\sigma$ are elasticities. Also, to be complete, the constraint would be as $$\dot{s}\left(t\right)=-c(t)$$ The question that I ask to myself is why an agent (or social planner) uses the same discount rate for a rival (consumption) and non rival (environmental quality.) ? For example, I have completely different preferences for consumption and environment for future. So, how can I use the same discount $\rho$ ? There is an interesting paper of Endres et al. (2014) where authors use individual and social discount rates which are different. In appendix B. (at page 631 of the paper), they define $A$ and $B$ where they say $A\neq B$ because they say each person treats differently rival and non rival goods. So, is there a big caveat of growth models which contain rival and non rival goods in utility function ? Thanks in advance for your hints.
