Could you state or direct me to results regarding the Diophantine equation $a^2+b^2=c^2+d^2$ over integers? Specifically, I am looking for a complete parametrization. In the case that a complete parametrization does not exist, I would be interested in seeing complete parametrizations for special cases. For example, in the case that any one of the variables is zero, we are led to Pythagorean triples. Taking a variable to be some non-zero constant would be interesting. I'm looking for known results as I am not as familiar with the literature as many MO-ers out there. 

Nearly two months after I asked the above question, I have come across a paper where Noga Alon has given an explicit result in Problems and results in Extremal Combinatorics, Part I in section 9, On ranks of perturbations of identity matrices. He says Lemma 9.1. Let $A = (a_{ij})$ be an $n \times n$ real, symmetric matrix with $a_{ii} = 1$ for all $i$ and $|a_{ij}|\le\epsilon$ for all $i\ne j$. If the rank of $A$ is $d$, then $d\ge \frac{n}{1+(n-1)\epsilon^2}$. In particular, if $\epsilon\le \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ then $d\ge\frac{n}{2}$. His proof is rather pretty. I apply the lemma to the question at hand as follows. Application. Suppose $S$ is an $m\times n$ matrix with row vectors $(s_1,\ldots, s_m)$, an $m$-element subset of $\lbrace\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\rbrace^n$ such that $\forall s_i,s_j\in S: i\ne j\implies |\langle s_i,s_j\rangle|\le\epsilon$. Let $A=(a_{ij})$ be its Gram matrix, which is symmetric $m\times m$ with $a_{ii} = \langle s_i,s_i\rangle = 1$ for all $i$ and $|a_{ij}|=|\langle s_i, s_j \rangle|\le\epsilon$ for all $i\ne j$, and rank $d$. Note that the rank of $S$ also $d$. By the lemma, since $n\ge d$, we get $\boxed{n\ge \frac{m}{1+(m-1)\epsilon^2}}$. Assuming $\epsilon\le \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, some manipulation also yields $\boxed{m\le \frac{n(1-\epsilon^2)}{1-n\epsilon^2}}$. Bill Johnson's reference to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma led me to its Wikipedia page, which had the paper as a reference. 

Suppose we are given two smooth projective varieties $X$ and $Y$ over $k$. Let $D^b(X)$ and $D^b(Y)$ denote the derived category of coherent sheaves. Furthermore let $k\subset L$ be a finite Galois extension of $k$. Suppose there is an equivalence $F:D^b(X\otimes_k L)\rightarrow D^b(Y\otimes_k L)$. If one has an object $\mathcal{T}$ in $D^b(X\otimes_k L)$ that descents i.e. there is an object $\mathcal{K}$ in $D^b(X)$ such that $\pi^*\mathcal{K}\simeq \mathcal{T}$, where $\pi:X\otimes_k L\rightarrow X$ is the projection, does the object $F(\mathcal{T})$ also descent? Maybe this depends on the functor $F$ ? 

For the Grassmannians Kapranov proved that there is a tilting bundle consisting of $\sum^{\lambda}(\mathcal{T})$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is the tautological bundle and $\sum^{\lambda}$ the Schur functor. I want to learn somthing more on Schur functors, especially for sheaves. Does anybody know a good reference ? 

For a linearly reductive Group $G$ over a field $k$ one has that the category of finite dimensional representations of $G$ is semisimple. What can one say about the number of simple representations? For what kind of groups the number is finite? 

Theorem. The Galois group of a quintic polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is $A_5$ if and only if its discriminant is a rational square and its Weber sextic resolvent has no rational root. Question. What are known infinite families of of quintic polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, each with Galois group $A_5$? I am aware of two explicit such families as follows. Example 1. $f(x)=x^5+(5t^2-1)(5x+4)$ for $t\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $t\equiv\pm 1\pmod{21}$. This is Exercise 3.7.2 in the book Generic Polynomials by Jensen, Ledet and Yui. Example 2. $f(x)=x^5+(t^2-5^5)(x-4)$ for non-zero $t\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\forall u\in\mathbb{Q}: t\ne g(u)$ where $g(u)=\frac{(u^3-18u^2+8u-16)(u^3+2u^2+18u+4)}{2u^2(u^2+4)}$. This is from the paper Reducibility and the Galois group of a parametric family of quintic polynomials by Lavallee, Spearman and Williams. Note. Both are all trinomials, presumably because it is easier to construct polynomials with square discriminant when some coefficients vanish. It would be nice to see otherwise. 

When one is given a partition $\lambda=(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_r)$ and a locally free sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on for example a Grassmannian variety one can apply the Schur-functor $\Sigma^{\lambda}(\mathcal{E})$ for some partition $\lambda$. Now take an invertible sheaf $\mathcal{L}$ and my question is: What is $\Sigma^{\lambda}(\mathcal{E}\otimes \mathcal{L})$ in terms of $\Sigma^{\lambda}(\mathcal{E})$ and $\mathcal{L}$ or $\Sigma^{\lambda}(\mathcal{L})$? Is ther a formula for computing Schur-functor of tensorproduct? 

Consider the blowup $X$ of $\mathbb{P}^2$ at a single point $p$. Then, Orlov showed that there is a semiorthogonal decomposition $D^b(X)=\langle e,O_X,O_X(1),O_X(2)\rangle$, where $O_X(i)$ is the pullback of $O_{\mathbb{P}^2}(i)$, and $e$ can be taken to be $i_*O_E(-1)$, where $i:E\rightarrow X$ is the inclusion of the exceptional divisor. The objects $e,O_X(i)$ are in fact all exceptional, so their direct sum should be a tilting object for $D^b(X)$. But I dont see why for example $Ext^k(e,\mathcal{O}_X(i))=0$, for $k>0$ ? 

For a linearly reductive group $G$ over $k$ we consider the bounded derived category of finite dimensional representations $D^b(\mathrm{Repr}(G))$. Is the Grothendick group $K_0(D^b(\mathrm{Repr}(G))$ finitely generated? 

Theorem: In this paper of Frei and Levesque, they correct the proof of a result of Halter-Koch and Stender: Define the real pure algebraic number field $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{Q}(\omega_n)$ for $\omega_n=\sqrt[n]{D^n\pm d}>0$ (the $\pm$ sign is fixed), where $d,D,n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $d|D^n$ and $D^n\pm d$ is not a $k^{\text{th}}$-power positive integer for $k|n$. Let $\epsilon_{n,k}=\frac{(\omega_n-D)^k}{\omega_n^k-D^k}$. Then the set $\{\epsilon_{n,k}: k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}, k|n\}$ is an independent system of units in $\mathbb{K}$. Background: I am looking specifically at computing units of algebraic number fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[p]{t})$ for odd primes $p$ (any infinite family in $t\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, with $p$ fixed). Unfortunately, the above result gives only one unit $\frac{(\omega_p-D)^p}{\omega_p^p-D^p}$. Question: Are there results on obtaining at least one other independent (non-torsion) unit? Note: For irreducible $x^p-t$ there is one real root $\sqrt[p]{t}$ and $p-1$ non-real complex roots $\zeta_p^i \sqrt[p]{t}$ for $i=1,\ldots,p-1$ and $\zeta_p=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{p}}$. Then by Dirichlet's Unit Theorem, the unit rank of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[p]{t})$ is $1+\frac{p-1}{2}-1=\frac{p-1}{2}$. Thus I am especially interested in $p=5$ where there can be at most two independent units. 

Is it possible to say what surfaces occur as minimal models of surfaces of general type with $K_0(S)$ finitely generated and $H^q(S,\Omega^p_S)=0$, for $q\neq p$? 

Kapranov showed that for a quadric $Q$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ there is a tilting bundle. For example if we consider a vector space $V$ of dimension $n=4$ and $\mathbb{P}(V)$ then the tilting bundle is $\mathcal{T}=\mathcal{O}\oplus \mathcal{O}(-1)\oplus \sum_{+}(-2)\oplus\sum_{-}(-2)$. Now $\omega^{\vee}_Q=\mathcal{O}(2)$ so what is $\mathrm{Ext}^k(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{T}\otimes \mathcal{O}(2))$? This should be zero for $k>0$... 

For the Grassmannian $\mathbb{G}(l,V)$ one has for the dual tautological bundle $\mathcal{Q^{\vee}}$: $\mathrm{Hom}(\sum^{\lambda}(\mathcal{Q}^{\vee}),\sum^{\mu}(\mathcal{Q}^{\vee}))=\sum^{(\mu/\lambda)}V^*$. What do we have for $\mathrm{Hom}(\sum^{\lambda}(\mathcal{Q}),\sum^{\mu}(\mathcal{Q}))$? 

Suppose we are given two smooth projective varieties $X$ and $Y$. Maybe this is elementary but what is the Chow ring $CH(X\times Y)$ in terms of $CH(X)$ and $CH(Y)$? 

Conjecturally, for a complete intersection $X$ the group $K_0(X)$ is finitely generated iff $H^{p,q}(X)=0$ for $p≠q$. This holds if and only if $X$ is a quadric, a cubic surface, or an even-dimensional intersection of 2 quadrics (see M. Rapoport, Complément à l'article de P. Deligne "La conjecture de Weil pour les surfaces K3", Inv. math. 15 (1972), 227-236). But Orlov proved that a intersection of two even-dimensional quadrics admits a semiorthogonal decomposition $D^b(X)=\langle \mathcal{O}_X(-d+3),...,\mathcal{O}_X,D^b(C)\rangle$, where $d$ is the dimension of $X$ and $C$ is a hyperelliptic curve. Since $K_0(C)$ is a direct summand of $K_0(X)$ this is not finitely generated in general. Furthermore $D^b(X)$ does not admit a tilting bundle... 

A website ( $URL$ ) says that the $abc$ conjecture implies that there are only finitely many solutions to the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ with $\gcd(x,y,z)=1$ and $n\ge 4$. This one I have proven. Lang's Algebra (p. 196) says that the $abc$ conjecture implies that for all $n$ sufficiently large, there are no solutions to the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ with $x,y,z\ne 0$. This one I have not proven (is it true?). What are the strongest known assertions about Fermat's Last Theorem that follows from the $abc$ conjecture, and how are they proven? I searched the web but people tend to just say vague things like "implies asymptotic version of FLT" and such. 

Definition. An $m\times n$ matrix is said to be a partial Hadamard matrix (let's say PHM) if its entries are chosen from $\lbrace -1, 1 \rbrace$ such that the dot product of each pair of row vectors is $0$. Details. This of course relates to the famous Hadamard conjecture which looks at $m=n$, but I am interested in the weaker $m<n$ case. Specifically, I am wondering about how many distinct $m\times n$ PHM exist given some, say $2$, of the row vectors, up to row permutation - as well as their construction. Questions. What are some good resources on results known about PHM? Are there iconic papers in the field? 

Let $X$ be a smooth complete intersection in $\mathbb{P}^n$. I am searching for literature on the K-theory for $X$? I guess the K-theory is known... 

In the article "Categorical resolution of irrational singularities" of Kuzentsov and Lunts is described how one can glue DG-categories. For this let $\mathcal{D}_1$ and $\mathcal{D}_2$ be two small DG-categories. Now consider a bimodule $\phi\in(\mathcal{D}^{op}_2\otimes \mathcal{D}_1)-dgm$. Then the gluing of these two categories along $\phi$ is denoted by $\mathcal{D}=\mathcal{D}_1\times_{\phi}\mathcal{D}_2$ is defined as follows: Objects are triples $M=(M_1,M_2,\mu)$ with $M_i\in\mathcal{D}_i$ and $\mu\in\phi(M_2,M_1)$. Morphism complex is defined via: $\mathrm{Hom}^k_{\mathcal{D}}(M,N)=\mathrm{Hom}^k_{\mathcal{D}_1}(M_1,N_1)\oplus\mathrm{Hom}^k_{\mathcal{D}_2}(M_2,N_2)\oplus \phi^{k-1}(N_2,M_1)$. Now suppose we consider $\phi^{op}\in(\mathcal{D}^{op}_2\otimes\mathcal{D}_1)^{op}-dgm=(\mathcal{D}^{op}_1\otimes\mathcal{D}_2)-dgm$. Now gluing $\mathcal{D}'=\mathcal{D}_2\times_{\phi^{op}}\mathcal{D}_1$. My question is now: Is it possible to get a DG-functor $F:\mathcal{D}\rightarrow \mathcal{D}'$ in the following way: send $M=(M_1,M_2,\mu)$ to $M'=(M_2,M_1,\mu^{op})$ and anagously for the Morphism complex??? The second question is: If we have a DG-functor $F:\mathcal{D}\rightarrow \mathcal{D}'$ this clearly induces a functor between the homotopy-category $F':H^0(\mathcal{D})\rightarrow H^0(\mathcal{D}')$. Does $\mathrm{Hom}_{H^0}(M,N)=0$ imply $\mathrm{Hom}(F'(M),F'(N))=0$? 

Given the vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$, endowed with the standard inner (dot) product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle:\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, the problem of almost-orthogonal sets asks, for each $\epsilon> 0$, for the construction (or at the very least, bounds on the cardinality) of a maximal subset $S$ of $U_n$, the set of unit vectors of $\mathbb{R}^n$, such that $\forall x,y\in S: x\ne y\implies |\langle x,y\rangle|\le\epsilon$. For known results, see Matt Cheung's Major Qualifying Project monograph at this link. Question: What are known results, if we restrict ourselves to some subset of $U_n$? Specifically, I am interested in the subset $\lbrace\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\rbrace^n$ consisting of the vertices of the scaled-down unit cube inscribed inside the unit ball centered at $0$. 

It is a slick, and seemingly ad-hoc, technique often used to prove that a Diophantine equation has no solutions. The equation $f(x_1,\ldots, x_k)=0$, with variables $x_i\in\mathbb{Z}$ and some elementary function $f$, is taken modulo some ingeniously chosen $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. Then by evaluating $f$ on the $k^n$ possible $k$-tuples $(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ of residues modulo $n$, it is shown that $0$ is achieved in no case. Thus no solution exists in $\mathbb{Z}$ either. A traditional classroom example is $x^2+y^2-3z^2=0$. Assume $\gcd(x,y)=1$ without loss of generality, and use modulo $3$. The trouble is in coming up with the brilliant $n$. An example of a good heuristic principle is choosing modulo $20$ if there are powers of $4$ as, out of to $20$ possible residues, the only quartic residues are $0,1,5,16$. Are there similar mods for other powers? In general, has there been any work done on an objective way of finding $n$? Perhaps good heuristics, if nothing else? Restrict $f$ to some non-trivial case, say certain polynomials of given degree, if needed. Paper references would be nice. 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two smooth projective surfaces and $f:X\rightarrow Y$ a birational morphism. Let $E$ be the exceptional curve on $X$ that is contracted. Now EGA III Theorem 4.1.5 states that the functor $\mathcal{F}\mapsto f^*\mathcal{F}$ is an equivalence between categories of locally free $\mathcal{O}_Y$-modules of rank $r$ and locally free $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules $\mathcal{E}$ of the same rank such that the restriction of $\mathcal{E}$ to the formal completition $\mathcal{X}=X_{/E}$ is trival. Is it possible to generalize this Theorem for arbitrary smooth projective schemes over a field of characteristic zero with birational proper morphism between them? 

Suppose we are given a finite dimensional $k$-algebra $A$ with an action of a finite group $G$. Suppose $\mathrm{gldim}(A)$ is finite. What is the relation between $\mathrm{gldim}(A)$ and $\mathrm{gldim}(A^G)$ ? Is $\mathrm{gldim}(A^G)$ finite too ? Such algebras occur for example when on considers a smooth projective variety over $k$ with an action of a finite group $G$. If $X$ has a $G$-equivariant tilting bundle $\mathcal{T}$ then $\mathrm{End}_G(\mathcal{T})=\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{T})^G$ would be such an $k$-algebra as above...
