Leonid speaks with great authority. I'd like to point out that you get a different answer in the category of graded coalgebras. If $A$ is a graded vector space, it has a graded dual $A'$ which is smaller than its full vector space dual $A^*$. Indeed, if the grading is locally finite, then this $A'$ has the same dimension sequence as $A$ and $A'' = A$. If $A$ is a locally finite, graded coalgebra, then its ring structure is given by an infinite sequence of finite tensors, and $A'$ is equivalently a graded algebra. Graded coalgebra homomorphisms also transpose to graded algebra homomorphisms. Recall that if $A'$ is also finitely generated (and scalar in degree $0$), then it corresponds to a projective variety with a choice of an ample line bundle. The morphisms between these are a perfectly good non-full subcategory of the projective schemes. The full dual $A^*$ is also the graded completion of $A'$. So what Leonid is saying in this case is that if you take the graded completion of a finitely generated, graded algera, it localizes the projective variety to the apex of its affine cone. This is similar to what Leonid describes for $\text{Spec}(A^*)$ in general. I said in a previous version of this answer that $\text{Spec}(A^*)$ atomizes the variety $\text{Proj}(A')$ to a "Cantor-set-like" structure. As Leonid points out in a comment, this is totally wrong in context. However, it is true that if $A$ is a finitely generated algebra, it has a completion $\hat{A}$ related to coalgebras such that $\text{Spec}(\hat{A})$ is an atomized form of $\text{Spec}(A)$. Namely, let $A'$ be the vector space of those dual vectors on $A$ that factor through finite-dimensional algebra quotients of $A$. Then $A'$ is a coalgebra, and $\hat{A} = (A')^*$ is an atomization in the sense that $\text{Spec}(\hat{A})$ is a 0-dimensional scheme whose points are the closed points of $\text{Spec}(A)$. (It isn't a Cantor set though.) 

In the interest of completeness, here is what I put on the 20-questions wiki — we might as well repeat it here in the $\infty$-questions site. I had basically the same idea as Ilya, do a branched search to look for the digits of $N^2$. However, the code that I wrote in Python works from the 10-adic end, while Ilya's works from the Archimedean end. Both programs support a heuristic model that implies that solutions in the integers are very unlikely. If you wanted an optimized search in the integers, you would work from both ends and try to match the partial solutions. And you would probably want to implement the algorithms in C++ rather than in Python. 

Every admissible coloring of $\mathbb{Z}_+$ yields a tiling of $\mathbb{Q}_+$ by subsets of the form $T_a = \{a,2a,3a,\ldots,na\}$, and vice versa. There is a special interest in lattice tilings, in which the set of choices of $a$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}_+$ of index $n$. In particular, if $n+1$ or $2n+1$ is prime, then such a subgroup exists, and the quotient group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/n$. It is easy to make variations that do not tile $\mathbb{Q}_+$, for example multiples of $\{1,2,3,4,6,8,9\}$. However, these variations generally span abelian groups in $\mathbb{Q}_+$ of lower rank than the span of $\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$. For the stated question, the rank is $\pi(n)$, and we may as well work in the subgroup of $P_n$ of $\mathbb{Q}_+$ generated by the $\pi(n)$ primes up to $n$. 

I'd like to add two remarks to David Speyer's great explanation of the Hurwitz encoding of a branched covering. A key question first studied by Hurwitz is when two branched coverings are "the same", in the sense that there is some way to braid the branch points to send one covering to the other covering. To address this question, you start with the obvious invariants, which are called "Hurwitz data". Obviously, each branch point is labelled by the cycle structure of its permutation. Obviously, the permutations of all of the branch points multiply to 1. (At least, these are both obvious once you understand what David said.) Slightly less obviously, the group $G$ generated by the permutations $g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n$ is another invariant. It is exactly the Galois group of the branched covering, if you either interpret the branched covering as a field extension of $\mathbb{C}(z)$, or if you interpret the branched coverings as a Galois category. In one definition, the Hurwitz data is exactly the choice of $G$ and abstract monodromy elements assigned to the branch points that generate $G$. A geometrical branched covering with sheets is then defined by this data and a choice of a subgroup $H \subset G$ representing an intermediate, irregular covering. (Well, with the extra condition that the normal core of $H$ is trivial, so that the homomorphism from $G$ to permutations is injective.) After you identify these obvious invariants, you might think that it is time to show that the Hurwitz action of the braid group is transitive on coverings with the same Hurwitz data. However, there is another invariant that was anything but obvious in Hurwitz' time, but fairly standard these days. It is easier to see this invariant if you have an unbranched covering with Galois group $G$ of a closed surface $S$. The covering comes from a homomorphism $f:\pi_1(S) \to G$, and the invariant the homology class $f_*([S]) \in H_2(G)$. A branched covering of the sphere gives you a relative version of this invariant; the homology group that it lives in depends on the monodromy elements as well as on the group $G$. In any case it is often a non-trivial invariant. 

I am cheating a little to give this answer, because I am fairly sure that it is part of Gil's motivation in asking the question. The most natural generalization of the Birkhoff hypothesis to quantum probability is only true for qubits. (It might also be true for a qubit tensor a classical system; I did not check that case.) A quantum measurable space is a von Neumann algebra. We are most interested in the finite-dimensional case, where classically "measurable space" is just a fancy name for the random variables on a finite set. A finite-dimensional von Neumann algebra is a direct sum of matrix algebras. In particular, $M_2$ is called a qubit and $M_d$ is called a qudit. To make a long story short, the Birkhoff hypothesis can be stated for a direct sum of $a$ copies of $M_b$, or $aM_b$. In this setting, a doubly stochastic map $E$ is a linear map from $aM_b$ to itself that preserves trace, that preserves the identity element, and that is completely positive. In this setting, $E$ is completely positive if it takes positive semidefinite elements of $aM_b$ to positive semidefinite elements, and if $E \otimes I$ also has that property on the algebra $aM_b \otimes N$ for another von Neumann or $C^*$-algebra $N$. The natural analogue of permutation matrices are the *-algebra automorphisms of $aM_b$. These are permutations of the matrix blocks, composed with maps of the form $E(x) = uxu^*$, where $u$ is a unitary element of $aM_b$. The question as before is whether the doubly stochastic maps are the convex hull of the automorphisms. This Birkhoff hypothesis is true for $M_2$, false for $M_d$ for $d \ge 3$, and I should check it for $nM_2$. It is true for $aM_1 = a\mathbb{C}$, because then it is the usual Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem. I am left wondering about two infinite classical versions of Birkhoff's theorem, for the algebras $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{N})$ and $L^\infty([0,1])$. In the former case, one would ask whether any stochastic map that preserves counting measure (even though counting measure is not normalized) is an infinite convex sum of permutations of $\mathbb{N}$. In the latter case, whether any stochastic map that preserve Lebesgue measure is a convex integral of measure-preserving permutations of $[0,1]$. Addendum: At least the discrete infinite case is addressed, with generally positive results, in this review and in this older review. The older paper also raises the continuous question but with no results. However, with some more Googling I found this counterexample paper. 

This isn't a homotopy theory answer, but the most widely used type of cogroup in mathematics is an algebraic group. An algebraic group is a cogroup object in the category of commutative rings, or in particular commutative algebras over a field. What is important in this case is that people care a lot about the opposite category, the category of affine schemes, or in the field case affine algebraic varieties. People care just as much about schemes and algebraic varieties in general, but if you want the algebraic groups analogue of connected semisimple Lie groups, then all examples are affine. In my view, any time you endorse a co(something fancy) object in a category, you are really endorsing the opposite category in general. Of course, at the formal level a category and its opposite category have exactly the same information, but conceptually it's a big leap. For example, non-commutative geometry is largely the study of the opposite category of non-commutative rings. Although in this case, people (correctly) use Hopf algebras as if they were cogroup objects, but they aren't! The tensor product operation on non-commutative algebras is not a coproduct. 

Enter Ricalde. He corresponded in a French question-and-answer journal called L'Intermédiaire des mathématiciens (which reads a lot like MathOverflow!). In one entry that I think was published in 1898, he asked about solving the quintic equation --- he didn't solve it himself. His question was about reducing the general quintic equation $$ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f = 0$$ to the special form $$y^5 + py + q = 0,$$ which is called Bring-Jerrard form. (In other words, Bring and Jerrard showed how to eliminate three of the terms in the quintic equation.) Obtaining Bring-Jerrard form is a complicated part of the problem, similar to Ferrari's solution to the quartic equation, but the hardest part is to solve the Bring-Jerrard equation; that's the part that requires elliptic functions. Much later there was a long laudatory biography of Ricalde in a regional publication called Enciclopedia Yucatanense. This biography was cited in Spanish Wikipedia, which apparently led to the English Wikipedia entry. It credited him with solving the quintic equation with elliptic functions, and I think some other major achievements as well. (Although it's a bit hard for me to tell, since I only get a snippet view.) However, in modern mathematical literature, Ricalde is barely cited for anything. The only citation that I found in the arXiv was in a review by Lemmermeyer concerning another algebra problem called Pell's equation. (Lemmermeyer includes Ricalde in a long list of people who solved special cases of Pell's equation, citing the 1901 issue of L'Intermédiaire des mathématiciens.) My guess is that a local biographer of Ricalde took some topics that Ricalde studied to be Ricalde's own achievements. Moreover, that Ricalde was a competent or aspiring research mathematician in his time, but not a standout. 

Here are four tempting fallacies that I have seen, that are in my opinion are all teachable and interesting: 

No, $f$ doesn't have to be invertible. It has to be injective, even in the volume-preserving category rather than the symplectic category. None of the singular values of $Df$ can go to 0, because some other singular value would go to $\infty$. This shows that it is locally injective, and then globally it is not possible to make the locally injective pieces overlap. But even when $n=1$, it does not have to be surjective. In this case the symplectic condition says just that $f_n$ is area-preserving. You can reshape larger and larger circles centered at $0$ to non-concentric circles with the same area that lie in the upper half plane. So the image of $f$ could be the upper half plane. Actually, I think that the image of $f$ can be any open topological disk with infinite area. 

Don't try to keep it secret for as long as possible. Sane math departments want to help with two-body problems. But it takes real work to help, and the department can't take do any of that work until you define the problem. It could be a mistake to be very forward about a two-body problem, as if to suggest that that's supremely more important than research and teaching. One deft move which is I think is fine is to have a link to your partner toward the end of your home page, without an explicit statement that you have a two-body problem. Also, you have to define your two-body problem privately to each university when the time comes; what you say on your home page is not enough. (As Jordan Ellenberg says below, it's outright illegal for the university to infer your romantic status or even ask you.) Certainly if you are both in math, don't interview on the same plane trip. It's important to establish that you and your partner are independent professionals. The department has the right to schedule you on the same plane trip and I wouldn't say that you should draw a line in the sand if they do. But it's better for both sides to avoid this. 

Motivated by an e-mail from grshutt, I looked myself at the Princeton Companion to Mathematics. I discovered that the editors of the PCM answered the same question as the one that I posed here. Part VI is a collection of biographies of 95 mathematicians, plus one for Bourbaki, and the fact that the Bernoullis share a slot. They chose 37 mathematicians born between 1850 and 1920, exactly in the middle of the range that I suggested. See the table contents to see who they picked. They also wrote nice biographies, although they are much shorter and more sedate than E.T. Bell's single-author work. It is a little embarrassing that we had this whole discussion without noticing that the PCM, with Timothy Gowers as the chief editor, had already done the same work. But it is also useful. It seems that when informed people carefully make lists of influential mathematicians of comparable length, they'll arrive at roughly the same list. Typically the intersection is about 1/2 if the lists are exactly the same length. PCM's list is longer than Bell (in the corresponding period) and mine, and shorter than Pete's, so we can look at who I (or Harrison) included but they did not, or who they included but Pete did not. PCM minus Pete: Fredholm, Vallée-Poussin, Russell, Sierpinski*, Littlewood*, Skolem, Ramanujan*, Courant, Kolmogorov*, Church, Hodge* (* = honorable mention in Pete's list) me minus PCM: Picard, Hurwitz, Lefschetz, Siegel, Chevalley, Gelfand Harrison minus PCM: Henri Cartan, MacLane, Erdos, Feynman Bell minus PCM: Zeno, Eudoxus, Poncelet, Monge PCM $\cap$ Pete $\cap$ Harrison $\cap$ me: Hilbert, Minkowski, Hausdorff, Cartan, Noether, Weyl, Banach, von Neumann, Godel, Weil Some of the differences can be explained as a somewhat different emphasis. In listing Russell and Church, the PCM gave more credit to the philosophical end of logic. (This is also grshutt's point in in his answer posted here and in his letter.) Whether Feynman should "count" is another question with two different reasonable answers. (As I said in a comment, the argument for Feynman is that he is an architect of quantum field theory, and quantum field theory is arguably a fundamental mathematical theory, even though parts of it haven't been made rigorous.) And I suppose that some of the differences indicate the ill-defined side of the question, or they are just random fluctuations, and aren't really worth arguing over.
