HINT What is the difference between variable and fixed cost? Try separating your total cost into fixed and variable cost. To do this, think about what costs the firm faces even when they have no output (let quantity produced be zero.) For a bit of intuition, think of these costs perhaps as rents paid by a firm during the initial setup stage (time spent fitting a factory with production equipment). They have a certain amount of bills to pay even though they produce nothing. After doing this it should be a straight forward thing to differentiate and interpret. MEANING Let's take your example. We can see that we have a cost of 75 (let's assume American dollars) regardless of how much output we produce. So Q=0 still incurs a cost of $75. Then by definition, this is the fixed cost portion of your total cost function. Then since any cost function is the sum of fixed and variable costs, we have that your variable cost function is $$C(Q)=Q^3-5Q^2+12Q$$ differentiating with respect to $Q$ yields: $$3Q^2-10Q+12$$ This is your marginal variable cost. Notice this is the same function achieved by simply differentiating the total cost function. This is because fixed costs are constants (and not functions of Q) and therefore disappear when C is differentiated with respect to Q. Then we can just refer to the equation above as marginal cost Marginal cost equations tell you how much your total cost rises when you decide to produce an additional unit of output. Notice here that making the production decision incurs a new sort of "fixed" cost. So let's examine what happens when Q increases: $$Q=1 \implies MC=5$$ $$Q=2 \implies MC=2$$ $$Q=3 \implies MC=9$$ and this is enough for us to tease out another important part of this function! Notice that marginal costs decrease as production increases over our initial range and then, at a certain point, marginal costs begin to increase as production continues to increase. This is a example of increasing marginal returns and decreasing marginal returns (respectively) In general, you can picture a marginal cost curve as a differentiable nike symbol or a U where the right side of the U is drawn much higher than the left side(and where it is a bit slanted to the right This would tend to infinity as Q tends to infinity). Alright - hope that cleared some things up. And to top it off, you can do a bit of reading about marginal cost. 

I am looking for resources that give a self-contained introduction to vector autoregression. To be a bit more specific, I am interested in VAR models and their application to isolating and investigating monetary policy shocks. 

Traditionally, labor force participation is best thought of as a supply-side phenomena. That is, a certain subset of our nation's population is jobless but is jobless by choice. For example, consider a stay-at-home parent. So, we have agents making a decision to not supply labor. However, there is a hint of the demand side at play here. For example, a very weak demand side might discourage workers, thereby compelling the marginal participant to exit the labor force. So, to be explicit: LFP is a supply-side concept. However, there is a mechanism through which demand side forces can factor into LFP. 

Say two countries have the same amount of resources. A has an absolute advantage relative to B if A has technology such that A produces a larger quantity of output using that given level of resources relative to B. So, lets say potatoes are inputs and mashed potatoes are outputs. A has an absolute advantage in mashed potato production if it can produce more pounds of mashed potatoes than B. Comparative advantage, on the other hand, deals with the opportunity cost. For example, the french fries foregone by each country when they decide to produce mashed potatoes. It is worth noting that comparative advantage is the basis of trade. Not absolute advantage. 

Obviously, condition 3 does not hold. Can you see why this cannot be an equilibrium outcome? Think about what should happen in the economy and the forces that will drive this economy toward a state s.t. condition 3 holds. 

The only 'maximum' agent $i$ can achieve is $U(w)$ since this agent cannot participate in this market. 

You could probably get a very good idea of a company's ability to spend money - that is, make capital investments, develop new ventures etc. - by investing its balance sheet and develop both liquidity and leverage ratios. High liquidity with low leverage means that a company is probably not investing enough. Low liquidity with high leverage ratios would indicate a company has already invested heavily and is not in a position to undertake new ventures etc. 

This makes use of Weierstrass theorem: "Any continuous function mapping from a non-empty compact set to a a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ attains a maximum and minimum. So, for example: We know by Hein-Borel that a $B(p,w)$ (the budget set) is compact. Since it is compact, we know by Weierstrass theorem that there exists a solution to the utility maximization problem on B(p,w). In general, optimization on a compact set will have a solution if you have a continuous objective function. 

I want to understand when and why multi-way clustering is necessary. Could anyone give a good example that provides intuition of when and why to use multi-way clustering that also illustrates why clustering at a group level is not sufficient? 

Here is the chain of logic: Demand for P falls $\implies$ Price of P falls $\implies$ supply for P falls/harvest of P falls $\implies$ supply of starch falls. The supply of starch falls because the decrease in the harvest of potatoes causes a decrease in the availability of the input needed to produce the starch. Keep in mind that there is no pressure placed on the demand for starch. So,you will not shift the demand curve in your simply supply and demand graph used to represent the market for starch. The only shock to the starch market comes from the decrease in supply of starch that results from the decreased harvest of potatoes. And so to finish it all off: If you hold demand for starch constant and decrease the supply of starch, the equilibrium price of starch rises. 

In the opinion of the economists here, what are some of the more important theories in economics that remain untested? By untested I mean theories that, though perhaps evaluated using empirical data, have not been tested in a laboratory setting. This interests me because of experimentalists track record with fundamentally altering how the field views certain theories. The most obvious example of tested theories are expected utility theory and the convergence of double auction markets with no restrictions. What theories do you think the field should eventually test and why? examples: monetary policy experiments: $URL$ macroeconomic experiments: $URL$ 

I will write out some generalized comments here because I am incredibly interested in the contributions of experimental economics to our understanding of economic man. Further, I am not convinced entirely that this is a homework question. The real thing here is that I think many other people - especially undergrads possibly interested in pursuing graduate school - might find the answer both interesting and compelling. So, here is a brief outline of what could be a more complete answer: 

Usually one can think of $a(t)$ as some form of interest. So, we can normalize some initial investment to 1 so that: $$a(0) = 1 $$ letting $k$ denote some initial investment, we can have that the value of $k$ at time $t$ is give by your formula: $$A(t)= ka(t)$$ So, for example, if you invest k=10, assume an interest rate $i=5$% and compounding interest, then ten periods after you invest your money, $k$ is worth: $$A(10,k) = 10*(1+.05)^{10}$$ 

It seems that economic threats have become a mainstay in geopolitical saber rattling. For example: $URL$ Summary: Saudi Arabia has threatened to sell approximately $750 billion in U.S. treasuries if Congress passes a measure meant to facilitate the accountability of any Saudi Official found to have been complicit in/actively involved in the terror attack of 2001. In response to this economic threat, the Obama administration has taken a position against the Congressional action. Such threats and subsequent responses make me curious: Let us suppose the Saudi's are able to sell the $750 billion of treasuries. What is the likely outcome for each of the two economies. Further, if such threats are feasible and serious, why are there no restrictions about who can hold (and in what amounts) US debt? It seems reasonable for some Americans to argue that the benefits of allowing foreign nations (especially those who are not historically allies of America) are not worth the costs. 

Clearly, currencies from these emerging market economies devalued relative to the USD. So here is part one of your question. Now the crux - what happened to securities values in those nations? 

You needn't use the Lagrange here. And in general, this will be true for additively separable, linear utility functions. Note that the marginal rate of substitution between any two goods $i,j$ is a utility function of the form $u(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)=a_1x_1+...+a_nx_n$ will be constant at $MRS_{i,j}=\frac{a_i}{a_j}$ A consumer will buy none of a good $x_i$ whenever $\frac{u_i}{p_i}$ is below the maximum such ratio of the $n$ goods. A consumer will exhaust her budget on whichever good has the maximum such ratio. And if all such ratios are equal, the consumer is indifferent between any consumption bundle that exhuats wealth $w$. For your case of two goods, indifference curves are linear. For more than two goods, they are hyperplanes. 

I am reviewing old midterms to prepare for my upcoming midterm and ran across this question: Let $\alpha , \beta \in (0,1)$. Now, let $f_{\alpha}$ and $f_{\beta}$ on $\mathbb{R^2}$ be defined as $f_{\alpha}(x)=x_1^{\alpha} x_2^{1 - \alpha}$ and $f_{\beta}(x)=x_1^{\beta} x_2^{1 - \beta}$ Now, let R be a binary relation on $\mathbb{R_x^2}$. Let ${x,y} \subset R_+^2$ We have that: $$xRy \leftrightarrow f_{\alpha}(x) \geq f_{\alpha}(y) \land f_{\beta}(x) \geq f_{\beta}(y)$$ For which combinations of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is this binary relation complete, for which combinations is it transitive and for which combinations is it continuous. My thoughts 

now we replace $\epsilon_i$ in our original equation: $$y_i=X_i\beta_1 + W_i\beta_2+ \phi_i \alpha + \chi$$ where now we have $E[W_i \chi]=0$ Intuition: I think I used the series of linear projections to 'control' for the endogenous portion of $W_i$. EDIT: I originally typed this incorrectly. I have changed the relevant orthogonality condition. Here is the intuition behind the (correct) orthogonality condition $E[W_i \chi]=0$: Since $W_i$ is a linear function of $X_i , Z_i$, and both are themselves orthogonal to $\chi$, we obtain the given orthogonality condition. Okay - the question. I think that $\hat \beta_{2.CF} \equiv \hat \beta_{2.OLS} \equiv \frac{cov(W_i,Y_i)}{Var(W_i)}$ If this is correct, do I just use the R.S.E. form that I use in OLS if I want heteroskedasticity robust S.E. when using the C.F. approach? 

Maybe this is a well-known fact that I have somehow overlooked or forgotten etc., but I found myself curious recently if there are any conclusions about WARP holding over different dimensions for a given choice structure. So, if I have a utility function, $N$ agents, $L$ commodities and price vectors in $R^L_+$, and I want to determine if WARP holds here, is it enough to assume that $L=2$ and prove WARP. Meaning, is it true that if WARP holds for $L=2$ it also holds for $L=N$, $N \in \mathbb{N}$ Edit : I feel like I should add that I know, generally, proving something for a specific case does not allow one to generalize the result. However, there are unique cases where such proofs can work. The first example that comes to mind is that whenever the excess demand function is homogeneous of degree zero we can reduce the problem to the simplex and it is sufficient to show that only n-1 markets clear. Why I am asking? I am trying to determine whether or not WARP holds for an adaptation of the (1999) Fehr & Schmidt Inequality Aversion utility function. I thought it might be easier to do by considering $L=2$
