With a view to understand to which extent OP's identity can fail, I am sharing these easy positive results. The emphasis is on the fact that OP's question tightly relates to (generalizations of) the prime avoidance lemma for ideals of denominators. Let $A$ be an integral domain. Let $(\mathfrak{p}_i)_{i \in I }$ be an arbitrary family of prime ideals of $A$. Let $S = A \setminus \bigcup_{i \in I} \mathfrak{p}_i$. 

The last method is the computation of the second integral homology group of $G_n$, also called Schur multiplier. We will establish $\text{H}_2(G_n, \mathbb{Z}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}^n$, which yields, as we will see, some other benefit. 

The "local Artinian" assumption in OP's question can be removed as the following more general result holds (rings are supposed unital and commutative): 

In the case $R = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]$, we have $S_R = R \setminus \mathfrak{m}$ where $\mathfrak{m} = R \cdot 2 + R \cdot (1 + \sqrt{-5})$. More generally, if $R$ is the ring of integers of some number field, then $S_R$ is the complement of the union of finitely many non-principal maximal ideals. Claim 1 can be used to inspect the state of affairs regarding polynomial rings $R[X]$ with $R$ an integral domain. For those rings $R$, the set $S = S_{R[X]}$ is one of the two trivial sets on many instances. We call $f \in R[X]$ a $u$-polynomial if $f(r)$ is a unit of $R$ for every $r \in R$. 

This answer addresses the trivial part of the question, that is multiplicative stability, while providing non-trivial examples of saturated sets $k(R)$ under two rather restrictive conditions: $R$ is a Dedekind domain or a polynomial ring over a unique factorization domain (UFD). It is easy to show that $k(R)$ is multiplicatively closed. 

If $M$ is a module over $R$, $x \in M$, and $N$ is a submodule of $M$, we denote by $(N:x)$ the ideal of $R$ consisting of the elements $r$ such that $rx \in N$. Now we can prove the second claim. 

The group law of $G^{\rtimes 2}$ is given by $$(g, h)(g',h') = (ghg'h^{-1}, hh')$$ and more generally for $G^{\rtimes k}$, we have $(g_1, \dots, g_{k -1}, g_k)^{(1, \dots,1, g)} = (g_1^g, \dots,g_{k - 1}^g, g_k^{g})$ where $x^y \Doteq y^{-1}xy$. Therefore $G^{\rtimes k}$ is just $G^k$ in disguise. Indeed, we have $G^{\rtimes 2} = (G \times \{1\}) \cdot D(G)$ with $D(G) = \left\{ (g, g^{-1}) \, \vert \, g \in G \right\} \lhd G^{\rtimes 2}$ and $[G \times \{1\}, D(G)] \subset (G \times \{1\}) \cap D(G) = 1$. Considering the following normal subgroups of $G^{\rtimes 3}$, $$ \left\{ ((g, 1), 1) \, \vert \, g \in G \right\}, \, \left\{ ((g, g^{-1}),1) \, \vert \, g \in G \right\},\, \left\{ ((1, g), g^{-1}) \, \vert \, g \in G \right\} $$ we see how the isomorphism $G^{\rtimes k} \simeq G^k$ generalizes for $k \ge 3$. Turning back to OP's question, the two implications are then immediate. 

The above formula can be rephrased as $\tau_n = \frac{3}{2}\frac{W_n'}{W_n}$ where $W_n$ is the $n$-th Wallis' integral and $W_n'$ is recursively defined by $W'_0 = \frac{\pi}{3}, \,W_1' = \frac{1}{2}$ and $W_n' = - \frac{1}{2n}(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^{n - 1} + \frac{n - 1}{n}W'_{n - 2}$. The latter formula allows an efficient computation of $\tau_n$ for any $n > 0$. As $W_n' \le \frac{\pi}{3}(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^n$ and $W_n \sim \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2n}}$, the sequence $(\tau_n)_n$ converges to $0$ exponentially fast (we have for instance $10^{-7} < \tau_{91} < 10^{-6}$). Before proving the claims, let us state some obvious, but important, remarks. Remark 1. Let $A \in GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ and $d \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Let $C$ be any subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then we have $$f(AC) = \vert \det(A) \vert^2f(C), \quad f(C + d) = \int_C \lambda\left(C \cap (C + d + x) \right)d\lambda(x).$$ In particular the ratio $\tau(C)$ is $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$-invariant but it is not invariant under translation. Indeed, if $C$ is a convex subset of finite positive Lebesgue measure whose interior contains $0$, then the function $f_C(d): d \mapsto f(C + d)$ has a non-empty and bounded support. The following tightly relates to OP's question. 

The class of rings which satisfy the hypotheses of Claim 2 is wide: fix finitely many fields $k_1, \dots, k_n$ and let $\{K_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha}$ be a family of fields such for every $\alpha$, the field $K_{\alpha}$ contains (up to isomorphism) one of the fields $k_i$. Then there is a zero-dimensional ring $R$ whose residue fields are the fields $K_{\alpha}$ [1]. The proof of Claim 2 relies on [3, Lemma 10]: 

Note that non-constant $u$-polynomials over UFDs which aren't fields do exist, see e.g., [1, Example 3.b]. Indeed, take $\mathcal{P} =\{p \text{ prime } \vert\, p \equiv 3 \text{ mod } 4 \} \subset \mathbb{Z}$ and set $$\mathbb{Z}_{\mathcal{P}} = \{ \text{ rational numbers } \frac{m}{n} \text{ with no prime factor of } n \text{ in } \mathcal{P}\}.$$ Then $x^2 + 1$ is $u$-polynomial over the UFD $\mathbb{Z}_{\mathcal{P}}$. In the course of Claim 3's proof, we showed 

As a perfect soluble group is just a trivial group in disguise, there is no non-trivial finite soluble group satisfying OP's condition (which echoes a discussion initiated in the comments). Side note. Since OP's property is stable under taking quotients (use Gaschutz's Lemma to lift generating pairs), the non-existence of such groups will be established if it is shown that no finite simple groups satisfy OP's property (see YCor's comment for early work in this direction). 

Claim 3 below gives a way to compute efficiently $\tau_n$ for all $n > 0$. The proof of the proposition follows Fedja's idea. The first part consists in proving that $\tau$ doesn't decrease after Steiner symmetrization. This is Claim 4 below. The second part uses [1, Theorem 7.1.10] showing that some Euclidean ball centred at $0$ can be obtained as the limit of Steiner symmetrizations of $C$ for any compact convex $C$. When $n = 1$, the result is slightly stronger. 

The OP defines a seemingly narrower set $$N_R = \{ a \in R \setminus \{0\} : a \vert x \text{ or } x \vert a \text{ for every } x \in R\}$$ which satisfies $$R^{\times} \subset N_R \subset S_R \subset R \setminus \{0\}.$$ 

If $R$ is any commutative domain with identity, it is easily checked that $Ra \cap Rb$ is principal if $Ra + Rb$ is. Note that the localization of a Prüfer domain at a prime ideal is a valuation domain, hence a Bézout domain. 

If $X$ is a completely regular topological space and $Y$ is an open subspace of $X$ with trivial induced topology, then $Y$ is also closed. In particular, if $x \in X$ is an isolated point, then $\{x\}$ is closed and the ideal consisting of the continuous functions $f$ such that $f(y) = 0$ for every $y \neq x$ is simple. I am indebted to Zach Teitler who mentioned this fact first. 

I conclude with a comment on OP's motivation. The situation of $M_2(R)$ mentioned in OP's question, is rather different than the situation of $T$. Indeed, note that $K_1(M_n(R)) = K_1(R)$ and $\text{sr}(M_n(R)) = \lceil \frac{\text{sr}(R) - 1}{n} \rceil + 1$ [5, Theorem 5.18] whereas $K_1(T_n(R)) = K_1(R)^n$ [2, Corollary 2] and $\text{sr}(T_n(R)) = 1$ if and only if $\text{sr}(R) = 1$, where $T_n(R) \subset M_n(R)$ is the ring of $n$-by-$n$ upper triangular matrices. (In some $K$-theoretical sense, $T$ is closer to $R^2$ than $M_2(R)$.) 

Let us first observe that an ideal $I$ of a commutative ring $R$ with identity is minimal in OP's sense if and only if $I$ is a non-zero simple module over $R$. From now on, we will favour this terminology. Note also that a topological space $X$ with trivial topology, i.e., the open sets of $X$ are $X$ and $\emptyset$, is completely regular for a trivial reason. Let $C(X)$ be the ring of continuous real-valued functions on $X$. If $X$ is a topological space with trivial topology, then the ring $C(X)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ and hence is a simple ring. This leads to

Let $R$ be an arbitrary commutative ring with identity. We say that $R$ satisfies the prime avoidance lemma for unions of cardinality $\kappa$ if for every ideal $I$ of $R$ and every index set $K$ of cardinality $\kappa$, the inclusion $I \subset \bigcup_{k \in K} P_k$ implies $I \subset P_l$ for some $l \in K$, where the ideals $P_k$ are arbitrary prime ideals of $R$. Note that the prime avoidance lemma for countable unions holds for some interesting classes of rings, see for instance the answer of Neil Epstein to this MO post. 

The answer is no in general. Take $R = \prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}_{> 0}} \mathbb{Z}/2^n\mathbb{Z}$. Then the Jacobson radical of $R$ is $\prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}_{> 0}} 2\mathbb{Z}/2^n\mathbb{Z}$, and it contains a non-nilpotent element, namely $(2 + 2^n \mathbb{Z})_n$. Therefore the Jacobson radical of $R$ doesn't coincide with the nilradical of $R$. All credits go to Georges Elencwajg, see this MO post. Side note. Let $J(R)$ denote the Jacobson radical of a commutative unital ring $R$. Knowing that $x \in J(R)$ holds if and only if $1 + rx \in R^{\times}$ holds for every $r \in R$, the identity $J(\prod_{i \in I} A_i) = \prod_{i \in I} J(A_i)$ is immediate. 

Let $A$ be an integral domain and let $N \subseteq M$ be two modules over $A$. The condition $S^{-1}N \cap M = N$ for $S = A \setminus \{0\}$ is equivalent to $N \cap aM = aN$ for every $a \in A$, provided that $M$ is torsion-free. Hence, in this case, $N$ is a pure sub-module of $M$ in a weak sense. We can prove the following claim without using induction on the number of generators of the sub-module $N$. 

Eventually, we note that the answer to OP's question cannot be too simple as we have $$G_n/G_n' \simeq \mathbb{Z}^2,\quad G_n/G_n'' \simeq \mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z}$$ for every $n$. To get the second isomorphism, observe that $r_n \equiv r_1 \cdot r_1^a \cdots r_1^{a^{n - 1}} \text{mod } (F(a, b))''$. 

We denote by $V_n(r)$ the Lebesgue measure of the Euclidean ball of radius $r \ge 0$, that is, $V_n(r) = r^n\frac{\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2} + 1)}$, and let $\nu_n = V_n(1) = \lambda(B_n)$. Given a real number $h$ such that $-1 \le h \le 1$, we denote by $B_n^{\text{cap}}(h)$ the hyperspherical cap of height $h$ along $x_n$ , that is the set of points $x = (x_1, \dots, x_n) \in B_n$ such that $x_n \ge h$. We also set $V_n^{\text{cap}}(h) = \lambda(B_n^{\text{cap}}(h))$.

I fail to find an integral domain $R$ such that $k(R)$ is not saturated. The two propositions below provide conditions under which $k(R)$ is saturated, yielding non-trivial examples of sets $k(R)$. By trivial, I mean one of the two possibilities $k(R) = R^{\times}$ (the unit group of $R$) or $k(R) = R \setminus \{0\}$. The latter is the subject of a theorem of Robert Gilmer and William Heinzer [1, Corollary 2]: 

Let us denote by $R^{\times}$ the unit group of $R$. The obvious examples of sets $S_R$ are $R \setminus \{0\}$ (obtained, e.g., when $R$ is a Bézout domain) and $R^{\times}$ (obtained, e.g., for $R = \mathbb{Z}[X]$, a non-Bézout unique factorization domain). If $R$ is atomic, the above proof shows that $S_R$ is the multiplicative submonoid of $R \setminus \{0\}$ generated the units of $R$ and the prime elements $p$ of $R$ such that $Rp$ is a maximal ideal of $R$. Hence it is not too difficult to find rings $R$ such that $R^{\times} \subsetneq S_R \subsetneq R \setminus \{0\}$. Indeed, we have 

Addendum. I discovered this preprint of Rodney Coleman (2013) in which OP's question was both asked and answered.

The computation of $r$ is essentially the same if we suppose $K = \mathbb{Q}$ and consider how many of the vectors $(\nu_p(\lambda_i))_i$ are $\mathbb{Q}$-linearily independent for $p \in \mathbb{N}$ prime and $\nu_p$ the $p$-adic valuation. In this case $r' = 0$ and the generators of $\ker f$ can be computed in polynomial time if you leave aside the problem of factorizing the numerator and denominator of $\lambda_i$ as products of primes. For the general case, observe indeed that $r$ is the free rank of the image of $N_{K/\mathbb{Q}} \circ f: \mathbb{Z}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}^{\ast}$, $(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n) \mapsto N_1^{z_1}N_2^{z_2} \cdots N_n^{z_n}$ where $N_i = N_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\lambda_i) \in \mathbb{Q}$ is the norm of $\lambda_i$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. How to compute $r'$ in general is unclear to me. Still, Dirichlet's unit theorem provides us with an upper bound and computational results should exist. My naive impression is that the complexity of your problem is exactly the complexity of the prime decomposition in $\mathbb{Z}$. More instructed readers may prove or disprove this assertion.

The following claim characterizes circumstances under which $\ker(\text{eval}_q)$ for $q \in K = \text{Frac}(R)$ is a principal ideal of $R[X]$. In particular, this answers question $2$ in the positive and provides a recipe to construct non-principal ideals of the form $\ker(\text{eval}_q)$.
