As Pavel says, any semisimple element lies in a maximal torus, where you can take any root. On the other hand, if $g$ is unipotent, then it is in the image of the exponential map, so you can make sense of $g^\lambda$ for any $\lambda \in \mathbb C$, so counterexamples must have nontrivial semisimple and unipotent parts. Suppose $g=s.u=u.s$ is the Jordan decomposition of an element. Then $s^n$ and $u^n$ are semisimple and unipotent respectively, so they are the Jordan decomposition of $g^n$. Thus the existence of roots is compatible with Jordan decomposition. Now take a semisimple element $s$ such that $Z_G(s)^0$ does not contain a central torus (so its center is finite) -- if $G$ is simply connected then in fact $Z_G(s)$ is connected, so I'll assume that. Now pick a regular unipotent element $u$ in $Z_G(s)$ and consider $g =s.u$. I want to claim $g$ is a counterexample. Indeed suppose for each $n$ we have $h_n$ an $n$-th root, and $h=s_nu_n$ is its Jordan decomposition. Then $s_n^n =s$ and $u_n^n=u$, and both $s_n$ and $u_n$ lie in $Z_G(s)$. Then we see that $s_n$ centralizes $u$ for all $n$, but since $u$ is regular in $Z_G(s)$ and $s_n$ semisimple it follows that $s_n$ must lie in the centre of $Z_G(s)$. But then taking, say, $n$ equal to the order of that centre (which is finite) we get a contradiction, as $s_n^n$ must then be $1$. Semisimple elements $s$ such that $Z_G(s)$ does not contain a central torus exist, but there are only finitely many conjugacy classes of them, as was essentially shown in the paper of Borel and de Siebenthal. In fact I think that paper establishes that there are $r+1$ such classes where $r$ is the rank of $G$, so this would give a negative answer for the exceptional groups also. I suspect that these might somehow be the only counterexamples? 

The simplest proof of Borel-Weil-Bott that I know is due to Demazure: he has two papers in Inventiones (one in 1968 the other in 1976) on the theorem, and the second is two pages long -- it gives a simplification of his previous proof, and he uses only algebro-geometric techniques. Both papers are readable. 

It's maybe worth mentioning a reason why the crystal techniques don't immediately solve this problem: If $V$ and $W$ are representations of $\mathfrak g$, then we can find the corresponding representations of the quantum group $V_v$,$W_v$, and take their tensor product. The crystal basis theory shows you how to combinatorially understand the decomposition of $V_v\otimes W_v$ and so this also solves in turn the problem of decomposing $V\otimes W$. However the "flip map" $\sigma\colon V_v\otimes W_v \to W_v\otimes V_v$ is not an isomorphism representations (even though the representations are in fact isomorphic). Thus $\sigma$ doesn't induce an automorphism of $V_v\otimes V_v$, and so the "symmetric part" of the quantum version of a second tensor power doesn't immediately make sense. This gets reflected on the combinatoral side by the fact that if $B_1$ and $B_2$ are the crystals of highest weight representations, then their tensor product $B_1 \boxtimes B_2$ and $B_2 \boxtimes B_1$ are isomorphic but this isomorphism is not realized by the flip map: one first has to twist by the map which takes a "highest weight" crystal to a "lowest weight" crystal (this has been studied by a number of people: e.g. Berenstein, Henriques-Kamnitzer, and in the context of Littelmann paths by Biane-Bourgerol-O'Connell and probably others too!) So again, at least at first sight it's not immediately clear what the "symmetric part" of a crystal $B_1 \boxtimes B_1$ should be. 

This question seems slightly strangely phrased to me: the case $\mathbb C[B_n\backslash GL_n(F_q)/B_n]$ gives you a Hecke algebra which is not commutative. It has the same dimension of the group algebra of the symmetric group, and by deformation techniques it's known to have the same number of irreducible representations, but none of this requires commutativity (though that does hold sometimes, and David's answer about the Gelfand trick is a very slick strategy). If you're interested in where the theory of Hecke algebras relating representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ and the representations of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb F_q)$ extends to, then there are a number of directions. For a finite group of Lie type $G$, the classification of all irreducible representations hinges on generalizations of the kind of Hecke algebra you mention, where instead of the double-coset algebra, you consider twisted versions of it which are endomorphism algebras of certain "cuspidal" representations of (rational) Levi subgroups of $G$. These turn out to have presentations like the Hecke algebra attached to $S_n$, though sometimes with parameters which are various powers of $q$. One standard reference is Carter's book on finite groups of Lie type, where there is discussion of these endomorphism algebras. (A crucial ingredient is usually that $G$ has a $BN$ pair, so that the $B$--double cosets are indexed by a Coxeter group.) Similar kinds of Hecke algebras (though now infinite-dimensional "affine" Hecke algebras) arise when studying representations of p-adic groups, Roger Howe has a nice article in Lecture Notes in Math 1804 on the use of Hecke algebras in the p-adic theory -- slight generalisations of the affine Hecke algebras used to study the case of representations generated by an Iwahori fixed vector turn out to allow you to study surprisingly large parts of the representation theory of p-adic groups. 

As the comments say, one of the problems here is the multiplicity of things that get called "quiver varieties". The example you are looking at would correspond in Nakajima's context to a quiver variety attached to $SL_2$, and maybe that's worth making explicit. Nakajima starts with a quiver Q, and does two things: first he adds a "shadow vertex" for each original vertex, and an edge from that vertex to it's corresponding vertex in the original quiver, then he take the contangent bundle of everything, which in graph terms means adding for each edge you now have another edge in the opposite direction. Thus for $SL_2$ the original quiver is just a single vertex with no edges. The Nakajima procedure adds another vertex and two edges one in each direction. The quotients that Nakajima would then consider would be with respect to the action of the general linear groups on the original vertices: in our case just one of them, say $V$. For the GIT quotient, you would use some choice of stability, which in this case could be just that the map $x \colon W \to V$ is surjective. Then you need the moment map for the action of the group $\text{GL}(V)$: this is just the map to the composite $xy \in \text{End}(V)$ (where $y\colon V \to W$ is the other linear map). The symplectic quotient is then the quotient by the action of $\text{GL}(V)$ on the stable part of the zero locus of the moment map: so pairs $(x,y)$ where $x$ is surjective, and the image of $y$ lies in the kernel of $x$. The surjectivity of $x$ means that the $\text{GL}(V)$ action is free, and the quotient can then be identified with the cotangent bundle to a Grassmannian of $W$: it is the image of the map $(x,y) \mapsto (\text{ker}(x),yx)$. The affine quotient is the image of the map $(x,y) \mapsto yx$, which gives you the closure of a nilpotent orbit in $\text{End}(V)$. 

I'd like to mention two (quite different) factors: the time it takes the journal to accept the paper is a serious consideration: however outstanding your papers, it's probably useful for it to be accepted in famous journal X instead of submitted to famous journal X when you go on the job market. I think the AMS periodically publishes average processing time for journals in the Notices. Another factor I've come to try and consider is how expensive the journal is: journals like Inventiones are extortionately expensive compared with AMS journals (including JAMS, to give a journal of comparable prestige). Rob Kirby has information about this on his webpage, and probably there are more recent sources too. Of course I think this criterion is easier to use when you're more established than when you're starting out. 

This is standard stuff: for example, if $A$ is an associative algebra over a field $k$ and $M$ is a simple module over $A$ whose dimension as a $k$-vector space is smaller than the cardinality of $k$, then any element of $\text{End}_k(M)$ is algebraic over $k$ (one just needs to consider the $k$-dimension of $k(\alpha)$ if $\alpha$ is a nonzero endomorphism -- see Kevin Buzzard's comment above for example). On the other hand, there's a nice (short) article of Quillen in Proceedings of the AMS about Schur's Lemma for filtered algebras: he checks that for a filtered algebra $U$ over $k$ whose associated graded is commutative and finitely generated, if $M$ a simple $U$-module, and $\theta \in \text{End}_U(M)$, then one has $\theta$ algebraic over $k$. 

As Scott implies, there are probably lots of sensible answers to this question, but one perspective is to view the category of $\mathcal D$-modules on a (smooth) variety $X$ as a category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a "noncommutative deformation" of the cotangent bundle $T^*X$. This is essentially just another way of viewing the existence of the symbol map, but for exactly that reason it's a good point of view -- you can lift $\mathcal D$-modules to modules for the microdifferential operators (or pseudodifferential operators) on the cotangent bundle, and working locally on the cotangent bundle is then a useful technique. This process gets called "microlocalization", and I think is at least mentioned in the discussion of noncommutative geometry. 

One book you might look at is Conway and Smith's "On quaternions and octonions". It discusses the map from the unit quaternions to $SO(3)$, and give applications of quaternions to "geometry in three dimensions" in a reasonable amount of detail. It also discusses the octonions and the Cayley-Dickson construction very nicely, so it's a great book to look at for interesting examples. One thing I liked is that the compact form of $G_2$ is the automorphisms of the octonions and a normed algebra, and thinking in terms of standard bases for octonions calculates the dimension of $G_2$ essentially by showing it's an iterated sphere bundle, in the spirit of how you wanted to talk about the Hopf fibration I think. I was using the book as a resource in a class on classical groups for 3rd year undergrads, and it at least let me find a nonclassical group. (Some of the students knew what a manifold was, some didn't -- it seemed fair to say to the one's who did that they should think through the examples we had and see that they were manifolds/fibrations etc. useful if you have some strong students in the class!)
