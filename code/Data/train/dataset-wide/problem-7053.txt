Simple, you have a perpetuity, thus will need to discount all future cash flows to find Net Present Value, which essentially is the net worth of your company: 

Producers of corn may not be able to afford a decrease in prices. Remember that farmers are (usually) not speculating and not “investing”. They are producing a product that they need to offload in order to make money. They have zero interest in uncertainty (again, assuming that most are not speculating). The future price they can receive today may be better than the spot price in 6 months, or it may be worse - you really have no idea, but at least you can lock it in, so that you know what to plan for. Remember that farmers have two uncertainties about their product when laying the first seed: 1) quantity and 2) price. By hedging the price on some quantify you can reduce your risk significantly (and hence also your upside) which may be far more appealing then the risk of losing everything. 

The sale of the bonds (assets) will only affect the assets-side of the balance sheet. If Acme bank did not lend out the money, your “bonds” would go 50-10 = 40. And your cash would go 0+10 = 10. If they lend out the money, bonds still go to 40 and lending goes up by 10, so 50+10 = 60. 

How, in practise, would that be different from what is happening now? ..or what you, as an "investor" could already do? No one is forcing you to deposit all your liquid assets into a bank account - most banks offer some sort of investment-opportunities, where you can buy into different funds with different risk-profiles. Next thing; suppose banks take all deposits and lend out to different customers for various purposes and they receive interest on those lendings - some of those interest are transfered back to you for allowing the bank to use your money. This would actually be the same, as putting your money into a fund. The bank "invests" your money with other customers and recieve some sort of yield on that investment (interest). Difference will be the risk-profile. By "investing" in the bank you recieve an extremely diversified portfolio, funding everything from consumer goods, cars, houses to actually backing large corporations. Most of your investment is being placed high up in the hierarchy of priotization if the lenders go into default, which makes your investment "safer" than if you go and buy bonds in that same company (but obviously also recieves a lower yield). Your proposal will put peoples money in a different place in the hierarchy of debt if customer/lenders go bankrupt, actually increasing the general risk-profile of the bank. In all everything comes down to your risk profile - which exposure do you want your investment to have. The risk of a AAA rated sovereign bond yielding -0.5%, receive 0% on your deposits in a government backed bank, 5% on a BB- mutual fund or 25% on an emerging markets bonds? 

Consider that you want to purchase a product from a EU country, pricing their products in Euros. Let’s say that you want to buy a product that costs 100 euro. No matter what the relationship is between USD/EUR, the product will still be 100 EUR. Let’s say the USD/EUR is 1.24 as in your example - that means for every 1.24 USD you have, you get 1 EUR. If you want to buy the product you will then need 124 USD to buy a 100 EUR product. Now let’s say that the USD strengthens compared to EUR and the new exchange rate is 1.15 instead of 1.24. Using same logic as above, you now need 115 USD to purchase that same product, giving you a discount of 9 USD just because of the new exchange rate. Remember the product is still 100 EUR - but you can now buy more euros for your dollar than you could before. 

There are different oppinions on which rates to use for calculating expected return (I assume you mean throu CAPM?). Most, however, do agree that it should be long-term risk-free, so 1 and 3-month T-Bills are going to be way to short a timespan. Usually you would go with 10 to 30 year government bonds. My professor in B-School recommended 10-year government bonds for a similar case. 

You will then divide that by your interest rate, perhaps your average weighted cost of capital, WACC. Let’s say it is 5%. 

As you said it doesn’t make sense to compare entry level finance jobs with non-entry level normal jobs. Salary increase in finance is usually quite large - also many have bonus schemes, which many statistics leave out of the “average salary”. Over time definitely the Quant will make more than the school teacher. 

Increasing the gap between assets and liabilities is exactly the same as described above. Assets = (Equity + Liabilities). 

Which would be the Net Present Value of all your future cashflows; given the information you provided. This is true because you specified a specific cashflow without growth for all eternity, hence the value of your cash flow in year 50 is going to be worth very little in today’s money. EDIT: Forgot to take into account that there are 12 months in a year; answer has been updated. 

No why would it? The valuation should solely be based on the future expectations of the company. Perhaps during this one year, the startup has taken on 100x more customers than it had before, or earning 200 times more, and seemingly have an even brighter future than it did one year ago. Why would the previous valuation affect the new one? This is at least true for rational investors. 

Capital not being put to work reveals no profit. This capital could have been invested into something else which may (or may not) have resulted in profit for the bank. Opportunity cost of capital could be rather big. This means that the bank is actually loosing out on potential profits. Capital (in form of equity) does not necessarily mean the company is profitable. Many (often smaller) companies are 100% equity financed - this has no relation to profitability what so ever. Increasing the equity/debt ratio does not say anything about if the company is profitable. It could be because the company has build up equity (yay, this means profits), but it could also be because the company has gotten a capital injection (not affecting profits). It works other ways as well - perhaps a company is very profitable (building equity and not paying dividends), but at the same time they increase their debt, keeping the ratio constant; in this case you cannot see if it is profitable or not. Debt is not the same as “not profitable”. Actually most companies have debt because they may be able to invest the debt at a better rate than their interest rate (eg in machinery to increase production resulting in profits). 

I am yet a bit confused about the actual application of the Efficient Component Pricing Rule (or Baumol-Willig pricing rule) for a network monopolist $M$. What I know is the following. The ECPR determines the optimal access price $a$ which $M$ charges some downstream competitor for accessing its network. More precisely, it says that the access price is the direct (marginal) cost plus the opportunity cost of the monopolist $M$ which is also equal to the retail price minus the saved (marginal) cost of the incumbent for not serving the costumer at the downstream market himself. On the other hand, in my notes, there is stated that the access price should optimally be equal to the marginal cost for the operation of the network. And this is where I am confused as I don't know which would really be the 'efficient' one? Let's consider a simple example. Let's say there's some network monopolist $M$ that can also serve consumers at the downstream market with a product that is priced $p = 10\$$. The marginal cost for serving the consumers is $c^* = 2\$$ per unit. The cost for maining the network, i.e. for operation and such, is $ C = 5\$$. What would now be the optimal price that the monopolist charges a downstream competitor which would like to access $M$'s network in order to serve the consumer, having a marginal cost for selling at the markt of $c > 0$? According to what I first understood it should be $a = p - c^* = 10\$ - 2\$ = 5\$ + [10\$ - 2\$ - 5\$] = C + [p - c^* - C]$. But according to my notes, it should just be $a = C = 5\$$. What is correct and why? 

I am again running into problems with regard to expected utility and utility of expectation. This is very similar to this question I posted a few days ago. Since it did not clear the matter then I post this as a separate question as it is placed, I think, in a more general setting. This time I don't care about income but about prices. The question is as follows. Let $C(x) = cx^2$ be the cost function for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$. The output price is $p_s$ and variable according to the scenario $s$. The utility of the firm is given as $u(\Pi_s) = \log(\Pi_s)$ where $\Pi_s$ is the profit in scenario $s$. Now there are two scenarios. In the first, the price is $p_1 = \bar{p} + z$ with probability $w$ and $z \in \mathbb{R}$ constant and in the second, $p_2 = \bar{p} - z$ with probability $(1 - w)$. Derive the optimal output $x$ if the agent has to decide for the quantity before the price is known. In my opinion, there are two ways to solve this. Either I set up the first-order condition separately, i.e. $$\frac{d\mathbb{E}[u]}{dx} = w \frac{(\bar{p} + z) - 2cx}{(\bar{p} + z)x - cx^2} + (1 - w)\frac{(\bar{p} - z) - 2cx}{(\bar{p} - z)x - cx^2} = 0$$ which is quite cumbersome to solve for $x$ afterwards or I compute the expected price $p^* = \mathbb{E}[p] = z(2w - 1) + \bar{p}$ and then solve $$\frac{d\mathbb{E}[u]}{dx} = \frac{p^* - 2cx}{p^*x - cx^2} = 0$$ for which $x$ would then just be $$x = \frac{p^*}{2c}$$ What I don't understand is which approach should I use here and, in particular, why? I am familiar with vNM-rationality and the expected utility maximization context but I cannot see which one beats the other and what is the theoretical argument there: expected utility of possible prices or utility of expected prices? 

I currently deal with interest rate theories, reading amongst others Paul Samuelson (1958) and Peter Diamond (1965). In Samuelson the possibility of a naturally occuring negative interest rate is introduced due to consumption smoothing and without some central bank mechanism. Often times I heard (or read) that the interest rate is impossible to decrease below zero as soon as some commodity is introduced that preserves its value over time, like land or some kind of neutral money. What I don't understand is, why? What is the idea behind that and what kind of concept is this neutral money as opposed to "traditional" money? 

In class we dealt with insurance economics and, specifically, adverse selection due to information asymmetry. As one possible solution we considered pooling contracts, i.e. the same contract for both high- and low-risk households for some average price. We showed and I understood why the high-risk households now would buy more insurance than the low-risk ones and thus everybody would act as if they were low-risk whether this is true or not. What I am not sure about is why there wouldn't be an equilibrium in a competitive market. It's clear that the low-risk individuals have reason to go for a lesser premium and, if some other insurer would offer this, then they would go there. Therefore, my questions are: 1) So why won't there be an equilibrium? I would think that if a new insurer appears with a better deal than the pooling contract, then there would again be the problem with adverse selection. Hence, the new insurer wouldn't appear and offer a better deal in the first place? 2) I also read that this is pareto-inefficient in that it disadvantages the low-risk households (obvious) but does not benefit the high-risk households. The latter point I do not understand since the high-risk households will have a higher demand since the pooling contract situation makes the insurance relatively cheap. Isn't that a benefit? 

You have $$ \begin{align} u(\lambda a + (1 - \lambda) b, \lambda b + (1 - \lambda)a) &= \sqrt{\lambda a + (1 - \lambda)b} + \sqrt{\lambda b + (1 - \lambda)a} \\ &\geq \lambda\sqrt{a} + (1 - \lambda)\sqrt{b} + \lambda\sqrt{b} + (1 - \lambda)\sqrt{a} \\ &= \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \\ &= u(a, b) \end{align}$$ The inequality in the second line follows from Jensen's inequality for concave functions. I don't think you need to prove Jensen but you can even do that moderately easy with the AM-GM inequality if you want to.
