A representative agent chooses a consumption time-path to maximize expected discounted utility $E\left[\sum_{i=0}^\infty\beta^i U(c_{t+i})|\Omega_t\right]$, where $\Omega_t$ is the information set at time $t$, subject to the inter-temporal budget constraint, $c_t + p_tq_t = r_tq_{t-1} + w_t$, for all $t$. The optimal consumption path satisfies: $p_tU'(c_t) = \beta E[r_{t+1}U'(c_{t+1})|\Omega_t]$, for all $t$ Which gives the Euler equation: $E[\beta(r_{t+1}/p_t)[U'(c_{t+1}) / U'(c_t)]|\Omega_t] - 1 = 0$. He then imposes the CRRA utility function $U(c_t) = c_t^{1-\gamma}/(1-\gamma)$, making the Euler equation become $E[\beta(r_{t+1}/p_t)(c_{t+1}/c_t)^{-\gamma}|\Omega_t] - 1 = 0$. This yields the moment equations: $E[\{\beta(r_{t+1} / p_t)(c_{t+1} / c_t)^{-\gamma} - 1\}z_t] = E[E[\beta(r_{t+1} / p_t)(c_{t+1} / c_t)^{-\gamma} - 1|\Omega_t]z_t] = 0$ with $z_t$ a vector of instruments belonging to $\Omega_t$. 

Actually, Section 3 of the paper you linked is probably one of the most comprehensive lists you could find of the movers and the shakers with regard to predictive game theory. I know that many of them have both published and working papers addressing these issues. Fudenberg even addresses those specific two topics. A few selections from the paper: 

The simple answer is they estimate the demand curves for each product and, using their cost structure and market characteristics (competition structure, etc.) set price to maximize profits. This is standard for any firm, though. How Google in particular and these big firms in general (Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) estimate demand curves is somewhat different than the usual economist might do it. For usual demand estimation, a researcher would have to make use of market idiosyncrasies to identify demand. For example, using supply shifters with 2SLS for basic demand estimation, BLP for discrete choice with heterogeneous products, etc. Identification is such a big issue for demand estimation because a researcher generally just observes equilibrium (p, q) combinations, not the actual demand curve. We are also often constrained purely by the amount of data available. For a big firm like Google, however, they 1) have the ability to enact exogenous perturbation in price to see how sales change and 2) have access to tons and tons of data. Using 1) they are constantly running little experiments to see how consumer behavior changes. They can then use the results to actually trace out the demand curve. In these experiments, the firm could easily take into account things like movie popularity, genre, etc. With respect to 2), Pat Bajari, chief economist at Amazon and one of the biggest names in modern empirical IO, has a (at this point) working paper with Nekipelov, Ryan, and Yang on how to use machine learning to estimate demand curves across products with lots of sample points bunches of characteristics (think thousands of product characteristics). As a "fledgling computer science researcher," you'd probably be in to this. This approach is especially relevant for people/firms with access to tons of data (like Google, Amazon, etc.) 

The primary literature concerned with this type of question (at least where classical results break down) is behavioral economics. There's a great general compilation of papers put together by the Russell Sage Foundation called the "Behavioral Economics Reading List" that includes, among other things, a General Introduction section with overview papers by some of the big movers and shakers (Camerer, Kahneman, Laibson, etc.). Many of the papers you will find through the Russell Sage paper list will be on alternative methods to classical consumer theory. If you want just the tests of assumptions/predictions, I would recommend looking through the abstracts of John Lists's papers on Testing Economic Theory. List is one of the most prolific experimentalist authors on the subject and has weighed in on most questions that other people work on in this field as well. Just reading his abstracts on that page should give you a pretty good idea of the state of the literature up through 2011 (the website isn't updated). His CV is updated, but doesn't give you the abstracts without looking up the papers individually. 

TL;DR: I think the most probable reason is a (close to) constant supply of everything and that the demand for everything is declining but we have a slower decline in demand for keys. Lets start with the supply side first: Most items (as I understood) are created by playing the game. So when you play you generate these items and as people are (obviously) playing this game they are created and we have a supply. Assuming that there is no significant change in the games that are played, we get a constant supply of "most items" (i.e., weapons, metals) $s_n$. Keys however, are bought by players. I am assuming that players will also buy a constant amount of keys $s_k$ (which is probably not true, but I will discuss that later). Now the demand side: You said metal, guns and stuff like that is either used as as it is or used to create an item. You never said anything about consuming these items, so I guess (is this true?) that, once you have an item you keep it and don't need it anymore. Therefore, if the player base is not increasing fast enough, the demand will decrease at a certain rate $d_n$. The key are used to generate items of 3 different kinds (I hope I got that right): normal items (like above), hats (which can not be found and are pretty rare) and consumable items (like MvM). Normal items have a change in demand which is $d_n$ (as we defined it like that), hats have a slower decrease in demand, as they are a) more rare (and therefore more people still need them) and b) are randomly created (which means if one wants one specific (but very rare item) one has to open many chests), therefore their decrease in demand is lower $d_h < d_n$. The last item we can get is consumable, so I think it is save to assume that here the demand is also not decreasing that much as they are consumed, i.e. $d_c < d_n$. Combining demand and supply So, what do we have? We have seen, that the difference between the change in supply $s_n$ and the change in demand $d_n$ of normal goods (lets call it $e_n = s_n - d_n$) is negative, so there if there would have been a (real and fixed) currency in this universe, the price would be dropping. What about keys? Here we also have that the difference is decreasing, but at a much slower rate (as $e_k = s_k - d_k < s_k - d_n = s_n-d_n$). Therefore the relative price of keys, compared to the price of normal goods should be increasing. Why has it just started now? There could me many reasons for that, some of them could be: 

Most of the literature on "Strategic experimentation" (or Bandits) uses Poisson processes. Here players can use either a risky or safe arm and one of them generates a fixed stream of payoffs (usually the safe arm) the other one generates lump-sum payments whose arrival times are described by a Poisson process. Some examples are: Klein, Nicolas, and Sven Rady. "Negatively correlated bandits." The Review of Economic Studies (2011). Keller, Godfrey, and Sven Rady. "Strategic experimentation with Poisson bandits." Theoretical Economics 5.2 (2010): 275-311. Keller, Godfrey, Sven Rady, and Martin Cripps. "Strategic experimentation with exponential bandits." Econometrica 73.1 (2005): 39-68.
