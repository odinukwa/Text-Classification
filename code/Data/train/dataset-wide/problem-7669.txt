Yes. $\delta(\epsilon)/\epsilon$ is nondecreasing on $[0,2]$, so once $\delta(\epsilon)$ is nonzero it is strictly increasing. See T. Figiel, On the moduli of convexity and smoothness, Studia Math. 56 (1976), 121â€“155. 

Is there a standard term for a metric space in which $\rho(p,r) < \rho(p,q) + \rho(q,r)$ for any distinct $p$, $q$, $r$? Sort of the opposite of metric convexity. For instance, a subset of euclidean space with the inherited distance function has this property if and only if no three points are colinear. Another example: $\rho^\alpha$ has this property for any metric $\rho$ and any $\alpha \in (0,1)$. (Context: I'm working on the second edition of my book Lipschitz Algebras, and I realized that a property I called "concavity" in the first edition is equivalent to this simple condition.) 

I have an idea for a possible counterexample to the noncommutative Stone-Weierstrass problem. A good answer to the following question would really help. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the C*-algebra of $2\times 2$ complex matrices, let $\mathcal{B}$ be the C*-subalgebra of $2\times 2$ diagonal matrices, and let $v$ and $w$ be the unit vectors $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$ and $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$, respectively. Then $f: A \mapsto \langle Av,v\rangle$ and $g: A \mapsto \langle Aw,w\rangle$ are pure states on $\mathcal{A}$. They are distinct, but $f(A) = g(A)$ for all $A \in \mathcal{B}$: we say that $\mathcal{B}$ fails to separate $f$ and $g$. I would like to find a C*-algebra $\mathcal{A}'$ which (unitally) contains $\mathcal{A}$ together with a C*-subalgebra $\mathcal{B}'$ which contains $\mathcal{B}$, such that $\mathcal{B}'$ separates any extensions $f'$ and $g'$ of $f$ and $g$ to states on $\mathcal{A}'$. This could be trivially accomplished by setting $\mathcal{A}' = \mathcal{B}' = \mathcal{A}$, so let me add one more condition. Let $P = \left[\matrix{1&1\cr1&1}\right]$ and observe that the distance from $P$ to $\mathcal{B}$ is $1$. (Evaluation in the $(1,2)$ matrix entry is a norm one linear functional on $\mathcal{A}$ which takes the value $1$ on $P$ and is zero on $\mathcal{B}$. Conversely, the distance from $P$ to the identity matrix is $1$.) To prevent trivial solutions to my problem, I impose the additional requirement that the distance from $P$ to $\mathcal{B}'$ must still be $1$. 

"Why not simply use Bochner spaces like $C(X;L^2(\Omega))$?" --- do you mean that this would be the space of continuous sections of the bundle with fiber $L^2(\Omega)$? Yes, that is correct if the bundle is trivial, i.e., a bundle of the form $X \times H$ where $H$ is the fiber Hilbert space. But of course not all bundles have this form. A natural class of examples where the bundle is usually not trivial arises when $X$ is a Riemannian manifold and the fiber at a point is the tangent space there. Each tangent space carries an inner product, so this is a Hilbert bundle. "Is the constant rank condition necessary in order to put a continuous structure on the bundle?" --- yes. It's hard to see how to reasonably topologize a bundle whose fibers could vary in dimension. One does sometimes consider "dimension drop" conditions where you only consider sections which, say, vanish at some point, or lie in a proper subspace of the fiber at some point. "Is it true that the constant rank condition is not imposed on measurable Hilbert bundles because measurability is a weaker condition that allows for variation of fibers?" --- again, I basically agree. This setting is very different from the topological setting; measurable sections will be totally insensitive to any global topological features of a bundle. So one can just take a measurable Hilbert bundle over a measure space $X$ to be something of the form $\bigcup (X_n\times H_n)$, with $n$ ranging over $\mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$, $(X_n)$ a measurable partition of $X$, and $H_n$ an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space. (The nonseparable setting introduces some bad pathology, so I prefer to stick to the separable case.) While I'm on the subject, measurable Hilbert bundles provide a setting for spectral theory that nicely accomodates multiplicity: $\bullet$ If $A$ is a (bounded or unbounded) self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $H$, then there is a measurable Hilbert bundle over the spectrum of $A$, and an isometric isomorphism between $H$ and the $L^2$ sections of this bundle which turns $A$ into multiplication by $x$. $\bullet$ If $\mathcal{A} \subset B(H)$ is a separable abelian C*-algebra then there is a metrizable locally compact Hausdorff space $X$, a Borel measurable Hilbert bundle over $X$, and an isometric isomorphism between $H$ and the $L^2$ sections of the bundle which turns $\mathcal{A}$ into the set of multiplication operators by functions in $C_0(X)$. $\bullet$ If $\mathcal{M} \subseteq B(H)$ is an abelian von Neumann algebra, then there is a metrizable locally compact Hausdorff space $X$, a Borel measurable Hilbert bundle over $X$, and an isometric isomorphism between $H$ and the $L^2$ sections of the bundle which turns $\mathcal{M}$ into the set of multiplication operators by functions in $L^\infty(X)$. I would say that these statements cleanly exhibit the way the abstract C${}^*$- and von Neumann algebras are situated within $B(H)$. (Details can be found in my book Measure Theory and Functional Analysis.) 

The answer is yes if you additionally assume $G$ is first countable. I claim that for any open neighborhood $U$ of $0$ there exists a symmetric open neighborhood $V$ of $0$ such that $nV \subseteq U$ for all $n \in {\bf N}$. This implies that $H = \bigcup_{n \in {\bf N}} nV$ is an open subgroup of $U$, as desired. To prove the claim, suppose it fails and let $U$ be an open neighborhood of $0$ such that every symmetric open neighborhood $V$ of $0$ satisfies $nV \not\subseteq U$ for some $n$. Let $(V_i)$ be a neighborhood base at $0$ and wlog (replacing $V_i$ with $V_i \cap -V_i$) assume each $V_i$ is symmetric. Then for each $i$ we can find a finite sequence $s_i$ of elements of $V_i$ whose sum is not in $U$. Concatenating the $s_i$ yields a sequence of elements which converges to $0$, but whose sum does not converge. To see the second assertion, let $W$ be a neighborhood of $0$ such that $W - W \subseteq U$ and let $z \in G$. For each $i$ let $x_i$ be the sum of the sequence $s_1\hat{\phantom{.}}s_2\hat{\phantom{.}}\cdots\hat{\phantom{.}}s_i$. If $x_i \in z + W$ then $x_{i+1} - x_i = \sum s_{i+1} \not\in U$, so that $x_{i+1} \not\in z + W$. Thus the sequence $(x_i)$ cannot converge to $z$, and $z$ was arbitrary. This contradicts the hypothesis on $G$, so the claim is proven. 

This is known as the Arens-Eells space $AE(X)$. In the nonlinear Banach space literature it's also called the Lipschitz-free space $\mathcal{F}(X)$. It is not a dual space in general, but rather the predual of the space ${\rm Lip}_0(X)$ of Lipschitz functions which vanish at $x_0$. In some cases it is a dual space. For instance, if $X$ is a compact metric space and $0 < \alpha < 1$, let $X^\alpha$ be the set $X$ equipped with the "Holder" or "snowflake" metric $\rho^\alpha$. In this case $AE(X^\alpha)$ is the dual of the space of "little" Lipschitz functions which are locally flat. The space $AE(X)$ is characterized abstractly by its universal property: there is a natural isometric embedding of $X$ in $AE(X)$ (in your formulation, take the point $p$ to the Dirac measure at $p$ minus the Dirac measure at $x_0$), and for any Banach space $E$ and any Lipschitz function $f: X \to E$ which takes $x_0$ to $0$ there is a unique bounded linear extension $T: AE(X) \to E$. Moreover, $\|T\| = Lip(f)$. You can find out all you want about this space in Chapter 2 of my book Lipschitz Algebras. 

(1) No. The Calkin algebra contains an uncountable family of mutually orthogonal nonzero projections. (2) Yes. Embed $B(H)$ into $B(H \otimes H)$ by the map $A \mapsto A \otimes I$, then pass to $Q(H\otimes H) \cong Q(H)$. (3) No. The Calkin algebra is simple. 

I don't know anything about almost primes, but I think you're mistaken not to send your paper to people in the field. If you're afraid of someone stealing your idea, I wouldn't worry --- having already submitted it to a journal establishes your priority (besides the fact that having your idea stolen seems very unlikely in this situation). A much more likely outcome is that your paper won't be read. However, if you do the research to find people who would be interested in this exact problem --- which, if you have internet, should be easy --- you increase the chance of being read. Being polite and asking for suggestions could also be more likely to produce a helpful response. Most professional mathematicians are not interested in stealing your ideas, but are very interested in encouraging others who share similar interests. Approach others with this in mind. 

This is answered on the first page of Cuntz's paper "K-Theory for Certain C*-Algebras" (Ann. of Math. 113 (1981), 181-197). If you google "cuntz algebra k-theory" it is the first result. 

However, the answer is yes if the entries of $X$ commute. Then you can treat them as continuous functions on some LCH space, and evaluating at any point of that space gives you a scalar matrix with positive entries. Any eigenvalue of any of these matrices will belong to the spectrum of $X$. 

Yes, although the terminology is unusual this is standard. The compactifications of $X$ correspond to quotients of $\beta X$ which correspond to closed subalgebras of $C(\beta X) \cong BC(X)$. For example, see Theorem 3.55 of my book Measure Theory and Functional Analysis. If you don't care to look it up, the idea is to define an equivalence relation on $\beta X$ by setting $x \sim y$ if $f(x) = f(y)$ for all $f \in \mathcal{F}$. The key point is that this is a closed equivalence relation --- it is closed as a subset of $\beta X \times \beta X$ --- and this implies that $\beta X/\sim$ is compact Hausdorff (not as obvious as it looks and a good exercise; Theorem 1.45 of my book).
