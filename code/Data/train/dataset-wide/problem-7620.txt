I cannot omit mentionning the work of Jeff Weeks, which is way more complete than mine: $URL$ Click on Kaleidotile, this program can do tilings on the sphere, the Euclidean plane and the hyperbolic plane. There is a binary for MacOS and Windows and a source code. 

Now I feel shy because there are some people watching that really know what they are talking about, unlike me. So a word of warning: anything I am going to write here may be too optimistic (or stupid). It is certainly extremely vague. With that said, the point of view I refer to is: consider the domain of f as a Riemann surface over the target. By this I mean that you can reconstruct dom(f) by patching pieces of the target using f to understand how to glue things. A the level of critical point, you have to remove the critical value and add several copies of the pieces that you may have to cut. This is already idealistic since there are also asymptotic values (points whose preimage is "at infinity", more rigorously, points $a$ in the range such that there is a path in the domain tending to the boundary of dom(f) and whose image by f tends to $a$). The prototype of the latter is the point 0 in the range of f=the exponential map, where a preimage of a neighborhood of 0 is an infinite cover over a punctured disk. But it may be less nice. Some more heuristics: the infinity of C is small, the infinity of D is big. In fact, you can recompose D by patching many copies of a single compact patch, exponentially many as you wander off to the boundary of D, if you count the distance by how many patches you need to cross. Archetypical examples: 

I'm not sure if this specific claim is stated explicitly anywhere, but it follows from the more general discussion about intermediate extensions in Jech, page 247. If we take any $x \in L[r]$, then there is a complete subalgebra $A$ of the random algebra associated to $\dot{x}$, with the property that $L[x]=L[G_r \cap A]$. But any complete subalgebra of a measure algebra is also a measure algebra. So $A$ is isomorphic to random forcing. 

Axiom: $0^\sharp$ exists. $0^\sharp$ is a pivotal principle in the large cardinal hierarchy, but it is actually a set of natural numbers. If it exists, it is unique. 

It is a (folklore?) fact that if $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal, and $\mathbb{P}$ is a $\kappa$-closed poset such that $\Vdash_\mathbb{P} |\mathbb{P}| = \kappa$, then $\mathbb{P}$ is equivalent to $Col(\kappa,\mathbb{P})$, the collection of partial functions from $\kappa$ to $\mathbb{P}$ of size $<\kappa$, ordered by inclusion. Hence if $\mathbb{P}$ is any $\kappa$-closed forcing, then $\mathbb{P} \times Col(\kappa,\mathbb{P}) \sim Col(\kappa,\mathbb{P})$, so $\mathbb{P}$ is completely embeddable into $\mathcal{B}(Col(\kappa,\mathbb{P}))$. If $\mathbb{P}$ is $\kappa$-strategically closed (following the notation from Cummings' chapter of the Handbook of Set Theory, not Jech's book), then one can show that $\mathbb{P}$ is completely embeddable into $\mathcal{B}(Col(\kappa,\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{P})))$, since after forcing with this collapse we can use the strategy to build a filter on $\mathbb{P}$ that is generic over the ground model. It is not clear to me whether we can always embed such $\mathbb{P}$ into the smaller forcing $Col(\kappa,\mathbb{P})$. Question: Are there counterexamples to the statement, "If $\kappa$ is regular and $\mathbb{P}$ is $\kappa$-strategically closed, then there is a complete embedding of $\mathbb{P}$ into $\mathcal{B}(Col(\kappa,\mathbb{P}))$? 

Curiously enough, I asked myself the same question several days ago... I couldn't settle it; yet, resorting to Jacques Touchard's theorem on the form of odd perfect numbers (cf. J. A. Holdener, "A theorem of Touchard on the form of odd perfect numbers". Amer. Math. Monthly, vol. 109, issue 7 (Aug. - Sep., 2002), pp. 661-663), one can easily establish the following result: Proposition. If $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is and odd perfect number, then $n \equiv 1 \pmod{24}$ or $n \equiv 9 \pmod{72}$ or $n \equiv 17 \pmod{72}$. 

Hello, Is anyone here aware of a well-motivated exposition of the Bourgain-Glibichuk-Konyagin estimate for exponential sums (or Gauss sums) over multiplicative subgroups? If any of you has a write-up on the subject, I would be more than glad to have an opportunity to take a look at it. Thank you very much! 

E. S. Pondiczery was a pseudonym used by R. P. Boas, Jr. in the paper Power problems in abstract spaces. The name became part of the well-known Hewitt-Marczewski-Pondiczery theorem. Another pseudonym used by Boas (and F. Smithies) was H. Pétard. I highly recommend that you take a look at the hilarious Lion hunting and other mathematical pursuits (A collection of mathematics, verse, and stories by the late Ralph P. Boas, Jr.) for more information in this regard. Added (Nov 7/2010). In that book you can also learn about other pseudonyms (for instance, Ian Stewart's one) and the memorable feud 'twixt Bourbaki and Boas. Added (Nov 8/2010). According to page 10 of the aforementioned book, H. Pétard was in fact a pseudonym that Boas and Smithies made up for the use of E. S. Pondiczery. 

Two questions were asked Concerning question I: Here's an application for my favorite bijection! Consider R the group of reals with addition and its subgroup Q of rationals. The group R mod Q has the same cardinality as R does (I guess you need the axiom of choice here). Let $\phi$ be a bijection from R mod Q to R. Let $f^t$ be the conjugate by $\phi$ of the translation by t in R mod Q. For all $t \in Q$ and all $x \in R$, $f^t(x)=x$. Concerning question II: (Corrected from my previous wrong claim) For X finite, then your assumptions imply that all $f^t$ are the same map and are a projection (a solution $p$ of $p\circ p=p$). In particular, your claim is true if $X$ is finite. Proof: let $n=|X|$, and notice that $f^t$ is for all k>1 the k-th iterate of a map $g:X\to X$ with $g=f^{t/k}$. Apply this to $k=n!$. I claim that $g^{n!}$ is a projection. Indeed consider any $x\in X$. Its orbit by $g$ consists in a tail of length $a\in\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$ followed by a cycle of length $b\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, and $a+b\leq n$. So $g^{a}(x)$ has period $b$ dividing $n!$. As $n!\geq a$, the point $y=g^{n!}(x)$ is also a $g$-periodic point of period dividing $n!$, so it is fixed by $g^b$. Since $b$ divides $n!$, the point $y$ is fixed by $g^{n!}$. This proves the claim. Hence for all $t$, $f^t$ is a projection. Now consider two positive reals $s<t$. Then $f^t=f^s\circ f^{t-s}$ so the image of $f^t$ is contained in the image of $f^s$. But the image of $f^t$ is the same as the image of $f^{t/k}$ for all $k$ because the latter is also a projection. Since there is some $k$ so that $t/k<s$, we get that the image of $f^s$ is contained in the image of $f^{t/k}$ i.e. in the image of $f^t$. Since projections are characterized by their images, we are done. 

An ultrafilter $U$ is $(\mu,\kappa)$-regular if there is a sequence $\langle X_\alpha : \alpha < \kappa \rangle \subseteq U$ such that for all $y \in [\kappa]^\mu$, $\bigcap_{\alpha \in y} X_\alpha = \emptyset$. Countable incompleteness is equivalent to $(\omega,\omega)$-regularity, and for every $\kappa$, there is always an $(\omega,\kappa)$-regular ultrafilter. The failure of $(\omega,\omega_1)$-regularity for an ultrafilter on $\omega_1$ is consistent relative to large cardinals, and carries some large cardinal strength. In the 1970s, Kanamori proved that if $\lambda$ is singular, then every ultrafilter on $\lambda^+$ is $(\lambda,\lambda^+)$-regular. Question: Is it known whether Kanamori's result can be improved to, "If $\lambda$ is singular, then every ultrafilter on $\lambda^+$ is $(\kappa,\lambda^+)$-regular for some $\kappa < \lambda$"? What about in the case $\lambda=\aleph_\omega$? 

Suppose $\kappa$ is inaccessible (or more). Does there exist a $\kappa$-c.c. partial order $\mathbb P \subseteq V_\kappa$ that forces $\kappa = \aleph_1$, with the following property?-- Whenever $G \subseteq \mathbb P$ is generic over $V$, there does not exist any $H \not= G$ in $V[G]$ which is also $\mathbb P$-generic over $V$. 

It depends on the function $f : i \mapsto |A_i|$. The ultraproduct $\prod A_i/ U$ has the same cardinality as $\prod f(i)/U$. $f$ represents an ordinal $\alpha <j(\kappa)$ in the ultrapower $M$ of the universe $V$, where $j : V \to M$ is the canonical embedding. It's a standard fact that $2^\kappa < j(\kappa) < (2^\kappa)^+$. So the cardinality of $\prod f(i)/U$ is $|\alpha|$, which can be anything between $\kappa$ and $2^\kappa$, because we can select an $f$ corresponding to each such $\alpha$. For example, if $f$ is the identity function, then the ultraproduct has size $\kappa$. If $f(i) = i^+$ for $U$-almost all $i$, then $\prod f(i) / U = \kappa^+$. 

The automorphism group of the symmetric group $S_n$ is (isomorphic to) $S_n$ when $n$ is different from $2$ or $6$. In fact, if $G$ is a complete group you can ascertain that $G \simeq \mathrm{Aut}(G)$. The reverse implication needn't hold, though. 

I guess you can find plenty of them in the Problem Department of the American Mathematical Monthly. For instance, here is a nice one by M. Hajja and P. Walker: Evaluate $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{1} (1+u^{2}+v^{2}+w^{2})^{-2} du dv dw $. Good thing about this one is that there may exist a CAS out there that does not give you the answer at once. 

This one will be quick... Wonder if anybody knows or remembers the title of the paper in which Karatsuba introduced his approach at Burgess's bound on character sums. Thanks for your support. EDIT. It might have been in "Sums of characters and primitive roots in finite fields". Since this appeared in Russian in Dokl. Akad. Nauk. SSSR, would any of you guys be so kind as to provide us with a review of the translation that, according to MathSciNet, appeared in Soviet Math. Dokl. 9 (1968), 755–757? Thanks again. ADDED. I've been trying to get a copy of the corresponding issue of the Soviet Mathematics Doklady in the libraries to which I have access (real or virtual). It all has been to no avail. Does any of you know if there is a possibility to get a copy of it through the AMS? I recently took at look at ams.org to find out, but I didn't find info regarding the acquisition of back issues of the said journal. 

Another solution can be obtained by adding many reals and using a lemma of Spencer Unger that generalizes the lemma used by Silver. 

I completely agree with you. It is important for everyone to be exposed to proofs, because it shows them what math is really about--reasoning, not computation. The mathematical way of thinking is very valuable for developing general critical thinking skills and the most careful and precise reasoning. I believe there is no substitute. You also hit the nail on the head when you point out that Euclidian geometry is a great medium for learning what proofs are all about. The subject matter connects with intuition, and the propositions and arguments are easily seen to be well-motivated and accessible to the novice. As you mention, it is empirically found to be hard to do proofs for the beginner with other topics. How can we expect our undergraduates to do well when the secondary education is lacking in the prerequisite training? If mathematics education is an appropriate topic of discussion here, then certainly the relation of high school curriculum to the preparedness of undergraduates is relevant. 

For a year I have been giving lectures on a (probalby) new way to present an explicit sphere eversion. These lectures include a review of many other explicit eversions that have been described, as text, drawings or even computer generated movies, since Smale proved his theorem. During these lectures, I have been frequently asked the following question: are these eversions all equivalent? I suppose the meaning of this question is: can you deform one eversion into another? A more general question is: What is the $\pi_1$ of the space $I$ of immersions of $S^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$? Recall that Smale proved that $I$ is connected so that there is a path from the canonical embedding to the antipodal embedding, which is the definition of a sphere eversion. The set of all eversions up to homotopy is in (non canonical) bijection with the $\pi_1$ above. If the latter were trivial, then all eversions would be equivalent, and conversely. But as far as I have understood, it is not the case. 

To be more precise I am interested in questions similar to the one below (I asked the question below on math.stackexchange last week but got not answer.) I have a $C^1$ function $f:[0,1]^2 \to \mathbb{R}$. The arclength of the graph of $f_y:x\mapsto f(x,y)$ is $$L(y)=\int_0^1 \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)\right)^2} dx$$ Deriving under the integral does not seem to be possible since it would involve a crossed derivative $\partial^2 f/\partial x\partial y$ whose existence is not assumed. Hence I do not expect L to always be a $C^1$ function of y. But so far I have not been able to find a counterexample. This question must have been already looked at. Any idea? 

Is there a notion of supercompactness of a cardinal $\kappa$ that implies the following? For every sequence $\langle \alpha_i : i < \kappa \rangle \subseteq \kappa$ and every $i_0 < \kappa$, there is an elementary embedding $j : V \to M$ such that if $\lambda = j(\langle \alpha_i : i < \kappa \rangle)(\kappa + i_0)$, then $M^\lambda \subseteq M$. This works with almost-hugeness, but I’m wondering if there is an intermediate notion (which already has a definition, or a simpler one that just stating the above). 

This is answered in chapter 2 of my thesis. As far as I know, this is essentially the only method for obtaining such ideals. I am very interested in finding alternative constructions. Please contact me if you have some ideas. 

Almost-huge cardinals are characterizable in terms of coherent towers of supercompactness measures, with a certain property of the direct limit model (see Kanamori's book). A useful large cardinal hypothesis between almost-huge and huge is the assertion that a cardinal has an almost-hugeness towers of unbounded height. The most natural name for this would be "super-almost-huge," but that sounds too awkward to me. I was thinking "ultracompact" might be good because of its affinity with supercompactness. So my question is, is this a bad choice of terminology for some reason, or did someone already give a name to this hypothesis? 

Erdős and Diamond proved in [1] that Chebyshev could have achieved sharper bounds for the asymptotic behavior of the prime counting function. Nevertheless, their proof does not shed any light on the first question that you posed because they took the PNT for granted throughout their note. References: [1] H. G. Diamond; P. Erdős. On sharp elementary prime number estimates, Enseign. Math. (2) 26 (1980) 313-321. 

There are only three terms of the Fibonacci sequence which are equal to a factorial: $$F_{1}= F_{2} = 0!=1! \quad \mbox{and} \quad F_{3}=2!$$ What is more, F. Luca proved in this paper (published in 1999) that the only nontrivial solutions of the diophantine equation $$F_{n} = m_{1}! \cdots m_{t}!$$ are $F_{3}=2!$, $F_{6}=(2!)^{3}$, and $F_{12} = (2!)^{2}(3!)^{2} = 3! 4!$. 

Can any of you guys help me to find out if there is a retrodigitized copy of M. Ram Murty's 1976 thesis available on the online database of Carleton University Library? I really hope this question is appropriate for MO. Thanks in advance for your replies. Sources 

The relation used by Matiyasevich (Matijasevich, Матиясевич), the one to which N. Takenov alluded above/below, is the following: If $F_{n}^{2}|F_{m}$ then $F_{n}|m$ ...... (20) In the 1992 Fall issue of the Intelligencer there was a note by Matiyasevich where he explained, among other things, the importance of that relation on his work concerning Hilbert's tenth problem. Here you have an excerpt from that note: "It is not difficult to prove this remarkable property of Fibonacci numbers after it has been stated, but it seems that this beautiful fact was not discovered until 1969. My original proof of (20) was based on a theorem proved by the Soviet mathematician N. Vorob'ev in 1942 but published only in the third argumented (sic) edition of his popular book [on the Fibonacci sequence]... I studied the new edition of Vorob'ev book in the summer of 1969 and that theorem attracted my attention at once. I did not deduce (20) at that time, but after I read Julia Robinson's paper I immediately saw that Vorob'ev's theorem could be very useful. Julia Robinson did not see the third edition of Vorob'ev's book until she received a copy from me in 1970. Who can tell what would have happened if Vorob'ev had included his theorem in the first edition of his book? Perhaps, Hilbert's tenth problem would have been "unsolved" a decade earlier!" 

By chance I wrote, not long ago, the following applet (HTML5+JS+WebGL) that works at least on Firefox and Chrome. $URL$ This work is CC-BY-SA, including the code, but NOT the image by Escher, for which I have not asked permission: you can probably use it a few times in conferences (fair use) but not in a permanent publication (and I will eventually have to remove this image or to create a variant of my own, like Valdimir Bulatov). 

In short: D is hyperbolic, C is parabolic (this is very vague, I know; there is at least one thing that makes me uneasy about all this presentation of things: that C nevertheless contains D.). Now, anytime you have an island, you have a patch that is a copy of the domain D$_i$. If you start from a point in the domain, mapped in D$_i$, and try to lift D$_i$ by f and hit a problem, is may be because you need to put a ramification point, so this increases the number of patches you need... kind of... in fact you will probalbyhave to cut your patch into smaller pieces, because of more ramification points: but then the heuristics is that it only improves things (it makes dom(f) more hyperbolic). If the problem is not due to a ramification point, then it there is an asymptotic value, and again this leads to many patches: in some sense, it is even more hyperbolic than just having ramification points. If $f$ is transcendental and some D$_i$ has only finitely many islands, then close enough to the boundary of dom(f), it is a bit like there is no islands. By the discussion above other preimages will be ramified, or worse. Now if there are enough D$_i$ with this property, then the game is to see that, on a purely combinatorial level, there must at least an exponential growth of the patches (this is idealistic but this gives an idea): this is what happens with the two examples above. Let us look at an example that works not: cos(z). Its critical points are points of $\pi\mathbb Z$, half of which get mapped to -1 the other half to 1. There is no asymptotic value (in fact, infinity is). The number of patches (whatever that means) grows linearly with the combinatorial distance. More precisely if you take D$_1$ and D$_2$ two disks about -1 and 1, their preimages are all ramified of ramification number=2. Join them by a line. Then the preimage of this picture is many disks-like domains at all the points of $\pi\mathbb Z$ all joined to the next by a line. This graph is more "euclidean" than "hyperbolic". Now if you have three domains D$_i$, take a point outside and link this point to each D$_i$ by disjoint curves, giving a Y-shaped picture with three disks attached at the tips. Ideally, the preimage of this graph contains (infinitely) many copies of this Y-shaped curve with disks at tips and to each of these disk (with finitely many exceptions) is attached at least two distinct copies of a Y. Such a graph is necessarily hyperbolic. Again, I do not know the proof of Ahlfors' theorems, and I completely forgot the proof of Bloch's theorem, so all this may be far from the actual proofs. This is just my point of view on things.
