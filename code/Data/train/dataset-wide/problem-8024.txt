When reviewing my notes and Serre's book "Galois Cohomology" Chapter 5 dealing with non-abelian group cohomology, I realized that I don't fully understand the concept of biprincipal spaces such as a-(A,B)-space (defined in page 49). I think that what Serre ment is that is a G-set P with two G-groups A and B such that: $\forall p,q \in P : \exists ! a \in A : q=a*p$ $\forall p,q \in P : \exists !b \in B : q=p*b$ $\forall p \in P , a \in A , b \in B: (a*p)*b=a*p*b=a*(p*b)$ (A and B action commutes) Then he talks about composition of such spaces: if P is a (A,A')-space and Q is a (A',A'')-space then $P \circ Q = P \times ^{A'}Q $ which he claims has a (A',A'')-space structure. If so, for what is this composition is good for? Q is already a (A',A'')-space. Serre defines $ P \times ^AF$ as follows: let A be a G-group, let P be a principal homogeneous space on which A acts from the right and F a G-set on which A acts from the left. Then it is a quotient space of $P \times F$ induced by the following equivalence relation: $ (p,f) \sim (p*a, a^{-1}*f) $ for all $a \in A$. He uses the construction of biprincipal spaces and their compositions in several instances (instead of using the cocycles language), such as in the proof of Proposition 35 and in the construction of fibers for normal subgroup in page 52. I wonder if there are some examples which I hope will give me a feel of this construction and another good text about it. Moreover, translation of this biprincipal spaces to a cocycles language, given that $P \times ^AF \cong _a F$ by using a cocycle $a_s$ to twist F: $^s \prime f = a_s \cdot ^s f$ which can be defined for $p \in P$ by $ s \mapsto a_s \mbox{ such that } ^s p = p * a_s$ and the mapping $ f \mapsto [(p,f)]$ induces $P \times ^AF \cong _a F$, would be helpful.

@Wilberd van der Kallen : The comment option doesn't work for me right now (probably because I am logged from two different computers) so I write here. I think I understand that by left invariance a function vanishing in $H$ can be checked for $e$ only, since $$ \delta \lambda_h f(x) = \lambda_h \delta f(x) $$ and we may factor $x = he$ for $x \in H$. Tell me if that is correct. However, I don't understand the $m / m^2$ construction, and why it represents the module (I know that $m/m^2$ is a representive element with $\delta f(x) = f - f(e)$ but don't understand the implementation to a given derivative module, how to represent the general derivative by $\delta$). (in the general case: let $B = A \oplus M$ direct sum of mudules where $A \subset B$ and $M$ is a maximal ideal in the ring. Then we defined $$\pi_A : B \to A \ ; \ \pi_A(a+m)=a$$ and $\delta (f) = (f - \pi_A(f))$ and then $M/M^2$ is a representative for a derivative module, since $\delta$ is a derivative.). I also don't understand what do you mean by $m$-adic completion. Thanks and sorry for the late answer. 

One problem in the proof is that $\operatorname{pd}_R(R/I)$ might be infinite, so you can't apply Auslander-Buchsbaum the final time. I can't seem to come up with an example where $M$ has finite projective dimension while $\operatorname{ann} M$ has infinite projective dimension, but they must exist. Later: The famous Dutta-Hochster-McLaughlin example does the trick. It is a module $M$ of finite projective dimension over $R = k[x,y,z,w]/(xy-zw)$, with annihilator $(x,y,z,w)^3 + (x,z)$. 

I had pretty much forgotten, but Craig Huneke and I needed to know something about traces a few years ago, and couldn't find a good reference, so we put some facts as an appendix in this paper. Our context forced us to define the trace of a module, rather than an algebra, but of course you can just ignore the algebra structure on $B$. The setup for us was this: Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring and $M$ a finitely generated torsion-free $R$-module. The trace of $M$ is an $R$-homomorphism $\mathrm{End}_R(M) \to R$, which matches the one you're describing if $M$ is free. It's obtained as follows: let $\alpha : Hom(M,R)\otimes_R M \rightarrow End(M)$ be the natural homomorphism defined by $\alpha(f\otimes x)(y) = f(y) \cdot x$. If the dual of $\alpha$, that is $\alpha^*$, is an isomorphism from $Hom(End_R(M),R)$ to $End_R(Hom(M,R))$, then the trace of $M$ is $(\alpha*)^{-1}$ of the identity on $Hom(M,R)$. We say then that $M$ "has a trace." [Exercise: if $M$ has $R$-torsion, then the trace of $M$ is the same as the trace of $M/\mathrm{torsion}$, so defining the trace in the torsion-free situation is enough.] Now, here's the sufficient condition we needed (Prop A.2): if $R$ satisfies $(S_2)$ and $M_p$ is free over $R_p$ for all height-one primes $p$, then $M$ has a trace. This is a jazzed-up version of your (3), and maybe helps with (4). (Parenthetically, we also needed to know when the trace was surjective, which is where the characteristic comes in, and I conflated it with the trace existing in one of my comments earlier.) 

As soon as the dimension of $R$ is at least $1$ and $R$ is locally Gorenstein at the associated primes, then $K$ is isomorphic to an ideal of pure height $1$. In particular $K$ (as an ideal) contains a non-zerodivisor, so allows an injection $R \longrightarrow K$. If $R$ is Artinian, then $K \cong E_R(k)$ is the injective hull of the residue field, and every element is annihilated by a power of the maximal ideal, so there is no such injection. 

For elementary courses, say up to first year undergraduate or so, Khan Academy has a wide range of courses on maths (some of which are listed under computer science or physics). For graduate courses, several answers have mentioned MSRI and/or the Hausdorff institute but the Fields Institute video archive deserves a mention as well. The archive does no go back very far, but there are some excellent courses at various levels. (Search for the word "course" on the linked page). 

It sounds like you have a percolation problem. In percolation theory one has a lattice, typically in the plane or in 3-space, and each vertex is "porous" independently with probability $p$. The question is to describe the connected components of the set of porous vertices. It is common to restrict to a finite box, as in your example. One expects a similar behaviour to the Erdős–Rényi graph model, and there are many cases in which it is proved (although there may be less emphasis on the size of the small components). Edit: As Ben Barber points out in his answer, the techniques used are quite different to the Erdős–Rényi case, and one needs a much larger value of $p$ in order to expect a giant component. For some impressive-sounding real-world motivation one might imagine oil percolating through rock; it can only pass through porous areas, and the question is whether it eventually occupies a positive proportion of the rock (in which case one can drill into it and make some money). For many researchers the actual motivation is probably more to do with theoretical understanding of phase transitions. These problems are well studied, for example there are some introductory lecture notes here. On a casual inspection I cannot actually find an example where diagonal connections (cells connected only at their corners) are permitted, as in your question. Frustratingly I actually remember playing with a simulation of exactly your example in a physics lesson back in my schooldays. Maybe I can track it down. 

The answer to the question is "no". It is probably best to think in terms of projective geometry: you are asking for a set $S$ of points in projective $n-1$ space such that every hyperplane contains a point in $S$, and $S$ does not contain a hyperplane. Let $S_0$ be the union of two hyperplanes $H_1$ and $H_2$ with two points $p_1\in H_1$ and $p_2\in H_2$ removed. Let $S$ be the union of $S_0$ with a point $q$ lying on the line between $p_1$ and $p_2$. Any hyperplane not meeting $S_0$ must meet $H_1$ only in $p_1$ and $H_2$ only in $p_2$, and so must contain the line between $p_1$ and $p_2$, and hence must contain $q$. 

No. Let's work with an Artinian local ring $R$. Let $X$ be a module satisfying $\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(X,R)\neq 0$ for all $i$. (These are plentiful; for example, assume $R$ is non-Gorenstein and let $X$ be the residue field.) Define a module $Q$ by "Serre's trick": take generators $\chi_1, \dots, \chi_r$ for $\mathrm{Ext}_R^1(X,R)$ and consider the short exact sequence corresponding to $(\chi_1, \dots, \chi_r) \in \mathrm{Ext}_R^1(X,R^r)$: $$0 \to R^r \to Q \to X \to 0$$ Then $\mathrm{Ext}_R^1(Q,R) =0$, since the long exact sequence of $\mathrm{Ext}$ looks like $$\cdots \to \mathrm{Hom}_R(R^r,R) \to \mathrm{Ext}_R^1(X,R) \to \mathrm{Ext}_R^1(Q,R) \to \mathrm{Ext}_R^1(R^r,R)=0$$ and the map $\mathrm{Hom}_R(R^r,R) \to \mathrm{Ext}_R^1(X,R)$ is cooked up precisely to be surjective. On the other hand, $\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(Q,R) = \mathrm{Ext}_R^{i}(X,R) \neq 0$ for all $i\geq 2$. One can jazz this up a bit, using a result of Jorgensen-Sega (journal link): There exists a local Artinian ring $R$ and a family $\{M_s\}_{s\geq 1}$ of reflexive $R$-modules such that (among other things) $\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(M_s,R)\neq 0$ if and only if $1 \leq i \leq s-1$. They give a completely explicit construction of $R$ and the modules $M_s$. Taking one of the $M_s$ in place of $X$ above, one obtains modules $Q_{a,b}$ for which $\mathrm{Ext}_R^i(Q_{a,b},R)$ vanishes up to $i=a-1$, is nonzero for $a \leq i \leq b$, and vanishes again for $i \geq b+1$. Then taking direct sums gives essentially arbitrary behavior of vanishing and non-vanishing. 

The $A_\infty$ and $D_\infty$ plane curve singularities have defining equations $x^2=0$ and $x^2y=0$. These equations are "clearly" natural limiting cases of the equations for $A_n$ singularities $x^2 + y^{n+1}=0$ and $D_n$ singularities $x^2y+y^{n-1}=0$ as $n \to \infty$, since large powers are small in the adic topology. So we're tempted to say that $A_\infty$ and $D_\infty$ are "limits" of the "series of singularities" $\{A_n\}$ and $\{D_n\}$. This was already observed by Arnol'd in 1981, who wrote "Although the series undoubtedly exist, it is not at all clear what a series of singularities is." Have there been any attempts since Arnol'd to make sense out of the phrases in quotes in the previous paragraph? That is: 

Smith and Van den Bergh worked with it, and got some lovely results, in this paper. For example, they show that direct summands of polynomial rings have simple rings of differential operators in positive characteristic. This is still open (as far as I know) in characteristic 0. It's a particularly interesting paper for the connections it makes with representation types.
