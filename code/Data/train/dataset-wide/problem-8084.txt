Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemannian three-fold such that $H_2(M,\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}$ and $S$ any surface representing 1. By Hodge theory there exist a harmonic differential one-form $\eta$ dual to the surface $S$, meaning for all closed 2-form $\alpha$ we have : \begin{equation} \int_M \eta \wedge \alpha = \int_S \alpha \end{equation} and \begin{equation} \Delta \eta = 0 \end{equation} where $\Delta$ is the Hodge De Rham Laplacian acting on one-forms. My question is : does it possible to control the $L^1$ and the $L^2$ norm of $\eta$ with geometric quantities ? I was thinking about the following : any such $\eta$ gives an application $M \to \mathbb{S}^1$ by integrating $\eta$ on any path and takes the result modulo $\mathbb{Z}$ (it does not depend of the path by the assumptions on $\eta$ to be an integer class and being closed). Therefore, by the co-area formula, I expect the $L^1$ norm to be related to the area of surfaces representing $S$, the minimal one for instance. 

The basis $\dot{B}$ is usually hard to compute, in the same way the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis for the Hecke algebra is. On the other hand, at least for type A, there is another way to get at this basis via what you might call "quantum Schur-Weyl duality": there's a geometric construction of finite dimensional quotients of the quantum group of type sl_n due to Beilinson-Lusztig-MacPherson, each of which has a canonical basis. More recent work of Lusztig, Ginzburg and Schiffmann-Vasserot showed that these finite dimensional quotients could be put into a compatible family, from which you can recover the whole modified quantum group, and it's canonical basis. How much more explicit this realization is probably depends on what sort of question you're interested in I imagine. With regard to the crystal structure, there's a paper of Kashiwara "Crystal bases of modified quantized enveloping algebras" in Duke which studies this. He shows that the crystal structure reflects the $B\times X\times B$ parametrization you mention, and investigates a crystal basis of a "dual algebra" (a kind of quantum coordinate algebra) for which the crystal structure is a kind of Peter-Weyl theorem (at least for the finite type case). Lusztig investigates something similar in his book. 

Let $M$ a compact manifold with surfaces $S_1,...,S_p$ as boundaries. Let us suppose that $M$ admits a complete hyperbolic structure. Then, from the ending lamination theorem, given either laminations or conformal structures (the end invariants) on $S_1...S_n$ one is able to find a unique complete hyperbolic structure on $M$ with ends $E_1,...E_N$ admitting exactly these end invariants. My question is, are these invariants localized in the ends ? More precisely, given $f$ a pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism of the surface $S_1$ and its associated lamination when $f$ is iterated in positive time. Then, one can consider the hyperbolic structure given by the ending lamination theorem associated to this lamination for the surface $S_1$ and with whatever end invariants you want for the rest of the surfaces ($S_2...S_N$). Does the resulting hyperbolic structure satisfies that the end associated to $S_1$ is asymptotically isometric to a $\mathbb{Z}$-cover of a hyperbolic compact 3-fold which fibers over the circle with fiber $S_1$ and monodromy $f$ ? I know from McMullen's book (theorem 3.12) $URL$ that this is true for one degenerated end quasi-Fuchsian manifolds or, more obviously, for $\mathbb{Z}$-cover of compact manifold I wondered whether this result may be generalised. A very first question is what happens if we consider two pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms $(\Phi_1, \Phi_2)$ for which the laminations given by iterating these in positive time are in transversal position. So that the sequence of quasi-Fuchsian manifolds given in Bers coordinates by $(\Phi_1^n, \Phi_2^n)$ converges by Thurston's theorem. Can I say that the end $E_1$ (resp $E_2$) of the limit representation are asymptotically isometric to the $Z$-covering of the compact manifold which fibres over the circle of monodromy $\Phi_1$ (resp $\Phi_2)$ ? Thank you for your reading. 

You can prove it using only basic facts about continuity/compactness and the same estimate which makes the winding number/fundamental group of $S^1$ proofs work: first check that if $p(z)=z^n + a_{n-1}z^{n-1} + \ldots + a_0$ is a polynomial then $|p(z)|$ tends to infinity as $|z|$ tends to infinity (this is the "leading term dominates" estimate for large $|z|$). It follows easily that $|p|$ attains a minimum value, since outside a large disc centered at $0$ the value of $|p|$ is really big, and the disc is compact, so $|p|$ attains a minimum on it. We want this minimum value to be zero, so suppose for the sake of contradiction it isn't, then we can change coordinates if necessary so that minimum is attained at $0$, and rescale $p$ so the minimum is $1$. Then you just have to show that if $p(z) = 1+b_kz^k + \ldots + b_n z^n$ (where $k \geq 1$) then you can make $|p|$ smaller than $1$ for some nonzero $z$. But this is just the same kind of estimate as before: the term $b_kz^k$ dominates the other terms for $z$ small, and we can easily arrange for $b_kz^k$ to be a negative real giving the required contradiction. The proof has the advantage that it makes the theorem "obvious" once you have some notion of compactness in the plane, so you could use this proof pretty early in a course that talks about functions on $\mathbb R^n$ or $\mathbb C$. As I said before though, what makes the proof tick is the same as what makes the $\pi_1(S^1)$ proofs work, it just uses simpler techniques to get a contradiction. Unfortunately I have no idea who it's due to (which is why I explained it rather than giving a reference...) 

Let $M_{\Gamma}$ a Riemannian covering of a closed compact manifold $(M,g)$ with deck transformation $\Gamma$ (its neutral element will be denoted by $e$). If we denote by $p_t^{\Gamma}(x,y)$ the heat kernel associated to $M_{\Gamma}$ does the following proposition occurs : There exist a probability measure $\mu$ on $\Gamma$ such that the associated random walk on $\Gamma$ of law $\mu^{*n}$ satisfies that there exists two constants $C_1, C_2 > 0$ and a point $x \in M_{\Gamma}$ such that : $$ C_2 \mu^{*n}(e,e) \le p_n^{\Gamma}(x,x) \le C_1 \mu^{*n}(e,e) $$ 

Here is the set up : I consider the unitary tangent bundle of a surface $(S,g)$ endowed with the Sasakian metric ; $(T^1S, g_s)$, in fact we have the following fibration : \begin{equation*} \mathbb{S}^1 \to T^1 S \underset{p}{\to} S \end{equation*} where $p$ is Riemannian submersion. We also have a natural action, the rotation in the fiber, which give a structure of $\mathbb{S}^1$-principal bundle. I am interested in the eigen one-form of the Laplacian associated to the Sasakian metric, differential forms defined on $T^1S$ verifying $\Delta \omega = \lambda \omega$, with $\Delta$ the Hodge laplacian. My question is : Given all the eigenfunctions and eingenforms, let say $\eta$, associated to the Hodge Laplacian on the basis (and there pull back in $T^1S$ ,$p^*(\eta)$ ) and all the $\mathbb{S}^1$-invariant function (like the euler class for instance) does it possible to give a kind of formula which gives all the eingenforms of the Hodge Laplacian for the Sasakian metric ? Any references would be appreciated. 

I'm commenting on part 4) of your question really I think: Harish-Chandra was interested in studying the unitary dual, but in the process realized that the whole unitary structure was rather more than one needed to carry around, and moreover, that it was necessary also to consider representations which were not necessarily unitary, and in this wider context the analytic issues of when to consider two representations "equivalent" intrude more prominently (because, for example, there are lots of different kinds of function spaces on a given G-space). The notion of "admissible module" -- a module where each irreducible representation of the maximal compact subgroup occurs with finite multiplicity gave a natural class of representations which includes all unitary representations, and once in this class it is pretty natural to restrict attention to the action to the action of the Lie algebra g, and the maximal compact K (as the Lie algebra acts on K-finite vectors). Thus certainly all the motiviation for the notion of a (g,K)-module must be due to Harish-Chandra, but I'm not sure if he actually abstracts the idea in his papers. I can't tell from BGG's original paper if they are thinking of category O in the context of (g,K)-modules: their stated motivation is much more from modular representation theory. One nice reference for the representations of real groups is the book "Representation Theory of Lie groups" from the Park City summer school -- for example there's an article by Knapp and Trapa which discusses the work of Harish-Chandra. Also, I'd just like to mention that the idea of considering the pair (g,K) where g is the Lie algebra and K is the maximal compact of a real Lie group G is quite natural if one considers that the g action contains the infinitesimal information while the maximal K is a retract of G, and so one could hope that its action captures enough of the "global" information in the representation. (I think it was Graeme Segal who pointed this out to me -- perhaps an obvious comment for him, but I found it insightful and at least psychologically useful). 

Let $X$ be a Cartan-Hadamard manifold, meaning a complete, connected, simply connected Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature and $\Gamma < Isom(X)$ a discrete group of isometries of $X$. On can define the orbital function as follows $$ N_{\Gamma}(x,\rho) := \sharp \{ \gamma \in \Gamma \ , \ d(x, \gamma \cdot x) \le \rho \} $$ where $d$ is the distance on $X$ induced by the metric. We will denote by $V(x, \rho)$ the volume of a ball centered at $x$ of radius $\rho$. All the examples of orbital functions I have in mind (action of $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}^2$ on the plane, fundamental groups of finite volume hyperbolic manifolds and their abelian covers, convex-cocompact group actions...) satisfy that the following function $$ \frac{N_{\Gamma}(x, \rho)}{V(x, \rho)} $$ is equivalent when $\rho \to \infty$ to a decreasing function. So that I wondered if this property may be more general. Here is then my question, does the previous property always occur ? One can relax a bit the previous property as follow. There exists $\rho_0 \in \mathbb{R}_+$ such that there exists a constant $C>0$ such that for all $\rho_2 \ge \rho_1 \ge \rho_0$ we have : $$ \frac{N_{\Gamma}(x, \rho_2)}{V(x, \rho_2)} \le C \hspace{0.3cm} \frac{N_{\Gamma}(x, \rho_1)}{V(x, \rho_1)} \ .$$ From the homogeneity that enjoys the orbit $\Gamma \cdot x$, it seems quite natural to me that it actually holds, at least when the group is finitely generated, but I don't know how to get into it. Does someone has either a reference/an idea toward a proof or a counter example to this ? Thank you for your reading. 

This goes back to Jimbo I think. A reference is: "A q-difference analogue of $U(\mathfrak g)$, Hecke algebra and the Yang-Baxter equation'', Lett. Math. Phys. 11 (1986). It has been much studied though, so there are lots of subsequent papers, some of which might be closer to what you are looking for? For example this paper studies an analogue of Schur-Weyl duality for "walled Brauer algebras", and this paper studies a two-parameter version. 

This is perhaps overkill for your question, but there is a classification for the simple modules of an interesting family of affine Hecke algebras even with (certain) unequal parameters due to Lusztig. The proof is different from the one in the original case by Kazhdan and Lusztig, using equivariant perverse sheaves and the graded affine Hecke algebra. The first paper associates to an affine Hecke algebra (attached to any root datum) a graded version, and shows how the classification of simple modules (when $q$ is not a root of unity) can be reduced to the same classification problem for the graded algebras (though for a single affine Hecke algebra, one needs to understand the irreducibles for possibly smaller graded Hecke algebras, as well as the irreducibles for it own associated graded Hecke algebra). The problem of classifying simple modules for the graded algebras (with a certain family of parameters arising from the study of unipotent representations of $p$-adic groups) is then taken up in a series of papers Lusztig wrote on "Cuspidal local systems" which solves th problem by geometric means (perverse sheaves and equivariant cohomology). This is then used in two later papers to give a complete "Langlands style" classification of the unipotent representations of simple $p$-adic groups.
