It may (or may not) be easier to think about analogous questions for $SO(n)$ or $SU(n)$ first. Also, I do not think I have seen any discussion of rational points with unrestricted denominators, so pointers to literature about that would be a good start. I might be willing to work with a slightly different set $X'$, so long as it was still a finite set of rational points defined by a straightforward arithmetic criterion. Note that there is an algebraic group $G$ defined over $\mathbb{Z}$ with $G(\mathbb{R})=U(n)$ and $X\subset G(\mathbb{Q})$. I am guessing that some Langlands-like stuff may be relevant, but I know very little about that sort of thing. For $U(1)$, we know that every rational point (other than $z=-1$) has the form $$ z = \frac{1+it}{1-it} = \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} + \frac{2t}{1+t^2}i $$ with $t\in\mathbb{Q}$. If $t=a/b$ in lowest terms then I think that the denominator of $z$ is $a^2+b^2$. I suspect that if $a^2+b^2=p_1\dotsb p_r$ (with $p_k$ prime) then we can write $z=z_1\dotsb z_r$ where $z_k\in U(1)$ and $z_k$ has denominator $p_k$. Anyway, there are certainly connections with well-known questions in number theory. This also covers the equivalent case of $SO(2)$. Similarly, if $Z\in U(n)$ and $Z+I$ is invertible (which is usually true) then $Z=(1+iT)(1-iT)^{-1}$ for a unique self-adjoint matrix $T$. If $Z$ has entries in $\mathbb{Q}[i]$ then so will $T$. However, it does not seem easy to say anything about the denominators of $T$ and $Z$. 

I tried to find a counterexample, but ended up with the following interesting example instead. Put $X=\prod_{n=0}^\infty\{0,1\}$. Define $$ \phi_n : X \to \mathbb{Z}/2^n \times X $$ by $$ \phi_n(a) = \left(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}2^{n-1-i}a_i,(a_n,a_{n+1},\dotsc) \right). $$ Define $\tau_n:\mathbb{Z}/2^n\to\mathbb{Z}/2^n$ by $\tau_n(i)=i+1$, then define $\sigma_n:X\to X$ by $\sigma_n=\phi_n^{-1}\circ(\tau_n\times 1)\circ\phi_n$. One can check that $\sigma_n^{2^n}=1$ and $\sigma_{n+1}^2=\sigma_n$, so the maps $\sigma_n$ fit together to give an action of $\mathbb{Z}/2^\infty$ on $X$. This is easily seen to be free. 

Firstly, no plus construction is needed here. The plus construction is used to kill a perfect subgroup of the fundamental group, but $\pi_1(BU)$ is already trivial. Next, put $\mathcal{V}=\bigoplus_{n=0}^\infty\mathbb{C}$, and equip this with the standard Hermitian inner product. Let $\mathcal{V}_n$ be the obvious copy of $\mathcal{C}^n$ in $\mathcal{V}$. Let $B$ denote the space of subspaces $\mathcal{W}\leq\mathcal{V}\oplus\mathcal{V}$ such that $\mathcal{W}\cap(\mathcal{V}\oplus 0)$ has finite codimension in $\mathcal{W}$, and also the same finite codimension in $\mathcal{V}\oplus 0$. This is the union of subspaces $$ B(n) = \{\mathcal{W}\in B : \mathcal{V}_n^\perp\oplus 0 \leq\mathcal{W}\leq\mathcal{V}\oplus\mathcal{V}_n, \dim(\mathcal{W}/(\mathcal{V}_n^\perp\oplus 0))=n\}$$ Now $B(n)$ is homeomorphic to the Grassmannian $G_n(\mathbb{C}^{2n})$, and using this we see that $B$ is a model for $BU$. Now let $E$ denote the space of inner-product preserving linear maps from $\mathcal{V}^k$ to $\mathcal{V}$. This has an evident action of $\Sigma_k$, which is free because inner-product preserving maps are always injective. It is a standard fact that $E$ is also contractible, so it is a model for $E\Sigma_k$. Now suppose we have elements $\mathcal{W}_1,\dotsc,\mathcal{W}_k\in B$ and a map $f\in E$. We then have a subspace $$\bigoplus_i\mathcal{W}_i\leq\bigoplus_{i=1}^k (\mathcal{V}\oplus\mathcal{V}) \simeq \left(\bigoplus_{i=1}^k\mathcal{V}\right)\oplus \left(\bigoplus_{i=1}^k\mathcal{V}\right). $$ We can apply $f\oplus f$ to this to get a point $\gamma(f;\mathcal{W}_1,\dotsc,\mathcal{W}_k)\in B$. This construction gives the map $\gamma:E\times_{\Sigma_k}B^k\to B$ that you need. 

Suppose you have a map $f\colon X\to Y$ of finite CW complexes such that $K(p,n)_*(f)$ is injective for all primes $p$ and integers $n\geq 0$ (where $K(p,n)$ is Morava $K$-theory). Then the Nilpotence Theorem of Hopkins, Devinatz and Smith implies that the map $\Sigma^kf^{(m)}\colon \Sigma^kX^{(m)}\to\Sigma^kY^{(m)}$ has a left inverse $g$ for sufficiently large $k$ and $m$. This may not seem very satisfactory but I think that it is the best that you can reasonably hope to do. The question of whether a map has a left inverse is just intrinsically much more subtle than the question of whether it is an equivalence. One can also say that in the category of finite spectra, a map $f\colon X\to Y$ has a left inverse iff $\pi_*^S(f)\colon \pi_*^S(X)\to\pi_*^S(Y)$ is injective, provided that Freyd's Generating Hypothesis is correct. But the Generating Hypothesis has been any open question for fifty years now, which is another indication that the problem is intrinsically hard. 

Over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ it is not true that $H_*(\Omega^2\Sigma^2X)$ is the free Gerstenhaber algebra. Instead, Cohen proves that $H_*(\Omega^n\Sigma^nX)$ is a free object in a more elaborate category involving some Dyer-Lashof operations. In the case $n=2$ there is only one Dyer-Lashof operation but it still creates a lot of complexity. However, the Dyer-Lashof operations are controlled by the homology of symmetric groups. If we use rational coefficients then the homology of any finite group is zero in positive degrees, and because of this, all the Dyer-Lashof operations are zero. You therefore expect to get a free Gerstenhaber algebra, but I do not know where that is spelled out. There will not be any interesting difference between $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ here; there is a natural isomorphism $H_*(X;\mathbb{C})=H_*(X;\mathbb{Q})\otimes\mathbb{C}$ for all spaces $X$. 

For the case where $|S|=2$ you can assume that $S=\{0,1\}$. It is then well-known that you can take $\pi$ to be the elliptic modular function $\lambda$. It follows easily that it works equally well to take $\pi(z)=1/\lambda(z)$. This induces a conformal isomorphism $\mathbb{H}/G\to\mathbb{C}\setminus S$, where $G$ is the group of matrices $g=\left[\begin{array}{cc}a&b \\ c &d\end{array}\right]\in SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ with $g=1\pmod{2}$. The action on $\mathbb{H}$ is by $z\mapsto (az+b)/(cz+d)$. If we let $l$ denote the ray $(1,\infty)$ then $\pi^{-1}(l)=\lambda^{-1}((0,1))$, and one can check that this is the union of the $G$-translates of the positive imaginary axis. If you have Maple you can enter 

Most of this is not special to the case of $AG_{\infty,2}^+$. For any spectrum $X$, we have a Hurewicz map $h:\pi_{\ast}(X)\to H_{\ast}(X)$, which induces a map $h':\mathbb{Q}\otimes\pi_{\ast}(X)\to\mathbb{Q}\otimes H_{\ast}(X)$. Standard calculations show that $h'$ this is an isomorphism when $X=S^n$ for some $n$, and it follows by induction up the skeleta that $h'$ is an isomorphism for all $X$. Next, the homotopy groups $\pi_{\ast}(X)$ are (essentially by definition) the same as the homotopy groups of the space $\Omega^\infty(X)$, so we have an unstable Hurewicz map $h'':\pi_{\ast}(X)=\pi_{\ast}(\Omega^\infty(X))\to H_{\ast}(\Omega^\infty(X))$. By combinining these we get a map $\mathbb{Q}\otimes H_\ast(X)\to \mathbb{Q}\otimes H_\ast(\Omega^\infty(X))$. Next, every infinite loop space is a homotopy-commutative H-space, and this makes $H_\ast(\Omega^\infty(X))$ into a graded-commutative (and graded-cocommutative) Hopf algebra. Now let $A_*$ be the free graded-commutative ring generated by $\mathbb{Q}\otimes H_\ast(X)$, with the Hopf algebra structure for which the generators are primitive. More explicitly, $A_\ast$ is a tensor product of polynomial algebras (one for each even-dimensional generator in $\mathbb{Q}\otimes H_\ast(X)$) and exterior algebras (one for each odd-dimensional generator). It is now quite formal to construct a canonical map $A_\ast\to\mathbb{Q}\otimes H_\ast(\Omega^\infty(X))$ of bicommutative Hopf algebras. One can then show that this map is always an isomorphism. Indeed, it is possible to reduce to the case $X=S^n$ again, and the groups $\mathbb{Q}\otimes H_\ast(\Omega^k S^{n+k})$ can be calculated by repeated use of Serre spectral sequences, and one can then let $k$ tend to infinity. As $\mathbb{Q}\otimes H_\ast(\Omega^\infty(X))$ is free on primitive generators, it is a standard fact that the dual Hopf algebra $\mathbb{Q}\otimes H^\ast(\Omega^\infty(X))$ is also free on primitive generators in the same degrees. For the Madsen-Weiss case, you now just need to know the groups $\mathbb{Q}\otimes H_\ast(AG_{\infty,2}^+)$. This is not hard, because $AG^+_{\infty,2}$ is the Thom space of a virtual vector bundle over $BSO(2)=\mathbb{C}P^\infty$, so we can use the Thom isomorphism theorem. 

First, consider the category $\mathcal{S}$ of spectra. Let $S/2$ denote the cofibre of twice the identity map of the sphere spectrum. It is then known that the identity map of $S/2$ has order $4$. If we had a good system of chain complexes $Hom_{\mathcal{S}}(x,y)$ then $Hom_{\mathcal{S}}(S/2,S/2)$ would be the cofibre of twice the identity on $Hom_{\mathcal{S}}(S/2,S)$, but for chain complexes the cofibre of twice the identity always has exponent 2, which gives a contradiction. Thus, for triangulated categories of topological origin, the best you can hope for is to define mapping spectra $F(x,y)$, not chain complexes $Hom(x,y)$. Next, this paper: $URL$ exhibits a triangulated category $\mathcal{C}$ such there are no nontrivial exact functors from $\mathcal{C}$ to any of the standard examples of triangulated categories, or in the opposite direction. This means in particular that there is no way to define a 'representable' functor $F_{\mathcal{C}}(x,-)$. However, if $\mathcal{D}$ is a triangulated category arising from a stable model category then one can define mapping spectra $F_{\mathcal{D}}(x,y)$ for objects $x,y\in\mathcal{D}$. I think that is covered by this paper: $URL$ . As in David Roberts's comment, I think one can also do the same for triangulated categories that arise from stable $(\infty,1)$-categories.
