I am restricting my consideration, for the moment, to just the troposphere. With regard to our understanding of the GHE do we predict that an increased GHE due to increasing CO2/Water/Methane will change the lapse rate postively or negatively? The dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR), according to my old text books, is easily calculated from the formulae -g/c, where g is the acceleration due to gravity and c is the specific heat capacity of the atmosphere. This is supposed to be a general formulae that can be applied to any planet with a solid surface and a gaseous atmosphere. So for earth is the formulae now -g/c + (GHE) or is it -g/c - (GHE)? The bracketed GHE term being specific to the atmosphere of a specific composition, e.g. including 400ppm CO2. The second part of the question then , after we have the correct sign, is how is the term (GHE) expected to vary as the CO2 (or other greenhouse gas) concentrations vary? 

Irrespective of how accepted any scientific theory happens to be it is often worth thinking about a possible experiment to test said theory and perhaps falsify it. If we wanted to do this for the theory of the greenhouse gas effect what areas are worth considering when designing such an experiment? Would we limit ourselves to just the radiative heat response of CO2 or are their wider issues we need to incorporate into the experiment? This question is NOT a duplicate as it relates to the generality of greenhouse gases and specifically asks IF we should limit ourselves to the radiative response of CO2. Therefore one possible avenue of answering could be to consider the wider issues of water vapour and methane and such an answer would be clearly outside the scope of the CO2 specific question which has been postulated as the duplicate. 

The answer, as already given is "By radiation" . But comments and other answer detail have added extra information which can be useful in understanding this in the wider context, particularly relating to arguments about the Earth's energy budget and climate change. Here is some other extra stuff to consider; We pose the same question for the planet Venus. Venus has an atmosphere composed of nearly pure CO2 (actually about 96.5%). The surface temperature on Venus is around 750K at the equator when facing the sun and drops by a mere 5K overnight. Night and day are about 120 earth days in length so that's a pretty slow axial rotation and a very slow loss of surface heat during the planet's night. Now the atmosphere on Venus is very thick, masses of that lovely CO2, and surface pressure is about 90 times that of earth (9.2MPa). If you calculate the optical attenuation of the atmosphere to incoming solar radiation then the solar flux at the surface is a mere 4W per sq m. It is therefore self evident with such a low solar flux at the surface that the direct radiation from the sun cannot warm the surface to 750K. It is therefore interesting to draw some energy flux diagrams (similar to the Trenberth ones for the earth) and calculate the source of all that extra heat warming the surface. Don't forget to draw 2 diagrams, one for night and one for day to check you understand how a pure CO2 atmosphere works. This is a great exercise for school students (and anybody else) interested in the greenhouse effect of CO2. 

It is true that water is not the only variable constituent of the atmosphere, but it is capable of large variations (0-5%+) that I'm not sure other trace constituents are capable of outside of plumes from smokestacks / cars / factories / etc. A virtual temperature for other gases would only be meaningful if their variability imparts a significant change in mass in a parcel such that it becomes important for buoyancy. That being said, you could easily derive such a virtual temperature, as the virtual temperature is just a proxy for density changes and we can easily calculate this. For each constituent gas, you can use the ideal gas law as $$p_i = \rho_i R_i T$$ such that each density of gas $i$ is $$\rho_i = \dfrac{p_i}{R_i T}$$ and then sum these with dry air ($p_d$) $$\rho = \dfrac{p-\sum p_i}{R_d T} + {\large\sum} \dfrac{p_i}{R_i T} $$ and then solving for $p$ in terms of $\rho$, $R_d$ and collecting the rest of the terms into a variable and calling it $T_v$. This process could be used to generically define a virtual temperature for any number of trace gases (single or multiple) as long as you know their mixing ratios with dry air. I'm not aware of anyone using (on Earth) a virtual temp for anything other than water vapor and suspended hydrometeors (e.g. density potential temperature, $\theta_\rho$) but that certainly doesn't mean no one is. 

Wind is caused by pressure differences. Think of a balloon full of air; poke a hole in it and the air comes out. Why? Because the pressure in the balloon is higher than outside, and so to regain equal pressure, mass moves and that is the wind. There is a bit more to this in the atmosphere as the Earth rotates and near the surface friction also plays a role. The equation of motion is the Navier-Stokes and in vector form in Cartesian space is: $$\dfrac{\partial\mathbf u}{\partial t} = - \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u -\dfrac{1}{\rho}\nabla p-2 \mathbf \Omega \times \mathbf u + \mathbf g + \mathbf F$$ In this equation, $\mathbf u$ is the vector wind, $(\mathbf u \cdot \nabla)$ is the advection operator, $\rho$ is density, $\mathbf \Omega$ is the vector rotation of the Earth, $\mathbf g$ is effective gravity and $\mathbf F$ is friction. The LHS is the time rate of change of the wind at a point in space (as opposed to following the parcel). The RHS represent a number of factors that produce a change in the wind. From left to right: 

I have got a barometer in my hall (it's supposed to predict the weather). Sure does move about a lot. You know that of course. So the answer to your question is "YES" , in fact any change in the composition of a gas mixture is likely to change its pressure (other things being equal), but the effect will be small as the other 999,600 ppm of other stuff has a rather bigger effect BUT even if the effect was a 1 or 2% change I doubt you could confirm it by measurement as the normal variation in barometric pressure day to day and hour to hour will rather swamp it. 

OK, you have all seen the question before BUT let's make the challenge a little different this time. I want you to use the Feynman Method ! You have to explain it simply, preferably just text but one or 2 sketch diagrams may be OK (no complicated graphs with multiple colours please) and I am going to limit you to 150 words. Who fancies the challenge - make sure you don't leave out any of the important physics. This question is asking for an explanation of how something works. I am not interested in experimental evidence or proof, just a clear explanation that you can chat about to someone to help explain the physics behind it in as simple terms as possible. Like if your mate down the pub says, OK, tell me how this works then. 

Firstly you need to define what you mean by average daily temperature. What algorithm are you going to use to compute it (from several time spaced measurements), why and what do you think the result represents. Obviously if you use a measurement which is going to be affected by very local anthropogenic activity (e.g. cars) you can expect timing of activities to affect individual measurements. a measuring station which is going to be thus affected is not really going to be useful for anything wider or general though. When siting weather stations we try to find locations which are not subject to such local disturbances. Ideally well away from any heat producing apparatus (e.g. fixed a/c units), heated buildings, variable traffic and so on. Locations in open non urban areas are preferable for understanding changes in the weather and climate. Past locations thus chosen however have often been compromised by the expansion of nearby housing or industry as populations and cities have expanded. This is why you sometimes see references to Urban Heat Islands (UHI) in discussions of climate measurement. 

Inertial instability is similar to the centrifugal instability in that we are looking at the stability of parcels to horizontal perturbations. In the inertial case, however, the initial state is geostrophic balance rather than cyclostrophic balance. Symmetric instability is the case where a parcel is inertially stable to horizontal perturbations and statically stable to vertical perturbations but unstable to perturbations between the horizontal and vertical. An additional constraint is that the flow is symmetric and only varies in two dimensions. This instability was also first examined as centrifugal instability, but with added baroclinity. Conditional symmetric instability (CSI) is related to symmetric instability with the difference being that $\overline{\theta}^*_e$ rather than $\overline{\theta}$ surfaces are used to asses the instability. For more information on these mesoscale instabilities, you can find information on them in Markowski and Richardson (2010) pages 49 (inertial instability) and 53 (symmetric instability). Holton (4th ed, 2004) treats these instabilities on pages 204 (inertial oscillations) and 279 (symmetric instability). Markwoski, P., and Y. Richardson, 2010: Mesoscale meterology in midlatitudes.

Image licensed CC-BY by The School of Physics UNSW This illustrates a the effect of a near-surface density gradient that is low density (warm) at the ground and increases (gets colder) with height. The photons from the sky that pass close to the road are refract toward the observer and you see a false image of the sky as an inferior mirage. The other photons do not pass through the strong density gradient and are not bent and you see the true positions of the objects. 

Tornadoes, land/waterspouts and supercell thunderstorm mesocyclones are examples of vortices where Coriolis is unimportant. Tornadoes are in cyclostrophic balance. Land and waterspouts (as well as non-supercell tornadoes) arise from horizontal convergence of vertical vorticity. The supercell mesocyclone spin originates as horizontal vorticity that is tilted and stretched into vertical vorticity. These vorticies can spin in either direction in either hemisphere. 

Bifurcation is relevant to the atmosphere because it effects the predictability of the evolution of the atmosphere. I can't speak to its merits with climate models, but with weather it is quite important. As Lorenz discovered, the atmosphere is chaotic and numerical prediction is very sensitive to the initial conditions. If the initial conditions are close to the bifurcation point, the solution can be wildly different and this leads to poor predictability. In particular, weather models assimilate observations and each observation is a value and an uncertainty. When the uncertainty contains the bifurcation point that essentially means for that particular scenario the instrument error is such that the instrument can provide an observation on either side of the bifurcation. This can be explored with ensemble modeling where many models are run with slightly different initial conditions (or slightly different models, or both) and leads to a large spread in the ensemble and low confidence in the forecast. Our atmosphere can be more sensitive than the instruments we use to measure it can detect. I'll try to dig up some references to presentations I've seen that show hurricane dissapation / rapid strengthening determined by differences in gulf of Mexico observations smaller than the instrument error reporting them. For more NWP-centric studies, you can search for articles on predictability. I know there should be a couple by Dr. Fuqing Zhang (PSU) and I'll edit when I can point to some specific articles. 

Another way of looking at the question: I take 2 standard wheelbarrows of bits of plants from my garden. One wheelbarrow is used to fill the compost bin. The other goes to the bonfire. How much ash do I have from burning compared to how much compost from the compost bin. Any gardener will know that the amount of compost will be much larger than the amount of ash. So now we need to compare the chemical composition of the ash with that of the compost. For Wood Ash there are quite a few research articles. Most of the carbon atoms in wood ash will be in the form of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3). Percentage in the ash will vary widely but lets take a median of 50%. Ash as a percentage of original organic matter will be maybe of the order of 8% by weight. For an original 100kg of organic matter (yes, its a big wheelbarrow) we would have 8kg of ash. In this ash would be 4kg of CaCO3. The carbon atoms would be 12% of that (relative atomic masses). So 100kg of organic bits gives you 0.48kg of carbon atoms left in the ash when you burn it. There seems to be fewer research articles on composting but we found the following approximations. For 100kg of organic matter there will be about 9% organic carbon (9kg). Composting will turn 100kg of raw material into around 30kg of compost in which the organic carbon content will be around 25% ( 7.5kg of carbon). These figures are median "pot luck selection" as results can vary widely. We can however see that composting retains massively more (7.5kg) of carbon atoms compared with burning (0.48kg). The difference will be in the atmosphere. 

I think this is it: ppm(mol)=ppm(v) x (density CO2/density total atmos) x (Molecular Weight total atmos/Molecular Weight CO2)​​​​. Try some number crunching to see if that makes sense. 

Climate science is a very exciting field to get into right now. Not only do we have a change at the top in politics in the USA and the prospect of big changes there but the new theory of a Gravity Induced Temperature Gradient is coming to the fore. I recommend researching and reading about both sides of the debate, not just the CAGW theory stuff. If the ideas of Loschmidt (c.1870's) and the recent experimental results of R.Graeff (2007) take precedence over the current consensus theories then there will be great opportunities opening up in this field for those with the right knowledge and background. Good luck with it !
