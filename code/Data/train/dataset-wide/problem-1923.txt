The resulting harmonic analysis (using t_tide) shows that the tidal constituents with amplitudes over about 5 cm are:

From McKenzie's original 1984 paper and from Spiegelman & McKenzie (1987) paper the equations that govern the conservation of momentum and mass of a low-viscosity fluid melt (magma) in a deformable matrix (rocks) are: ${\partial\over\partial t} (\rho_f\phi) + \nabla \cdot (\rho_f\phi{\bf v})=\Gamma$ ${\partial\over\partial t} [\rho_s(1-\phi)] + \nabla \cdot [\rho_s(1-\phi){\bf V]}=-\Gamma$ ${\bf v}-{\bf V}=-{k_\phi\over\rho \mu}\nabla \mathscr{P} $ $\nabla \mathscr{P}=\eta\nabla^2{\bf V}+(\zeta+{\eta\over3})\nabla(\nabla\cdot{\bf V})+(1-\phi)\Delta\rho g\hat k $ $k_\phi \sim \alpha^2{\phi^n\over c} $ where $\rho_f$ is the density of the magma, $\phi$ is the porosity or the volume fraction occupied by the magma, ${\bf v}$ is the magma velocity, $\Gamma$ is the "melting function", which gives the rate of mass transfer from matrix to magma, $\rho_s$ is the density of the solid matrix, ${\bf V}$ is the matrix velocity, $k_\phi$, is the permeability, $\mathscr{P}$ is the piezometric pressure (the pressure in excess of hydrostatic pressure, $\mathscr{P}=P-\rho_fgz$), $\Delta\rho=\rho_s-\rho_f$ and $\hat k$ is the unit vector in the $z$ direction with $z$ increasing downwards. The permeability, $k_\phi$, can be expressed as a non-linear function of the grain size $\alpha$, porosity, and a dimensionless coefficient, $c$. 

My first grid generation was using SMS ($URL$ That software is proprietary and it used to be cumbersome to get it to do what you needed sometimes. It also provides metrics for grid quality. The tool that I am more familiar with is BatTri. It was developed by Ata Bilgili and Keston Smith and is a graphical Matlab interface to the C language two-dimensional quality grid generator Triangle developed by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk. They explain the code in $URL$ They include several quality checks that I have found quite useful. I have just found this website ($URL$ that lists a lot of mesh generation software. Most of them I have never heard of or know anything about. 

Most of the heat balance calculations in the ocean use satellite-measured sea surface temperature (SST). This provides global temperature fields with daily variations. The interior heat content is determined using ARGO floats (as mentioned before), long-term mooring arrays (e.g., TAO, PIRATA) and extensive field cruises (e.g., WOCE) that use CTDs to measure temperature down to several thousand meters deep. Very few people use bottle samples (e.g., Nansen or Niskin bottles) for heat content estimates (they are used for sensor calibration for instance). 

Tidal constituents follow the expression: $\eta(t) = A cos (\omega t + \phi)$, where $\eta$ is the tidal elevation at a specific time, $A$ is the amplitude of the constituent, $\omega$ is the speed of the constituent (the rate of change in phase), and, finally $\phi$ is the phase of the constituent at the initial time from which the time is measured. The phase, $\phi$, is measured with regard to the equilibrium tide. Thus, the short answer is that the phase is usually referring to the delay (in degree) from the theoretical equilibrium tide. From the NOAA glossary for phase lag (or phase epoch, not to be confused with the tidal datum epoch): 

The red rain phenomenon in Kerala, India has been reported several times in history (1896, 2001, 2012). The color of the rain seems to be associated with the presence of airborne spores of the algae Trentepohlia annulata. My questions are: 

Also, for a very simple visualization application for plate tectonics and a lot of other information, you can use EarthViewer. It is extremely intuitive and the related Earth History data helps to frame the changes.

A simple way to estimate the implications is to simplify the problem. If the orbits of Earth, Sun and Moon were circular and in the same plane, and the Earth had no tilt, the only remaining tidal constituents would be $M_2$ and $S_2$ (also the overtides and combination tides: $M_4$, $MS_4$...). The rest of the tidal constituents can be expressed as linear combinations of their rates of change based on the remaining forcings: orbital eccentricity and inclination and axial tilt. The modulation of the amplitude $A_M$ of the main constituent wave, $\eta_M = A_M cos (\omega_M t)$, by another constituent of amplitude $A_c$ is: $\eta_t= (A_M+A_ccos(\omega_c t))cos(\omega_Mt)$. Expressing it as a linear combinations of the rates of change gives $\eta_t= A_Mcos(\omega_Mt)+{A_c\over2}cos(\omega_M-\omega_c)t+{A_c\over2}cos(\omega_M+\omega_c)t$, such that the original amplitude remains unchanged, while two extra components with slightly different frequencies appear. In the case of the effect of the axial tilt, it modulates the main frequencies based on the solar parameters (the inclination of the Moon orbit is not affected by the axial tilt). The period of the solar declination is a sidereal year (365.2564 days). In the case of the modulation of the $M_2$, the resulting periodicities are 1 cycle/solar day ± 1 cycle/sidereal year. The two resulting constituents are $P_1$ and $K_1$. $P_1$ is known as the solar declinational diurnal constituent. The case of $K_1$ is slightly more complex as the inclination of the Moon also results in a contribution at this frequency. The rest of the tidal constituents are also modified accordingly, but their amplitudes are much smaller. In short, the removal of the axial tilt will result in the removal of the $P_1$ tidal constituent (and some other minor ones) and an amplitude decrease in the $K_1$ constituent. 

I have been using the routines in nctoolbox (also check here) that do all the slicing (vertical, horizontal, following a track). The repository is in GitHub. The one you should looking at is vsliceg.m. You can follow the logic there or develop your own. 

A "meddy" is usually described as a Mediterranean Water eddy. While many meddies have been observed in recent years, I would want to know what are the common characteristics of such features (temperature, salinity, depth, lifespan)? What are the conditions that cause the formation of meddies? How are they preserved for so long as they may last for about 2 years and cover distances up to one thousand kilometers? 

Some of the driest deserts on Earth occur in the western side of continents and they are called Coastal Deserts. Examples of such deserts are the Atacama desert (Chile, the driest desert on Earth), the Baja California desert (USA/Mexico), the Namibia desert (southwestern Africa), and the Atlantic coastal desert of Morocco/western Sahara/Mauritania. In mid-latitudes, the western side of continents is most frequently occupied by deserts, while the eastern side tends to be covered by forests (e.g., Amazon rainforest). . Distribution of non-polar arid regions. Source: USGS. Coastal deserts occur east of the strongest coastal upwelling regions in the world. The upwelling is associated with eastern boundary currents flowing equatorward (due to Coriolis): the Canary Current (off Northwest Africa), the Benguela Current (off Southwest Africa), the Humboldt Current (off Chile and Peru), and the California Current (western North America). The prevailing winds in these regions are the trade winds that flow parallel to the coast and generate upwelling dynamics: surface Ekman balance is setup (in deep enough waters) with water transport being to the right (left) of the wind in the northern (southern) hemisphere; this causes a deficit along the coast that needs a compensating flow in the deeper part of the water column bringing cold, nutrient rich waters (some of the most productive regions in the world) to the surface. Source Commons Wikipedia. The cold waters near the ocean surface results in a cool, stable coastal atmosphere. In this region, evaporation from the ocean is reduced and produces extremely low rainfall over land. Precipitation is limited to morning fog and produces some of the driest ecosystems on Earth. The Atacama desert is the best example of such environment with average rainfalls of 15 mm/year (the driest non-polar region). In some areas, they are trying to take advantage of the little moisture the fog (Camanchaca) brings to establish some agricultural zones. The fog droplets are too small (1-40 micrometers) to form water drops and precipitate, so they use fog-catchers to collect moisture from the fog. Source: newatlas.com 

The dominant constituents are K1 and O1, with comparable amplitudes. The resulting effect of the two main diurnal frequencies is a period slightly over 24 hours. The effect of the semidiurnal constituents (M2, S2) is smaller and can be seen in the first time series as slight humps in May 24-27. 

Many meteorological stations are assimilated into NOAA's reanalysis. You should be careful with this approach as the raw data you have might have been already included in the hindcast. The reanalysis includes the data in an statistical way. In general, the reanalysis does not match the data at any point, but tries to minimize the global difference between observations and model simulation. There is no guarantee that the reanalysis is going to be close to any of the assimilated data. 

Thus, the mid-October was exceptional in a sense, but will be surpassed by the November event. With regard to the effect on tides, the combination of the $M_2$ and $S_2$ tidal constituents gives rise to the spring/neap cycle. Meanwhile, the $N_2$ tidal constituent arises from the fluctuating distance of the Moon from Earth and its frequency is 1 cycle/month less than that of $M_2$ and 3 cycles/month less than that of $S_2$. We can resynthesize a time series of tidal elevation based on only these three tidal constituents ($M_2$, $S_2$, and $N_2$). The resulting time series of amplitudes has an envelop that shows the size of the spring tides. As can be seen in the figure, even including only these three constituents, the resulting variability in the size of the spring tides (12 years shown) is pretty high. The problem is how to define "king tides". There are some spring tides that are larger than others, but even among the largest there is variability. This is where the uncertainty on the definition of the recurrence interval of the "king tides" comes from. Ultimately, it seems that having ~2 peaks ("king tides") per year is a good approximation. Including 3 constituents is a significant simplification and the entire series gets more complicated when additional constituents are included and defining a "king tide" is also more difficult. 

First, let's explain what compressibility is. Compressibility is defined as a measure of the relative volume change of a parcel of fluid as a response to a pressure change. When I calculate the compressibility of seawater using Matlab and the seawater package (equivalent to Fofonoff & Millard, 1983), I obtained that the compressibility increases at cold temperatures for salty, brackish, and fresh water. In fact, water has a minimum compressibility at 46.5°C (Fine & Millero, 1973). As pressure increases the compressibility decreases for any of the salinities considered. 

It seems that tropical forests absorb more carbon dioxide than many scientists have believed before. NASA and NCAR scientists have shown that tropical forests absorb 1.4 billion metric tons out of a total global absorption of 2.5 billion metric tons. This estimate is much larger than previous estimates and the tropical contribution seems to be much larger than other areas like temperate or boreal forest. Previously, most climate models showed mid-latitude forests in the Northern Hemisphere absorbing more carbon than tropical forests. Those results were data-limited and suggested that deforestation was causing tropical forests to release more carbon dioxide than they were absorbing. The new results seem to indicate the opposite and are based in a more comprehensive analysis of available data. 

Nur & Cline (2000) constructed a map of sites destroyed in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean region during the years 1225–1175 BCE. They also provided a map of earthquakes of magnitude above 6.5 that were measured during the XX century. They claimed that "virtually all of these Late Bronze Age sites lie within the affected (“high-shaking”) areas". They also showed evidence of earthquake damage in many of the main cities of the area and point out that: 

Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) is used to measure and compare the activity of individual hurricanes and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated as an integral of the squares of hurricane speeds. My question is whether a similar parameter can be used to estimate the activity of any kind of cyclone or storm system (tropical or extra-tropical cyclones, fronts...). 

The launch was scheduled for 2017 using a DNPER launch vehicle. It seems that the contract contract between Kosmotras and Hisdesat was canceled and that resulted in an uncertain launch date. The satellite has been finished since 2013 and it has been waiting for over 3 years to be launched. Source The dispute between Russia and Ukraine resulted in EU imposing sanctions on Moscow. As a result, Russian President Vladimir Putin supposedly signed a secret decree halting launches of the Dnepr rocket (based on the Soviet-era R-36M missile that was made in Ukraine). It also affected the launch of several satellites of the Iridium constellation. With the Russian government withholding approval for the launch, everything felt apart and now the parent company (hisdeSAT) has to find another launch platform. The two main candidates are the Soyuz rocket from Roscosmos and the Falcon rocket from Space-X, but the cost of either alternative is much higher. 

As suggested by Kossin et al., "The poleward migration of the location of tropical cyclone maximum intensity," (Nature, 2014, dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13278), the answer could be "maybe". As the tropical region increases in size (tropical expansion: the increasing area of the world where tropical phenomena is observed has expanded in time) due in part to anthropogenic reasons, there might be a migration of tropical cyclones poleward. The migration might not change the cyclone formation area, but it does seem to affect the location of maximum intensity. The migration seems to be occurring in most areas and the trend seems significant in most regions of the world except the North Atlantic, for instance. 

Sea level rise (SLR) is anything but spatially uniform. The satellite derived SLR rates that you present are a good example of the complexity of the spatial response. A good way to explore the spatial characteristics from observations is to use the data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL). They have a good interactive map to investigate global mean sea level trends since 1900. The time limits can be adjusted to see the changes depending on the data you use. Source PSMSL.

In the case of Río de la Plata, part of it is history and politics, and part of it is oceanography. Most of Argentina and Uruguay considers Río de la Plata as a river (thus, the name, río) and as such it is the widest river in the world (maximum width >200km). Río de la Plata is formed as the confluence of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers and results in a pretty wide estuary with Montevideo (Uruguay) in the northern shore. As can be seen in the following satellite image, the combined discharge from the Paraná and Uruguay rivers creates a current that flows into the Atlantic Ocean and that is visible under calm wind conditions and high discharge periods. 

In the case of a hurricane, the winds and atmospheric effects are so strong that it is difficult to separate the two. The article cited in the question mentions the two effects. The fact that the wind lined up with the coastal alignment suggests that wind set-down might have been a factor. It is not that uncommon for wind set-down to be a controlling process (e.g., Red Sea (also)). 

The new standard for ocean temperature is the "conservative temperature". It is based on a hypothetical adiabatic and isohaline change in pressure to the sea surface. Conservative temperature was adopted as the standard by the oceanographic community as part of the Thermodynamic Equation Of Seawater - 2010 (www.teos-10.org). The previous standard (EOS-80) was Potential Temperature. What are the differences between potential and conservative temperatures? What are the benefits of using conservative temperature? Where should I expect the biggest departures between the two temperatures and why?
