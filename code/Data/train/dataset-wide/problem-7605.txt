Let $M_i$ be fixed rectangular matrices with integer coefficients less than $n$. Consider the variety defined by the condition $$ \mathrm{rank}(\lambda_1M_1 + \lambda_2M_2 + ... + \lambda_kM_k) = 1. $$ Assume that there is an integral point $(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_k)$ lying on this variety, can we then guarantee that there is an integral point with the height (maximal absolute value of the coordinates) bounded polynomially in $n$ (the exponent may depend on $k$ and the size of the matrices)? P. S. It might be related to the Birch-Davenport theorem, so with high probability this question is either known or out of reach for current methods (which would be ok to know), but I couldn't find a reference. 

It is well known that for a given polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ the number of primes $p$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$ is infinite. In fact, one can even write down a formula for the density of such primes (e.g. D. Berend, Y. Bilu "Polynomials with roots modulo every integer"). Now suppose that $f = \sum_{i=0}^d a_ix^i$ is irreducible, the degree $d$ is fixed and all $a_i \leq N^C$ for some constant $C$. Is it possible to prove the uniform bound (e.g. whith the constant depending only on $d$ and $C$ and $N$ large) $$ \pi(N, f) = \Omega_{d, C}(\frac{N}{\log N}), $$ where $\pi(N, f)$ means the number of primes less than $N$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$? The aforementioned paper cites a general density formula due to Lagarias and Odlyzko which seem to provide such a bound assuming GRH. It's of course highly desirable to drop this assumption. 

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups over the ring of integers $R$ of a local field $F$ with finite residue characteristic $p$. Suppose we have a surjection $\phi$ from $G(F)$ to $H(F)$, and another surjection $\bar{\phi}$ from $G(k)$ to $H(k)$. Is this enough to conclude the image of a parahoric in $G$ is a parahoric in $H$? 

Let $L/\mathbb{Q}$ be a Galois closed field with Galois group a subgroup of $S_6$. Is it the case that $L$ is the compositum of Galois closures of linearly disjoint fields of degree at most $6$ over $\mathbb{Q}$? Currently this looks true from a bashing argument: taking each subgroup of $S_6$ up to isomorphism and either noting it is a direct product, or it has a large subgroup which is not normal and whose normalizer is the whole subgroup. Bashing argument isn't complete yet, so this might still be false. I'd like something more elegant though, and if it works for $S_n$ even better. 

I am wondering if there are any rigorous results telling that some dynamical system hits infinitely many primes (except for the case when orbits are just arithmetic progressions). To make it specific, is there a polynomial $f(x)$ such that its iterations $f^n(x)$ are prime for infinitely many $n$ given that the integer $x$ is fixed. A simple observation here is that if $f(x) = 2x + 1$ then asking if iterations of $f(1)$ contain infinitely many primes is equivalent to the Mersenne primes conjecture. P. S. This question seems to be related to the Bunyakovsky conjecture, so maybe somebody knows about any partial results in this direction? 

If you divide on $a$ and let $a$ to be big you have basically a set of linear inequalities of the form $1-o(1) \geq b_ic-d_i \geq o(1)$. If you look at $b_ic$ geometrically, it is a beam of lines emanating from zero with slopes $b_1, ..., b_{a-1}$. And you want to find a point $c$ such that the line $x = c$ intersects each line in a strip $1+d_i-o(1) \geq y \geq d_i+o(1)$. It seems that if you order the lines according to the slope and starting from the line with the smallest slope (smallest $b_i$) it is possible to choose $d_i$ for each new line appropriately (based on the geometric representation above) 

Numerical Recipes, 3rd edition, Chapter 3 describes a vast number of interpolation methods with source code. It seems from what you are telling us that something is confused in the paper: Chebyshev interpolation has to do with picking points at which to minimize error of the ensuing result, but perhaps something else was meant/the usage is slightly different. 

Sato-Tate has a much more general form in random matrix theory stating that the Satake parameters are distributed as the eigenvalues of some random matrix in a compact Lie group related to the Zariski closure of the image of the associated Galois representation. The measure is just the Haar measure on that group. This applies to abelian representations, and recovers Hecke's equidistribution result. 

The image of $\Lambda_2$ in $G/\Lambda_1$ is finite. Take a set of representatives $s_1, s_2, \ldots s_n$ in $\Lambda_2$. Now consider $\cup s_i F_2$. I claim this is a Borel fundamental domain for $F_1$. It is Borel as it is a finite union of Borel sets. Let $g\Lambda_1$ be a coset of $\Lambda_1$. Then $g\Lambda_2$ intersects $F_2$ in a single point $x$. Now, $\Lambda_2 = \cup s_i \Lambda_1$, and so $x$ is in some $s_i$ translate of $F_2$, and hence in $F_1$. It is unique as otherwise we have $s_i \lambda_1 = s_j \lambda_1'$, which would mean our set of representatives was too big in the first place. 

Back to 1980, P.Erd\H{o}s and C. Pomerance asked in their paper "Matching the natural numbers up to n with distinct multiples in another interval" (see page 160 of the journal scan $URL$ "Related to these questions, we ask if there is a large constant $c$ so that in any interval of length $cn$ there are $\pi(n)-\pi(n/2)$ distinct multiples of the primes in $(n/2, n]$ (there need not be a matching). " I am wondering if there is any progress on this question. Also, can we say anything if we require only some prime multiples to be present (e. g. we want to guarantee that there are distinct multiples of at least $O(n/\log n)$ primes from $(n/2, n]$)? 

Recall that a graph is called $k$-chordal if any cycle $C$ of length $> k$ contains a chord, i.e. an edge joining to non-consecutive vertices in $C$. Let $f(n, k)$ be the minimal number of edges s.t. any graph on $n$ vertices can be made $k$-chordal by deleting at most $f(n, k)$ edges. There is a paper of Erd\H{o}s and Laskar "On maxinal chordal subgraph" where they show that $$ f(n,3) = \frac{n^2}{2} - (1+o(1))\sqrt{2}n^{3/2}. $$ I am wondering if other bounds for $f(n, k)$ are known for bigger $k$. A bound in terms of the number of edges is also of interest. In particular, is is true that there is some bounded $k$ s.t. $$ f(n, k) = o(|E|), $$ where $E$ is the number of edges? UPD The answer for the last question is NO, as seen from the following example. Take $k+1$ copies of $K_{n/(k+1)}$, call it $G_0, ..., G_k$. Join all vertices in $G_i$ and $G_{i+1}$ (addition mod $(k+1)$). One can show that for this graph $f(n, k) \geq n^2/4(k+1)^2$. It is interesting to see what is the right constant, though. 

I've got a new criterion for comparing Galois reps which are four dimensional if we know the kernel of the residual representation mod $5$ (or any large odd prime) and the Sato-Tate groups (should be same for each one) are connected. Note that we don't need to have a large residual image, so this applies to a different set of representations than Faltings-Serre. It also doesn't use a large tower, making it stronger and more efficient than existing variants of the Livne method. What I don't have are some good examples: the one I was working on when I discovered this method really requires a criterion that works for $p=2$, which is a lot more complicated (and I don't have a handle on yet). So does anyone have some Galois representations to compare lying around meeting my critera? The kernel of the residual representation may be hard to determine on the automorphic side: I'm working on ways to fix that. 

I think that conjecture is true. Let $a$, $b$ be two non-adjacent vertices. I claim that $H = G \setminus \{a, b\}$ must contain exactly two connected components. Indeed, if it has more than two, we can take any of these, say $H_1$, and $H_1 \cup \{a, b\}$ will be connected while the rest of $G$ not. On the other hand, the case of a single component $H$ is also impossible since otherwise $G \setminus H$ is just pair of vertices $a$ and $b$ and it is disconnected. Thus, $G$ consists of two components $H_1$ and $H_2$ and $a$ and $b$ in between. Now I claim that $H_1$ is just a path from $a$ to $b$. First, since $G \setminus H_2$ is connected, there should be some path $l$ from $a$ to $b$ which lies entirely in $H_1$. On the other hand, $H_1$ cannot contain any other vertices since otherwise $G \setminus \{l \cup a \cup b \}$ is disconnected. The same holds for $H_2$. Thus, $G$ originally was just a cycle. 

Conway and Sloane, as well as Cassels, and also O'Meara, all have their own idiosyncratic way of expressing the following result (for good primes): Every quadratic form with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is equivalent by a change of variables with coefficients $\mathbb{Z}_p$ to one expressible as $\oplus_{i} p^{e_i}h(\epsilon_i, m_i)$, where $h(\epsilon_i, m_i)$ is $y_1^2+y_2^2+\ldots+y_{m_i}^2$ if $\epsilon_i=0$, and $y_1^2+y_2^2+\ldots+ry_{m_i}^2$ with $r$ a quadratic nonresidue if $\epsilon_i=1$. Furthermore there is a quadratic form $f$ over the integers with given local components $f_i$ if and only if the compatibility conditions for rational equivalence are satisfied. In the case of rational equivalence this has been given an effective treatment by Kirschmer and a coauthor whose name escapes me right now: given a discriminant and a list of primes where the form should have negative Hasse-Witt invariant, they compute a quadratic form. What I would like is a function that given a discriminant (as an integer), and a list of local components, computes a quadratic form in the given genus, i.e. computes the form $f$ described above. 

There is a paper by Gy\H{o}ry and Lemons "Hypergraphs with No Cycle of a Given Length", which bounds number of hyperedges for hypergraphs avoiding cycles of length $2k$ (unfortunately, I have access only to the abstract: $URL$ Particularly, in the case of a uniform 4-hypergraph avoiding 2-cycles it seems to provide $O(n^2)$ bound. I am wondering if it is possible to improve this to $o(n^2)$ or it is sharp? Here 2-cycle simply means two hyperedges $E_1, E_2$ which intersect in $2$ vertices. 

A classical theorem of Cassels states that if a homogenous quadratic form $Q$ has an integer zero, then there is a zero of small height (bounded solely by the coefficients and number of variables). Birch and Davenport extended this result to an arbitrary lattice $\Lambda$. Now suppose there is an integer lattice $\Lambda$ in $\mathbb{R}^{kl}$ and it is known that there is a vector $v \in \Lambda$ of the form $$ v =(\lambda_1 w, \lambda_2 w, \ldots, \lambda_kw), $$ where $\lambda_i$ are integers and $w$ is an integer vector in $\mathbb{R}^l$. Of course, such a condition is equivalent to multiple quadratic relations $X_iX_j - X_kX_l = 0$. I am wondering if one can then guarantee the existence of such $v$ with bounded height (polynomial in $\det(\Lambda))$)? It seems that in general there are no meaningful generalisations of Cassels' theorem to simultaneous quadratic forms. 

The answer is yes. There is a sign walk entirely within each compartment that removes the minus signs and produces the same normalized symbol for each train. Therefore the compartments of the two different trains are isomorphic as they have the same normalized symbol, even if that normalized symbol isn't the symbol of an actual quadratic form. 

Let $A$ and $B$ be Hecke eigenforms of some weight $k$ and level $N$. We know that there are irreducible representations $\rho_a$, $\rho_b$ of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$ whose trace of Frobenius of $p$ is given by $a_p$ or $b_p$, the Fourier coefficients of $A$ or $B$. $AB$ is a modular form of weight $2k$. It isn't clearly a Hecke eigenform, but its Fourier coefficients are still algebraic numbers, and it can be expressed as a sum of Hecke eigenforms and possibly an Eisenstein series of weight $2k$. We also have $\rho_a \otimes \rho_b$ a representation. It isn't irreducible, but can be expressed as a sum of irreducibles. The obvious hope is that this would correspond to the product, but that cannot be true because the characters don't match up. But convolution if appropriately defined would produce a form related to $\rho_a \otimes \rho_b$. So my two questions: what is multiplication of modular forms representation-theoretically, and what is tensoring of representations on the modular forms side?
