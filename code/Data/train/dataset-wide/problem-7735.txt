Products of topological spaces give us nice embedding characterizations of spaces. Let $X$ be a topological space. Then we say that a topological space $Y$ is $X$-compact if $Y$ is isomorphic to a closed subspace of some product $X^{I}$, so the products $X^{I}$ are in some sense the universal $X$-compact spaces. We say that a space $Y$ is $X$-completely regular if $Y$ is isomorphic to a subspace of some product $X^{I}$. Some nice topological properties may be characterized using $X$-compactness and $X$-complete regularity. For instance, the $[0,1]$-completely regular spaces are simply the completely regular spaces. The $\{0,1\}$-completely regular spaces are the zero-dimensional spaces. A topological space is compact and Hausdorff if and only if it is $[0,1]$-compact. A topological space is a Boolean space(i.e. compact and zero-dimensional) if and only if it is $\{0,1\}$-compact. A topological space whose cardinality is below the first measurable cardinal is realcompact ($\mathbb{R}$-compact spaces are called realcompact spaces) if and only if it can be given a compatible complete uniformity. Furthermore, a topological space whose cardinality is below the first measurable cardinal is $\mathbb{N}$-compact if and only if it can be given a compatible complete non-Archimedean uniformity (a non-Archimedean uniform space is a uniform space generated by equivalence relations). I must mention that the restriction that the cardinality of your space is below the first measurable cardinal is a very minor restriction. The existence of a measurable cardinal goes beyond the standard axioms of set theory. Furthermore, measurable cardinals are extremely large if they do exist. On a related note, every metric space can be isometrically embedded into some space $\ell^{\infty}(A)$ for some set $A$ (See Isbells book on Uniform Space for a proof). Therefore the spaces $\ell^{\infty}(A)$ are in a sense the universal metric spaces. In particular, since every metric space is uniformly homeomorphic to a bounded metric space, every metric space is uniformly homeomorphic to a subspace of the unit ball of $\ell^{\infty}(A)$. Since every uniform space is induced by a family of pseudometrics, we conclude that every uniform space is uniformly homeomorphic to a subspace of a product of the unit balls in some $\ell^{\infty}(A)$. In particular, a topological space is can be given a compatible complete uniformity if and only if it is isomorphic to some closed subspace of some product $\ell^{\infty}(A)^{I}$. 

Let $BG$ denote the classifying space of a finite group $G$. For which group cohomology classes $c\in H^2(G;\mathbb{Z}/2)$ does there exist a real vector bundle $E$ over $BG$ such that $w_2(E)=c$? 

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a monoidal category. There is a notion of Morita equivalence of algebra objects internal to $\mathcal{C}$. Does each Morita class have a symmetric Frobenius representative? A Hopf representative? Following arXiv:math/0111139, suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple and rigid with finitely many irreducible objects and irreducible unit. Each indecomposable semisimple module category over $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to one of the form $\text{Mod}_\mathcal{C}A$ for some algebra object $A$ internal to $\mathcal{C}$; such algebras are called indecomposable semisimple, and their Morita classes are in bijective correspondence with such module categories. In this language, my question is whether, given such a module category $\mathcal{M}$ over $\mathcal{C}$, there is a symmetric Frobenius (or Hopf) algebra object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that $\text{Mod}_\mathcal{C}A$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{M}$. If not, are there conditions on $\mathcal{C}$ under which $A$ exists? 

There are even non-normal separable complex manifolds. The paper Complex analytic manifolds without countable base by Calabi and Rosenlicht gives examples $M,S$ of a non-normal separable complex manifolds of complex dimension 2 and hence real dimension 4. It was proven by Rado that every Riemann surface is paracompact, so the dimension of these manifolds is optimal. 

$f(0)=0$ $X$ is a DCPO whenever $L\subseteq X$ is a chain, then $f[L]$ has a least upper bound and $f(\bigvee L)=\bigvee f[L]$. whenever $x\in L$ and $f(x)<r$, there is some $y>x$ with $f(y)\leq r$. 

Let $\kappa$ be a strong cardinal. Then for each $\lambda\geq\kappa$ does there exist a $\mu>\lambda$ such that if $U$ is a $\kappa$-complete ultrafilter on $\lambda$ and $j:V\rightarrow M,V_{\mu}\subseteq M,j(crit(j))>\mu$ then there is some $\alpha$ and $x\in V_{\alpha}$ so that the ultrafilter $\{R\subseteq V_{\alpha}|x\in j(R)\}$ is Rudin-Keisler equivalent to $U$? 

We can also describe $\beta\mathbb{Z}$ in terms of ultrafilters on Boolean algebras. I claim that $\beta\mathbb{Z}$ is the space of ultrafilters on the Boolean algebra of clopen sets in $\mathbb{Z}$ when $\mathbb{Z}$ has the Fürstenberg topology. Recall that a space $X$ is zero-dimensional if it has a basis of clopen sets, and recall that a zero set on a space $X$ is a set of the form $f^{-1}(0)$ for some continuous $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. A completely regular space $X$ is said to be strongly zero-dimensional if the Stone-Cech compactification $\beta X$ is zero-dimensional. It can be shown that a completely regular space $X$ is strongly zero-dimensional if and only if whenever $Z_{1},Z_{2}\subseteq X$ are disjoint zero sets, there is a clopen set $C\subseteq X$ with $Z_{1}\subseteq C,Z_{2}\subseteq C^{c}$ [1 p. 85]. In other words, a completely regular space is strongly zero-dimensional iff every pair of zero sets is separated by a clopen set. If $X$ is zero-dimensional, then let $\mathfrak{B}(X)$ denote the Boolean algebra of clopen subsets of $X$ and let $\zeta X$ be the space of ultrafilters on $\mathfrak{B}(X)$. Then $\zeta X$ is in a sense the maximal zero-dimensional compactification of $X$ which is called the Banaschewski compactification. If $X$ is strongly zero-dimensional, then the Banaschewski compactification $\zeta X$ is precisely the Stone-Cech compactification. In [1. p. 86] it states that zero-dimensionality and strong zero-dimensionality are equivalent in Lindelof spaces. Therefore since $\mathbb{Z}$ is zero-dimensional and Lindelof, the space $\mathbb{Z}$ is strongly zero-dimensional. We conclude that $\beta\mathbb{Z}=\zeta\mathbb{Z}$ is the space of ultrafilters on $\mathfrak{B}(\mathbb{Z})$. In order to clear up some confusion about the space $\mathbb{Z}$ and its Stone-Cech compactification, I will outline some basic facts about $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\beta\mathbb{Z}$. I claim that the space $\mathbb{Z}$ has an infinite partition into clopen sets. It is not too hard to give an explicit example of such a partition. For a more slick proof, assume that $\mathbb{Z}$ has no partition into countably many clopen sets. If $\mathcal{U}$ is an open cover of $\mathbb{Z}$, then there is a clopen cover $\{C_{n}|n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ that refines $\mathcal{U}$. If we set $D_{n}=C_{n}\setminus(C_{0}\cup...\cup C_{n-1})$ for all $n$, then $\{D_{n}|n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is a partition of $\mathbb{Z}$ into finitely many clopen sets that refines $\mathcal{U}$, so $\mathbb{Z}$ is compact. This is a contradiction. Therefore $\mathbb{Z}$ has a partition into countably many clopen sets. In particular, there is a continuous surjective function $f:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ where $\mathbb{N}$ has the discrete topology. Therefore the map $f$ extends to a continuous surjective function $\bar{f}:\beta\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\beta\mathbb{N}$. Since $|\beta\mathbb{N}|=2^{\mathbb{c}}$, we conclude that $|\beta\mathbb{Z}|=2^{\mathbb{c}}$ as well. We conclude that the Stone-Cech compactification $\beta\mathbb{Z}$ is much larger than the pro-finite completion of $\mathbb{Z}$. [1] The Stone-Cech Compactification, Russell Walker (1970) 

Given two spectra $A$ and $B$, the set $[A,B]$ of homotopy classes of maps from $A$ to $B$ forms an abelian group. Can the dual abelian group $\text{Hom}([A,B],\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$ be expressed as a group of homotopy classes of maps between spectra? The Brown-Comenetz dual $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E$ of a spectrum $E$ is defined here. A key property of $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E$ is that its homotopy is dual of that of $E$ in the sense that $\pi_*I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}E=\text{Hom}(\pi_*E,\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$. Naively, I suspect that $\text{Hom}([A,B],\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$ can be expressed in terms of $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}A$ and $I_{\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}B$. What if I replace ${\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}}$ by ${\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}$ or ${\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}}$? 

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a pivotal tensor category. Feel free to assume finiteness, semisimplicity, fusion, sphericality, unitarity or whatever makes things interesting. Which of the following structures come for free? 

I'm asking because premodular tensor categories appear in the literature with (at least) two definitions: 

Let $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$ denote the $\mathbb{Z}/2$-module defined by the inversion action on $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $G_0$ be a finite group that acts trivially on $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$. Then one can compute via the Künneth Theorem and UCT for cohomology,\begin{align}H^3(G_0\times\mathbb{Z}/2;\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv})&=\text{Tor}(H^3(G_0;\mathbb{Z}),\mathbb{Z}/2)\times H^2(G_0;\mathbb{Z})\otimes_\mathbb{Z}\mathbb{Z}/2\times \mathbb{Z}/2\\&=H^2(G_0;\mathbb{Z}/2)\times \mathbb{Z}/2.\end{align}We find that every non-zero element in the cohomology group is of order $2$. Now let $G_0\rightarrow G\xrightarrow{x} \mathbb{Z}/2$ be a possibly non-trivial extension of $\mathbb{Z}/2$ by $G_0$. A $G$-action on $\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv}$ is defined by $g:n\mapsto (-1)^{x(g)}n$. Is it true that every non-zero element in $H^3(G;\mathbb{Z}^\text{inv})$ is of order $2$? 

I do not have much intuition for the identities presented in the question, the LD-monoids are the monoids with self actions that satisfy identities that look similar to consistency, compatibility, and co-compatibility. An LD-monoid is an algebra $(X,*,\circ,1)$ such that $(X,\circ,1)$ is a monoid and where 

Property $1$ states that $\mathcal{A}$ is a collection of least upper bounds and properties $2-5$ state that $\mathcal{A}$ contains all sets with least upper bounds that you would want to include. For instance, in a Boolean algebra you would always want to include the least upper bound of a finite set. Axioms $2-5$ get rid of all the trivial differences between Boolean admissibility systems. A Boolean admissibility system $(B,\mathcal{A})$ is called subcomplete if whenever $R\cup S\in\mathcal{A}$ and $r\wedge s=0$ whenever $r\in R,s\in S$, then $\bigvee R$ exists. I recently proved that the category of Boolean admissibility systems is equivalent to the category of all pairs $(L,A)$ such that $L$ is a frame and $A$ is a Boolean sublattice of $L$ which is a "basis" for $L$(i.e. $A$ is a sublattice of $L$ consisting of complemented elements where each element in $L$ is the join of elements in $A$). This equivalence of categories restricts to an equivalence between the category of all zero-dimensional frames and subcomplete Boolean admissibility systems. With this duality, I was able to characterize point-free topological properties in terms of the corresponding Boolean admissibility systems. These properties include ultraparacompactness, ultranormality, $\kappa$-compact zero-dimensional frames(where $\kappa$ is a cardinal), extremally disconnected frames(as Boolean admissibility systems which are complete Boolean algebras), Lindelof $P$-frames(as $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebras), and other properties. This result does not have as much of a pointed analogue since very rarely does a Boolean admissibility system correspond to zero-dimensional space (i.e. a spatial zero dimensional frame). The Boolean admissibility systems that correspond to topologies are precisely the subcomplete Boolean admissibility systems $(B,\mathcal{A})$ where each ideal closed under taking least upper bounds in $\mathcal{A}$ can be extended to a maximal ideal closed under taking least upper bounds in $\mathcal{A}$. This property can be characterized by a very strong distributivity property and very few Boolean admissibility systems satisfy this property. I should also note that one can represent any pair $(L,A)$ where $L$ is a frame and $A$ is a "basis" for $L$ as the poset $A$ along with specified least upper bounds. Unfortunately, even though this setting is more general, I have not yet found a way to represent any separation axioms in terms of posets with specified least upper bounds. 

The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence \begin{equation*}E^2_{p,q}=H_p(B,h_q(F))\Rightarrow h_{p+q}(E),\end{equation*} computes the generalized homology $h$ of a total space $E$ of a Serre fibration from the ordinary homology $H$ of the base space $B$ with coefficients in the generalized homology of the fiber $F$. In particular, using the fibration $\text{pt}\rightarrow X\rightarrow X$ computes $h_n(X)$ from $h_n(\text{pt})$ and knowledge of the differentials. For simplicity, suppose that $h$ satisfies $h_0(\text{pt})=\mathbb{Z}$. (This may not be necessary in the end.) As a generalized homology theory , $h$ corresponds to a topological spectrum (also called $h$). Trivially, the Eilenberg-Maclane spectrum $H$ is a Postnikov truncation of $h$; in particular, the homotopy groups agree at degree $0$ and there are no k-invariants to check. My intuition is that the spectral sequence refines $H$ by incorporating data from the higher degrees of the Postnikov tower of $h$. The new homotopy groups $\pi_n(h)$ in the Postnikov tower appear as the coefficient modules $h_n(\text{pt})$ in the spectral sequence, while the new k-invariants appear as differentials. Now, my question. Suppose $h$ and $g$ are topological spectra such that $g$ is a Postnikov truncation of $h$. Is there an analog to the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence that computes $h$ from $g$? (Perhaps Postnikov truncation is too strong or too weak an assumption. Please feel free to interpret my question to make it more interesting!) 

For varieties that only have unary function symbols, it is necessary to use constant functions as in Tom Leinster's answer. $\mathbf{Proposition}$ Suppose that $V$ is a variety such that all the function symbols are unary and for all terms $t$, $V$ does not satisfy the identity $t(x)=t(y)$. Then there is some algebra $X\in V$ and multiple homomorphisms $1\rightarrow X$. $\mathbf{Proof}$ Suppose that $V$ does not satisfy the identity $t(x)=t(y)$ for each term $t$. Then there does not exist terms $s,t$ that satisfy the identity $s(x)=t(y)$. Therefore every identity in $V$ is an identity of the form $s(x)=t(x)$. Let $G$ be the monoid of all terms in $V$ in one variable up to logical equivalence. Then $G$ is a monoid defined by $s(x)t(x)=s(t(x))$. We may therefore think of the variety $V$ as the collection of all actions from the monoid $G$ to some set $X$. On the other hand, let $G$ be the trivial action on a set $X$. In other words, $gx=x$ for all $g\in G$. Then every function $\phi:1\rightarrow G$ is a homomorphism.
