Here's an example with a topological action of $\mathbf{R}^2$ on the 2-torus with 3 orbits; I expect it can be made $C^\infty$ but definitely cannot be made real analytic. If $X$ is a topological space and $f$ a self-homeomorphism, recall that its mapping cylinder $\mathrm{Cyl}(X,f)$ is $X\times [0,1]$ modulo identification $(x,1)\equiv (f(x),0)$. It admits a continuous action of $\mathbf{R}$ given by $t\cdot (x,u)=(f^{-\lfloor t+u\rfloor}(x),u+t-\lfloor u+t\rfloor)$. If $X$ is a smooth manifold and $f^{\pm 1}$ is smooth as well, then so is the mapping cylinder and the action. (Here smooth can mean $C^k$, $C^\infty$, $C^\omega$). Now consider a continuous action of a topological group $H$ on $X$ commuting with $h$, in the sense that $h\cdot(f(x))=f(h\cdot x)$ for all $x\in X$ and $h\in H$. Then the action of $H$ extends to an action on $\mathrm{Cyl}(X,f)$, simply given by $h\cdot (x,u)=(h(x),u)$, and this action commutes with the flow, so that we get a continuous action of $G=H\times\mathbf{R}$ on $\mathrm{Cyl}(X,f)$. Clearly if the action of $H$ has finitely many orbits, then so does the action of $G$, and if the action of $H$ has locally closed orbits, then so does the action of $G$. Also if the action of both $f$ and $H$ is smooth in any sense then so is the action of $G$. Now we pick $X$ to be the circle, identified to the projectivized line $\mathbf{R}\cup\{\infty\}$ by sterographic projection, $f(x)=x+1$, $f(\infty)=\infty$. Then we pick $H$ to be the reals, acting in such a way that its orbits are the integers (singletons) and the intervals between integers. [This action can obviously made analytic outside $\{\infty\}$ but behaves badly close to infty]. Anyway the action of $G=\mathbf{R}^2$ on the 2-torus $\mathrm{Cyl}(X,f)$ has 3 orbits: $C=\{\infty\}\times [0,1]$, the orbit $C'$ of $(0,0)$, which is orbit of $(0,0)$ by the flow of the mapping cylinder and is fixed by $H$; it's an immersed line, accumulating on the orbit $C$, and the dense open orbit $C''$, on which $G$ acts freely. Then $C'$ is 1-dimensional and so is the circle $\bar{C'}-C'=C$. So far this is only a topological action of $\mathbf{R}^2$ on the 2-torus. To get a better smoothness, we need the action of $H=\mathbf{R}$ to be made smooth. To make it real analytic is hopeless because $\infty$ is an accumulation point of isolated fixed points. On the other hand, to make it $C^\infty$ does not sound hard. 

[t.f.g. means topologically finitely generated, meaning having a dense finitely generated subgroup] Now I claim that 

No for $2n+1\ge 7$: $\mathfrak{so}(3)\oplus\mathfrak{so}(2n-2)$ does not embed into $\mathfrak{gl}(2n)$. Indeed start with $2n+1\ge 9$. Consider a nontrivial irreducible (real) representation of this product, nontrivial on both factors, of dimension $d$. It is isotypic for $\mathfrak{so}(3)$, say of the form $\mathfrak{v}_k^{\oplus m}$ with $\mathfrak{v}_k$ $k$-dimensional. If $k$ is odd, $\mathfrak{v}_k$ is absolutely irreducible, and hence the centralizer is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{gl}_m$, and hence $m\ge 2n-2$, so $$d=km\ge 3m\ge 3(2n-2)=6n-6=(2n+1)+(4n-5)\ge 2n+1.$$ Otherwise $k$ is a multiple of 4 (so $k\ge 4$) and the complexification is a sum of $2m$ $(k/2)$-dimensional irreducible representations, and hence the complexification of the centralizer is $\mathfrak{gl}_{2m}(\mathbf{C})$. So $2m\ge 2n-2$, so $$d=km\ge 4m\ge 4(n-1)=4n-1\ge 2n+1.$$ Such irreducible being discarded, one remains with sums of irreducibles factoring through one quotient, and the smallest faithful one is clearly $(2n+1)$-dimensional. For $2n+1=7$, one has to show that $\mathfrak{so}(3)\oplus\mathfrak{so}(4)\simeq\mathfrak{so}(3)^3$ does not embed into $\mathfrak{gl}(6)$. This is seen by hand: start with an irreducible of dimension $\le 6$, and suppose that it's nontrivial on the first factor. Then on the first factor, it's either $\mathfrak{v}_3$, $\mathfrak{v}_5$, $\mathfrak{v}_4$ or $\mathfrak{v}_3^{\oplus 2}$. The centralizer is abelian in the first two cases, and is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{so}_3\times\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ in the last two cases. This shows that for $\mathfrak{so}(4)$, the only irreducible of dimension $\le 6$ (actually $\le 7$) that is nontrivial on both factors is 4-dimensional, and that there is no irreducible of $\mathfrak{so}(3)^3$ of dimension $\le 6$ that is nontrivial on each factor. If we allow only irreps that are nontrivial on only one factor, one has to add up to 9 to get faithfulness. So one irrep should be nontrivial on 2 factors, hence 4-dimensional. The remaining 2 dimensions are not enough to add anything. Remains $2n+1=5$. At the level of Lie algebras there's no obstruction. Indeed any subalgebra of the 10-dimensional $\mathfrak{so}(5)$ has codimension $\ge 4$, that is dimension $\le 6$. Hence, if nonabelian it's isomorphic to $\mathfrak{so}(4)$, or $\mathfrak{so}(3)+\mathbf{R}^{k}$ for some $k$. A centralizer argument shows that $k\le 1$, so this indeed embeds into $\mathfrak{so}(4)$. I haven't checked at the group level. 

There exists such example (thus also disproving Conjecture 4.1.28 here). Indeed there exists a nonzero nilpotent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with rational coefficients whose automorphism group $A$ is unipotent (references (1,2) below). Therefore $\mathfrak{g}$ admits an $A$-invariant $\mathbf{Q}$-defined proper subalgebra $\mathfrak{l}$ such that the induced $A$-action on $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}$ is trivial. Let $G$ is the corresponding unipotent $\mathbf{Q}$-group ($G_K$ can be defined by endowing $\mathfrak{g}_K$ with the group law defined by the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula) and $L_\mathbf{Q}$ the corresponding subgroup, so that $\mathrm{Aut}(G_\mathbf{Q})=A_{\mathbf{Q}}$. Then $L_\mathbf{Q}$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G_\mathbf{Q}$ and the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(G_\mathbf{Q})$ on $G_\mathbf{Q}/L_\mathbf{Q}$ is trivial. It follows that every subgroup of $G_\mathbf{Q}$ containing $L_\mathbf{Q}$ is also a characteristic subgroup. So, if we define $H\subset G_\mathbf{Q}$ as the inverse image of an infinite cyclic subgroup of $G_\mathbf{Q}/L_\mathbf{Q}$, then $H$ is not $p$-divisible (hence not $p$-powered) for any prime $p$, while $G_\mathbf{Q}$ is $p$-powered for all primes $p$. For those who rather like Lie groups: if we perform the same construction in the real case, we get $H\subset G_\mathbf{R}$, where $G_\mathbf{R}$ is a simply connected nilpotent Lie group, $H$ is a closed proper subgroup closed under the whole group of continuous group automorphisms of $G_\mathbf{R}$. 

Then if $(S_n)$ is a sequence of finite simple groups, the conditions $r_6(S_n)\to\infty$, $\mathrm{nc}(S_n)\to\infty$, $\mathrm{ns}(S_n)\to\infty$, $\rho(S_n)\to\infty$, $r_m(S_n)\to\infty$ where $m$ is any number with at least 2 distinct prime divisors, $\mathrm{lni}(S_n)\to\infty$, $\mathrm{lso}(S_n)\to\infty$, $a(S_n)\to\infty$, are all equivalent. The same holds with "$\to\infty"$ replaced by "is bounded". This is just a sample: many variants are possible, and follow from the classification with not much efforts. Of course this dramatically fails for arbitrary finite groups, for which "being of bounded rank" is not univocally defined. 

Update: my answer above was incomplete since it does not address double transpositions; let me now answer the question fully; this will actually make use of the above answer about the graph of transpositions! Let us consider the graph $Z_n$ of double transpositions. Let me stick to $n=6$. I'll denote the permutation $(ab)(cd)$ as $(ab|cd)$ to avoid too many parentheses/commas. In $Z_6$, there are triangles defined as follows: 

Here's a proof assuming $n\ge 3,n\neq 8$ that the Lie algebras are isomorphic only when the quadratic forms are equivalent up to rescaling (I assume $K$ has characteristic zero and fix an algebraically closed extension $C$). Let $f:\mathfrak{so}(\phi)\to \mathfrak{so}(\psi)$ be a $K$-defined isomorphism. We can assume that both $\mathfrak{so}(\phi)$ and $\mathfrak{so}(\psi)$ are $K$-defined subalgebras of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ preserving a nondegenerate quadratic form on the $n$-dimensional space. Then both are $C$-conjugate to $\mathfrak{so}(n)$. Since I assume $n\neq 8$ odd, over $C$, all automorphisms of $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ can be realized by some element of $\mathrm{GL}_n(C)$ (actually, of $\mathrm{O}_n(C)$). It follows that $f$ can be realized by a conjugation, namely there exists $A\in\mathrm{GL}_n(C)$ satisfying: $f(g)A=Ag$ for all $g\in \mathfrak{so}(\phi)$. The set of $A$ satisfying this condition is a $K$-defined linear subspace on which the determinant map does not vanish; hence it contains a $K$-point with nonzero determinant. That is, $A$ can be found in $GL_n(K)$. Hence $\mathfrak{so}(\psi)$ preserves the $K$-defined quadratic form $x\mapsto \phi'(x):=\phi(A^{-1}x)$. Since the set of $K$-defined invariant forms is 1-dimensional (because the standard representation of $\mathfrak{so}(\psi)$ is absolutely irreducible), it follows that $\phi'$ and $\psi$ are collinear. I don't know what's going on for $n=8$. For $n=2$, while there's only one 1-dimensional Lie algebra over $K$ so it's not enough to classify. Nevertheless it's still true that two quadratic forms are $K$-isomorphic up to rescaling [equivalently, have same determinant in $K^*/(K^*)^2$] iff they have isogenous SO(-). The point is that for 1-dimensional $K$-tori, $K$-isogenous is the same as $K$-isomorphic, and we can run the same proof as the above Lie-algebra-theoretic one, where we need to use the fact that every automorphism of $\mathrm{SO}_2(C)$ can be realized by some element of $\mathrm{GL}_2$. Actually this latter proof works for all $n\ge 2$ to show that if $\mathrm{SO}(\phi)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(\psi)$ are $K$-isomorphic then $\phi$ and $\psi$ are $K$-equivalent up to rescaling.
