Stellar aberration, the change in the apparent positions of more or less most of the night sky with the seasons, directly due to the velocity of the earth in its orbit. Note - aberration, which is related to the idea that raindrops appear to fall slanted in a moving vehicle, is not the same as parallax, e.g. has no relation to the distance of the stellar source, etc. :-) See $URL$ . Predicted by Bradley in 1725. First measured > 0 by Bessel in 1838, with unpublished successful observations by Henderson 5 years earlier. See $URL$ . 

Ok, I understand and am convinced by the standard solution of the Monte Hall Problem, i.e. it is better to switch doors after Monte opens one, and improve one's probability of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. If I had remaining doubts, they were removed by the many computer simulations, e.g. see $URL$ But then I came up with what I call the "three card monte problem". Assume you are playing a variant of 3 card monte against a blindingly fast but honest dealer, who will also turn over a losing card, before your once and final guess. Do you have a strategy that improves your probability to better than 1/2? Well, here's one. You choose a card, mentally, but do not reveal it. The dealer then turns over one of the other cards, which he knows is always not the "special winning card". There is prob = 1/3 that the turned over card is the card that you previously secretly mentally chose. If that happens, you still can choose again, and therefore have prob = 1/2 of choosing the winner. If the card turned over by the dealer is not the card you secretly chose mentally, then you are apparently playing the classic Monte Hall game, i.e. you should secretly mentally switch card positions to increase your prob of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. Your overall prob. of winning is (1/3)(1/2) + (2/3)(2/3) = 1/6 + 4/9 = 33/54 = 11/18 > 1/2 The paradox arises from the fact that another player, who chose the other hidden card which was not turned over also has the same 11/18 probability of winning. So you both switch? The difference between this and the classical Monte Hall paradox is that because no player has to declare any card position, you both can switch. Is this right? If this gets too argumentative, I'll put it somewhere else. 

For simplicity, let us consider only a functor out of a small category $\mathcal{C}$ to $Set$, $$ f:\mathcal{C}\to Set, $$ The Grothendieck construction produces a category (category of elements) $El(f)$ whose objects are $\sqcup_{c\in \mathcal{C}} f(c)$. Grothendieck construction provides a universal way to compute the colimits. My question: Is there a co-form Grothendieck construction (or Grothendieck nstruction for fun)? The co-form of Grothendieck construction should give us a way to compute the limits. By nonsense argument, this might be the (internal) Grothendieck construction for $f^{op}: \mathcal{C}^{op}\to Set^{op}$. But I hardly see what is this more concretely. First, the space of elements is dual to above form, perhaps $\Pi_{c\in \mathcal{C}} f(c)$. 

Given a monoid $C$ acting (from the right) on a set $M$, there is a bar construction giving a simplicial set or equivalently a translation/action category, $$ N_\bullet (M\rtimes C)= \cdots M\times C^2 \Rrightarrow M\times C ⇉^s_t M, \quad \text{with } s(m,c)=mc, t(m,c)=m. $$ There is a natural morphism of simplicial sets $N_\bullet (M\rtimes C)\to N_\bullet (*\rtimes C)$. One may argue that the correct quotient of $M$ by the $C$ action is this bar construction (cf. Thomason’s homotopy colimit theorem). Now consider weak monoidal category $C$ coherent action on a category $M$. That is, there is an action functor $M\times C\to M$, unit and associative up to coherent invertible natural transformations. We imitate the bar construction $$ \cdots M\times C^2\Rrightarrow M\times C ⇉^s_t M. $$ But in this case simplicial identities hold up to invertible natural transformations. Jardine's supercoherence theorem implies that we obtain a pseudo-simplicial categories, that is a pseudo functor $\Delta^{op}\to Cats$. Applying then the Grothendieck construction, we obtain a category which is a pseudo colimit of this simplicial diagram. This may be regard as the (homotopy) quotient of $M$ by the $C$ action. There is another construction like the geometric nerve of a bicategory. Viewing $C$ as a one object, say $*$, bicategory. Imaging the object of $M$ as arrows $0\leftarrow *$, arrows of $M$ as 2-cells. Then the action functor works like composition in a bicategory. Now form a simplicial set with $X_0=M_0$, that is arrows $0\leftarrow *$. Let $X_1$ be the set of 2-commutative triangles with vertex $(0,*,*)$, that is the set of $(m, c, \alpha)$, where $m\in M, c\in C$ and $\alpha$ is an arrow in $M$ with target $mc$. Let $X_2$ be 2-commutaitve 3-simplex $(0,*,*,*)$, and so on. We obtain a simplicial set $X$. (It is clear that if $M$ is a set and $C$ is a monoid, $X$ is the bar construction.) My question: whether $X$ and the one given by Grothendieck construction have the same homotopy type? They both have a map to (the nverve of one obect bicategory) $C$, thus a commutative triangle up to homotopy? Possible relevant result, it is shown that the geometric nerve and pseudo-nerve of a bicategory has the same homotopy type. However this does not answer the question directly. 

Suppose we call a knot an equivalence class of embeddings of S1 --> R3 under ambient isotopy, a knot representative a particular such embedding, and a knot diagram the "2 1/2 dimensional" shadow of such a knot representative on S2 from a particular vantage point P, i.e. the light source for the shadow is at P, and the "2 1/2" means that the over and under information is shown. My question involves how the set of knot diagrams of a particular fixed knot representative vary as P, the viewpoint varies. We know about the Reidemeister rules, which generate a group of transformations of knot diagrams in a way such that the underlying knot remains invariant under changes of both ambient isotopy and projection. Intuitively there is also a smaller group of pure "projective" transformations of knot diagrams under which any fixed knot representative remains invariant. Assuming that, what are the relations between these two groups of transformations of knot diagrams? 

If we introduce local coordinates $(x^i)$ on $M$, then $(x^i, dx^i)$ can be local coordinates on $TM$, and $(x^i, dx^i, \delta x^i, d\delta x^i)$ can be local coordinates on $T(TM)$. But the rules for change of coordinates is a bit complicated for $T(TM)$, which involve the second derivatives of transition functions of $(x^i)$. So we can not hope $TTM\cong \oplus^3 TM$. From argument above we have three different maps $TM\to TTM$ given by $(x^i, dx^i)\mapsto (x^i, dx^i,0,0)$ or $(x^i, 0,\delta x^i,0)$ or $(x^i,0,0, d\delta x^i)$, thus we have a map $\oplus^3 TM\to TTM$ of vector bundle over $M$. This map is locally an isomorphism, as we saw $T(TR^d)=R^{4d}=\oplus^3 T R^d$, so this is also a globally isomorphism. 

I got a proof, slightly modified after talking to a friend. Thanks @Tim and @Harry. We prove a stronger statement: any inner horn $\Lambda^n_i$ can be retracted to $\Delta^{n-1}\cup_{\{n-1\}} \Delta^1\{ n-1, n \}$, then by induction the statement follows. To this end, we claim that $\Lambda^n_i$ admits an inner horn retraction to $\Delta^{n-1} \cup_{ \Delta^{n-2}\{1,\cdots,n-1\} } \Delta^{n-1}\{1,\cdots n \} $, then the stronger statement follows also by induction. To prove the claim, noticing that $\Delta^{n-1} \cup_{ \Delta^{n-2}\{1,\cdots,n-1\} } \Delta^{n-1}\{1,\cdots n \}\hookrightarrow \Lambda^n_i$ is a trivial cofibration, therefore $\Lambda^n_i$ admits a retraction to $\Delta^{n-1} \cup_{ \Delta^{n-2}\{1,\cdots,n-1\} } \Delta^{n-1}\{1,\cdots n \} $. But each step is retracting a horn containing $ \{0 ,n \}$, thus an inner horn retraction. 

Crystallography, illustrated by optical diffraction. See the repeated pattern under a magnifier, then project with different wavelengths (would a prism work or do you need different laser pointers). Introduction to Fourier analysis, optical transforms,etc. 

Isn't the point that human reason is generally frail altogether, especially when making conclusions by using long serial chains of arguments? So in mathematics where such extended arguments are routine, we want their soundness to be as close to ideal as possible. Of course, even generally accepted proofs are occasionally later seen to be lacking, but to give up proofs as the ideal changes the very nature of mathematics. I heard that the example of parts of the Italian school of algebraic geometry of the 19th century was an important example of this overextension of intuition. Furthermore, it is only in the attempt at proof that the real nature of the reasons why a statement is true are finally exposed. So the reformulation and refoundation of algebraic geometry in the 20th century is said to have exposed revolutionary new ways of seeing mathematics in general. Finally, it is only by proof that the limits of applicability of a theorem are really understood. This comes into play many times in physics, say where some "no-go theorem" is elided because its assumptions are not valid in some new realm. 

Could you point where did I make mistake(s)? I think the second is wrong, but I can not tell why. Thanks in advance. 

Thanks to commenters, I realized that the naive statement on Lie algebras is simply wrong. My original attempt is to consider the cokernel for $L_\infty$-algebra morphisms. My second question still make sense. 

I am considering the double tangent bundle $T(TM)$ of manifolds $M$. Locally, if $M=R^d$ then $T(TM)=R^{4d}=\oplus^3 TM$. My attempt is to see whether $T(TM)\cong \oplus^3 TM$ naturally for any $M$. I have two contradictory arguments, of which one says $T(TM)\not\cong \oplus^3 TM$ but the other seems say $T(TM)\cong \oplus^3 TM$. 

Let $G=(G_1, G_0, s, t, u, i,\circ)$ be a groupoid, where $s, t$ are source and target maps, $i$ is the inverse, $u$ is the unit, and $\circ$ is the composition. Denote $\underline{G_1}, \underline{G_0}$ the trivial groupoid on $G_1, G_0$ respectively. There are morphisms of Lie groupoids $s:\underline{G_1}\to \underline{G_0}$ and $t: \underline{G_1}\to \underline{G_0}$, and $u:\underline{G_0}\to G$. There is a natural transformation $us\Rightarrow ut:\underline{G_1}\to G$ given by $id: G_1\to G_1$. Is it true that the 2-commutative diagram $$\underline{G_1}⇉^s_t \underline{G_0}\xrightarrow{u} G$$ is a 2-coequaliser diagram in the 2-category of groupoids? If this is not the case, how to correct it? I learn from Thomason’s homotopy colimit theorem that the 2-colimit of the nerve $\Delta^{op}\to NG$ and $G$ has the same homotopy type. A relevant statement is a quotient stack is a 2-coequalizer. 

How to form your own math circle or some other teaching movies, especially with kids solving problems and having fun at it. I mentioned this in a comment, but it could use elaboration and advertisement. Museums are for people, especially kids. One goal is to empower kids to feel they can think. Some sort of exhibits on what really good mathematics teaching feels like could be tremendously inspiring. The museum could be a living organizing center for this. 

a. Euler's computation of Zeta(2), (at first with only very weak, handwaving, or no convergence arguments), as redacted in Polya or here. Obviously amazingly ingenious, and interesting for artists, connecting numbers and circles. Requires unerstanding that a polynomial is equal to the product of its first degree factors, possibly it is too well known, however. It also allows one to then revisit the convergence argument and show what mathematicians actually worry about, after the "flash of ingenuity" b. A lovely agument I heard a long time ago on sci.math relating to Sagan's book "Contact" in which a message is encoded in the bits of Pi. Someone asked whether a deity could arrange for Pi to be a different real number. Opinions went back and forth relating to spacetime, etc. Then someone asked, in light of any of the familiar series expansions, "If Pi were different, which natural number would be missing or duplicated, and how might that be?" Leads to a discussion of the Peano axioms. Everyone goes home wondering. :-)
