The temperature of the cosmic microwave background scales as the inverse of the cosmic scale factor $a$. i.e. When everything was at half the separation it is now, then the CMB was twice the (absolute) temperature. The scale factor in turn is reciprocally related to the redshift by $a/a_0 = (1 +z)^{-1}$, where $z$ is the redshift and $a_0$ is the present-day scale factor, usually taken to be 1. From this we see that $$T(z) = T_0 (1+z),$$ where $T(z)$ is the temperature at redshift $z$ at some time in the past and $T_0 = 2.73$K is the temperature of the CMB now. For the range of temperatures you specify requires redshifts in the range $99< z< 136$. Getting from a redshift to a time in the universe since the big bang is not so simple. The answer depends on what you take to be the "cosmological parameters" - i.e. the values of the cosmic matter density, the dark energy density and so on. However, we can avoid looking "under the hood" and use a cosmology calculator. The one I have linked to is for a "flat" universe and has default values for what are currently good estimates for the matter density and present-day Hubble parameter. For the range of $z$ I found above, this corresponds to an age of between 10.8 and 17.3 million years after the big bang. I guess you are perhaps thinking about these ideas that life could have been around about 15 million years after the big bang. 

The way it works is as follows. We do detailed studies of stars in the solar neighbourhood. This establishes the local density of stars and the mix of masses they possess (called the stellar mass function). We compare that with the mass function of clusters of stars and note that to first order it appears invariant. We can then triangulate the problem in various ways: we can make a model for the stellar density of the Galaxy, assume it all has the same mass function and hence get a number of stars. The model may be based on crude light-to-mass conversions, but more often would be based on deep surveys of the sky - either narrow pencil beam surveys from HST, or broader surveys like SDSS, The key is to be able to count stars but also estimate how far away they are. This is highly uncertain and relies on some assumptions about symmetry to cover regions of our Galaxy we cannot probe. Another method is to count up bright objects that might act as tracers of the underlying stellar population (eg red giants), compare that with the number of giants in our well-studied locale, and from this extrapolate to a total number of stars, again relying on symmetry arguments for those bits of the Galaxy that are distant or obscured by dust. A third way is to ask, how many stars have lived and died in order to enrich the interstellar medium with heavy elements (a.k.a. metals). For example, it turns out there must have been about a billion core-collapse supernovae to create all the oxygen we see. If we assume the mass function is invariant with time and that supernovae arise from stars above 8 solar masses, then we also know how many long-lived low-mass stars were born with their high-mass siblings and hence estimate how many stars exist today. The number, whether it be 100 billion or 300 billion is no more accurate than a factor of a few, but probably more accurate than an order of magnitude. The main issue is that the most common stars in the Galaxy are faint M dwarfs,that contribute very little light or mass to the Galaxy, so we really are relying on an extrapolation of our local knowledge of these objects. The number of galaxies problem is easier, though the number is less well defined. We assume that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. We count up how many galaxies we can see in a particular area, multiply it up to cover the whole sky. The number must then be corrected for distant faint galaxies that cannot be seen. The difficult here is that we are looking into the past and the number of galaxies may not be conserved, either through evolution or mergers. So we have to try and come up with a statement like "there are n galaxies in the observable universe today that are more luminous than L". I think this number is certainly only an order of magnitude estimate. 

Thanks to the efforts of the aLIGO team, gravitational wave astronomy is a reality. At the same time, neutrino detectors like Hyperkamiokande are becoming much more sensitive. My question is: what are the prospects for the pseudo-simultaneous detection of gravitational waves and neutrinos from the same supernovae? What sort of stuff could we learn from such an event, both about supernovae and neutrinos? In particular, what are the prospects for estimating the neutrino mass? 

My understanding is that it would be quite usual for the majority of neutron stars to be pulsars shortly after they formed. The requirements are that they should have strong magnetic fields and rapid rotation (faster than a rotation period of a few seconds). The latter seems an almost inevitable consequence of conservation of angular momentum and the former must surely be assisted (if not fully explained) by conservation of magnetic flux as the core of a massive star collapses (see the discussion in Reisenegger 2007). But to be observed as a pulsar, the spin and magnetic field axes have to be oriented in a specific way, so that Doppler-boosted and beamed radiation sweeps over the Earth. This requirement means that we can observe only a fraction of the pulsars out there. In fact there are a category of "radio quiet pulsars" - these are detected by their high energy radiation pulsations but not seen as radio pulsars. The idea here is that the beaming is less extreme for the high energy radiation, allowing it to be seen. The pulsar phenomenon is also transient. Once the rotational kinetic energy of the pulsar has been extracted and it spins down beyond the "pulsar death line", or if magnetic field decay occurs rapidly, then the pulsar should switch off. Most of the billion (or so) neutron stars in our Galaxy are no longer pulsars. The slope of the death line is such (e.g. see Arons 1999) that even if the pulsar is born with a relatively weak field ($10^{6}$ T !) it should still be born with a rotation period short enough ($<1$ s) to produce the pulsar phenomenon initially. You might find the discussion/simulations in this paper interesting. 

I think the correct answer is that nobody knows - it all depends on the behaviour, or equation of state, of the dark energy. If the dark energy takes the form of a cosmological constant, then the energy density due to dark energy will end up completely dominant as the universe expands. The acceleration of the scale factor $a$ is given by $$\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}\left(\rho + \frac{3P}{c^2}\right) $$ where $\rho$ is the energy density, and $P$ is the pressure. A cosmological constant has $P = -\rho c^2$, which leads to $$ \ddot{a} = \frac{8\pi G \rho a}{3}$$ So, if dark energy dominates, then $\rho a$ increases with time, so the acceleration is positive and increasing with $a$ and hence time. If matter dominates, which it did in the past, then $P \simeq 0$ and $\rho a \propto a^{-2}$, so the acceleration is negative, with a magnitude that becomes smaller. The transition from deceleration to acceleration happens when $\rho_{\Lambda} + \rho_m + 3P/c^2= 0$. If we assume a cosmological constant with $P = -\rho_{\Lambda} c^2$, where $\rho_{\Lambda}$ is the dark energy density (which is constant), and $\rho_m$ is the matter density, where $\rho_m = \rho_0 a_0^{3}/a(t)^3$ and $\rho_0$ and $a_0$ are the present-day matter density and scale factor respectively. Thus $$ \rho_{\Lambda} + \rho_m -3\rho_{\Lambda} = 0$$ and the transition point occurs when $\rho_m = 2 \rho_{\Lambda}$. But because $\rho_{\Lambda}/\rho_0 = 0.7/0.3$, then $$ \rho_{\Lambda} = \frac{7\rho_0}{3} = \frac{7}{3}\left(\frac{a}{a_0}\right)^3 \rho_m$$ and so the scale factor at the time of transition from decleration to acceleration is found from $$ \rho_m = \frac{14}{3}\left(\frac{a}{a_0}\right)^3 \rho_m,$$ $$ a = \left(\frac{3}{14}\right)^{1/3} a_0$$ i.e. when the scale factor was 60% of the present day value. According to this cosmology calculator, this happened roughly 6 billion years ago. Thus the universe was decelerating then accelerated. So clearly the acceleration now is increasing with time. On the other hand, if for whatever reason, the dark energy started to "decay" then it might be that the acceleration would decrease.
