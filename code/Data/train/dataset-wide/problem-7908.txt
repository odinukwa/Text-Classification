This is as of now probably more of a really long comment than a complete answer. There is a one-to-one correspondence between compact Hausdorff spaces with distinguished dense subspaces and structures called proximity spaces. Similarly, there is a more general correspondence between locally compact Hausdorff spaces with distinguished dense subspaces and structures called local proximity spaces. In essence, we obtain the notion of a compact (locally compact) Hausdorff space with a distinguished dense subspace from structures that appear at first glance to have nothing to do with compactness. Intuitively, a proximity space is a set $X$ along with a binary relation $\mathcal{\delta}$ on $P(X)$ such that $\delta$ gives one the notion of whether two subsets of $X$ touch each other in some sense. For example, if $(X,d)$ is a metric space, then $(X,d)$ becomes a proximity space where $A\delta B$ if and only if $d(A,B)=0$. Every proximity space $(X,\delta)$ induces a completely regular topology on $X$ and with each proximity space $(X,\delta)$, we associate a compactification of $X$ known as the Smirnov compactification of $X$. From a proximity space and its Smirnov compactification, we obtain an equivalence between the category of proximity spaces and the category consisting of all pairs $(X,C)$ where $X$ is a proximity space and $C$ is a compactification of $X$. Furthermore, one can generalize the notion of a proximity space to the notion of a local proximity space to obtain a similar representation for locally compact spaces. Intuitively, a local proximity space is a set $X$ along with a notion of which subsets of $X$ are bounded and whether subsets of $X$ touch each other. The category of local proximity spaces is equivalent to the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces along with a distinguished dense subset. The reader is referred to the book [1] for more information on proximity spaces and local proximity spaces. [1] Naimpally, S. A., and B. D. Warrack. Proximity Spaces.

As G. Rodrigues stated, the problem of finding measures on a $\sigma$-algebra $(X,\mathcal{M})$ with a $\sigma$-ideal of null sets $I$ reduces to the problem of finding measures on the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{M}/I$. It turns out that the problem of finding measures $\mu$ on $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebras $B$ with $\mu(a)=0$ iff $a=0$ only appears to be more general than the problem of finding measure on $\sigma$-algebras $(X,\mathcal{M})$ with $\sigma$-ideals $I$. This is because every $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a quotient of a $\sigma$-algebra by a $\sigma$-complete ideal. 

The converse does not hold assuming I interpreted your notation correctly. Assume that $X$ is an uncountable set and $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{G}=\{\{x\}|x\in X\}$. In other words, $\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}$ are both the set of singletons in $X$. Then $\sigma(\mathcal{F})=\sigma(\mathcal{G})$ is the set of all countable and cocountable elements of $X$. Furthermore, $\{A\times B|A\in\mathcal{F},B\in\mathcal{G}\}$ is the set of all singletons in $X\times X$, so $\sigma(A\times B|A\in\mathcal{F},B\in\mathcal{G})$ is the collection of countable and cocountable sets in $X\times X$. On the other hand, $\{x\}\times X$ is in $\sigma(\mathcal{F})\otimes\sigma(\mathcal{G})$, but is neither countable nor cocountable, so $\{x\}\times X\not\in\sigma(A\times B|A\in\mathcal{F},B\in\mathcal{G})$. Therefore $\sigma(\mathcal{F})\otimes\sigma(\mathcal{G})\not\subseteq\sigma\{A\times B|A\in\mathcal{F},B\in\mathcal{G}\}$.` 

Suppose that $U\subseteq S^{1}$ is open where $S^{1}=\{z\in\mathbb{Z}:|z|=1\}$. Then define $\mu_{n}(U)=\max_{t\in S^{1}}\frac{1}{n}\cdot|\{k\in\{1,...,n\}|t\cdot e^{\frac{2\pi ik}{n}}\in U\}|$. Define $\mu(U)=\lim_{n}\mu_{n}(U)$ (here this limit is with respect to the divisibility ordering on the natural numbers. This limit converges since if $n|m$, then $\mu_{m}(U)\leq\mu_{n}(U)$). Of course, this measure can be defined on all subsets of $S^{1}$, but I am only interested in how this measure behaves on open sets. $\textbf{Properties of the measure $\mu$}$ Let me now outline some interesting properties that this measure satisfies and some counterexamples as well along with proofs of why the counterexamples work. This measure has the property that $\mu(U)=\mu((\overline{U})^{\circ})$ for each open set $U$, so one can consider this algebra to be a measure on the Boolean algebra of regular open sets. Furthermore, we have $\mu(U\cup V)\leq\mu(U)+\mu(V)$. In particular, if $U,V$ are regular open, then $\mu(U\vee V)\leq\mu(U)+\mu(V)$ where $\vee$ denotes the least upper bound in the Boolean algebra of regular open sets. If $m$ denotes the Lebesgue probability measure, then it is easy to see that $m(U)\leq\mu(U)\leq m(\overline{U})$. In particular, if $m((\partial\overline{U})^{\circ})=0$, then $\mu(U)=m(\overline{U})$. $\bullet$ There are open sets $U$ where $m(U)<\mu(U)$. For instance, if $C\subseteq S^{1}$ is a closed nowhere dense set with $m(C)>0$ and $U,V$ are disjoint open sets with $C=\partial U=\partial V$, then $m(U)+m(V)<1=\mu(S_{1})=\mu(U\cup V)\leq\mu(U)+\mu(V)$, so $m(U)<\mu(U)$ or $m(V)<\mu(V)$. $\bullet$ There are open sets $U$ where $\mu(U)<m(\overline{U})$. Let $S^{+}=\{e^{i\pi x}|x\in(0,\pi)\},S^{-}=\{e^{i\pi x}|x\in(-\pi,0)\}.$ Let $C\subseteq\overline{S}^{+}$ be a closed nowhere dense set with $1,-1\in C$ and $m(C)>1/4$. Let $R,S\subseteq\overline{S^{+}}$ be open subsets of $S^{1}$ where $\partial R=\partial S=C$. Let $U=R\cup\{-x|x\in S\}$ and let $V=S\cup\{-x|x\in R\}$. Then $\mu_{n}(U)=\mu_{n}(V)\leq\frac{n}{2}-1$. Therefore $\mu(U)=\mu(V)\leq\frac{1}{2}$. However, we have $m(\overline{U})\geq\mu(C\cup\{-x|x\in C\})=2\mu(C)>2\cdot\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $m(\overline{U})>\mu(U)$. $\bullet$ $\mu$ is not finitely additive. Suppose that $C$ is a fat cantor set with $m(C)>\frac{1}{2}$ (i.e. $C$ is a closed nowhere dense subset). Let $U=S^{1}\setminus C$ and suppose that $U=\bigcup\mathcal{U}$ where $\mathcal{U}$ is a collection of disjoint open intervals. Let $C^{\sharp}=C\setminus\bigcup_{O\in\mathcal{U}}\partial O$. Then $m(C^{\sharp})=m(C)>\frac{1}{2}$. Now we shall select open sets $(A_{n,i})_{n>0,1\leq i\leq \lceil n/2\rceil}$ by induction on $n$. Suppose that we have selected open sets $A_{m,i}$ for $m<n$. Now there is some $x\in S^{1}$ where $|\{k\in\{1,...,n\}|x \exp(\frac{2\pi i k}{n})\in C^{\sharp}\}|>\frac{n}{2}.$ Now let $A=\{x\cdot\exp(\frac{2\pi i k}{n}|x\cdot\exp(\frac{2\pi i k}{n}\in C^{\sharp}\}$. Then there is some open neighborhood $V$ of $1$ such that $A\cdot U\cap\bigcup_{m<n,i\leq \lceil m\rceil}A_{m,i}=\emptyset$. Furthermore $\{y\in V|A\cdot y\subseteq U\}$ is dense in $V$. Therefore select $y\in V$ so that $A\cdot y\subseteq U$ and where each element in $A\cdot y$ is contained in a distinct element in $\mathcal{U}$. This can be achieved simply by taking $y$ to be sufficiently close to zero. Now let $(A_{n,i})_{i\leq\lceil n/2\rceil}$ be disjoint open sets in $\mathcal{U}$ containing members of $A\cdot y$. Then let $A_{n}=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\lceil n/2\rceil}A_{n,i}$. Then the sets $(A_{n})_{n\geq 1}$ are pairwise disjoint open sets. Let $B_{n}=A_{n!}$ for all $n\geq 1$. Then if $L\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ is an infinite subset, then $\mu(\bigcup_{n\in L}B_{n})>\frac{1}{2}$. By replacing $\frac{1}{2}$ with $1-\epsilon$, one can show that for all $\epsilon>0$ one can construct open sets $(B_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that whenever $L\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ is an infinite subset, then $\mu(\bigcup_{n\in L}B_{n})>1-\epsilon$. In particular, for each $\epsilon>0$, there are infinitely many pairwise disjoint open subsets of $S^{1}$ each with measure greater than $1-\epsilon$. Therefore the finite additivity of $\mu$ fails fairly badly. $\bullet$ Finite additivity also fails in a much stronger sense. I claim that there are open sets $U,V$ with $\overline{U}\cap\overline{V}=\emptyset$ but where $\mu(U\cup V)<\mu(U)+\mu(V)$. Suppose that $T=\{e^{ix}|x\in[0,\pi/2]\}$. Then there are countably many pairwise disjoint open sets $A_{n}$ so that $A_{n}\subseteq T$ for all $n$ and where if $L\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ is an infinite subset, then $\mu(\bigcup_{n\in L}A_{n})>\frac{1}{5}$. Then let $L,M\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ be pairwise disjoint infinite subsets. Then let $U=\bigcup_{n\in L}A_{n}$ and let $V=-(\bigcup_{n\in M}A_{n})$. Then $U,V$ are open sets where $\mu(U)>\frac{1}{5}$ and $\mu(V)>\frac{1}{5}$, so $\mu(U)+\mu(V)>\frac{2}{5}$. However, for all $x\in S^{1}$, at most one of the elements $x,ix,-x,-ix$ is contained in $U\cup V$. Therefore, we have $\mu_{4}(U\cup V)=\frac{1}{4}$, so $\mu(U\cup V)\leq\frac{1}{4}<\frac{2}{5}<\mu(U)+\mu(V)$ $\textbf{Questions about the measure $\mu$}$ Is there a reference for this measure $\mu$? I would also be satisfied if someone can find a published version a similar measure on the real number line or the Cantor cube or a measure defined slightly differently. This notion appears to be related to the notion of the upper density of a subset of $\mathbb{N}$. Is there is an interesting equivalent way of defining the measure $\mu$? For instance, can we associate to each open set $U$ some set $F$ such that $\mu(U)=m(F)$. Does there exist a function $\mathbf{E}$ which maps open sets to subsets of $S^{1}$ such that $\mathbf{E}(U)\subseteq\mathbf{E}(V)$ whenever $U\subseteq V$ and where $\mu(U)=m^{*}(\mathbf{E}(U))$ ($m_{*}(\mathbf{E}(U))$ respectively) for all open sets $U$ where $m^{*}$ denotes the Lebesgue outer measure and $m_{*}$ denotes the Lebesgue inner measure respectively)? Does there still exist a function $\mathbf{E}$ if we require $(\overline{U})^{\circ})\subseteq\mathbf{E}(U)\subseteq\overline{U}$? What if we also require $\mathbf{E}$ to be rotational invariant? Let $\mu^{\sharp}(U)=\lim_{P}\sum_{O\in P}\mu(O\cap U)$ where $P$ denotes the collection of all partitions of the regular open sets of $S^{1}$ into finitely many open intervals and where the limit is taken of the net where the partitions of $S^{1}$ are ordered by refinement. I am also interested in these same questions for the measure $\mu^{\sharp}$ as well. For example, does there exist a function $\mathbf{E}$ which satisfies the same properties as mentioned in the above paragraph but where $\mu^{\sharp}(U)=\mathbf{E}(U)$? Furthermore, I am interested if there is a collection $Z$ of regular open subsets of $S^{1}$ such that if $O$ is a neighborhood of $1$ and $U,V$ are regular open sets, then $U\in Z$ iff $V\in Z$ and where if $\mathbf{E}_{Z}(U)=\{x\in X|Ux^{-1}\in Z\}$, then $\mu^{\sharp}(U)=m(\mathbf{E}_{Z}(U))$ (or where $\mu^{\sharp}(U)=m^{*}(\mathbf{E}_{Z}(U))$ or $\mu^{\sharp}(U)=m_{*}(\mathbf{E}_{Z}(U))$) for all open sets $U$. Can we replace the function $\mathbf{E}$ with a function that maps open sets to measurable functions from $S^{1}$ to $[0,1]$ so that $\mu^{\sharp}(U)=\int\mathbf{E}(U)(x)dm(x)$ for each open set $U$ and so that $\mathbf{E}$ satisfies the properties analogous to the ones mentioned in this and the last paragraph? My original motivation for studying this measure was to construct a counterexample in mathematical logic, but this counterexample is not quite the counterexample I want, but this seems like a very interesting kind of measure to study in its own right. 

Yes. I claim that such a maximal chain must always have cardinality $\frak{c}^{+}$. First of all, take notice that for each ultrafilter $U$, there are at most $\frak{c}$ many Rudin-Kiesler equivalence classes below $U$ simply because there are at most continuumly many functions $f:\omega\rightarrow\omega$ and every ultrafilter RK-below $U$ is of the form $\{R\subseteq\omega|f^{-1}[R]\in U\}$ for some function $f$. Now observe that for every collection $\mathcal{C}$ of at most continuumly many ultrafilters, by my answer here there is an ultraftiler $U$ with $V\leq_{RK}U$ for each $V\in\mathcal{C}$. Suppose now that $\mathcal{C}$ is a maximal chain in the collection of ultrafilters. Now, let $(U_{\alpha})_{\alpha<\lambda}$ be a strictly increasing cofinal sequence where $\lambda$ is some regular cardinal. Then since every collection of at most continuumly many ultrafilters on $\omega$ has a RK-upper bound, we conclude that $\lambda>\frak{c}$. On the other hand, since each $U_{\alpha}$ has at most continuumly many $RK$-smaller ultrafilters, we conclude that $\lambda=\frak{c}^{+}$. Since each $U_{\alpha}$ has at most continuumly many predecessors, we coonclude that $|\mathcal{C}|=\mathfrak{c}^{+}$ as well. 

Then there is some $c$ with $f(c)=g(c)$. $\mathbf{Proof}$ We shall construct a transfinite strictly increasing sequence $(x_{\alpha})_{\alpha}$ in $X$ such that $f(x_{\alpha})\leq g(x_{\alpha})$ until we obtain an $x_{\delta}$ with $f(x_{\delta})=g(x_{\delta})$. Let $x_{0}=0$. If $\gamma$ is a limit ordinal and $x_{\alpha}$ has been obtained for $\alpha<\gamma$, then let $x_{\gamma}=\bigvee_{\alpha<\gamma}x_{\alpha}$. Then since $f(x_{\alpha})\leq g(x_{\alpha})$ for all $\alpha<\gamma$, we have $f(x_{\gamma})=f(\bigvee_{\alpha<\gamma}x_{\alpha})=\bigvee_{\alpha<\gamma}f(x_{\alpha})\leq g(x_{\gamma})$. Now suppose that $x_{\alpha}$ has been constructed and $f(x_{\alpha})\leq g(x_{\alpha})$. If $f(x_{\alpha})=g(x_{\alpha})$, then we discontinue the transfinite process. If $f(x_{\alpha})<g(x_{\alpha})$, then there is some $x\in X$ with $x>x_{\alpha}$ and $f(x)\leq g(x_{\alpha})$. Therefore select some $x_{\alpha+1}\in X$ such that $x_{\alpha}<x_{\alpha+1}$ and $f(x_{\alpha+1})\leq g(x_{\alpha})$. Then we have $f(x_{\alpha+1})\leq g(x_{\alpha+1})$, and the transfinite process continues. This transfinite process however must terminate at some ordinal $x_{\delta}$, so we have $f(x_{\delta})=g(x_{\delta})$. $\mathbf{QED}$. Let's now use the above proposition to construct a universal map that is not left-factoring. Suppose that $T$ is a the tree which consists of all strictly increasing functions $f:\alpha\rightarrow[0,1]$ for some ordinal $\alpha$. Let $L:T\rightarrow[0,1]$ be the mapping where $L(f)=\sup\{f(\beta)|\beta\in\textrm{Dom}(f)\}$. Then $L$ is universal. However, the mapping $L$ is not left-factoring. In particular, there is no order preserving map $h:[0,1]\rightarrow T$ with $L\circ h=1_{[0,1]}$ where $1_{[0,1]}$ denotes the identity function on $[0,1]$. If $h$ were such a mapping with $L\circ h=1_{[0,1]}$, then whenever $r<s$, then $r=L(h(r))<L(h(s))=s$, so $h(r)<h(s)$, hence $\textrm{Dom}(h(r))<\textrm{Dom}(h(s))$. However, if $(x_{n})_{n}$ is an infinite descending sequence of real numbers in $[0,1]$, then $(\textrm{Dom}(h(x_{n})))_{n}$ would be an infinite descending sequence of ordinals, a contradiction. 

Let's call a collection of subsets of $X$ containing the empty set, $X$ and closed under finite intersection and countable union a $\sigma$-topology. The most prominent example of a $\sigma$-topology is the collection of all cozero sets in a topological space. A zero set in a topological space $X$ is a set of the form $f^{-1}[0]$ for some continuous $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, and the complement of a zero set is a cozero set. The collection of all cozero sets has a prominent position in general topology since the collection of cozero sets forms a basis for any completely regular space. As expected, notions such as the Stone-Cech compactification, and the Hewitt realcompactification can be defined in terms of ultrafilters on the lattice of zero sets. Furthermore, the notion of pseudocompactness can be characerized in terms of zero sets and cozero sets; a completely regular space is pseudocompact if and only if every countable cozero cover has a finite subcover. I can say a bit more about the importance of zero-sets but I will refer the reader to the old but still standard basic reference [2]. In the paper [1], the author defines a zero-set structure in a way that abstractly axiomatizes what is meant by a zero set. Of course, by taking complements, we can abstractly axiomatize what is meant by a cozero set as well. Working with zero-set structures instead of just $\sigma$-topologies is very much within the spirit of general topology since one usually considers spaces and other structures satisfying substantial separation axioms instead of simply topological spaces without any separation axioms. In other words, if one is at all concerned about $\sigma$-topologies and spaces that satisfy separation axioms (of at least complete regularity), then one should consider zero-set structures instead of simply $\sigma$-topologies. A zero-set structure is defined in [1] to be a collection $\mathcal{Z}$ of subsets of some set $X$ such that
