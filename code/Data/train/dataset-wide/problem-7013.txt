An oil price of 0 will make any extraction of oil unprofitable and hence imply no further oil extraction. You should think about how prices carry signals. A low oil price (even if not 0) carries the signal that we, as society, do not value that oil as much. The conclusion is imminent. 

Is there some summary article on using variation in US bequest taxation as natural experiments? Has there been variation over time or over different states? Is there perhaps a paper that already has used this? 

I assume this means they're making 0 profits, while strictly speaking it could mean that they make negative profits and leave the market. 

Yes, there is an income effect. It's unclear why books wouldn't mention that, perhaps it was not a complete treatment. Clearly, for individuals with zero assets, the income effect is zero, and goes to +- infinity as assets go to plus/minus infinity. Hence, @ChinG's presumption, that the substitution effect would always dominate, is not clearly true for me. That might be the case under some particular assumptions onto assets and preferences, but not in general. Unless books clearly express that there is no income effect [in which case you're free to update the question], I'd assume that it's just not a complete exposition. 

How did this abstraction work? A represents the copyrighted work, B contains all other consumption goods. I don't think there is strong empirical evidence for or against the claim. So then, what does the theory say? Neoclassical Theory The rational agent under a general class of preferences does first decide his optimal consumption level given (permanent) income, and then decides how to allocate that consumption expenditure between different goods. For him, the answer would be Yes. Caveats However, what happens if we depart from the rationality assumption? Many weird things can happen. For example, instead of optimally choosing how much to save, the consumer could first decide, what he wants to consume, and then save the remainder. In this case, since he already has A "for free" he might be contempt with that, think that "having some B" is sufficient, and then save the remainder. In that case, it may very well be that the answer is No (or at least, not necessarily). Not all the money not spend on copyrighted material will be used for consumption on other goods. There are many reasons to believe why the rationality assumption is not always giving us the full story, especially when you look at life-cycle consumption, saving rates and divergence of savings at retirement ages. 

Following is a question that did not receive attention at math.SE at all. I am aware that is would be better suited there, but given its Economic background, perhaps it will get more attention here. If not, I'm happy to call this a failed attempt and delete it. I need to solve $Ag=b$ for $b$, where $A$ is not symmetric. $$A g = b \\ A = \left(\begin{matrix} A_1 \\ E_{IJ} \otimes \mathbb 1 \end{matrix}\right)$$ For some positive integers $I, J$: $A$ has size $(IJ\cdot J)\times IJ$, $g$ has size $IJ \times 1$, and $b$ has size $IJ \times 1$. $A$ is vertically stacked $A_1, A_2$, where $A_1$ is $IJ\times IJ$. $\mathbb 1$ is $J\times 1$ vector of ones, and $E$ is the identity matrix. I need to solve this for $g$ on a computer for the case where $J$ small and $I$ large. I am fairly certain (through the way I get $A_1$ and $A_2$) that with $A_1$ being singular, my system of equations is exactly identifying $g$. I'm used to the case where $A$ is symmetric and invertible. How do I proceed here? 

I'm trying to derive the solution to a final producer with unit elasticity of substitution and a continuum of inputs (of measure $x$). She minimizes input costs, given an output of $q$. $$ \min_{\{y(i)\}_i, 0 \leq i \leq x} \int_0^x p(i)y(i) di + \lambda\left[ \log q - \log A + \int_0^x \log y(i) di \right] $$ Combining two FOCs over $y(i)$ and $y(j)$, the shadow price drops out: $$ y(i) = p(j) \frac{y(j)}{p(i)} $$ Multiply with $w(i)$ and integrate, to get total labor cost on the left-hand-side: $$\underbrace{\int_0^x p(i)y(i)}_{C(x)} = p(j) y(j) x$$ Taking logs: $$\log y(j) = \log(C(x)) - \log p(j) - \log x \tag 1$$ Plugging back into the production frontier: $$ \log q = \log A(x) + \log(C(x)) - \log x - \underbrace{\int_0^x \log p(i) di}_{\equiv P(x)}$$ where I denote the price index as $P(x)$. Plugging back (1): $$ \log q = \log A(x) + \log y(j) + \log p(j) - P(x)$$ or, $$ q = \frac{A(x)y(j)p(j)}{P(x)} \\ y(j) = \frac{P(x)}{p(j)}\frac{q}{A(x)} $$ So, demand for each variety increases in total output $q$, decreases in productivity, and increases in the relative costs of variety $j$ compared to the total price index $P(x)$. This all appears to make sense. However, Acemoglu gets for $x=1$, and $A(1) = 1$ $$ y(j) = \frac{q}{p(j)}$$ that is, the price index does not appear in his equation, which you can find in his slides, slide. What am I missing? 

What's the literature on Non-Constant elasticities of substitution? Say, I'm interested in the elasticity between $c_1$ and $c_2$ increasing/decreasing in income/wealth. CES utility functions with equal spending weights are similar to $$ \left(\sum_i c_i^\frac{\epsilon-1}{\epsilon}\right)^\frac{\epsilon}{1-\epsilon}$$ A simple way of getting non-constant elasticities would be to let $\epsilon = \epsilon(Y)$. Then the elasticity of substitution would vary with income: $$\frac{d \log \frac{c_i}{c_j}}{d \log \frac{p_j}{p_i}} = \epsilon(Y)$$ But I feel that this mixture of preference-parameters and outcome variables is suboptimal. Is there a common way of modeling these preferences? 

Maybe I'm familiar with a completely different background of mathematical finance, but I'll drop my two cents anyways. First, note that $$ \int d Wt $$ is a stochastic integral and not easily integrable with standard methods. I hope you are preset with a tool of stochastic calculus. The following method based on no-arbitrage was first introduced by Merton. 

Firms run positive operative profits, which exactly offset the entrance costs. That is, life time profits are zero. Why? Because we start in many models from the first-best and gradually remove particular assumptions. Romer could have talked in his model about a world in which patents have limited enforceability, or competitors particularly catch up, but the standard models we research ( and teach) typically do not incorporate this. Later on, Kortum (1997) and Aghion, Howard, Howit create research based growth models that allow for catching up of competitors. Profits are messy to model Profits mess up a lot of things. Think about the neo keynesian model, a standard example of where firms make profits (positive or negative) in every period, which do not necessarily cancel out over time. Allow for heterogeneity in households assets: some are poor, some are rich. Perfect representation of the owner in the decision making process of the firm requires that the stochastic discount factor (SDF) of the firm represents the SDF of the owner. But, in this model, who is the owner? Rich and poor agents share the firm, with different degree of ownership. To do this properly, we would need to add a stock market for the firm and allow agents to trade it; track the ownership of the firm and adjust the SDF. But no, you can't even look at the share of ownership: Say, $w$ denotes the wealth level, $m(w)$ denotes the measure of firm assets hold by agents with wealth $w$, and $\rho(w)$ denotes the discount rate of agents with wealth level $w$. Can you then just compute the firms SDF $\rho_F$ with $$\rho_F = \int \rho(w)m(w) dw$$? In reality, firm decisions are often voted over by simple majority. You'd need to model coalitions that get votes of $50%$ of asset holdings and see what SDF that gives you. Of course, this is much too complicated to do correctly. Even the intermediate step with an asset market is not trivial, people very often fall back to assuming the SDF of the richest agents, predicting their model's outcome. But it's not nice: We like to have internality consistent models, and profits make this difficult.
