On the one hand, I could not find a published answer with a cursory search. On the other hand, as Ben says, you could work out the answer "by hand". Instead of writing down a sheer list, which might be complicated (and I haven't done the work), I'll write down the main ingredients. A Zariski-closed subgroup $H$ of any connected semisimple Lie group $G$ has three pieces: (1) finite, (2) connected semisimple, and (3) connected solvable. The Zariski topology forces $H$ to have only finitely many components; if $H_0$ is the connected subgroup, then $H/H_0$ is the finite piece. Then the Lie algebra of $H_0$ has a Levi decomposition, so that you get the other two pieces. The way to analyze the question is to chase down the possibilities for all three pieces. I think that the finite part always lifts to a slightly larger finite subgroup of $H$. This is not true for groups in general, but I think that it is true in context. Then this finite group is contained in a maximal compact group of $G$. Happily, the compact core of $\text{Sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$ is $\text{SU}(2)$, and the finite subgroups are classified by simply laced Dynkin diagrams. A semisimple, connected subgroup of $G$ corresponds to a semisimple Lie subalgebra, and that complexifies. The Lie algebra $\text{sp}(4,\mathbb{C})$ does not have very many inequivalent semisimple subalgebras. From looking a rank, they are isomorphic to $\text{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ or $\text{sl}(2,\mathbb{C}) \oplus \text{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$. I am confusing myself a little with the possible positions of the former, although I know there are only a few. The latter embeds in only one way. Then you would work backwards to get the real forms of these complex subalgebras; again there wouldn't be very many. Finally the solvable part also complexifies and I think that it is contained in a Borel subalgebra at the Lie algebra level. As for the more general question, for $\text{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$, there is a tidy converse answer that also shows you that you can't expect a tidy answer for all fixed $n$. Namely, if $G$ is any algebraic group, you can classify its anti-self-dual (or symplectically self-dual) representations. Every algebraic group will have some, because every algebraic group has representations in $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$. A more interesting case is when $G$ has an irreducible symplectically self-dual representation. For that purpose, you check that the irreducible representation is real, and then check the Frobenius–Schur indicator. 

The three terms commute, whether or not $A$, $B$, and $C$ are symmetric. The eigenvalues are of the form $bc+ac+ab$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are eigenvalues of $A$, $B$, and $C$. You just tensor eigenvectors together and you get the answer. 

As Akhil says, yes. Another somewhat standard name for this axiom is the "Dedekind cut axiom". If you Google that with quotes, you will find some references. 

Also, it's tempting to mark the problem as open rather than as a "puzzle". I did find several papers that analyzed the congruence structure of integers with restricted digits, and one that looked at prime factors. Two are by Erdos, Mauduit, and Sarkozy 1 2, and two are by Banks and Shparlinski (one also with Conflitti) 3 4. Presumably some of these authors can say whether the problem should be called open. 

A simple construction that bears on the narrow version of John's question: If $M$ is a closed $n$-manifold that embeds in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ (which can only happen if $M$ is orientable), then $M \times S^k$ embeds in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1+k}$. Thicken $M$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, then cross with $I^k$ in the new dimensions, and then take the boundary of that. By induction, then, any product of spheres embeds in the next dimension. On the other hand, Ryan Budney in arXiv:0810.2346 has both new results and a bibliography of the broad question of which closed 3-manifolds embed in $\mathbb{R}^4$. It is problem 3.20 in Kirby's problem list, it is an interesting open problem, and there have been several partial results. 

If you just want a sufficient condition, then you can typically establish what you want by taking a finite group quotient of $F_n$. For example, $S_{n+1}$ is generated by $n$ adjacent transpositions (the Coxeter presentation), and these can all be conjugated onto the same transposition. Or indeed if they fail to form the edges of a tree on the $n+1$ symbols, then they do not generate $S_{n+1}$. Of course there are similar tricks with $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{Z}/p)$ or even $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{Z})$. If you want necessary and sufficient conditions, then I guess since free groups are LERF, the above sufficient condition actually is also necessary, but I have no feeling that it's the best algorithm. I would study the proof that free groups are LERF to see if that gives you a more direct algorithm to calculate the coset space of $F_n$ divided by a finitely generated subgroup. 

Without other assumptions, the answer is an easy no. For instance, if $N^3$ is a homology 3-sphere with infinite fundamental group, then $M^6 = N^3 \times S^3$ does not have very many lifts of automorphisms of its middle homology, because there exists a degree one map $S^3 \to S^3$ but no map $S^3 \to N^3$ with non-zero degree. There are also obstructions from other cup products besides the middle one, and from algebraic operations on cohomology other than cup products. So the question is much more reasonable if $M$ is simply connected (unless it is 2-dimensional) and has no homology other than the middle homology and at the ends. In this case, Tom Boardman says in the comment that Wall and Freedman showed that the answer is yes for homeomorphisms, although they surely assume that $M$ is simply connected. In higher dimensions, I don't know the answer to this restricted question, but I imagine that it could be yes using surgery theory. 

It's clear from the space and time hierarchy theorems in computational complexity, and more specifically non-deterministic time hierarchy theorems, that there are statements with extremely long proofs in any formal system that: (1) can describe Turing machines or cellular automata or similar; (2) can describe large numbers; and (3) has proofs that can be checked in a reasonable amount of time, such as polynomial time or even exponential time. The non-deterministic hierarchy theorem says that $\text{NTIME}(f(n)) \ne \text{NTIME}(g(n))$ if $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ are reasonably separated functions. A fairly precise version of this result is due to Cook, but if $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ are far enough apart, you can conclude that there is a separation just by comparison to deterministic time. The corollary then is that you can turn instances of such a slow computational problem into a claim which cannot have a short proof; if it did have a short proof, you could find it quickly to answer the computational question. For example, for each fixed $n$, you can take a question of the form, "can the following unit squares with teeth and notches added tile a square of size $A(n)$, the Ackermann function?" The answer is always provably yes or provably no, because it is a finite question. You can use a diagonalization argument in the sense of complexity theory to show that sometimes the proof has an Ackermann-like length. Actually Mike sent me his question by e-mail, but I didn't think of this answer then and suggested posting the question here. I don't know if this is the result sought, or merely a similar result. I also don't see a way to convincingly argue that asymptotic results are obsolete. It is true that because some computational problems are asymptotically slow, you can make a sequence of computational problems that are all asymptotically fast, but with a worse and worse constant factor. 

I gather from Ben's comment that this is a right answer to a wrong question. It is a good description of the representation variety of a cyclic quiver; there is nothing special about cycle length 2 in the analysis. But the $A_2$ quiver variety is something else. 

Wikipedia's description of the Casson invariant gives the first important reason to study it. As an invariant that comes from the $\text{SU}(2)$ representation variety of $\pi_1(M)$, it reveals in particular that $\pi_1(M)$ is non-zero. At the time, before Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture and geometrization, there was a lot of mystery about potential counterexamples to the Poincaré conjecture. For instance, one speculation was that the so-called $\mu$ invariant could reveal a counterexample. Since the Casson invariant lifts the $\mu$ invariant, and since it proves that $\pi_1(M)$ is non-trivial when it is non-zero, it is one way to see that the $\mu$ invariant can never certify a counterexample to the Poincaré conjecture. (Of course, no we know that there are no counterexamples.) A second fundamental reason to study the Casson invariant is that it is the only finite-type invariant of homology spheres of degree 1. Many interesting 3-manifold invariants are finite-type, or (conjecturally) carry the same information as a sequence of finite-type invariants. This is known more rigorously at the level of knots; for instance, the derivatives of the Alexander polynomial, the Jones polynomial, and many other polynomials at $1$ are all finite-type invariants. At the level of knots, the second derivative of the Alexander polynomial, $\Delta''_K(1)$, is known to be the only non-trivial finite-type invariant of degree 2, and there is nothing in degree 1. So it means that this invariant appears over and over again as part of the information of many other invariants; there are many different definitions of the same $\Delta''_K(1)$. The same thing should happen to the Casson invariant, and indeed there are already two very different-looking types of definitions: (1) Casson's definition; (2) either the first LMO invariant or the first configuration-space integral invariant. A third fundamental reason is that Casson invariant has an important categorification, Floer homology, which is the objects in the theory whose morphisms come from Donaldson theory. One wrinkle of this construction is that it is only a categorification of one of the definitions of Casson's invariant, Casson's definition. If Casson's invariant has many definitions, then it might (for all I know) have many different categorifications. If your question is meant in the narrow sense of what topology you can prove with the Casson invariant, then you can definitely prove some things but only (so far) a limited amount. However, if you are interested in quantum topological invariants in their own right, and not just as a tool for pre-quantum topology problems, then the Casson invariant is important because it is a highly non-trivial invariant that you encounter early and often. 

$L'$ has the same semismiple part $A$ as $L$. The solvable radical of $L'$ is decomposed as $B' \oplus N'$, where $N'$ is the nilpotent radical of $L'$, $B'$ is an abelian Lie algebra acting by semisimple derivations, and $[A, B'] = 0$. $A \oplus B'$ is a subalgebra and $L' = (A \oplus B') \ltimes N'$. 

First, the Gröbner basis is not sparse. I am speaking a little off-the-cuff, but empirically when I ask SAGE for the Gröbner basis of $(y^n-1,xy+x+1)$ in the ring $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$, it gets worse and worse as $n$ increases. Any bound would have to be in terms of the degrees of the original generators as well as their sparseness, and I suspect that the overall picture is bad. Overall your questions play to the weaknesses of Gröbner bases. You would need new ideas to make not just the computations of the bases, but also the actual answer numerically stable. You would also need new ideas to make Gröbner bases sparse. You are probably better off with three standard ideas from numerical analysis: Divide and conquer, chasing zeroes with an ODE, and Newton's method. If you have the generators for the variety in an explicit polynomial form, then you are actually much better off than many uses for these methods that involve messy transcendental functions. Because you can use standard analysis bounds, specifically bounding the norms of derivatives, to rigorously establish a scale to switch between divide-and-conquer and Newton's method, for instance. Moreover you can subdivide space adaptively; the derivative norms might let you stop much faster when you are far away from the variety. 

Both of Reid's suggestions sort-of work and lead to the same formula. However, it's easier to first change the question to a $q$-analogue of the difference $$D^{\pm}_n = D^+_n - D^-_n = (-1)^n(n-1).$$ (Also, the formula for $D_n(q)$ is missing a factor of $q^{n(n-1)/2}$.) You can find $D^{\pm}_n$ by the inclusion-exclusion formula just as you can find $D_n$. In fact, it's even easier since only the last two terms of inclusion-exclusion survive. This proof has a straightforward $q$-generalization, although the final formula isn't the same. But I don't know how likely the latter is in the $q$-linear algebra context. The determinant of a matrix seems like the reasonable $q$-analogue of the sign of a permutation, yet it is not a perfect analogue. Let $\chi$ be a complex character of the multiplicative group of $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $D^\chi(q)$ be the corresponding sum of $\chi(\det M)$, summed over deranged matrices $M$. Then the $q$-analogue is that $D^\chi(q) = (-1)^nq^{n(n-1)/2}$ for all non-constant $\chi$. The proof uses the Möbius function of the lattice of subspaces, just like for the ordinary enumeration of deranged matrices. This time only the last term of the Möbius inversion survives, the term for the identity matrix.
