A useful tool in Algebraic Geometry is the incidence correspondence. Loosely speaking, it is a set of the form $$\{(p,X): p \text{ a fixed dimension subscheme of } Y \text{ and } X \text{ a specific type of subscheme} \}.$$ For example one could consider the incidence correspondence of lines in $\mathbb{P}^2$ with a point on them, or cubics in $\mathbb{P}^3$ with a line on them. It is not too hard to see that in each of the previous cases, the resulting scheme is a variety by writing down explicit equations in coordinates. In the first case the variety lives in $\mathbb{P}^2\times \mathbb{P}^2$ and with a bit of work it is not too hard to show it is a projective bundle over $\mathbb{P}^2.$ The second case is a subvariety of $\mathbb{P}^{19}\times G(1,3)$. My question is the following. Is there a way to get both of the previous examples in a more natural way then explicitly writing down equations? Should I even expect there to be one? Generally when working with incidence correspondences one is interested in properties such as smoothness and irreducibility and most authors I have seen conclude these from the equations. Since the first case above does end up being a projective bundle, I would really hope for there to be a natural way to construct it. Thanks. 

Let $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ be a finite field extension and $E/\mathcal{O}_K$ be the local N\'eron model of a CM elliptic curve with CM by $\mathcal{O}_F$ and let $G\subseteq E[p^n]$ be a subgroup over $\mathcal{O}_K$ of order $p^n$ which we assume to be cyclic. We assume that $p$ is inert in $\mathcal{O}_F$ so that $E[p^\infty]$ is a $1$-dimensional $p$-divisible group of height $2$. Hence we can write $$G = \text{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_K[x]/g(x)).$$ Let $s:\mathcal{O}_K\to E$ be the identity section. One can compute from the explicit form of $G$ above that $$s^*\Omega^1_{G/\mathcal{O}_K} = \frac{\mathcal{O}_K}{\prod_{\lambda\in G\setminus \{0\}}\lambda}$$ thus $$\#s^*\Omega_{G/\mathcal{O}_K} = p^{f\sum_{\lambda\in G\setminus \{0\}}v_{\pi_K}(\lambda)}$$ where $f$ denotes the inertia degree of $p$ in $\mathcal{O}_K$. Since $G\subseteq E[p^n]$, it follows that we can compute $v_{\pi_K}(\lambda)$ from the Lubin-Tate group law on $E[p^\infty]$ since $\lambda$ must also be a zero of that. We use a Newton polygon for the group law $$[p](X) = pX + X^q$$ where $q = \mathrm{Nm}(\pi_F)=p^2$. Then after a bit of induction, the slopes give the valuation as: $$v_{\pi_K}(\lambda) = \frac{v_{\pi_K}(p)}{q^r - q^{r-1}}$$ for a $\lambda$ of exact order $p^r$. We let $\Phi(r)$ denote the number of elements of $G$ of exact $p$-order $r$. Then $$\sum_{\lambda\in G\setminus\{0\}}v_{\pi_K}(\lambda) = v_{\pi_K}(p)\sum_{r=1}^n\frac{\Phi(r)}{q^r-q^{r-1}} = v_{\pi_K}(p)\sum_{r=1}^n\frac{p^r-p^{r-1}}{p^{2r}-p^{2r-2}} = \frac{v_{\pi_K}(p)}{p+1}\sum_{r=1}^n\frac{1}{p^{r-1}}.$$ I want a geometric interpretation of this. In particular, if I choose a filtration $$0\subseteq G_1\subseteq\cdots\subseteq G_n = G$$ where each subquotient $G^{(r)}$ is a group of order $p$, then we should have $$\#\log s^*\Omega^1_{G^{(r)}/\mathcal{O}_K} = f\left(\frac{v_{\pi_K}(p)}{p+1}\right)\left(\frac{1}{p^{r-1}}\right)\log p.$$ Is there a way to obtain this without using the formal group law of $E[p^\infty]$? In particular, I am interested in understanding how and why the factor $p^{-(r-1)}$ arises, and whether there is a geometric way of seeing this. 

We've reduced the problem of checking proof validity to the following reference-checking problem: Given an array $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ of $\ell$-bit values and a list $(k_0, y_0), (k_1, y_1), \dots, (k_{m-1}, y_{m-1})$ where each $k_j$ has $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ bits and each $y_j$ has $\ell$ bits, check that $x_{k_j} = y_j$ for all $j < m$. I claim that this can be done with $\tilde {O} ((n + m) \ell)$ additional variables and constraints. First of all, we may append $(0, x_0), (1, x_1), \dots, (n-1, x_{n-1})$ to the list $((k_j, y_j))$. Therefore we may assume without loss of generality that $m \geq n$ and $(k_i, y_i) = (i, x_i)$ for $i < n$. Moreover, it is sufficient to check that $((k_i, y_i))$ is self-consistent: That if $k_i = k_j$ then $y_i = y_j$. This is checked by sorting $((k_i, y_i))$: Let $(\tilde {k}_0, \tilde {y}_0), \dots, (\tilde {k}_{m-1}, \tilde {y}_{m-1})$ be a permutation of $(k_0, y_0), \dots, (k_{m-1}, y_{m-1})$ with $\tilde {k}_0 \leq \tilde {k}_1 \leq \dots \leq \tilde {k}_{m-1}$ (this is checkable in $\tilde {O} (m \ell)$ variables and constraints). Then it suffices to check the that if $\tilde {k}_{i+1} = \tilde {k}_i$ then $\tilde {y}_{i+1} = \tilde {y}_i$. This requires $O (m (\ell + \log n))$ bits and constraints. 

Recently I have been trying to understand Deigne-Lustzig induction in the case of $G = \text{Sl}(2,\mathbb{F}_p).$ In this case the appropriate Deligne Lustzig variety is given by $X:xy^q-y^qx = 1,$ aka the Drinfeld curve. The action of $G$ on affine space fixes $X$ and in addition commutes with the action of the $q+1$ roots of unity, $\mu_{q+1},$ by scaling. In almost all expositions I have read on Deligne Lustzig induction, $\mu_{q+1}$ is noncanonically identified with a nonsplit torus of $G.$ However for the action of $T$ we choose does not seem to be the action of $G$ restricted to $T.$ My question is rather vague. If we are only interested in the action of $T$ after identifying it with the roots of unity, why is it important to mention it at all? Perhaps this generalizes in some way that explains this but it is not clear in the case of $ \text{Sl}(2,\mathbb{F}_p).$ Thanks. 

Here is a good set of notes by Nigel Boston. I find them very readable and fairly self contained. $URL$ 

I can't recommend the following document by Tom Weston enough. It introduces spectral sequences rapidly and at a comfortable level of generality. It then applies the Hochschild-Serre sequence to group cohomology. www.math.mcgill.ca/goren/SeminarOnCohomology/infres.pdf 

In general, the first digit of a number $A$ can be determined from the fractional part of $\log_{10} A$. Specifically, if $\log_{10} A = n + \gamma$ where $n = \lfloor \log_{10} A \rfloor$ and $\gamma = \{ \log_{10} A \}$ then $A = 10^\gamma 10^n$ and $1 \leq 10^\gamma < 10$. Therefore the first decimal digit of $A$ is $k$ iff $k \leq 10^\gamma < k+1$, or, equivalently, iff $\log_{10} k \leq \gamma < \log_{10} (k+1)$. Taking the special case where $A = G$ is Graham's number, we have $G = 3^{3^x}$ for some natural number $x$. Then $\log_{10} G = 3^x \log_{10} 3$. Observe that multiplication by $3^x$ is the same as shifting the base 3 digits of a number $x$ places to the left. Setting $\alpha = \log_{10} 3$ the problem reduces to finding the base 3 digits of $\alpha$ starting $x$ places after the decimal point. Then the following conjecture would imply that it is impossible to prove anything about the first digit of $G$ in time $o (x)$: Conjecture: Given a natural number $x$ and a sequence of base 3 digits $z_0, \dots, z_{k-1}$, any proof in ZFC of the statement "The first $k$ base 3 digits of $\alpha$ starting $x$ places after the decimal point are not $z_0 \dots z_{k-1}$" must have length $\Omega\:(n)$. Analogous conjectures can be asked for any other $b \geq 2$ and replacing $\alpha = \log_{10} 3$ with any other well-known irrational numbers. The reason to expect such a conjecture to hold is that I don't think there is any way to prove anything about $x$th digit of $\alpha$ that is essentially different from calculating the $x$th digit with a general-purpose algorithm, and I don't think there are any such sublinear general-purpose algorithms. Given that there does exist a quasilinear time algorithm for computing the digits of $\alpha$ (see Modern Computer Arithmetic for details), this conjecture would give a fairly sharp estimates $\tilde {\Theta}\:(\log \log G)$ steps for the shortest proof determining the first digit of $G$. Showing that there are no sublinear-time algorithms for computing the $x$th digits of any natural irrational number seems more difficult than the P vs. NP problem, which is already far beyond what current theoretic computer science can achieve, and the conjecture I stated above is probably more difficult still. However, if we ever get to the point where it is possible to give sharp lower bounds on the most efficient possible algorithms for most problems, then this problem would be potentially solvable. 

Let $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ be a finite field extension and $\mathcal{O}_K\subseteq K$ be its ring of integral elements. Let also $G/\mathcal{O}_K$ be a finite flat $p$-group scheme that is also an $\mathcal{O}_E$-module where $E/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a finite field extension and $\mathcal{O}_E\subseteq E$ is its ring of integral elements. Let $H \subseteq G$ be any subgroup scheme (it does not have to be $\mathcal{O}_E$-stable). Let $G' = G \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_E} \mathcal{O}_{E'}$ be the Serre tensor construction, where $E'/E$ is a totally ramified extension of degree $r$. Then it is true that $\text{lg}(\omega_{G}) = \frac{1}{r}\text{lg}(\omega_{G'})$, where $\omega_G = s^*\Omega^1_{G/\mathcal{O}_K}$ and $s:\text{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_K)\to G$ is the identity section. Let $H' \subseteq G'$ be a subgroup such that it pulls back to $H$ under the closed embedding $G \to G'$. Then it should be true that $\text{lg}(\omega_{H}) \ge \frac{1}{r}\text{lg}(\omega_{H'})$ for every such group $H'$. My question is when equality holds. When $H$ is an $\mathcal{O}_E$-module (i.e., $\mathcal{O}_E$-stable in $G$), then I can prove when $H'$ is the Serre tensor construction of $H$, which is a subgroup of $G'$, that we have an equality as we do with $G$ (same proof). When it is not $\mathcal{O}_E$-stable, I don't think I can "Serre tensor construct" $H$ to be a subgroup of $G$, but I can, for example, take the image of $H$ in $G'$ under the embedding $G \to G'$ which pulls back to $H$. This is an example of a strict inequality. 

Baker's theorem implies that $$ |\log (A/B)| = |\sum e_i \log p_i - \sum f_j \log q_j| > \max (e_i, f_j)^{-C} $$ where $C$ depends only on $\{p_i\}, \{q_j\}$. Since $A \leq \left( \prod p_i \right) ^{\max (e_i)}$ and $B \leq \left( \prod q_j \right) ^{\max (f_j)}$ it follows that $\max (e_i, f_j) \sim \log (\max (A, B))$. Assume for convenience that $A > B$. Then $$ A/B - 1 \geq \log (A/B) \gtrsim \log (A)^{-C} $$ It follows that $|A - B| \gtrsim \log (A)^{-C} A \gtrsim A^{1-\epsilon}$ for all $\epsilon > 0$. Picking $\epsilon < 1 - d$ we get $|A - B| > A^d$ for sufficiently large $A$. 

Improving on Brumleve's answer, I have a method for encoding a length-$n$ proof with a quasilinear $\tilde {O} (n)$-bit 3SAT instance. In most formal systems, proofs and objects that appear in proofs (propositions, formulas, etc.) have a tree-like structure in that each such object can be built from other such objects in an enumerated list of ways. For example the proposition $P \to Q$ is built out of the two propositions $P$ and $Q$, and a proof of $Q$ can be made with modus ponens out of a proof of $P \to Q$ and a proof of $P$. Such a proof-tree can be encoded with a pointer architecture, as some sequence $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ where each $x_i$ encodes a formula or a proposition or a proof of a proposition, possibly encoding including references to earlier objects $x_j$, $j < i$. For example, if $x_k$ encodes the proposition $P \to Q$, which I will denote with the notation $k \mapsto (P \to Q)$, then $x_k$ might have information of the form $(\to, i, j)$ where $i \mapsto P$ and $j \mapsto Q$. Similarly, denoting $k \vdash Q$ for $x_k$ encoding a proof of $Q$, a proof $k \vdash Q$ by modus ponens might be given in the form $(\mathtt {ModusPonens}, i_0, i_1, i_2, i_3, i_4)$ where $i_0 \mapsto P$, $i_1 \mapsto Q$, $i_2 \mapsto (P \to Q)$, $i_3 \vdash P \to Q$, and $i_4 \vdash P$. In addition, if $x_j$ includes references $i_0, \dots, i_{k-1}$ to earlier objects, define $y_j = (x_{i_0}, \dots, x_{i_{k-1}})$ as a description of all the objects referenced by $x_i$. To check if the objects $(x_0, \dots, x_{n-1})$ with the supplementary information $(y_0, \dots, y_{n-1})$ encodes a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, you must check the following conditions:
