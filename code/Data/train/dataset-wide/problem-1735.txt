It may be that someone will come along with a better answer, but the first example I can find for the use of "z" explicitly for redshift is is William de Sitter's 1934 paper. I'm tempted to think this is one of the earliest uses if not the first use, certainly looking at de Sitter's 1933 book where he touches on this briefly, he does not use the letter "z". However he did use "z" in a 1930 paper to represent the ratio between the radius of the Universe and initial radius, which in this context is actually the same quantity as 1 + z and so why he would've used "z" in his 1934 paper. If I had to hazard a guess, there is no particular reason for the choice of "z" for redshift, it was just a convenient letter to use for the variable. 

Mostly, but not exclusively, black hole-like solutions (I append the "-like" as a nod to the difficulties in mathematically defining BHs in a satisfactorily general way) are studied in the idealized settings of asymptotically flat spacetimes. An asymptotically flat spacetime has the property of being like flat Minkowski spacetime at a correctly chosen notion of infinity, and can be seen as idealized if for no other reason as all mainstream cosmological models are decided not asymptotically flat. However this setting is still a good way to make predictions about real black holes as we can approximate "very faraway" for "at infinity" and "almost flat" for "flat". In flat spacetime if we want to change our point of view we can perform a Lorentz boost on our coordinates which will not change the spacetime-physics but will change how we perceive certain properties such as the velocities of objects, lengths, times between events, etc. In asymptotically flat spacetime we can perform a Lorentz boost on our coordinates at infinity to achieve a similar effect without changing the spacetime-physics. For example we can perform a Lorentz boost at infinity and extend the new boosted coordinates to create new coordinates where the black hole is moving through space at some non-zero velocity. In our new coordinates some properties will be changed (e.g. the shape of the event horizon), whereas other properties will remain invariant. 

The big similarity between inflation and dark energy is that the preferred models for both can be described by scalar fields, however there is a huge difference between the energy scale, with the energy scale of inflation being 27 orders of magnitude bigger than the energy scale of dark energy! Could they be related? Possibly, but the difference between the energy scales is not easy to explain. There are a number of papers proposing a relationship, but nothing that has really gone beyond speculation. Any test of a connection between the two would depend on the model used. 

When we observe the CMBR we are observing the surface of last scattering, however the comoving points that make up the surface of last scattering (which infact will actually have a comparitvely very small, but non-zero thickness rather than being a 2D surface) change with time, which in theory should correspond to a change in the observed pattern (of anistropy) over time. On human time scales and given the limitations on our ability to observe the minute details of the CMBR, the observable effect on the pattern will be negligible. 

The black hole region of a spacetime is defined as a region where nothing can escape to infinity and an event horizon at a given time is the boundary of a connected region of space which is part of the black hole region. As you're after a simple answer I won't give a formal definition of a black hole or an event horizon, but they can be found in Wald. The problem though is to know whether anything in a region of space can escape to infinity depends on precise knowledge of the future, also not all spacetimes have a suitable notion of infinity. Yet clearly even when we don't know the entire history of the spacetime or when there isn't a suitable notion of infinity, we can still identify objects that are functionally equivalent to black holes. The apparent horizon if you like is the spatial boundary of what we might consider to functionally be a black hole. As nothing can escape a black hole, even light directed away from it is pulled back towards the singularity so we know that a black hole can cause even light directed outwards, relative to a point in space, to move inwards to that point. The apparent horizon is the boundary between where outwardly directed light moves outwards and where it moves inwards. In Schwarzschild spacetime, or more generally Kerr-Newman spacetime (in standard coordinates) the apparent horizon and the event horizon coincide. However, more generally, the location of the apparent horizon depends on how you 'slice' spacetime (it is observer-dependent if you like - unlike the event horizon). Apparent horizons needn't be associated with (formally-defined) black holes, however as long as the spacetime has certain properties, they will indeed be associated with black holes and will lie at or inside the event horizon. 

The basic assumptions of the cosmological principle mean that space can only have constant scalar curvature. This can be positive, negative or zero and a flat Universe is one where the curvature is zero. The curvature of space is something that can be measured and the current value is known to be close to zero, not just from BOOMERanG, but from subsequent observations. Vanilla FLRW cosmology has difficulty explaining this and it is known as the flatness problem. However the conventional view is that cosmic inflation does a very neat job in solving this problem. However a truly flat Universe must have a spatial curvature of exactly zero on a large scale, so to truly determine if the Universe is flat, even using a number of reasonable assumptions requires an exact measurement, which is impossible. So observation can never rule out the possibility that the Universe might have a very small positive or negative curvature. In addition, if you slightly relax the cosmological principle from its strictest interpretation, the scalar curvature does not completely determine the topology of the Universe, opening the door to so-called exotic topologies. For example a flat Universe could have a toroidal topology and be compact (of finite spatial volume). 

@RobJeffries has covered most points, but just to add a little. The lookback distance is directly proportional to the cosmological time elapsed since emission, whereas the cosmological red-shift depends on [basically] how much scale factor, which is a function of cosmological time, has changed since emission. If the Universe has been expanding for its history up to the present then the scale factor to present will be a strictly increasing function of cosmological time, so there will be a one-to-one correspondence between red-shift and lookback distance. NB this will not be true if, for example, the Universe was initially expanding but is currently contracting. However how the scale factor changes is governed by the stress-energy of the contents of the Universe so the relationship between red-shift and lookback distance will not generally be simple. 

It really comes down to what you define as accelerated expansion. Usually accelerated expansion is taken to mean that the first deriviative of the scale factor $a'(t)$ is increasing. However the Hubble parameter is given by: $$H \equiv \frac{a'(t)}{a(t)}$$ As in expanding Universe $a(t)$ is increasing, it is possible for $a'(t)$ to be increasing, but $H$ to be decreasing. I suppose it could be argued that an increasing $H$ (i.e. some kind of phantom energy scenario) is what we should truly reserve the term "accelerated expansion for. E.g. you could argue that a de Sitter Universe where $H$ is a constant, and therefore also any Universe where $H$ is decreasing, shouldn't be described as as "accelerated expansion", as there is effectively no difference between the expansion at some time $t$ and some later time. However we don't go with this definition. 

Yes it is to do with general relativity. For a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole the last stable orbit is at 3 times the Schwarzschild radius and hence the inner edge of the accretion disk. 

The particle horizon is the point where light arriving at us now would've had to have been emitted at the big bang (though note this is hypothetical as the Universe did not become transparent to light until it was several 100,000 years old).. How far away it is depend on the model you use (not to mention there are several different distance measures in cosmology), but it's proper distance is reckoned to be about 46.9 billion light years. A note of caution though, when calculating the particle horizon cosmic inflation is usually ignored. What is light arriving (again hypothetically) from usually called the particle horizon therefore would be actually light that was emitted from just the end of the inflationary epoch. If you were to take a model with a big bang singularity and inflation the "true particle horizon" would in fact be much further away. 

Expansion means that distances are increasing as a function of time. Say if the distance between two galactic clusters is $D$, then in an expanding Universe the distance is governed by some strictly increasing function of time $a(t)$ called the scale factor where $$D=a(t)D_0$$ where $D_0$ is the distance at the present time and by definition $a(t_{0})=1$. Cosmology assumes that the Universe is on large scales the same everywhere (homogeneous) and the same in all directions (isotropic) so the above applies to all distances above a certain scale. The scale factor $a(t)$ can be found from the Friedmann equations and initial conditions. Expansion is possible in Universes of both finite and infinite spatial extent. As the volume of a (large enough) region of space increases in proportion to $[a(t)]^3$, but the amount of matter remains constant, the matter density changes in proportion to $[a(t)]]^{-3}$. Expansion however also decreases the kinetic energy of of its contents, so the energy density decreases by a greater factor if the contents has kinetic energy. 

If I remember Stephen Hawking alludes to some sort of "quickening of time" near the big bang in his book A Brief History of Time (though I read it 20 years ago, so don't hold me to the exact details). He makes an argument that if time is measured by the number of collisions in a given volume then the number of collisions should go to infinity as you approach the big bang, thus meaning the big bang was infinitely far in the past. Note this isn't really time dilation (though maybe it could be reframed as such) which the comparison of time like coordinates between different spacetime coordinate systems that are set up to represent different observers' points of view. In fact I was thinking about this the other day and I think this argument doesn't hold water. It is more sensible to talk about the number collisions in a given comoving volume and use the conformal time as the coordinates, because the number of collisions in a unit comoving volume per unit conformal time should be constant throughout the life of the Universe. As @Stan Liou alludes to though, in the models of the Universe best thought to represent our reality the big bang happens at some finite past value of conformal time. 

A Universe with (hyper)spherical spatial geometry is realistic, though we don't see any evidence for it but it can't be ruled out either. As a point of interest, hyperspherical geometry doesn't necessarily mean hyperspherical topology, though it does mean the Universe must be compact i.e. of finite volume. Now to address more thoroughly though whether it is possible to circumnavigate a spherical (in both geometric and topological senses) Universe: Nothing can travel faster than light, so in order to find out if it is possible to circumnavigate the Universe we need to know if light travelling radially outward from some point in space will arrive at the same point in space at some later time. If $R(t_1)$ is the radius of curvature of the Universe at time $t_1$, then to circumnavigate the Universe by that time, the light must have traveled at least a proper distance of $2\pi R(t_1)$ from its starting point. Or in other words the radius of the observable Universe must be at least $2\pi R(t_1)$ by time $t_1$ in order for anything to circumnavigate the Universe. The radius of the observable Universe is given by: $r_{obs}(t_1) = R(t_1) {\LARGE{\int}}^{t_1}_{ t_ {int}} \frac{cdt}{R(t)}$ Where $t_{int}$ is when the Universe begin (e.g. the big bang) Therefore the condition for it to be possible to circumnavigate a spherical Universe in a rocket ship is: ${\LARGE{\int}}^{t_{fin}}_{ t_ {int}} \frac{cdt}{R(t)} > 2\pi$ Where $t_{fin}$ is the time when the Universe ends (note in a Universe without beginning $t_{int} = -\infty$ and in a Universe without end $t_{fin} = \infty$). For simple models with spherical spatial geometry the value of this integral is easy to calculate: $\begin{array} {|l|l|} \hline \mathbf{MODEL}&\mathbf{VALUE}\\ \hline \mbox{Matter-dominated closed R-W}&2\pi \\ \hline \mbox{Radiation-dominated closed R-W}&\pi \\ \hline \mbox{De Sitter closed-slicing}&\pi\\ \hline \mbox{Einstein static}&\infty\\ \hline \mbox{Eddington-Lemaitre}&\infty\\ \hline \end{array}$ This means that in the case of a Robertson-Walker closed Universe light can just circumnavigate the Universe once from the big bang to the big crunch as long as the pressure is zero. In the de Sitter closed slicing it can only make it half-way around the circumference, even though there is no big bang or big crunch. In the Einstein static Universe you can go round as many times as you like as you have an infinite amount of time to travel the circumference of fixed length. In the Eddington-Lemaitre model the expansion in early times is so slow you can circumnavigate the Universe as many times as you like.
