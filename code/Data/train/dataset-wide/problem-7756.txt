I don't know of a reference off hand, but I don't see any harm in just claiming that the assertion easily follows from the Jordan decomposition of $T$. After all, if you know that the limit on the left hand side exists you just write $T = D + N$ for some diagonalizable over $\mathbf{F}$ endomorphism $D$, and some nilpotent endomorphism $N$ where $D$ and $N$ commute, and observe that for large $n$, $$||T^{p^n}||^{p^{-n}} = ||D^{p^n}||^{p^{-n}} = ||D|| = \max_{\lambda \in Sp(T)}|\lambda|.$$ You can also show in this way that the limit exists by being a bit more careful. 

No; it is not abelian in general. Let $R$ be a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal generated by an element $\pi$, let $k := R / \pi R$ be the residue field of $R$ and let $\mathcal{O}$ be the inverse image in $M_2(R)$ of the scalar matrices in $M_2(k)$. Note that $\mathcal{O}$ is free of rank $4$ as an $R$-module, with basis $\{e_{11} + e_{22}, \pi e_{11}, \pi e_{12}, \pi e_{21}\}$ say. So $\mathcal{O}$ is, in particular, finitely generated and projective as an $R$-module. For every $g \in GL_2(R)$, you have the invertible fractional ideal $\mathcal{O}g$. Note that $\mathcal{O}g \cdot \mathcal{O} h = \mathcal{O} gh$ since $GL_2(R)$ normalises $\mathcal{O}$ inside $M_2(R)$. Note also that $\mathcal{O} g = \mathcal{O} h$ if and only if $gh^{-1} \in \mathcal{O}^\times$, which is the preimage in $GL_2(R)$ of the group of scalar matrices in $GL_2(k)$. So we obtain an injective group homomorphism from $PGL_2(k) \cong GL_2(R) / \mathcal{O}^\times$ into the group $I(\mathcal{O})$ of invertible fractional ideals of $\mathcal{O}$. In the positive direction, if $K$ is the field of fractions of a Dedekind domain $R$ and if $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal order in some finite dimensional separable $K$-algebra, then $I(\mathcal{O})$ is abelian. See Theorem 12 and Theorem 13(c) of this paper by Frőhlich, which gives a thorough discussion of the Picard group of a noncommutative ring. 

Given a(n $\infty$-)category, there is a process called "stabilitazion" which spits out a stable $\infty$-category (as one can read about in either Higher Algebra or the nlab). The famous example is Spectra, which is the stabilization of Top (and I guess the various enhancements of derived categories, out of categories of modules). If I start instead with the plain old category of pointed sets, what is its stabilization? And if I start with finite pointed sets? 

Is there a structure theorem for such varieties? If X is a smooth and proper/projective variety whose canonical bundle $\omega_X$ has finite order in the Picard group, do we know anything about X? EDIT: As was pointed out in the comments, if $\omega_X^n = O_X$ then one can find a cycling covering of order n, $Y \to X$, with $\omega_Y = O_Y$. So the problem reduces to understanding varieties with trivial canonical bundle. I'll leave the question as is for a few days more, in case someone else wants to contribute. If nothing happens I will delete it. 

presumably the reason there is an equality in 3.25 instead of an isomorphism is that you don't want $V_K$ to be abstractly isomorphic to $W$, but you want them to be equivalent subschemes of $X_K$ (ie isomorphic in the category of pairs (scheme, embedding)). At least that's how I would interpret it, but I might be wrong. Also, take $X = P^N$. Saying that $W \subset X_K$ is defined over $k$ means precisely that you can find equations cutting out $X_K$ with coefficients in at most $k$. 

I vaguely recall reading a long time ago a 50-or-so page paper, either by John Baez or linked from his page (I think the former), which among other things gave a justification for his table of n-categories and a very cute explanation of the realization that really it should start at n=-2. I believe this paper also introduced (to me) the ideas of properties, structure, and stuff. I was just thinking about how I'd love to look back at this, but among the wealth of resources available on Baez's webpage I can't seem to find what I'm looking for. Googling hasn't turned it up either. Does anyone know what paper I'm talking about? And if it doesn't talk about properties, structure, and stuff, can anyone recommend a friendly and polished exposition of these ideas? 

In motivic homotopy theory, the category of motivic spectra comes with a set of "bigraded spheres", $S^{i,j} = \Sigma^i (\mathbb{G}_m)^{\wedge j}$. It is well-known that homotopy classes of maps out of these don't detect equivalences. This gives rise to a notion of "cellular" motivic spectra (as studied by Dugger--Isaksen): these sit as a right localization -- that is, a full subcategory whose inclusion admits a right adjoint -- which is by definition the largest subcategory in which bigraded homotopy groups do detect equivalences. Back in equivariant homotopy theory, the analogous "tautological Picard elements" are the virtual representation spheres $S^V$, i.e. $V$ is a formal difference of finite-dimensional $G$-representations. These corepresent what are therefore known as "$RO(G)$-graded homotopy groups". 

Maybe Asher Auel's thesis? But maybe it's still schemes, not sure! (but that thesis is still awesome) $URL$ 

I hope this is well known, I just could not work it out myself. Say I have a variety X (smooth and projective over C is my usual setup) with a smooth subvariety Z. Let f: BL_Z(X) --> X be the blowup of X with centre Z and let E be the exceptional. 

The question might be a bit vague. Certainly there are excellent references online on stability conditions. The first which comes to mind is the most elementary and is by Arend Bayer. If you are already familiar with all of that, these notes by Daniel Huybrechts go deeper into the subject. These are notes from a lecture series delivered in Cambridge, which was recorded on video. Also, I find the original paper by Bridgeland quite readable. 

I don't know of a uniform way to prove it for all curves. For elliptic curves it follows from Hodge theory and for the rest it's a consequence of the Bondal-Orlov theorem. It's all explained in Huybrechts's excellent book on Fourier-Mukai transforms. 

If I understand the setup of the question correctly, the answer is yes. Using non separated schemes makes no difference. This is explained here. In brief, whether you do the Grothendieck ring of "integral, finite type, separated" or "finite type" or even "finite type algebraic spaces" it's the same. When you pass to stacks it's a whole other mess of course. 

Take $R = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{F}_q$ for distinct primes $p,q$ and $\mathfrak{m} = qR$. Then $\hat{R} \cong 0 \times \mathbb{F}_q$ is isomorphic to an ideal in $R$, so $Hom_R(\hat{R}, R) \neq 0$. This $R$ isn't complete with respect to $\mathfrak{m}$ since $R \neq \hat{R}$. 

The following paper of Tim Hodges may be of interest: $K$-theory of $\mathcal{D}$-modules and primitive factors of enveloping algebras of semisimple Lie algebras. Bull. Sci. Math. (2) 113 (1989), no. 1, 85–88. He proves that the Quillen $K$-groups of the abelian category of coherent $\mathcal{D}_X$-modules on any smooth complex quasiprojective variety $X$ (such as a flag variety) are the same as the corresponding $K$-groups of $X$ (or equivalently the category of coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules.) The proof proceeds via a reduction to the case when $X$ is affine, and then by considering the associated graded of $\mathcal{D}(X)$. It follows from this that if $X = G/B$ is a flag variety then $K_0(\mathcal{D}_X)$ is a free abelian group of rank $|W|$, where $W$ is the Weyl group of $G$. It should be possible to construct an explicit set of $|W|$ pairwise non-isomorphic indecomposable projective coherent $\mathcal{D}_X$-modules using Schubert cells. 

The answer is yes. Let's say that a domain $R$ has the intersection property if every non-zero two-sided ideal $I$ of $R$ has non-zero intersection with the centre of $R$. The result follows from the Theorem and Lemma below. 

Your functor $BX \to \mathrm{Top}$ factors through the inclusion of the full subcategory of $\mathrm{Top}$ generated by the single object $Y$, which is just the data of $\mathrm{End}(Y)$ (an $E_1$-algebra) -- you might call this subcategory $B(\mathrm{End}(Y))$. By adjunction, the multiplication on $Y$ gives a map $Y \to \mathrm{End}(Y)$, and your map (of one-point categories, which is equivalent to a map of $E_1$-algebras) is just the composite $X \to Y \to \mathrm{End}(Y)$. 

First of all, I'm confused by the first sentence. Shouldn't it just say $u$ is a cochain, not a cocycle? Probably more importantly, I don't really see what's supposed to be going on in part (i), since those two addends aren't in the same cohomological dimensions. I'm getting that $\delta (u\cup_0 u+u\cup_1 u) = 4(a\cup u)+2(a\cup_1 u+u\cup_1 a)$, and I'm not sure how to cancel the last terms. The addends in the RHS came straight from the addends on the LHS, i.e. there's no interaction between the two terms as far as I can tell, which makes me doubt myself. This could be just a lot of silliness on my part, but I'd appreciate it if someone could clear this up for me. And of course I'd love to hear about fun or unexpected applications of this particular operation... EDIT Following Tyler's suggestion, I've found that changing the formula to $u\cup_0 u+u\cup_1 \delta u$ does wonders. Now that I've reached it, I'm having difficulty with part (iv). I have that $P_2(u+v)=P_2(u)+P_2(v)+u\cup_0 v+v\cup_0 u+u\cup_1 \delta v+v\cup_1 \delta u$. So somehow those last four terms are supposed to collapse into $u\cup v$ as computed using the non-trivial pairing. How exactly should this work? I have a vague sense that a representing cochain should only be spitting out the values 0(mod 4) and 2(mod 4), the latter only when the cup guys both spat out 1(mod 2)'s. So I'm slightly inclined to believe that the first two loose terms, which are equal since $\deg(u)=\deg(v)=2p$ and $\cup_0=\cup$ (the usual cup product), might sum to the desired "$u\cup v$" thing. Assuming we represent $u$ and $v$ by the same cochains throughout the equation, which I'm pretty sure is a valid thing to do(???), then if they evaluate to an even number then that sum will be 0(mod 4) while if they evaluate to an odd number then that sum will be 2(mod 4). So I'm thinking that somehow those last two terms should vanish. But why? And is there a concise way of writing everything I've just said, e.g. using notation $\rho:Z_2\otimes Z_2\rightarrow Z_4$ for the pairing, etc.? And probably more importantly, is there any significance to the fact that the cup product measures the failure of the Pontrjagin square to be a group homomorphism? 

Where $H^i_\bullet$ is the cohomology with respect to the t-structure $\bullet$. The point of the spectral sequence is that you can filter E in two ways, according to A or to B and then A. 

The following is apparently a theorem of Serre (which can be found in his FAC paper, although I haven't spotted it $URL$ Let's say that a graded module is torsion if it's zero for all degrees high enough. Let R be a commutative graded ring generated in dimension one. Denote Gr the category of graded R-modules and Tors the subcategory of torsion modules (which is a Serre subcategory). Then the quotient category Gr/Tors is equivalent (through the ~ construction) to the category of quasi-coherent modules on Proj R. I believe that when R is noetherian then this equivalence restricts to one between finitely generated graded modules and coherent modules. (presumably there is also a relative version of this -- but I am quite allergic to Proj so I'm not going to go any further on this) 

X and Y are proper and irreducible. As a double cover does not crush X to a point, it must be surjective. The fibres are then finite sets which implies that it is a finite morphism. Finite morphisms are affine. Affine morphisms do not have higher direct image (this is just the relative version of the theorem which says that affine schemes do not have higher cohomology with coefficients in quasi-coherent sheaves). 

Another way of seeing this is to compare two consecutive square numbers, say n2 and (n+1)2. If we expand the larger one, we get (n+1)2=n2+2n+1, so it is exactly (2n+1) more than the previous square. As n increases, this expression represents the consecutive odd numbers. So squares always differ by consecutive odd numbers. 

Let $k$ be a base commutative ring, and let $A$ be a (unital but not necessarily commutative) $k$-algebra. The cone on $A$ is the ring $CA$ of infinite matrices $(a_{ij})_{i,j \geq 1}$ that are finitely supported in each row and column. Then, the suspension of $A$ is $CA/\mathcal{M}_\infty(A)$, the quotient by the ideal $\mathrm{colim}_n \mathcal{M}_n(A)$ of finitely-supported matrices. Here are some facts (lifted from section 1.4 of Loday's Cyclic Homology). 

I'm trying to understand the following theorem, but I don't think I'm reading it correctly. Let $(\mathcal{C},J)$ be a site (with a subcanonical topology). Write $\mathcal{C}/X$ for the groupoid of objects over $X\in \mathcal{C}$. Let $\mbox{Sh}:\mathcal{C}^{op} \rightarrow \mbox{Gpds}$ be the functor taking $X$ to the category of sheaves on $\mathcal{C}/X$ and isomorphisms of sheaves, and let $\mbox{Sh-map}:\mathcal{C}^{op} \rightarrow \mbox{Gpds}$ be the functor taking $X$ to the category whose objects are sheaf morphisms $\mathscr{F} \rightarrow \mathscr{G}$ and whose morphisms are commuting squares of sheaves determined by isomorphisms $\mathscr{F}_1 \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow} \mathscr{F}_2$ and $\mathscr{G}_1 \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow} \mathscr{G}_2$. These are in fact both stacks on $\mathcal{C}$, and moreover they determine a category-object $(\mbox{Sh},\mbox{Sh-map})$ in the category of stacks. 

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the two-dimensional Lie algebra over a field $k$ with basis $\{x,y\}$ and relation $[x,y] = y$. Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the ideal of $\mathcal{A}$ spanned by $y$. Let $D' : \mathcal{A} / \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{A}/\mathcal{I}$ be the $k$-linear map that sends the image $\overline{x}$ of $x$ in $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{I}$ to $\overline{x}$. Since $\mathcal{A} / \mathcal{I}$ is abelian, this is a derivation. Now if $D$ is a derivation of $\mathcal{A}$ that lifts $D'$, then $D(x) = x + ay$ for some $a \in k$, and $D(y) = b y$ for some $b \in k$ because $D(y) = D([x,y]) = [x,D(y)] + [D(x),y]$ is a sum of commutators in $\mathcal{A}$, and as such must be an element of $\mathcal{I}$. Now $$by = D(y) = D([x,y]) = [x,D(y)] + [D(x),y] = [x, by] + [x + ay,y] = (b + 1)y$$ forces $y = 0$, a contradiction. So $D$ does not exist. There is probably also a counterexample if $\mathcal{A}$ is only assumed to be a commutative algebra. In the positive direction, if $\mathcal{A}$ is a commutative $k$-algebra such that the Kahler differentials $\Omega_{\mathcal{A}/k}$ is a free $\mathcal{A}$-module (for example, if $\mathcal{A}$ is a polynomial algebra in finitely many variables over $k$), then you can always lift $D'$. 

Recall that Hochschild homology can be defined as $HH_*(A) = \pi_*|N^{cyc}(A)|$, the geometric realization of the cyclic nerve. Thus, I would expect that fact 1 is actually a consequence of an equivalence $|N^{cyc}(A)| \simeq \Omega | N^{cyc}(SA)|$. Is this true? More generally, is there a sense in which I can read "$\mathrm{Spec}(SA) \to \mathrm{Spec}(CA) \to \mathrm{Spec}(A)$" as a (co?)fiber sequence with contractible middle term, at least "to the eyes of Hochschild homology"? The second and third facts, however, I find yet more mysterious: they seem to assert that taking an "algebro-geometric sphere" (read: $\mathbb{G}_m$) over $A$ witnesses this delooping at the level of Hochschild homology. I have no idea why this should be true, but would love to have some intuitive (algebro-)geometric explanation. 

An $\infty$-categorical version of this statement is now proved as Theorem 3.8 here: $URL$ The fact that this restricts to relative 1-categories as expected follows from Remark 3.2, and the fact that this applies in particular to marked quasicategories (which can be thought of as "presentations" of relative $\infty$-categories) follows from Remark 3.3. 

I would of course be interested to hear partial answers, e.g. if this is only known when $G$ is finite/discrete but is open for $G$ a (compact) Lie group -- similarly if this depends on what $G$-universe I'm working over (though the answer is pretty obviously "no" e.g. for the trivial universe). Moreover, if the answer to the above is "no", then I have a follow-up question.
