It is well known that for a given polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ the number of primes $p$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$ is infinite. In fact, one can even write down a formula for the density of such primes (e.g. D. Berend, Y. Bilu "Polynomials with roots modulo every integer"). Now suppose that $f = \sum_{i=0}^d a_ix^i$ is irreducible, the degree $d$ is fixed and all $a_i \leq N^C$ for some constant $C$. Is it possible to prove the uniform bound (e.g. whith the constant depending only on $d$ and $C$ and $N$ large) $$ \pi(N, f) = \Omega_{d, C}(\frac{N}{\log N}), $$ where $\pi(N, f)$ means the number of primes less than $N$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$? The aforementioned paper cites a general density formula due to Lagarias and Odlyzko which seem to provide such a bound assuming GRH. It's of course highly desirable to drop this assumption. 

Let $a_1, ..., a_d$ be positive reals and consider the linear Diophantine equation $$ \sum_i a_in_i = 0. $$ I am interested in estimating the number of integer solutions of this equation inside a box $[-N_1, N_1] \times ... \times [-N_d, N_d]$ and also the minimal basis for the corresponding integer lattice in terms of $a_1,...,a_d$. More specifically, it seems that if the number of solutions is of order $N^{d-1}$ then $(a_1, ...., a_d)$ should be proportional to some integer vector of bounded norm. Presumably, smth much more precise is known. I believe that such kind of questions are well studied so any good reading on this topic would be highly appreciated. 

A nice Lemma due to Konyagin asserts that for any subset $B \subset \mathbb{F}_p$ holds $$ |B.B - B.B + B.B - B.B + B.B - B.B| \geq \frac{1}{2}\min\{p, |B|^2 \}, $$ where the standard notation for the product set $B.B$ is used. Now suppose that instead of $B.B$ we have a partial productset $B\stackrel{G}{.}B$ along the edges of a graph $G$ of edge density $\epsilon$ (meaning that $b_1b_2 \in B\stackrel{G}{.}B$ if only if $b_1, b_2 \in B$ are adjacent in $G$). Is it true that if $B < \sqrt{p}$ a similar estimate $$ |B\stackrel{G}{.}B + B\stackrel{G}{.}B + B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B| \gg_{\epsilon} |B|^2 $$ holds? UPD Sorry for sloppy notation. So what it means. $B.B = \{b_ib_j |b_i, b_j \in B \}$, $B.B-B.B = \{b_ib_j - b_kb_l |b_i, b_j, b_k, b_k \in B\}$, and $B.B+B.B$ etc. being defined the same way. 

Let $X$ be a smooth closed subvariety in a complex projective space and $Z\subset X$ be a generic hyperplane section. Lefschetz hyperplane section Theorem says that the restriction map $H^i(X)\to H^i(Z)$ is an isomorphism for $i<dim(Z)$ and injective for $i=dim(Z)$. I am interested in examples when it's also an isomorphism $i=dim(Z)$. This is equivalent to saying that Fourier-Deligne transform of the intersection cohomology sheaf of the cone over $X$ has less than full support in the dual space (then this support has to be the cone over the projectively dual variety $X^*$). This is so when $X$ is an even dimensional quadric; are there other examples? 

Does Hochschild cohomology of a cocommutative Hopf algebra over a field of positive characteristic have a natural divided power structure? If not, perhaps a certain natural extra structure on the Hopf algebra would yield one? 

It's a toric variety, for which intersection cohomology is computed algorithmically, see e.g. De Catldo's lectures. 

Let $X$ be a complete smooth curve over $\mathbb C$ and $A=Jac[2]$ be the group of 2-torsion elements in the Jacobian of $X$. Is their a relation between: 1) The $A$-torsor of $\theta$-characteristics and its decomposition into odd and even parts. 2) The projective action of $A$ on sections of ${\mathcal O}_{Jac}(2\Theta)$, where $\Theta$ is the $\Theta$-divisor, lifting to a Heisenberg group action. 

Is there a theorem (or theorems) that can be thought of a real analogue of Weil conjectures? One can replace the finite field by real numbers and Frobenius by complex conjugation; counting points can perhaps be replaced by Euler characteristic or a more refined invariant of the set of real points. Of course, Lefschetz fixed point formula can be applied here, but is there something more specific one can say? 

The paper by Kazhdan and Lusztig "A topological approach to Springer representation" may provide an answer to the question at the end of the post on an explicit form of Springer representation. Also, I think this question is related to Lusztig's homomorphism from the Hecke algebra $H$ to the asymptotic Hecke algebra $J$. To simplify the statement, assume $G=SL(n)$ (as the author of the question does). Then the matrix of the Springer representation in the canonical basis in the top homology of Springer fiber can be read off that homomorphism (specialized at $q=1$): the algebra $J$ in this case is a sum of matrix algebras, taking the summand corresponding to the given nilpotent we get the answer. The homomorphism is rather explicit, so this answer is as explicit as the canonical basis is. 

So I believe I have a solution to my question. It seems to be true for regular CW-complexes. I've changed my notation slightly as I've been working on the problem. Let me know if my answer could be improved in any way. Theorem: Let $X$ be a regular CW-complex and $L\in X$ a collection of open faces, then $X\setminus L \sim P(X\setminus L)$. This will follow from a sequence of definitions and lemmas. Definition: Let $\Delta^n$ be an n-simplex and $\Delta^{n-1}$ a facet. Then $A_n = \Delta^n\setminus \Delta^{n-1}$ is a pavilion of $\Delta^n$ with $dim(A_n)=n$. Continuing inductively we can write $\Delta^n = A_n\cup A_{n-1}\cup\ldots\cup A_0$ with $A_i$ a pavilion (of $\Delta^n$) and $dim(A_i)=i$. Call this a pavilion decomposition of $\Delta^n$. Note: For $A_k$ a pavilion, $A_k$ contains exactly one vertex. So if $A_n\cup A_{n-1}\cup\ldots\cup A_0$ is a pavilion decomposition of $\Delta^n$, then each $A_i$ contains exactly one vertex of $\Delta^n$. We can then specify a pavilion decomposition with a bijection $f:vert(\Delta^n)\to [n]\cup\lbrace 0\rbrace$ where for $a\in A_i$, $f(a) = dim(A_i)$. Lemma: Let $A_n\cup A_{n-1}\cup\ldots\cup A_0$ be a pavilion decomposition of $\Delta^n$ and let $I\subseteq [n]\cup\lbrace 0\rbrace$, then $\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i$ is convex. Proof: We induct on $|I|$. Note that a pavilion is contractible. For the inductive step, note that the line between a point in a pavilion $A$ and any point in $cl(A)\setminus A$ lies entirely inside $A$ except for the one endpoint.$\square$ Definition: Let $X$ be a simplicial complex and $\chi = sd(X)$ be its barycentric subdivision. Let $\alpha\in\chi$ be a closed face. Define the principal pavilion of $\alpha$ to be the pavilion $\Gamma$ of $\alpha$ such that $dim(\Gamma)=dim(\alpha)$ and $\lbrace max(\alpha)\rbrace\in\Gamma$ (remember $\alpha$ is a chain of faces of $X$). Applying this inductively produces the principal pavilion decomposition of $\alpha$ and also of $\chi$. Note: For $\alpha$ a closed face of $\chi$, there exists a chain $c$ for which $\alpha$ is the collection of all subchains of $c$ (in particular $c$ is the single element of $int(\alpha)$) and the principal pavilion of $\alpha$ is $\lbrace d\,|\, d \text{ is a subchain of $c$ and } max(c)\in d\rbrace = \lbrace d\,|\,d\text{ is a subchain of $c$ and } max(d)=max(c)\rbrace$. Lemma: For $X$ a simplicial complex, $\chi=sd(X)$, $a\in X$ an open face, and $\gamma\in\chi$ a principal pavilion of some face of $\chi$, $\gamma\cap sd(a) = \left\{ \begin{matrix} \gamma & \quad \text{if }\lbrace a\rbrace\in\gamma\\ \emptyset & \quad \text{if }\lbrace a\rbrace\notin\gamma \end{matrix} \right.$ Proof: $sd(a)$ is the collection of all chains with max element $a$. Let $\alpha$ a closed face of $\chi$ be such that $\gamma$ is the principal pavilion of $\alpha$. Let $c$ be a chain such that $\alpha$ is all subchains of $c$, then $\gamma$ is all subchains of c with maximum element $max(c)$. So if $a = max(c)$, then $\gamma\subseteq sd(a)$, otherwise $\gamma\cap sd(a) = \emptyset$.$\square$ Lemma: For $X$ a simplicial complex, $\chi = sd(X)$, $L\subseteq X$ a collection of open faces, $\Lambda=sd(L)\subseteq\chi$, and $\alpha\in\chi$ a closed face, if $int(\alpha)\cap\Lambda =\emptyset$ then $\alpha\cap\Lambda$ is contractible and contained in the boundary of $\alpha$. Proof: Clearly if $int(\alpha)\cap\Lambda =\emptyset$ then $\alpha\cap\Lambda\subseteq bd(\alpha)$. Furthermore, for each $l\in L$ and $\Gamma_i$ the $i$-dimensional pavilion in the principal pavilion decomposition of $\alpha$, $\Gamma_i\cap sd(l)$ is either $\emptyset$ or $\Gamma_i$. So $\Gamma_i\cap\Lambda$ is either $\emptyset$ or $\Gamma_i$, and $\alpha\cap\Lambda = \cup_{i\in I}\Gamma_i$ where $I\subseteq [dim(\alpha)]\cup\{0\}$. So $\alpha\cap\Lambda$ is contractible.$\square$ Proof of Theorem: Let $\chi=sd(X)$ and $\Lambda=sd(L)\subseteq\chi$. We know that $sd:X\to\chi$ is a homeomorphism. Restricting to $X\setminus L$, we see $X\setminus L\simeq\chi\setminus\Lambda$. Now $\chi\setminus\Lambda$ is a simplicial complex missing some number of open faces. Let $\alpha\in\chi\setminus\Lambda$ be a maximal open face with $cl(\alpha)\cap\Lambda\neq\emptyset$. By the previous lemma $cl(\alpha)\cap\Lambda$ is a contractible portion of the boundary of $\alpha$. So $cl(\alpha)\setminus\Lambda$ is homeomorphic to a closed disk minus a contractible portion of its boundary, and thus deformation retracts on to the remainder of its boundary. That is, $cl(\alpha)\setminus\Lambda\sim cl(\alpha)\setminus(\Lambda\cup\alpha)$. Since $\alpha$ is maximal, the deformation retraction on $cl(\alpha)\setminus\Lambda$ extends trivially to $\chi\setminus\Lambda$. Thus we have $\chi\setminus\Lambda\sim \chi\setminus(\Lambda\cup\alpha)= del_{\chi\setminus\Lambda}(\alpha)$. Let $\Phi= \{\alpha\in\chi\setminus\Lambda \,|\, \alpha \text{ is open and maximal and } cl(\alpha)\cap\Lambda\neq\emptyset\}$. Applying the previous process to all the elements of $\Phi$ at once we have $\chi\setminus\Lambda\sim del_{\chi\setminus\Lambda}(\Phi)$. Now this process has decreased the maximum dimension of maximal faces whose closure intersects $\Lambda$. Iterating this process we find $\chi\setminus\Lambda\sim del_{\chi\setminus\Lambda}(\{\alpha\in\chi\setminus\Lambda \,|\, \alpha\text{ is an open face and }cl(\alpha)\cap\Lambda\neq\emptyset\})= del_{\chi}(\Lambda)$. (Note when you delete an open face from a complex, you delete all of its cofaces but not any of its faces.) Now $\alpha\in del_{\chi}(\Lambda) \iff cl(\alpha)\cap\Lambda=\emptyset \iff \forall a\in L\text{, } cl(\alpha)\cap sd(a)=\emptyset \iff \forall a\in L\text{, } a\notin\alpha \text{(viewing $\alpha$ as a chain of faces of $X$)} \iff \alpha\cap L=\emptyset \iff \alpha\in P(X\setminus L)$. That is $del_{\chi}(\Lambda)$ and $P(X\setminus L)$ are both chains of faces of $X$ that do not include elements of $L$. So we have $X\setminus L\sim del_{\chi}(\Lambda)= P(X\setminus L)$.$\square$ 

I think that conjecture is true. Let $a$, $b$ be two non-adjacent vertices. I claim that $H = G \setminus \{a, b\}$ must contain exactly two connected components. Indeed, if it has more than two, we can take any of these, say $H_1$, and $H_1 \cup \{a, b\}$ will be connected while the rest of $G$ not. On the other hand, the case of a single component $H$ is also impossible since otherwise $G \setminus H$ is just pair of vertices $a$ and $b$ and it is disconnected. Thus, $G$ consists of two components $H_1$ and $H_2$ and $a$ and $b$ in between. Now I claim that $H_1$ is just a path from $a$ to $b$. First, since $G \setminus H_2$ is connected, there should be some path $l$ from $a$ to $b$ which lies entirely in $H_1$. On the other hand, $H_1$ cannot contain any other vertices since otherwise $G \setminus \{l \cup a \cup b \}$ is disconnected. The same holds for $H_2$. Thus, $G$ originally was just a cycle. 

Let $M_i$ be fixed rectangular matrices with integer coefficients less than $n$. Consider the variety defined by the condition $$ \mathrm{rank}(\lambda_1M_1 + \lambda_2M_2 + ... + \lambda_kM_k) = 1. $$ Assume that there is an integral point $(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_k)$ lying on this variety, can we then guarantee that there is an integral point with the height (maximal absolute value of the coordinates) bounded polynomially in $n$ (the exponent may depend on $k$ and the size of the matrices)? P. S. It might be related to the Birch-Davenport theorem, so with high probability this question is either known or out of reach for current methods (which would be ok to know), but I couldn't find a reference. 

I am wondering if there are any rigorous results telling that some dynamical system hits infinitely many primes (except for the case when orbits are just arithmetic progressions). To make it specific, is there a polynomial $f(x)$ such that its iterations $f^n(x)$ are prime for infinitely many $n$ given that the integer $x$ is fixed. A simple observation here is that if $f(x) = 2x + 1$ then asking if iterations of $f(1)$ contain infinitely many primes is equivalent to the Mersenne primes conjecture. P. S. This question seems to be related to the Bunyakovsky conjecture, so maybe somebody knows about any partial results in this direction? 

The group $SL(2,F)$ where $F$ is a local nonArchemidian field is hyperbolic. Various generalizations of the notion of hyperbolicity have been studied in the literature (I've seen terms like "hierarchically hyperbolic", "relatively hyperbolic" etc.). Which of those classes do groups of the form $G(F)$ where $G$ is semi-simple of higher rank fall into? 

A commutative analogue of the conjecture that the only projective D-affine varieties are homogeneous spaces is a generalization of Harthshorne conjecture. The latter (famously proved by Mori) characterizes projective spaces as the only smooth projective varieties with ample tangent bundles. It is expected that the only smooth projective varieties whose tangent bundle is big and nef are homogeneous spaces of reductive groups, this conjecture is apparently due to Demailly and Campana-Peternell. 

There are various definitions of boundary of a hyperbolic group. Which of those generalize to semi-hyperbolic groups (in the sense of Alonso and Bridson)? The example I have in mind is a semisimple group over a nonArchemedian local field.The answer I'd like to get is something like a nonHausdorff space which is a union of partial flag manifolds $G/P$ (which can be described as the quotient of the complement to $G$ in the De Concini-Procesi compactification by the right action of $G$). 

Is every vector bundle on an algebraic torus $T=({\mathbb A}^1\setminus \{0\})^n$ over an algebraically closed field trivial? I am primarily interested in the case of a characteristic zero base field. 

The previous answer may be all you need, but, say, in question one one can also proceed by induction in q, to make the step of induction embed your complex into an acyclic complex of injective objects. 

Let $G$ be a complex simple simply connected algebraic group and $Gr_G$ be the corresponding affine Grassmannian (it is well known that $Gr_G$ is homotopy equivalent to the base loop space $\Omega K$ of the maximal compact subgroup $K\subset G$). Let $H=H^*(Gr,k)=H^*(\Omega K,k)$ be the cohomology ring where $k$ is a field of characteristic $p>0$. The computation of $H$ by Yun and Zhu in their paper "Integral homology of loop groups..." shows that the commutative $k$-algebra $H$ has a divided power structure, at least when $p$ is not too small. Can this be seen from first principles? In particular, is it related to Cartan's divided power structure on homology of a commutative simplicial $k$-algebra?
