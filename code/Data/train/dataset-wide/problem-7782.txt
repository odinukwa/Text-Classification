Let $c$ denote the inverse of $a+b$, i.e., $ac+bc=ca+cb=1$. Multiplying this by $a$ and $b$ from the left and from the right and using $a^2=b^2=0$, we obtain $abc=a$, $cba=a$, and $cab=b$. Let us show that $R=aR\oplus bR$. It follows from $ac+bc=1$ that $R=aR+bR$. If $ax=by$, then $bax=0$, implying $0=cbax=ax$ in view of $cba=a$. The $R$-modules $aR$ and $bR$ are isomorphic. Indeed, the rule $bcx\mapsto ax$, $x\in R$, defines an $R$-module homomorphism $bR=bcR\to aR$ because $bcx=0$ implies $ax=0$ due to $abc=a$. Its kernel vanishes: $ax=0$ implies $abcx=0$ because $abc=a$ and, hence, $0=cabcx=bcx$. It remains to apply Propositions 5 and 6 on page 52 of "Structure of Rings" by N.Jacobson (1964) and to conclude that $R$ is a ring of $2\times2$ matrices. Edit. By suggestion of Martin Brandenburg, I reproduce the Propositions quite literally: Proposition 5 $\dots$ Conversely, if $\frak A$ is a ring with an identity $1$ and ${\frak A}={\frak I}_1\oplus\dots\oplus{\frak I}_n$ is a direct decomposition of $\frak A$ into right ideals which are isomorphic $\frak A$-modules, then there exists a set of matrix units $\{e_{ij}\mid i,j=1,\dots,n\}$ such that ${\frak I}_j=e_{jj}{\frak A}$. Proposition 6. Let $\{e_{ij}\mid i,j=1,\dots,n\}$ be a set of matrix units in a ring $\frak A$ with identity $1$, and $\frak B$ the subring consisting of the elements which commute with the $e_{ij}$, $i,j=1,\dots,n$. Then every element of $\frak A$ can be written in one and only one way as $\sum b_{ij}e_{ij}$ where $b_{ij}\in{\frak B}$ for all $i$ and $j$. Hence ${\frak A}\cong{\frak B}_n$. The ring $\frak B$ is isomorphic to $e_{11}{\frak A}e_{11}$. Second thought Edit. Those Propositions are an old stuff. It is probably better to prove them here in two lines. For any $R$-module $M$, we have $\text{End}_R(\underbrace{M\oplus\dots\oplus M}_n)\cong\text{Matr}_n(\text{End}_RM)$. On the other hand, $\text{End}_RR\cong R$. Question. The problem looks a bit artificial. Is it a known exercise? 

Just making the above comment an answer. Take $C:=\text{Proj}\ \big(k[x,y,z]/z^2\big)$. Then $C_{\text{red}}={\mathbb P}_k^1$ and the coherent sheaf $F:={\mathcal O}_{{\mathbb P}_k^1}(-2)$ over ${\mathbb P}_k^1$ is known to satisfy $H^1\big({\mathbb P}_k^1,{\mathcal O}_{{\mathbb P}_k^1}(-2)\big)=k$. Since $F$ can be seen as a coherent sheaf over $C$, and it has torsion at a generic point that comes from the nilpotent $z/x$, you get a desired example due to $H^1(C,F)=H^1(C_{red},F)=k\ne0$. 

I am grateful to Edgardo whose answer supplied me with the Siegel theorem on integral points (I did not know it), and I am happy to see that my approach coincides with Edgardo's in many points. The answer is negative: there is no abelian subgroup $A\subset{\mathbb R}^2$ of rank $3$ such that its intersection $I_A:={\mathbb S}^1\cap A$ with the unit circle ${\mathbb S}^1:=\big\{v\in{\mathbb R}^2\mid|v|=1\big\}$ is infinite. In a few words: we show that such $I_A$ is a part of the intersection of two quadrics in ${\mathbb P}_{\mathbb C}^3$ defined over ${\mathbb Q}$, observe that this intersection in interesting cases is generic, hence, is an elliptic curve, and, finally, apply the Siegel theorem $URL$ to an affine part of this curve. Let $L_{\mathbb Q}:={\mathbb Q}A$ denote the ${\mathbb Q}$-linear space spanned by $A$. Besides the intersection $I_A$, we will also deal with the intersection $I_{\mathbb Q}:={\mathbb S}^1\cap L_{\mathbb Q}$. One can choose another ${\mathbb Q}$-basis $B'$ in $L_{\mathbb Q}$ and generate another $A'$. It is immediate that $A\subset\frac1nA'$ and $A'\subset\frac1nA$ for a suitable $n\in{\mathbb N}$. We conclude that $I_A$ is infinite for some $A$ iff, for any ${\mathbb Q}$-basis $B$ in $L_{\mathbb Q}$, there are infinitely many elements in $I_{\mathbb Q}$ whose denominators in terms of $B$ are limited. Assuming that some $I_A$ is infinite, we can choose a ${\mathbb Q}$-basis of $L_{\mathbb Q}$ inside $I_{\mathbb Q}$. Indeed, it is easy to pick a couple of ${\mathbb R}$-linearly independent $b_1,b_2\in I_{\mathbb Q}$. They generate a discrete ${\mathbb Z}$-lattice $A_0\subset{\mathbb R}^2$; so, $\frac1nA_0$ is also discrete for any $n\in{\mathbb N}$. Consequently, the intersection ${\mathbb S}^1\cap\frac1nA_0$ is finite. Including $b_1,b_2$ in some basis of $L_{\mathbb Q}$, we can see that $I_{\mathbb Q}\subset{\mathbb Q}A_0$ would imply $I_A\subset\frac1nA_0$ for a suitable $n\in{\mathbb N}$. A contradiction. For a similar reason, any $2$-dimensional ${\mathbb Q}$-linear subspace in $L_{\mathbb Q}$ contains finitely many rational points from $I_{\mathbb Q}$ with limited denominators. Let $b_1,b_2,b_3\in I_{\mathbb Q}$ be a ${\mathbb Q}$-basis in $L_{\mathbb Q}$. Its Gram matrix has the form $G:=\left[\begin{smallmatrix}1&c_3&c_2\\c_3&1&c_1\\c_2&c_1&1\end{smallmatrix} \right]$ with $-1<c_i<1$. Since the $b_i$'s are ${\mathbb R}$-linearly dependent, $\det G=0$. So, if $c_1,c_2,c_3\in{\mathbb Q}$, then, by means of the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization in $L_{\mathbb Q}$ and by the Sylvester criterion, we could find, in view of $\det G=0$, an isotropic element $0\ne v\in L_{\mathbb Q}$, i.e., such that $\langle v,v\rangle=0$, which is impossible. Hence, $c_i\notin{\mathbb Q}$ for some $i$. Actually, we study rational solutions of $$x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+2c_1x_2x_3+2c_2x_3x_1+2c_3x_1x_2=1.\qquad(1)$$ As $c_3^2<1$, there are finitely many rational solutions of the form $[x_1,x_2,0]$ with limited denominators, because $(1)$ becomes $(x_1+c_3x_2)^2+(1-c_3^2)x_2^2=1$. In other words, we can assume that $x_1x_2x_3\ne0$ and rewrite $(1)$ in terms of $y_i:=x_i^{-1}$ as $$\frac{y_1y_2}{y_3}+\frac{y_2y_3}{y_1}+\frac{y_3y_1}{y_2}+2c_1y_1+2c_2y_2+2c_3y_3=y_1y_2y_3.\qquad(2)$$ The dimension of the ${\mathbb Q}$-linear space spanned by $[x_2x_3,x_3x_1,x_1x_2]$, where $[x_1,x_1,x_3]$ runs over all rational solutions of $(1)$, equals $2$. Indeed, it cannot be $3$ as, otherwise, $c_1,c_2,c_3\in{\mathbb Q}$. It cannot be $0$ because we have at least one rational solution. If the dimension equals $1$, then, for all rational solutions with $x_1x_2x_3\ne0$, the triples $[y_1,y_2,y_3]$ are all ${\mathbb Q}$-proportional. Looking at $(2)$, we see that the coefficient of proportionality should be $\pm1$, and we get only finitely many solutions of $(1)$ with limited denominators. We conclude that $c_1=a_1c+d_1$, $c_2=a_2c+d_2$, $c_3=c$ for suitable $a_1,a_2,d_1,d_2\in{\mathbb Q}$. It follows from $\det G=0$ that $p(c)=0$, where $p(x):=\det\left[\begin{smallmatrix}1&x&d_2+a_2x\\x&1&d_1+a_1x\\d_2+a_2x&d_1+a_1x&1\end{smallmatrix}\right]$. Now, $(1)$ takes the form $x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+2d_1x_2x_3+2d_2x_3x_1+2(x_1x_2+a_1x_2x_3+a_2x_3x_1)c=1$. Since $c\notin{\mathbb Q}$, we deal in fact with the equations $$x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+2d_1x_2x_3+2d_2x_3x_1=1,\quad x_1x_2+a_1x_2x_3+a_2x_3x_1=0.$$ We want to show that, for any integer $0\ne d\in{\mathbb Z}$, the equations $$x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+2d_1x_2x_3+2d_2x_3x_1=d^2,\quad2x_1x_2+2a_1x_2x_3+2a_2x_3x_1=0$$ admit just finitely many integer solution. The intersection $$x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+2d_1x_2x_3+d_2x_3x_1-d^2x_0^2=0,\quad2x_1x_2+2a_1x_2x_3+2a_2x_3x_1=0$$ of two quadrics in ${\mathbb P}_{\mathbb C}^3$ is an elliptic curve if all the $4$ roots of the polynomial $q(\lambda):=\det(\lambda M_1+M_2)$ are pairwise distinct, where $M_1,M_2$ stand for the symmetric matrices of the quadrics (see, for example, $URL$ especially, from pages 221-222). Since $q(\lambda)=\det\left[\begin{smallmatrix}-d^2\lambda&0&0&0\\0&\lambda&1&d_2 \lambda+a_2\\0&1&\lambda&d_1\lambda+a_1\\0&d_2\lambda+a_2&d_1\lambda+ a_1&\lambda\end{smallmatrix}\right]=-d^2\lambda^4p(\lambda^{-1})$, in view of the Siegel theorem, it suffices to show that all the $3$ roots of the polynomial $\lambda^3p(\lambda^{-1})=0$ are $(\text{a})$ pairwise distinct and $(\text{b})$ all different from $0$. The polynomial $p(x)$ of degree $\le3$ has rational coefficients, $p(c)=0$, and $c\notin{\mathbb Q}$. Consequently, $p(x)$ cannot have multiple roots thus implying $(\text{a})$. If $(\text{b})$ is not true, the coefficient of degree $3$ in $p(x)$ vanishes, i.e., $2a_1a_2=0$. In this case, the second quadric is a couple of rational planes passing through the origin $0\in L_{\mathbb Q}$, and we already know that any $2$-dimensional ${\mathbb Q}$-linear subspace in $L_{\mathbb Q}$ contains finitely many rational points from $I_{\mathbb Q}$ with limited denominators. 

In fact, you are looking for an imbedding $\text{PGL}_2{\mathbb C}=\text{PSL}_2{\mathbb C}\hookrightarrow\text{PO}({\mathbb R};3,1)=\text{Isom}\,{\mathbb H}_{\mathbb R}^3$ that provides the subgroup of all orientation-preserving isometries of ${\mathbb H}_{\mathbb R}^3$. Consider the $4$-dimensional ${\mathbb R}$-linear space $H$ formed all hermitian $2\times 2$-matrices. It is easy to verify that $q(h):=\det h\in{\mathbb R}$ defined for all $h\in H$ is a quadratic form of signature $(3,1)$. The group $\text{SL}_2{\mathbb C}$ acts on $H$ by the rule $g\cdot h:=ghg^*$ (on the right-hand side, we use the matrix multiplication and the hermitian transpose). Obviously, this action preserves the quadratic form $q$ and, therefore, provides the desired imbedding. The imbedding $g\mapsto i(g)$ is "quadratic" : the coefficients of $i(g)$ are quadratic homogeneous expressions in coefficients of $g$ (they also involve the complex conjugation). This "quadratic" feature is inescapable because, in a sense, an imbedding in question is unique. So, if you need, you can extract from it all particular formulae you may want to. 

There is a positive number $a$ such that $a^a=2$. If $a=m/n$ with $m,n\in{\mathbb N}$ coprime, then $m^m=2^nn^m$. As $n\ge1$, we conclude that $m$ is even, sayt $m=2^kl$ with $k\ge1$ and odd $l$. So, $2^{km}l^m=2^nn^m$, implying $2^{km}=2^n$ and $km=n$. A contradiction.
