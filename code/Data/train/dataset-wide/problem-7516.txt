Oops, too long for a comment: The expectation of the time until you reach a given point other than the origin is infinite already in one dimension. To see this, let $T$ be the expected time until you get from 0 to 1 (in the obvious 1-dimensional setting). The first step is either to the left or to the right, and if you go to $-1$, the expected remaining time is going to be $2T$ since you have to get back to the origin and then to 1. Consequently $T = 1 + 1/2\cdot (2T)$, from which we see that finite $T$ leads to contradiction. In higher dimensions it becomes even worse. Presumably you want to modify your question and ask about something like the distribution of the time (in dimensions 1 and 2 you actually get there!) or about the expected time to get from one point to another in a finite box. 

You should submit only one version of the paper. Think of the referee as a typical reader, not a judge providing a certificate of correctness. If the referee needs additional information, then other readers will need it too. Regarding putting a proof in an appendix: There are exceptional cases when this is necessary, but most often it is not, and it can even be annoying to the reader (or seen as a warning sign of a bogus paper!) when important arguments are removed from their context. Reading a math paper will always be time consuming, but I don't think there is a general convention that proofs should be sketchy. As an inexperienced writer, it is sometimes hard to know when something should be left out, and when leaving it out will be regarded as a gap. Feedback from teachers and supervisors on this matter can be contradictory and confusing. If you feel you still haven't got the knack for it, bear in mind that it is much easier for a referee to ask you to remove details than to figure out when they are missing. I would not endorse any general advice to write sketchy proofs in order to keep the paper short. 

I recently learned that the answer to the question is YES, answered in the ETH preprint "H-cobordism for Hilbert Manifolds" by Dan Burghelea. I found the reference in the article "On the differential topology of Hilbert manifolds" of Eells and Elworthy. 

This one is analogous to an Ramras' answer: Donaldson's theorem from the 80s and the corresponding Seiberg-Witten stuff. 

Consider the Sobolev spaces $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ with a bounded domain $\Omega$ in n-dimensional Euclidean space. When facing the different embedding theorems for the first time, one can certainly feel lost. Are there certain tricks to memorize the (continuous and compact) embeddings between the different $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ or into $C^{r,\alpha}(\bar{\Omega})$ ? 

Let $I$ be a bounded interval and consider a sequence $(u_k)$ in $H^{1,2}(I)$ (usual Sobolev space). Suppose furthermore, that the sequence $(u_k)$ is bounded in $H^{1,2}(I)$. Then, by Rellich, we can extract a subsequence, still denoted by $u_k,$ s.t. $u_k$ converges to some $\bar{u}$ in $C^0(I)$. Furthermore, by weak compactness of bounded sets in $H^{1,2}(I)$ we can select a subsequence, s.t. $u_k$ converges to some $u$ weakly in $H^{1,2}(I)$. Thus, $u_k$ converges to $\bar{u}$ in $C^0$ and weakly to $u$ in $H^{1,2}$. Do these limits coincide, i.e. is it true that $u=\bar{u}$? 

Thanks to Bill Johnson! My question is easily answered by a direct application of the closed graph theorem (one shows that the diagonal is closed in the mixed norms). Unfortunately, I did not have this one as an exercise in my functional analysis class! 

McDuff proved that there exist continuum many non-isomorphic (separable) II${}_1$ factors. I would like to politely ask whether it is known/open if one can find $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ (or at least $\mathfrak{c}^+$) many such factors. My feeling is that this is not possible to construct more than $\mathfrak{c}$ separable von Neumann algebras by a simple cardinality argument. The ball of $B(H)$ for $H$ separable, is metrisable under the ultraweak topology, so it has at most $\mathfrak{c}$ ultraweakly closed subsets. So we cannot have more than $\mathfrak{c}$ different balls, and consequently, have more than $\mathfrak{c}$ non-isomorphic algebras. Is this correct? 

Let $\lambda$ be an infinite cardinal. Consider the Cantor cube $\Delta_\lambda = \{0,1\}^\lambda$. It is a standard fact in topology that the topological weight (= minimal cardinality for a basis) of $\Delta_\lambda$ is $\lambda$. Let $S$ be a zero-dimensional compact space of weight $\lambda$ and suppose $s\colon \Delta_\lambda\to S$ is a continuous suriection. Does there exists a closed subspace $D$ of $\Delta_\lambda$, which is homeomorphic to $S$ such that $p|_D$ is a homeomorphism? 

All topological spaces considered here are Hausdorff. It is a well-known consequence of the minimality of a compact topology that an injective continuous map $f\colon X\to Y$ where $X$ is compact, must be automatically a homeomorphism onto its range. I am interested in possibly non-compact spaces which share this property. I would like to kindly ask whether there is a characterisation of this class of spaces. 

The halting problem is algorithmically unsolvable: Suppose there is an algorithm that solves it. Construct a Turing machine that behaves differently from every Turing machine. Then it behaves differently from itself, contradiction. Gödel's incompleteness theorem: Suppose a consistent and complete formal system is strong enough to express elementary mathematics. Then it can express the statement that a given Turing machine halts on a given input. By enumerating all proofs, we can solve the halting problem, contradiction. The synopsis for the incompleteness theorem is is a little bit of cheating. The technically hard part of Gödel's proof is to show that a particular version of Peano arithmetic is strong enough to make the argument work (he had to do this since Turing machines weren't yet invented). But if he hadn't been able to pull this off, he would just have invented a slightly stronger system. The philosophically relevant part of the theorem is contained in this synopsis. 

Suppose we are given a sequence $a_1,\dots, a_n$ (input to a partition problem). It seems that this can be encoded as a cycle problem in $\mathbb{Z}^3$ by finding two large numbers $M$ and $N$ and taking the sequence to be $$a_1, M, N, a_2, M, N, \dots, a_n, (n-1)M, (n-1)N.$$ The numbers $M$ and $N$ should be chosen so that the two last terms cannot be canceled in any other way than the obvious one. Then by the orthogonality rule, the only remaining possibility is to let the terms $a_1,\dots,a_n$ go in the third direction, and we are back to the partition problem. This ought to work also for $d\geq 4$, although admittedly some details remain to be filled in. 

I am looking for a list of the irreducible representations of O(2). Could someone please provide a reference? EDIT: I am particularly interested in the representations on IR^2 (irreducible or not) 

Is every real vector bundle over the circle necessarily trivial? If yes - could you please point to a reference. If no - what are sufficient conditions? I am particularly concerned with the case of a smooth map $\gamma:S^1\rightarrow Q$ and the vector bundle $\gamma^* TQ$. 

This is a follow-up of a question of mine with a similar title. I am interested in Morse homology (on Hilbert manifolds), more specifically with "generic" perturbations of the metric tensor (under the heading of "transversality"). The space of perturbations to use should have the property of separability in order to apply the Sard-Smale theorem. Now comes the question, which is supposed to help me in these matters: Let H be a separable Hilbert space and let B be the closed unit ball in H. Is the space C^b(B), the space of continuous bounded functions on the closed unit ball endowed with the sup-norm, a separable space? The previous question of mine replaced B above with an open subset of the Hilbert space. Then the answer turns out to be NO. Notice that if H is finite dimensional, the answer is YES. 

Say that a Banach space $X$ is strongly saturated by reflexive subspaces if every closed subspace $Y\subset X$ contains a further reflexive subspace $Z\subset Y$ with $\mbox{dens }Y=\mbox{dens Z}$. If I recall correctly, the long James space has this property (it is strongly saturated by Hilbert spaces). I would like to know how far from a reflexive space can be a space with this property. To quantify "the distance to a reflexive space" I ask the following question: Is there a Banach space $X$ strongly saturated by reflexive subspaces such that $\ell_\infty(\omega_1)$ (or $\ell_\infty / c_0$) embeds into $X^{**}$? (in my vague understanding, containment of $\ell_\infty$, say, is still not very far...) 

Is there an example of an uncountable Boolean algebra $B$ in which every chain is countable and such that $\ell_\infty$ embeds into the Banach space $C(\mbox{Stone }B)$? The latter requirement is not very important, I just want to exclude some trivial cases, like the algebra of finite/cofinite subsets on some uncountable set. 

Let $p\in (1,\infty)$ and let $q$ be conjugate to $p$. Is there a subspace of $\ell_1(\ell_p)$ isomorphic to $\ell_q$? Of course, I am uninterested in the case $p=2$. 

My question will be very short. Suppose we have a Boolean algebra $B$ which admits an uncountable independent family. Does it follow that there is an uncountable chain of elements in $B$? Manifestly, this is the case for (infinite) complete Boolean algebras, although the proofs of existence of uncountable independent families/chains in these algebras seem to have nothing in common.
