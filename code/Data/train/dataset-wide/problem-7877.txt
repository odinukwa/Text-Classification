Notice that the number of Catalan paths of area at least $cn^{\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon}$ is less than the number of all paths that deviate from the horizontal axis by at least $n^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}$. Let $(S_k, k\geq 0)$ be the one-dimensional simple random walk starting from the origin. We need to find an upper bound for the following probability: $$P\big[\max_{k\leq 2n}S_k > n^{\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon}\big].$$ Now, one may use e.g. a Chernoff's bound for the Binomial distribution (together with the Reflection Principle if you don't want an extra polynomial term in front, see e.g. Chapter III of the Feller's book) to obtain that the above probability is upper bounded by $\exp(-c'n^{\varepsilon})$. So, the total number of such paths is at most $4^n\exp(-c'n^{\varepsilon})$. 

It is well known that for a given polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ the number of primes $p$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$ is infinite. In fact, one can even write down a formula for the density of such primes (e.g. D. Berend, Y. Bilu "Polynomials with roots modulo every integer"). Now suppose that $f = \sum_{i=0}^d a_ix^i$ is irreducible, the degree $d$ is fixed and all $a_i \leq N^C$ for some constant $C$. Is it possible to prove the uniform bound (e.g. whith the constant depending only on $d$ and $C$ and $N$ large) $$ \pi(N, f) = \Omega_{d, C}(\frac{N}{\log N}), $$ where $\pi(N, f)$ means the number of primes less than $N$ s.t. $f$ has a root modulo $p$? The aforementioned paper cites a general density formula due to Lagarias and Odlyzko which seem to provide such a bound assuming GRH. It's of course highly desirable to drop this assumption. 

Let $A_r = \{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z|\leq 1\}\cup\{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z-1|\leq r\}$ be the unit disk with a small "bump" (I'm interested in the regime $r\to 0$). What can be said about the logarithmic capacity of $A_r$? I can prove that there exists a constant $\gamma>0$ such that $\mathop{\mathrm{cap}}(A_r)=\gamma r^2 + $terms of smaller order, but have no idea about how to obtain the value of $\gamma$. Related to the above question: is there any useful explicit form of the conformal mapping of $\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \Im(z)\leq 0\}$ to $\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \Im(z)\leq 0\}\cup \{z\in\mathbb{C}: |z|\leq 1\}$? 

There is an example in the book "Essentials of Stochastic processes" of Durrett, which shows that, in general, $m$ need not be equal to $2n-2$ (it is Example 4.5 of the chapter devoted to Markov chains, Durrett calls this example "Mathematician's nightmare"). The state space of the chain is $\{0,1,\ldots,14\}$, from $0$ it jumps to $5,9,14$ with equal probabilities, from other states $x>0$ it always jumps to $x-1$. It is then claimed that $m$ is at least $30$ for this chain (I didn't do the calculations myself, though). 

I think that conjecture is true. Let $a$, $b$ be two non-adjacent vertices. I claim that $H = G \setminus \{a, b\}$ must contain exactly two connected components. Indeed, if it has more than two, we can take any of these, say $H_1$, and $H_1 \cup \{a, b\}$ will be connected while the rest of $G$ not. On the other hand, the case of a single component $H$ is also impossible since otherwise $G \setminus H$ is just pair of vertices $a$ and $b$ and it is disconnected. Thus, $G$ consists of two components $H_1$ and $H_2$ and $a$ and $b$ in between. Now I claim that $H_1$ is just a path from $a$ to $b$. First, since $G \setminus H_2$ is connected, there should be some path $l$ from $a$ to $b$ which lies entirely in $H_1$. On the other hand, $H_1$ cannot contain any other vertices since otherwise $G \setminus \{l \cup a \cup b \}$ is disconnected. The same holds for $H_2$. Thus, $G$ originally was just a cycle. 

Is there an explicit formula for the (logarithmic) capacity of a union of two disjoint disks? As far as I understand, one can assume without loss of generality that the disks have the same radii (otherwise apply a suitable MÃ¶bius transform etc.). 

No, the CLT need not hold under these assumptions. Consider the following example: take $p=1/2$ for definiteness, and divide the (discrete) time into intervals $I_1=[1,2]$, $I_n=(2^{n-1}, 2^n]$, $n\geq 2$. On each interval, let $(X_k, k\in I_n)$ be the i.i.d. Bernoulli($1/2$) conditioned on $\sum_{k\in I_n}X_k=|I_n|/2$ (think about placing $|I_n|/2$ balls into $|I_n|$ urns at random); clearly, $(X_i,X_j)$ are negatively correlated when $i,j\in I_n$ for some $n$. Then the CLT doesn't hold since the sum becomes deterministic from time to time. The correlations are not strictly negative though (because the $X$'s are independent if belong to different intervals), but you can probably make them so by some "small" perturbation. 

A nice Lemma due to Konyagin asserts that for any subset $B \subset \mathbb{F}_p$ holds $$ |B.B - B.B + B.B - B.B + B.B - B.B| \geq \frac{1}{2}\min\{p, |B|^2 \}, $$ where the standard notation for the product set $B.B$ is used. Now suppose that instead of $B.B$ we have a partial productset $B\stackrel{G}{.}B$ along the edges of a graph $G$ of edge density $\epsilon$ (meaning that $b_1b_2 \in B\stackrel{G}{.}B$ if only if $b_1, b_2 \in B$ are adjacent in $G$). Is it true that if $B < \sqrt{p}$ a similar estimate $$ |B\stackrel{G}{.}B + B\stackrel{G}{.}B + B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B - B\stackrel{G}{.}B| \gg_{\epsilon} |B|^2 $$ holds? UPD Sorry for sloppy notation. So what it means. $B.B = \{b_ib_j |b_i, b_j \in B \}$, $B.B-B.B = \{b_ib_j - b_kb_l |b_i, b_j, b_k, b_k \in B\}$, and $B.B+B.B$ etc. being defined the same way. 

Let $S(n)$ be the discrete sphere of radius $n$ (i.e., the internal boundary of the Euclidean discrete ball $B(n)$) centered in the origin, and consider a simple random walk starting at some $x\in\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $2n-1<\|x\|\leq 2n$ (the dimension $d$ is at least 2). Let $\nu_{n,x}$ be the conditional entrance measure to $S(n)$, given that the walk hits $S(n)$ before $S(4n)$. Also, let $hm_n$ be the harmonic measure (from infinity) on $S(n)$. Can one prove that the R.-N. derivative of $\nu_{n,x}$ with respect to $hm_n$ satisfies the Lipschitz condition? That is, there is a constant $C$ (maybe depending on the dimension), such that $$\Big| \frac{\nu_{n,x}(y)}{hm_n(y)} - \frac{\nu_{n,x}(z)}{hm_n(z)} \Big| \leq C \frac{\|y-z\|}{n}, $$ for all $y,z\in S(n)$. This is obviously true for the Brownian motion, but the discrete case is more tricky, since the harmonic measure is not uniform. 

If you divide on $a$ and let $a$ to be big you have basically a set of linear inequalities of the form $1-o(1) \geq b_ic-d_i \geq o(1)$. If you look at $b_ic$ geometrically, it is a beam of lines emanating from zero with slopes $b_1, ..., b_{a-1}$. And you want to find a point $c$ such that the line $x = c$ intersects each line in a strip $1+d_i-o(1) \geq y \geq d_i+o(1)$. It seems that if you order the lines according to the slope and starting from the line with the smallest slope (smallest $b_i$) it is possible to choose $d_i$ for each new line appropriately (based on the geometric representation above) 

Consider the standard two-dimensional Brownian motion, and define $\tau(A)$ to be the hitting time of $A\subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Let $hm_A$ be the harmonic measure (from infinity) on $A$. Let $B(r)$ be the disk of radius $r$ centered in the origin. Also, let $\nu_{A,x}^{R}$ be the conditional entrance measure to $A$ starting at $x\in B(R)\setminus A$, given that $\tau(A)<\tau(B(R))$. Assume also that $A\subset B(r)$ for some $0<r<R$. One may probably expect a result of the form $$ \Big|\frac{d \nu_{A,x}^{R}}{d\,hm_A}-1\Big| \leq const\frac{r\ln s}{s}, $$ where $s=\|x\|-r$ (because a similar result holds for the SRW). Could anyone provide a reference? 

Let $Z(m)$ be the number of uncovered (= not chosen) sites after $m$ trials. First, we have $$\mathbb{E} Z(N^a(1+\epsilon)\ln N)=N\times(1-N^{-a})^{N^a(1+\epsilon)\ln N}\approx N^{-\epsilon},$$ so you can use Chebyshev inequality to bound $\mathbb{P}[Z(N^a(1+\epsilon)\ln N)\geq 1]$ from above. Then, for the result in the other direction, use the Paley-Zigmund inequality, $\mathbb{P}[Z>0]\geq (\mathbb{E}Z)^2/(\mathbb{E}Z^2)$. Clearly, $\mathbb{E} Z(N^a(1-\epsilon)\ln N)\approx N^{\epsilon}$, and you write $Z(N^a(1-\epsilon)\ln N)$ as a sum of indicators, square it etc., to prove that $\mathbb{E} [Z(N^a(1-\epsilon)\ln N)]^2$ is $N^{2\epsilon}+$terms of smaller order. So, this way you can obtain that $N^a(1+\epsilon)\ln N$ trials will be enough (to choose everybody at least once) with probability at least $1-O(N^{-\epsilon})$, and $N^a(1-\epsilon)\ln N$ trials will be not enough also with probability at least $1-O(N^{-\epsilon})$. 

Recall that a graph is called $k$-chordal if any cycle $C$ of length $> k$ contains a chord, i.e. an edge joining to non-consecutive vertices in $C$. Let $f(n, k)$ be the minimal number of edges s.t. any graph on $n$ vertices can be made $k$-chordal by deleting at most $f(n, k)$ edges. There is a paper of Erd\H{o}s and Laskar "On maxinal chordal subgraph" where they show that $$ f(n,3) = \frac{n^2}{2} - (1+o(1))\sqrt{2}n^{3/2}. $$ I am wondering if other bounds for $f(n, k)$ are known for bigger $k$. A bound in terms of the number of edges is also of interest. In particular, is is true that there is some bounded $k$ s.t. $$ f(n, k) = o(|E|), $$ where $E$ is the number of edges? UPD The answer for the last question is NO, as seen from the following example. Take $k+1$ copies of $K_{n/(k+1)}$, call it $G_0, ..., G_k$. Join all vertices in $G_i$ and $G_{i+1}$ (addition mod $(k+1)$). One can show that for this graph $f(n, k) \geq n^2/4(k+1)^2$. It is interesting to see what is the right constant, though.
