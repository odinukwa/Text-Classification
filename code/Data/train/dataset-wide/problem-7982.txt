For a 3-connected counterexample, you can take a 'truncated' Petersen graph, truncating meaning that we remplace each vertex of $Pete$ by a 'small' triangle (think of a truncated cube). Then an induced cycle $G[V_1]$ as above must hit each triangle and moreover alternate between triangle edges and edges of the original $Pete$. Thus the latter edges would form a Hamilton cycle of $Pete$, which doesn't exist. Note that similar truncating constructions for higher connectivity $k>3$ won't work, as for $k=4$ a non Hamiltonian 4-regular 4-connected graph just doesn't exist (if my memory serves), and for $k>4$ a 'truncated vertex' $C_k$ might be visited more than once. Edit after Soro's comment: Truncating the Meredith graph $M$ (i.e. replacing each vertex by a small $C_4$ - note that this can be done in 3 different ways for each vertex, but that isn't relevant) will result in a cubic graph with 280 vertices that is still 4-connected. If a cycle as above exists, it must hit each $C_4$ (sharing either one or two adjacent edges with it) and alternatingly with those, hit edges of $M$, which would again form a Hamilton cycle of $M$. Just a feeling: for a $5$-connected graph, I would conjecture the statement to hold. 

For $n=3$ it is clear that the equilateral triangle with $r=\dfrac1{\sqrt{3}}$ is best possible. But already for $n=4$, we can do better than a square, by shifting two perpendicular segments as shown on the left below and placing the two other ones at small distances parallel to them. So we can realize $r={\sqrt{\dfrac38}}+\epsilon< \dfrac1{\sqrt{2}}$. Likewise for $n=5$, where the three black edges of the pentagon can be moved inside such that the whole fits in the blue circle with diameter $\dfrac{\sqrt{5}+1}2$, thus $r=\dfrac{\sqrt{5}+1}4<\sqrt{\dfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{10}}$ (the circumradius of the pentagon, orange circle). And there is still room for improvement, as the blue circle can be made smaller after pushing one of the grey segments diagonally upwards. 

Of course, for a given tile, say a pythagorean triangle, we can start with building a square that contains an arbitrary (but finite) number of different positions, then paving the plane with instances of that square repeats each position infinitely often. But this does not answer the question. As soon as self-similarity is involved, the "growth" happens in two dimensions. It does not seem possible e.g. to tile an infinite strip by some self-similar pattern. Or is it? 

It is clear that in both cases above, the formulae do not give any hint about this angle. But my question is: 

Given three naturals $a<b<c$. We consider polyominos, connected or not, which are composed of three squares of sides $a,b,c$. 

Not an answer, just a graphic illustrating the percentages $A$ and $B$ of multi-grade solutions vs. all solutions, sorted according to the biggest contained term. It is hard to believe they should drop to $0$ as $n$ grows, especially $B$, but sure enough, the available data after all only cover a tiny part of infinity... 

(Or is there a better definition of canonical?) The canonicity of the q-binomial coefficients is obviously accounted for by their relationship with linear subspaces. (So this is not an analytical criteria using the limit $q\to1$.) What about the q-Gamma function? We may consider it canonical because of the (?!) q-analogue of the Bohr-Mollerup theorem proved by R. Askey, which states that for $0\lt q\lt 1$, the only logarithmically convex function satisfying $f(1)=1$ and $f(x+1)=\frac{q^x –1}{q–1}f(x)$ is the q-gamma function $ \Gamma_q(z)=(1-q)^{1-x} \frac{(q\;;\; q)_{\infty}}{{(q^x;\; q) _\infty }}.$ Also note that this formula looks at least as elegant as Euler's definition of $\Gamma(z)= \dfrac{1}{z} \prod\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^z}{1+\frac{z}{n}}.$ On the other hand, one of the most basic identities, the recursion of binomial coefficients, has only an "asymmetric" q-analog and thus two of them: ${\genfrac[]00{n}{k}}_q=q^k{\genfrac[]00{n-1}{k}}_q+{\genfrac[]00{n-1}{k-1}}_q={\genfrac[]00{n-1}{k}}_q+q^{n-k}{\genfrac[]00{n-1}{k-1}}_q$. For the classical orthogonal polynomials, it looks like there exist systematically "nice" q-analogs (see e.g. this survey), but it is not clear if there is a certain sense in which those can be considered canonical. Maybe for the Chebyshev polynomials, there is one "best" q-analog. 

Let $k,m,n\in\mathbb N$ such that $n>k$. For a partition $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k)\vdash m$ with $\alpha_1\ge\dots\ge \alpha_k>0$ and nonnegative $ x_1,\dots,x_n$ define $x^\alpha :=\prod_{i=1}^k x_i^{\alpha_i} $ and ${\tilde x^{\alpha}} :=\prod_{i=1}^k x_{i+1}^{\alpha_i} $. All indices are cyclical $\mod n$. 

By this type of construction, it is in fact not hard to show that $\liminf\limits_{n\to\infty}\ d_{4,n}\ge 16$ (and conjecturing that for $4n-1$ prime this is again the best possible constellation would mean that equality holds). For even $k=6,8,...$, $\liminf\limits_{n\to\infty}\ d_{k,n}$ does not seem to increase further, it rather seems to stick at $16$. Very strange. May there be then a universal bound for $d_{k,n}$? Note that similar constructions for odd $k$ yield much smaller $h(C)$'s, as no separating line touches the central disk, which is where the situation is most tight. 

And possibly, it doesn't even make a difference if we allow an infinite set of pairwise different isosceles triangles! 

For a lattice $\mathbb Z^d$, denote by lattice line any line that contains two (and thus infinitely many) lattice points. 

In the Petersen graph $P$, there are triples of edges with pairwise distance $3$. If we add vertices $a,b,c$ on each of the edges of such a triple (see picture), now take a second instance of this graph and add three edges $aa',bb',cc'$, we'll come up with a 3-connected graph $G$ whose only 2-factors are H-cycles, i.e. it realizes the partition $(26)$. This is because $a,b,c$ cannot be all contained in a 2-factor of $P$, so there must be two of $aa',bb',cc'$ contained in any 2-factor of $G$, and from there it is easy to check that such a 2-factor cannot contain a $C_5$ of $P$, i.e. it must pass through all vertices. EDIT: We can realize other types $(n)$ by replacing $P'$ by certain other graphs: 

This should follow by Gosper's algorithm for computing the R.C.F. for $\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$ from the R.C.F. for $x$ from the fact that it holds for all $x=e^{2/n}$. But I wonder if there is a more direct way to prove it. 

On the Wolfram page about pi formulas, there is this curious limit by R. W. Gosper (130) $$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\prod\limits_{k=n}^{2n}\dfrac{\pi}{2\arctan k}=4^{1/\pi}.$$ The only reference given is an entry from 1996 in some forum. Has anybody a proof or reference for this or similar formulas? 

No. Your statement " A isomorphic B, C isomorphic D, then : A∪C isomorphic B∪D (I think so)" is wrong. Take $A=B=K_{1,2}$, $C$ an edge of $A$, $D$ the edge which is not in $A$. Then $A\cup C=A$, but $B\cup D=K_3$. 

Thank you for reading me so far. Some of the questions may be rather subjective. As for the title, I had thought at first about "Why are most q-analogues canonical?" But then I figured that in the whole ocean of q-analogues, maybe there are just some "very" canonical islands, but for the vast majority the notion of canonicity is more or less fuzzy. Is that a feasible perception? Even though some of these thoughts are somewhat philosopical, anyway, here goes. Looking forward to your input! 

This question is possibly a bit more philosophical $-$ compatible with the Christmas season, which is an appropriate moment to look at the world from a more universal angle... My last question with a similar flavor was a long time ago. Some mathematical constants come in pairs with their reciprocal. One of the first examples that comes to mind is the golden ratio, sometimes defined as $\phi=\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$, sometimes as $\phi=\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$, with the role of both being perfectly ambivalent. This happens of course because, up to sign, $\phi$ and $1/\phi$ are Galois conjugates. Similarly for $i$ and $-i$ (and in fact any pair of conjugate complex numbers of norm $1$, with a special mention of the 3rd roots of unity), and one could argue that $\phi $ and $i$ and $e^{2\pi i/3}$ are essentially just the simplest non trivial cases of solutions to $x^2+px\pm1=0$. But before you say "this is trivial, and after all, how should one even define a constant?", let me state that for $e$ and $e^{-1}$ the situation is very similar. While exponential growth is of course quite different from exponential decay, the same principle is at work in both. We may reduce this to a simple sign change in the defining formulae $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left(1\pm\frac1n\right)^n$, or take just the sign change between $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$. 

I have also found $f(9)\ge 7$ and generally $f(2k-5)\ge k$ for $k\ge7$ by "splitting" two vertices of the Petersen graph, but as $k$ grows, this is no big improvement on the trivial lower bound. Yet, there should be much better lower bounds. As for upper bounds, I suppose they are notoriously hard to find. Is it possible at least to prove that $f(n)<n$ for $n\ge 6$? Equivalently, that for each $\sigma \in S_n$ the 3-regular graph with links $(v_i,w_{\sigma(i)})$ is Hamiltonian? Note that the Generalized Petersen Graph $GP(7,2)\simeq GP(7,3)$, the most "symmetric" instance of those graphs, is already Hamiltonian, which makes me conjecture this holds. 

No. Start with a $K_9$ and compose a tournament of directed cycles built by chords of same "length" in the 9-gon. So there are three $C_9$ and one $3C_3$ involved. Now if you reverse the orientation of just one $C_3$, the resulting tournament should be non isomorphic. 

Let $G$ be a $(\nu,g)$-cage graph of degree $\nu$ with girth $g$ and $n=n(\nu,g)$ vertices. Based on the known examples, I am wondering if the following can be proved/disproved: 

Take an odd prime $p$ and put $x_0:=\sum\limits_{j=0}^{p-1}\left(a_{j}\sqrt{p}\cos\dfrac{j\pi}p+b_{j}\sin\dfrac{j\pi}p +c_{j}\tan\dfrac{j\pi}p\right)$, where the $a_{ij}$ are integers. If $f$ denotes the minimal polynomial of $x_0$, can we prove that $p$ divides all coefficients of $f$ except the leading one? I have quite a bit of numerical evidence for this. Note that it obviously doesn't hold without the $\sqrt p$ factor, but more interestingly, it is also false if $\sqrt p$ goes with the other terms instead of the $\cos$ term. Moreover, it seems that in those cases, none of the non-zero coefficients is divisible by $p$. (More generally, I think those coefficients are divisible by $p$ if we replace $\dfrac{j\pi}p$ by $\dfrac{j\pi}{p^r},\ r\in\mathbb N$ and do the sum over $j=0,...,p^r-1$.) If all but one of the $a_j,b_j,c_j$ are $0$, the claim is quite easy to prove (and not new). For instance, for $x_0=\sin\dfrac{j\pi}p$ with any fixed $j$, we have explicitly $$f(x)=\sum\limits_{i=0}^k(-1)^k\dbinom p{2i+1}(1-x^2)^{k-i}x^{2i},$$ where $p=2k+1$. So the claim is obvious here. Added: It should be clear from Galois theory that in general, the conjugates of $x$ are the sums obtained by replacing all the $j$'s by $kj$ for a fixed $k=2,...,p-1$.

Given two naturals $s<t$. Is there always a square (or at least a bigger rectangle) that can be tiled with $s\times t$ rectangles in an irreducible way (i.e. any grid line splitting it cuts at least one of the $s\times t$ rectangles of the tiling)? E.g. for $(s,t)=(1,2)$, it is well known that a $\underline{6\times 6}$ square has no irreducible tiling, but a $\underline{8\times 8}$ one does, and so do in fact all other rectangles with even area and sides bigger than $5\times 6$. I think I have seen a similar statement for $(s,t)=(2,3)$ somewhere, but can’t seem to find the article anymore. So: 

For the elliptic integral of first kind, $K(m)=\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1-m^2sin^2\theta}} $, it is well-known that $K(m)$ can be expressed in what Chowla and Selberg call "finite terms" (i.e. algebraic numbers and a finite product of Gamma functions of rational values) whenever $i\frac{K(\sqrt{1-m^2})}{K(m)}$ belongs to an imaginary quadratic field $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{d})$ (see Theorem 7 in S. Chowla and A. Selberg, On Epstein's zeta function, J. reine angew. Math. 227, 86-110, 196). Examples for these so called elliptic integral singular values are given on this Wolfram page (with some small typos) and in the note of J.M. Borwein and I.J. Zucker, "Elliptic integral evaluation of the Gamma function at rational values of small denominator," IMA Journal on Numerical Analysis, 12 (1992), 519- 526. See also what Tito Piezas has to say about this in his pleasant-to-read Collection of Algebraic Identities. The following question arises: 

My recent question about polygonal tilings where tiles can occur in infinitely many positions has been answered by two nice constructions (besides Jan Kyncl's answer, there is the Conway tessellation evoked in Robin Houston's comment), which are both of self-similar nature. For each of the positions, there are only finitely many tiles, because each step of the constructions (in terms of self-similarity: each "change of scale") involves an irrational rotation of a so far finite pattern. So I would like to push it further by asking: 

Start with a regular $n$-gon of side 1 and consider its sides as open segments that can be moved around in the plane, allowing only translations. Two segments may not intersect. 

I don't see how this can be obtained directly from Vandermonde's identity, but it is an easy induction over $t$ using ${k \choose j}={k-1 \choose j-1}+{k-1 \choose j}$. Grouping neighboring terms together, you will see that the LHS is just the sum of iterated differences of neighboring binomial coefficients, and iterating them $t$ times, it all boils down to ${k-t \choose m-t}$. Rather than writing it formally (who will ever read it?), I suggest you try it out with values like $k=10,m=8,t=3$. If we put $n:=m-t$, we get as a by-product for $r=1,...,n$ $$\sum_{j=0}^{n} (-1)^{j}{m-r \choose j}{m-j-1 \choose m-n-1}=0.$$ 

An easy construction to achieve the bound of $n^2$ edges for $2n$ vertices: embed the $n$ edges $(v_i,w_i)$ of the 1-factor as parallel segments in the plane. To these $n$ edges, add all $\binom n2 $ possible edges $(v_i,w_j)$ with $i<j$ and all $\binom n2 $ edges $(w_i,w_j)$. For any 1-factor, each $v_i$ must belong to a different edge, from there it is clear that there is a unique one. 

The following problem was raised in a Mathlinks thread: If $a,b,c\in\mathbb Z$ such that $a\ne0$ and $b^2-4ac\ne 0$, for how many consecutive integers $x$ can $ax^2+bx+c$ ba a perfect square ? The polynomial $-15x^2+64$ is obviously a square for the five numbers $x=-2,...,2$, but the method used for finding this in the above thread cannot be extended further. Should $5$ really be the best possible answer? Has this problem been treated somewhere else?
