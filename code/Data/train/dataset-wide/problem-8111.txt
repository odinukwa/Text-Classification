Every metric on $R^2$ is conformally equivalent to either the standard metric on $R^2$ or to the standard metric on the unit disc. Thus there are only two conformal equivalence classes. As every class contains a metric which is a product, every metric on $R^2$ is conformally equivalent to a product metric. Of course, this argument uses dimension $2$ in the very essential way. EDIT. The answer for the $2D$ torus is also yes. Every metric on a torus is conformally equivalent to a flat metric. About higher dimensions I do not know. The general formulation of the Uniformization theorem is that every open simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to the disc or to the plane. Equivalent formulation is that every Riemannian metric on such Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to the flat metric on the plane or to the Poincare metric in the unit disc. A corollary is that every Riemann surface has a conformal metric of constant curvature. EDIT. To construct an example of a product metric in the plane which is conformally equivalent to the disc, use the criterion that every complete metric of curvature $<-k$, with $k>0$ will be conformally equivalent to the unit disc. (This is called the Ahlfors-Schwarz Lemma). An explicit example of such product metric is $ds^2=e^{x^2}dx^2+e^{y^2}dy^2$. Just compute the curvature. The references are: Ahlfors, Conformal invariants; Hubbard, Teichmuller theory and applications to geometry, topology and dynamics (recommended!), and many other books on Riemann surfaces. Let me add that in your case you know in advance that the surface is homeomorphic to the plane (or to the torus) and with this additional information the proof of the Univormization theorem can be substantially simplified. Perhaps the simplest proof (if you know in advance what your surface is homeomorphic to) is in Goluzin, Geometric function theory. 

Topological vector spaces, other than Banach spaces with most applications are Frechet spaces. The primary sources arei: L. Schwartz, Theorie des distributions, 1966, and I. Gelfand, G. Shilov, Generalized functions, vol. 1 (the other volumes contain applications). And there are hundreds of secondary sources. EDIT. Let me add a book-size survey on applications of Frechet manifolds: MR0656198 Hamilton, Richard S. The inverse function theorem of Nash and Moser. Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 7 (1982), no. 1, 65–222. 

Exponential polynomials are very special among the entire functions of exponential type. Their zeros accumulate to finitely many directions: there are finitely many numbers $\{\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n\}$ such that the arguments of zeros accumulate only to those $\theta_j$. General entire functions of exponential type can have arguments of zeros arbitrarily distributed, for example, uniformly. Further, $\log M(r)$, where $M(r)=\max_{|z|\leq r}|f(z)|$ for exponential polynomials is like $(c+o(1))r$, while for general entire functions of exponential type, the limit $(\log M(r))/r$ might not exist. There are many other properties specific to exponential polynomials: their Taylor coefficients, zeros and everything else. 

The answer is no. Function $g(z)=(e^z-1)/z$ is entire, of exponential type $1$, is not an exponential polynomial, but it satisfies the equation $$(z+2)g(z+2)-(1+e)(z+1)g(z+1)+ezg(z)=0.$$ Ref. J-P Bezivin et F. Gramain, Solutiuons entieres d'un systeme d'equations aux differences, Ann. Inst. Fourier, Grenoble, 43 (1993) 792-814. Notice that you can modify this example to achieve arbitrarily small exponential type. Edit. There exists also such equations with entire solutions of smaller growth, of order less than one. This paper has explicit examples with order $1/3$ and $1/5$: K. Ishizaki and N. Yanagihara, Wiman-Valiron method for difference equations, Nagoya Math. J., 175 (2004) 75-102. 

I can estimate this as $c/(1-e^{4\pi t})$, where $c$ is a numerical constant which can be computed. It is possible that $c$ is less than $1/(2\pi)$, which will give what you need when $t<0$. To do this set $r=e^{2\pi t}$, $\theta=2\pi(x-k-1)$. Than the integral becomes $$\frac{u(-r)}{1-r^2},$$ where $u$ is the Poisson integral of the function $(\theta\sin\theta)/(2\pi), \;-\pi<\theta<\pi$. Trivial estimate (using Maple) shows that $u\leq 1.82/(2\pi)$, but certainly one can do better than that with more computation. 

To do this in $R^n$ you will need more than $2$ summands. You use the following lemma: if $Z$ is an analytic set in dimension $n$, not equal to the whole space, then you can find $n+1$ vectors $t_j$ such that the translations $Z+t_j$ are disjoint. This is proved by induction on $n$, using he Weierstrass Preparation Theorem. 

There are very many different proofs of Picard's theorem, and some of them are really "simple". (Picard's original proof occupies about 2 lines, using the things already known at that time). None of those proofs that I know simplifies if you assume that the function omits 4, 10, or any finite or countable set of points. However, if it omits a larger set, for example an arc, then one can give a "simpler" proof, in the sense that less knowledge is required: map the complement of this arc onto a bounded region, this can be done by an elementary function, and then apply Liouville's theorem. Remark. Let me add that the question whether there exists a "simpler" proof was asked immediately after Picard's proof was published, and it led to a very substantial progress in several areas of mathematics. People were looking not for a shorter proof but for a "more elementary" proof, using less prerequisite. Many such proofs were found and almost each of them led to a substantial generalization of Picard's theorem. However some very natural generalizations are still unproved. For example, it is conjectured that a holomorphic map from $C$ to $P^2$, the projective space of dimension $2$, omitting a generic curve of degree $5$ must be constant. 

Now if $f$ is positive definite, and with compact support, this means that $F=\hat{f}$ is non-negative and entire, of exponential type. So zeros of $F$ make a discrete sequence of isolated points. Then it is quite evident that you can make the sum $\sum_j F(t-t_j)$ positive: just take $t_0=0$ and $t_1$ different from all differences between zeros of $F$. Then $F(t-t_0)+F(t-t_1)>0$ for all real $t$. 

Yes, they have been studied. Look into the recent paper Langley, J. K. Trajectories escaping to infinity in finite time. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 145 (2017), no. 5, 2107–2117, and the reference list in this paper. They were also studied by physicists: Bender, Carl M.; Hook, Daniel W. Complex classical motion in potentials with poles and turning points. Stud. Appl. Math. 133 (2014), no. 3, 318–336. EDIT. I forgot to mention this: B. Branner, K. Dias, Classification of complex polynomial vector fields in one complex variable, Journal Journal of Difference Equations and Applications Volume 16, 2010 - Issue 5-6: 

What can be said about $D$ if it is known that coefficients are non-negative? (Except the trivial fact that the boundary point of the largest modulus is on the positive ray). What can be said about non-negative coefficients of a power series if it is known that it represents a univalent function? Is it possible to parametrize this class? 

All details about Cartan's thesis can be found in the thesis itself: $URL$ There is also a German translation for those who do not read French: Ueber die einfachen Transformationsgruppen. (German) JFM 25.0638.01 Leipz. Ber. XLV. 395-420 (1893). 

There is no PDE. Let $n: U\to S^2$ be a given smooth map, and suppose that the Jacobian is not $0$ at some point. Let $f$ be the composition of $n$ with the standard embedding of $S^2\to R^3$ as the unit sphere. Then the Gauss map of this $f$ is exactly $n$. So there cannot be any local condition, that is no PDE. 

each containing a simplified proof of Ahlfors's two fundamental theorems. (The second fundamental theorem implies the island theorem). These four proofs make a complete list, I suppose. 

I don't know the answer in this generality, but the following paper may be relevant: MR0320402 Frank, Günter; Wittich, Hans Zur Theorie linearer Differentialgleichungen im Komplexen. Math. Z. 130 (1973), 363–370. In this paper the question is studied when $k$ is the field of complex numbers, and the set of differential operators is somewhat restricted. 

Some very close statements are contained in the paper MR2558789 Li, Baokui; Wang, Yuefei A new characterization for isometries by triangles, and in the reference list of this paper. For example, your conjecture is true if the map is surjective: MR1657778 Chubarev, Alexander; Pinelis, Iosif Fundamental theorem of geometry without the $1$-to-$1$ assumption. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 127 (1999), no. 9, 2735–2744. 

In your question you only discuss the formal analogy, disregarding the questions of convergence, and what exactly a "function" is. This is a reasonable setting indeed, if one restricts oneself to finite sums. Then there is an exact correspondence, if we extend the set of Taylor series to Laurent series. Finite Laurent series $\sum a_n z^n$ are in one-to one correspondence with finite trigonometric sums $\sum a_n\exp(int)$. (These are essentially the same as the series in sines and cosines). The subspace of polynomials consists of those sums for which $n\geq 0$. One can give a condition on the series of sines and cosines to correspond to a Laurent series with $n\geq 0$. If one wants to pass to infinite sums, one has to use some topology. The simplest case is when the topology is defined by the standard scalar product. Completion of the space of polynomials in this topology gives the space $H_2$ which can be thought of as a space of trigonometric (Fourier) series, and as a space of Power series. And for the coefficients of the expansion you have two formulas: one involving integration, another differentiation. These formulas give the same result in view of Cauchy formula. On your other questions. Fourier series are generalized to Fourier transform. Taylor series are similarly generalized to Laplace transform. (With an intermediate step of Dirichlet series). For recommended reading... there are a lot of books, the appropriate one depends on your prerequisites. Hoffman's book Banach Spaces of Analytic Functions begins with a very clear explanation of relations between Taylor and Fourier series. 

The answer is no. Let $A$ be the space of real values functions with absolutely convergent Fourier series, and $F$ is a real function on some interval $I$. Theorem (Katznelson). If $F\circ f\in A$ for all $f\in A$ with range in $I$, then $F$ is analytic on $I$. Taking $F(x)=|x|$ we obtain that there is $f\in A$ such that $|f|$ is not in $A$.

This is not a hypergeometric equation (singularity at infinity is irregular). It can be reduced to the prolate spheroid equation. (Also known as confluent Heun equation). See the references in Wikiedia, $URL$ 

The tradition probably goes back to classical results on Laplace transform: Lalace transform of a function $f$ on the positive ray is $$Lf(\zeta)=\int_0^\infty f(z)e^{-\zeta z}dz.$$ If $f$ is of exponential type on the positive ray, this is holomorphic in $\Re\zeta>a$. Now if $f$ is entire, of exponential type, you can analytically continue this Laplace transform by rotating the integration path. This defines the Laplace transform in a full neighborhood of $\infty$, and it extends holomorphically to infinity and equals to $0$ these, that is $$F(\zeta)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nz^{-n}.$$ There is a one-to one correspondence between entire functions $f$ of exponential type, and Functions $F$ analytic at $\infty$, such that $F(\infty)=0$. (Polya's theorem). Modern summation theory is a generalization of this in some sense, and it considers divergent series $F$. They prefer to keep notation consistent with the classical theory. 

Journals which publish papers for money should not be considered serious journals, and if your purpose of publishing a paper is that it is read by mathematicians, you should not send it in such journals. If you really wish your paper to be read by mathematicians, publish it on the arxiv. If your goal is something different, this is a wrong web site to ask. 

Yes you can. First of all the condition $|f(0)|\geq 1$ is irrelevant: you can always multiply your function on a positive constant. Take an entire function $F$ for which the set $\{ z:|F(z)|>1\}$ is contained in the strip $\{ x+iy:|y|<\pi\}$. Such a function is constructed in Hayman's book Meromorphic functions, section 4.1.1, and it is called $E_0$ there. (Other people call it Mittag-Leffler function). Make sure that $F(0)=2$ by an appropriate shift. Then consider $F(kz)$ where $k$ is very large. Then the set in the unit disk where $|F(kz)|>1$ will be as small as you wish, but will contain $0$. Finally take real part of $F(kz)$. 

Yes, indeed, this notation was used to state the dimension of the manifold. The idea of dimenson is very intuitive but it took long time and a lot of labor to formalize. Before the modern definitions of "dimension", "manifold" and "homeomorphism" were spread, people, especially geometers, expressed this fact by saying that something depends on $n$ parameters, or is an "n"-parametric family, and wrote $\infty^n$. This notation is out of date now, but they still speak of $n$-parametric families. When I was an undergraduate student (early 1970s) $\infty^n$ was still used in the lectures on projective geometry, for example. I was puzzled because I knew that Cantor proved that all these things have the same cardinaity, until I read about Brouwer's theory of dimension and "domain preservation property". (About a century before, Cantor and Poincare were similarly puzzled until Brouwer clarified the thing:-) I think Cantor was the first who tried to prove that manifolds of different dimensions are not homeomorphic, but he failed. (Before Cantor it seemed evident to everyone that plane contains more points than the line, I do not know whether anyone cared to prove this, but those who did try, could not). 

The question seems trivial. Since everyone uses electronic version nowadays, why don't you write just Author, Review of, MR number. If the journal editor will want to edit this, let her edit. I quoted a Zentralblatt review once like this: [53] H. Schmidt, Zentralblatt fur Math. 27 (1943), 309-311. (This was in pre-computer era). 

Before addressing this question, think of the case of polynomials. In one dimension, Weierstrass theorem for polynomials says that there exists a polynomial with prescribed zeros. In several dimensions, zeros are never isolated. So what does it mean "prescribed zeros"? Zeros of a polynomial form an "algebraic set". But an algebraic set is defined as... zero set of a polynomial. We obtain a tautology. However there is something which can be called a "generalization of Weierstrass theorem". This is called the "solution of the Second Cousin Problem". See any book on several complex variables for exact formulation. For example, the Weierstrass theorem has the following consequence: every meromorphic function in the whole plane is a ratio of two entire functions. (Here a meromorphic function is defined as a function which is LOCALLY (in a neighborhod of every point) can be represented as a ratio of two analytic functions in a neighborhood of this point. So the statement is not a tautology.) The same statement is true in any dimension and it is proved using the solution of the second Cousin problem. In this sense the second Cousin problem is the generalization of the Weierstrass theorem to several variables. 

You cannot do this "without analytic continuation". A multi-valued function is defined on a Riemann surface. The singularities of this function are not lying on the Riemann sphere, so you cannot "specify their position" without describing somehow the Riemann surface. If your only singularities are finitely many ramification points and poles, the Riemann surface will be compact (but you need the additional data, for example the monodromy data, to specify this compact Riemann surface. Once the compact Riemann surface is known, and the poles position is specified on the Riemann surface, you have the Riemann-Roch theorem and which tells you (in principle) whether a function with such poles on such Riemann surface exists or not.
