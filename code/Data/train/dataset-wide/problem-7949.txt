Given the Chromatic Convergence Theorem, can we state this globally as some convergence in the category of categories? That is, we have the subcategories of finite spectra in each stable homotopy category of $E(n)$-localized spectra, say $\mathcal{L}_n^{fin}$. Is it correct that there should be "inclusion" functors $\mathcal{L}_n^{fin}\to\mathcal{L}_{n+1}^{fin}$? Can we say that if we take some kind of limit (maybe this should be phrased in terms of quasi-categories or something?) we get the homotopy category of finite spectra? 

Suppose we have four spectra: $E_1$, $E_2$, $X_1$ and $X_2$ where $X_i$ is $E_i$ local and $L_{E_1\wedge E_2}X_1\simeq L_{E_1\wedge E_2}X_2$. Of course what this really means (I think), if we're thinking in terms of model categories, is that there exists an $E_1\wedge E_2$-equivalence between $X_1$ and $X_2$. If we construct (perhaps after fibrant approximation?) the homotopy pullback of the diagram $X_1\to L_{E_1\wedge E_2}X_1\leftarrow X_2$, denoted, say, by $X^{1,2}$. Then is it true that there is an $E_1$-equivalence between $X^{1,2}$ and $X_1$ as well as an $E_2$-equivalence between $X^{1,2}$ and $X_2$, or in other words, $X^{1,2}$ localizes to $X_1$ and $X_2$ along the obvious localization functors? Feel free to make as many assumptions as you'd like, i.e. both localizations are smashing, everything is fibrant-cofibrant, some particular model of spectra, whatever. The intuition here is that the $E_1$-local stuff of $X_2$ should somehow be the same as the $E_2$-local stuff of $X_1$ and we'd like to glue along that part in some way. Forgive me if I'm messing up the details or the fundamentals (perhaps certain things should be up to homotopy or not up to homotopy, or certain things should be fibrantly or cofibrantly replaced or something). If it is clear to anyone what I am trying to say, but that person can say it in the correct formal way, please help! Thanks! 

This question has a few parts: 1) Is the Bousfield class of $\langle E\rangle$ the class of $E$-acyclics, i.e. $\langle E\rangle=\left\{ X:E\wedge X=0\right\}$ or is it the class of spectra which are Bousfield equivalent to $E$? It seems that both of these definitions are used. In either case, which is then the correct characterization of the partial ordering on the Bousfield lattice, as the former definition of Bousfield class seems amenable to reverse inclusion, but the latter does not. 2) Secondly, the following statement is made in Hovey and Palmieri's "Structure of the Bousfield Lattice" and I feel that it is probably really obvious, but that I must be missing something: Given an element of the Bousfield lattice $\langle E\rangle$ such that $\langle E\rangle <\langle H\mathbb{F}_p\rangle$ we have that $E\wedge H\mathbb{F}_p=0$ else $\langle E\rangle\geq \langle H\mathbb{F}_p\rangle$. I cannot see why this is necessarily true in general and assume it must have something to do with the nature of $H\mathbb{F}_p$ that I am missing. Can anyone help me out? I do not believe any other suppositions are made of $E$ than it is a spectrum. So perhaps (2) depends on (1) in some way. H&P say that $\langle E\rangle$ is the class of acyclics, but then how is (2) true in that case? I also believe that, definitions aside, (2) would follow if it was the case that $H\mathbb{F}_p\wedge H\mathbb{F}_p=0$ but I don't think that's true....is it? Please excuse my ignorance! 

Given a symmetric monoidal category $C$, we can construct its endomorphism operad (or multicategory) $End(C)$ whose objects are the objects of $C$, and for which the multimorphisms from $\{c_1,\ldots,c_n\}$ to $c$ are given by the hom set $Hom_C(c_1\otimes\cdots c_n,c)$. From this symmetric operad we can then produce a category of operators whose objects are finite lists of objects of $C$ and whose morphisms are described (roughly) in the following way: given two lists $\{c_1,\ldots,c_n\}$ and $\{d_1,\ldots,d_m\}$, a morphism between them is a morphism $\phi:\langle n\rangle\to\langle m\rangle$ in finite pointed sets (the category often denoted $\Gamma$ by Segal and others, and $\mathcal{F}in_\ast$ by Lurie) and for each element $i\in\langle m\rangle$ and set $\{j\in\phi^{-1}(i)\}$ a multimorphism of $End(C)$ going from $\{c_j\}$ to $d_i$. Let's denote the application of these procedures to $C$ by $End(C)^\otimes$. Essentially by construction, $End(C)^\otimes$ admits a Grothendieck opfibration to $\Gamma$, and as such, corresponds to a pseudofunctor $F_C:\Gamma\to Cat$. One might even say that this pseudofunctor defines the symmetric monoidal structure on $C$. Given a symmetric monoidal category there is a symmetric monoidal structure on $C^{op}$, so we may also consider $End(C^{op})^\otimes$. Similarly, we obtain a pseudofunctor $F_{C^{op}}:\Gamma\to Cat$. The sort of theorem I'm after is the following: 

There are a number of Grothendieck constructions: one for discrete categories, one for enriched categories (see Tamaki's paper here) and one for quasicategories (see the Unstraightening and Straightening correspondence of Lurie's Higher Topos Theory that goes between certain model categories whose underlying quasicategories are the ones of simplicial sets over a fixed simplicial set, and functors from that simplicial set to the quasicategory of quasicategories). Moreover, there is a construction that takes a simplicially enriched category whose morphism simplicial sets are Kan complexes and produces a quasicategory, namely the homotopy coherent nerve. My question is about how the coherent nerve construction interacts with the enriched Grothendieck construction and the Grothendieck construction on simplicial sets described by Lurie. Now, suppose I have a pseudofunctor from a diagram category to simplicially enriched categories $F:I\to sCat$. The enriched Grothendieck construction gives me a functor $C\to I$, where $C$ is a simplicially enriched category. We can extend this functor along the homotopy coherent nerve $hN:sCat\to sSet$, and by Proposition 3.2.5.18 of Higher Topos Theory, we know that there is a corresponding morphism $X\to N(I)$ where $X$ is a simplicial set. How does this object relate to the coherent nerve applied to $C$, i.e. the morphism of simplicial sets $N(C)\to N(I)$, where $I$ is thought of as a simplicially enriched category by thinking of its morphism sets as 0-dimensional simplicial sets? 

Or at the very least, I just want to say that if I apply the Grothendieck construction $\Gamma\overset{F_{C}}\to Cat\overset{op}\to Cat$ I get a symmetric monoidal category which is equivalent, as a symmetric monoidal category, to $C^{op}$ with the opposite symmetric monoidal structure. 

For $H$ a Hopf-algebra, an $H$-Hopf-Galois extension is a map of rings $\phi\colon\thinspace A\to B$ such that $H$ coacts on $B$ over $A$, $B\otimes_AB\cong B\otimes H$, and the cofixed points, or the primitives, of the $H$-coaction on $B$ are isomorphic to $A$, i.e. $A\cong B^{coH}$, where $B^{coH}$ is the equalizer of the coaction and the unit map of $H$ tensored up to $B$. However, I seem to be running into some situations where these properties all hold, but $B$ is not a ring. Rather, it's only a unital $A$-module, with the unit map being exactly that map I described. None of those requirements necessarily require $B$ to be a ring (I guess we'd better be careful about what category those isomorphisms live in though, so maybe you can only recover $A$ as a unital $A$-module or something). One example of this is when you've got an action of an $A_\infty$-space $G$ on an $A_\infty$-algebra $R$. Then the quotient $R/G$ is not necessarily still $A_\infty$, but by Koszul duality, it has a $BG$-coaction that you can use to recover some information about $R$. My only real question, since (I think) I'm running into this in the wild, is, does this kind of structure have a name? Additionally, does this kind of structure have any geometric interpretation? When $B$ is a ring, we can think of it as saying that we've got a principal $Spec(H)$-bundle $Spec(B)\to Spec(A)$ (when everything is noncommutative these are even sometimes called quantum principal bundles). But there doesn't seem to be any immediate geometric significance if $B$ is not a ring. 

Perhaps homology and the simplicial methods of algebraic topology (and algebraic geometry) which are just now finding applications in topological data analysis. I think algebraic geometry and topology have often been thought to be the pinnacle of math for math's sake, but their machinery is finding uses in very modern technology. Also, the theory of graphs and its applications to networks and network and systems analysis. 

In Jacob Lurie's book Higher Algebra, for an object $M$ of a monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, he constructs a category $\mathcal{C}[M]$ which can be thought of as "maps in $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $A\otimes M\to M$ with associated coherence data". $\mathcal{C}[M]$ is shown to be monoidal, and algebra objects of this category are shown to be precisely the algebras which coherently act on $M$ (though one algebra that acts on $M$ in two different ways will be thought of as two different objects of $\mathcal{C}[M]$). Moreover, he shows that if $\mathcal{C}[M]$ has a final object, which we'll denote $End(M)$, this object is an algebra object of $\mathcal{C}$ and $M$ is an object of $LMod_{End(M)}$. Thus any algebra that acts on $M$ admits a morphism to $End(M)$. I'm in particular thinking about the quasicategory of $\infty$-groupoids, $\mathcal{C}=Top$, so $M$ and $End(M)$ and everything else will just be spaces for the rest of this. We have another more down-to-earth notion of "endomorphisms of $M$." That is, the space of morphisms $Map_{Top}(M,M)$. This is a monoid object of $Top$ whose monoid structure is given by composition. Moreover there is an evaluation map $ev:Map_{Top}(M,M)\times M\to M$ so there is a corresponding object of $Top[M]$. Is this object clearly final in $Top[M]$? In other words, if $M$ is an object of the quasicategory $LMod_A$ for $A$ some loop space in $Top$, is there induced a map $A\to Map_{Top}(M,M)$? Certainly given a map of topological spaces $A\times M\to M$ one can produce, by adjunction, a map $A\to Map_{Top}(M,M)$, but it's not clear to me that this is necessarily a map of algebras or that it carries all the necessary structure (though I suspect it does). In other words this would require a more complex kind of adjunction than just the one for tensor/hom.
