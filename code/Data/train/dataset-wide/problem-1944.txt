The nature of this question is more about biological chemistry than it is about earth science. This is because gall stones have nothing to do with geology, but chemical processes in the body. Consequently, it would be inappropriate to apply geological classifications, such as igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic, to gall stones. Due to the way gall stones are formed - layers of bile coating a nucleus - they could be describes as being concretions. 

Sulphur/sulphides in coal may be one of the causes of self combustion. A slight diversion - in some metal sulphide mines, such as copper, at high level of sulphides in the ore, the sulphides can oxidize thus creating sulphide fires. If a lot of dry dust is produced during stope blasts, during the mining process, sometimes the sulphide dust can cause a secondary, unwanted, explosion. Most coal deposits contain sulphides/sulphur. Most lignite (brown coal, also low quality or low grade coal) deposits are nearer the surface, thus if lignite has lots of sulphur & it oxidizes with atmospheric oxygen combustion can occur. 

The weight that an object with a constant mass experiences on different parts of the Earth's surface will be slightly different for different locations, largely dependent on the height above sea level and the latitude. This is due to differencies in the gravitational strength on the Earth's surface at different locations. The accelation due to gravity, $g$, on Earth varies by $0.7\%$ from $9.7639$ $m/s^2$. In Kuala Lumpa (near the equator) the gravitational accelation is $9.766$ $m/s^2$, whereas in Helsinki (nearer the North Pole) it is $9.825$ $m/s^2$. The Earth is not a perfect sphere, there is a bulge around the equator. Because of this, the surface of the Earth, at the equitorial regions, is farther from the centre of gravity than the surface of the Earth at the poles. This reduces the effect of gravity at the equator. Additionally, 

Some people talk of the sun burning off the fog. All that happens is the sun warms the air to temperature greater than the dew point and the small droplets of water that condensed out of the atmosphere to produce the fog re-vaporize and can no longer be seen. 

For the atmosphere to be so cold it turns to liquid, extreme Snowball Earth conditions would exist. Any atmospheric gases that would turn into liquids would form a layer on the frozen surface of the Earth, that includes any surface rock that may be exposed and frozen water from oceans, lakes, etc. This source, gives the amount of nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere is $78.084\%$ and $20.946\%$ and the total mass of the atmosphere as ${5.148} 10^{18} kg$ respectively. From this, The mass of nitrogen in the atmosphere is $4.0198$ x $10^{18}$ $kg$ The mass of oxygen in the atmosphere is $1.0783$ x $10^{18}$ $kg$ The density of liquid nitrogen is $804$ $kg/m^3$ The density of liquid oxygen is $1140$ $kg/m^3$ Density is mass divided by volume, $\rho$ $=$ $m/v$ Using this the volume of liquid gas can be found. The volume of liquid nitrogen, from the atmosphere would be $4.0198$ x $10^{18}$/$804$ $=$ $5$ x $10^{15}$ $m^3$ $=$ $5$ x $10^{6}$ $km^3$ The volume of liquid oxygen, from the atmosphere would be $1.0783$ x $10^{18}$/$1140$ $=$ $9.459$ x $10^{14}$ $m^3$ $=$ $9.459$ x $10^{5}$ $km^3$ These liquids would lie of the surface of the frozen Earth. The surface area of the Earth is $510,072,000$ $km^2$ Thus, the height above the surface of the Earth that liquid oxygen would rise to is $9.459$ x $10^5$ / $510,072,000$ $=$ $0.001854$ $km$ $=$ $1.854$ $m$ and the height to which liquid nitrogen would rise, would be, $5$ x $10^6$ / $510,072,000$ $=$ $0.009803$ $km$ $=$ $9.803$ $m$ Because liquid oxygen would form first due to its higher boiling point, the combined height due to both nitrogen and oxygen becoming liquids would be $1.85$ + $9.80$ = $11.65$ m 

Getting figures on the amount of limestone available is difficult. Apparently "limestone makes up at least 10% of the total volume of all sedimentary rocks". One way to answer your question is by inference. Cement is manufactured from limestone. Current global production of cement is in excess of 3.27 Gt/a and by 2030 it is forecast to be approximately 4.83 Gt/a. Thus if all limestone currently earmarked for cement production were diverted to neutralizing the acidity of the world's oceans it could be done at short notice. How sustainable it would be over the 200 years required, is another matter. It also raises the question of what happens to all the industries and projects that current rely on a cheap and ready supply of cement? With much tongue in cheek, the Florida peninsular in the US is predominantly limestone, likewise a significant portion of eastern England, with the "white cliffs of Dover, the karst regions of the eastern Adriatic, southern Europe, southern and eastern Asia and the Nullabor Plain in southern Australia. Would these countries be will to sacrifice their lands to neutralize acidity in the worlds oceans? 

As with the answer to most things that involves consumption or absorption it's a question of degree, quantity and duration. Heat is energy that is being transferred. All life forms require a certain amount of heat to function and survive. Too much heat and not enough heat are detrimental to all life forms. Applying heat to food by cooking it kills most bacteria associated with the food. Likewise freezing food will initially slow life processes of bacteria and enough cold will also kill many types of bacteria. As for Earth's environment, if it does not contain enough heat, climate patterns change, ecosystems suffer and the planet freezes, as it has done on a number of occasions when it experienced ice ages. Likewise, with too much heat climate patterns change and ecosystems suffer. Earth's ecosystem requires a specific range of heat for it to be healthy. This is generally supplied by the Sun but in places can be supplied by the Earth's own geothermal systems, such as volcanic vents, particularly in oceans. Occasional extreme variations in heat can be tolerated if the difference in heat is not too extreme and if the duration of the extreme is short. Consider the detonation of a thermo-nuclear device in the atmosphere, 

Yes, tungsten carbide does have a hardness of 9, but neither it nor diamond, which has a hardness of 10, are immune to wear from friction. It's how rough diamonds get transformed into cut diamonds. From personal experience of using tungsten carbide drill bits (chisel bits, cross bit & button bits) to drill holes in rock, the tungsten carbide wears out and needs continual sharpening. The harder the rock being drilled, the faster the rate of wear. Eventually each drill bit wears out & becomes so narrow that it can no longer be used and it must be replaced. Also, anyone who has had involvement with diamond drilling will confirm that diamond drill bits wear out when they drill rock. The deepest holes ever drilled only go to a depth of just over 12 km. Those holes being the Kola Superdeep borehole, Al Shaeen oil hole and Sakhalin-1. In trying to reach the Earth's core, the hole will deviate and not be dead straight and the drill bits and drill steels will need to deal with high lateral earth pressures at depth and increasingly high rock temperatures. Additionally, tungsten carbide is had but brittle so it's uses are limited. No-one yet has the technology to drill a hole into the Earth's mantle, let alone its core. 

Your idea has merit. Shale is classified by geologists as being a mudstone. It is composed of silt and clay sized minerals. According to this geology website, shales can be crushed to produce a clay and then mixed with water. These days, items that were once made from natural clay, such as terracotta pots and tiles for roofs, are now made from crushed shale. 

Edit Having thought about this some more, something similar to what you are proposing has already been done in Egypt, when the Suez Canal was completed and opened in 1869. Within the canal system is Great Bitter Lake, which is a sea water lake. The presence of such a body of water for nearly 150 years has not increased the amount of moisture in the vicinity of the lake that would allow lush vegetation to grow. 

The first thing to consider is, if it is not the adjacent coal mine, what other nearby sources could produce such a result. Is there a coal fired power station or a factory nearby. If there are no other likely sources then the coal mine is still the most likely candidate as the source of the dust and metal contaminants. The other thing to consider is how is the coal being mined in the open pit and how is dust being generated by the coal mine. The most likely method of mining the coal would require the use of explosives and blasting. This can create large clouds of dust that can be high and wide. If the wind was not blowing when a blast occurred the dust may have reached your sensors. If the coal is mined by mechanical cutting techniques dust will still be generated, but not in the same quantities as blasting produces. The other ways dust is generated is by vehicles travelling on unsealed roads - the tyres of the vehicle churn up the dust on the roads. Dust can also be blown from trucks loaded with coal or from conveyor belts conveying coal to a dump site. The loading of trucks will also generate dust, as will the dumping of coal. From experience, the only way to control dust is to constantly spray with water. Do you know if the mine uses any for of dust suppression? It is well known that coal contains all types of contaminants, including metals such as cadmium and mercury. Different deposits have different types and degrees of contaminants. From what you have presented, the coal mine is the most likely source of the dust and metal contamination. 

What would you have an Antarctic rover do? How would you protect it from falling down a crevasse, some of which are totally obscured? What would you like to be found in Antarctica? Yes, Antarctica is a large snow and ice covered island. The ice being up to 4500 m thick. The analysis of Antarctic ice cores is allowing scientists to discover the composition of the Earth's atmosphere going back millions of years. There are nearly 400 sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica, Lake Vostok being the largest. The lake sediments of such lakes have yielded evidence of diverse life forms going back hundreds of thousands of years. Antarctica has mountain ranges and even 138 volcanoes. Mt Erebus being the one that is best known and is still active. Much of the exploration of Antarctica involves discovering what is beneath the ice, not so much what is on top of it. 

There are many issues I have with your suggestion. How would you distinguish the radiation that your source would emit from other sources of radiation? Also how would you detect the radiation? Where would you place the radiation detector? A detector placed on the surface of the Earth would not detect any radiation from the Mantle because the Crust would absorb the radiation, due to its thickness. Any device that would be placed in a pool of magma would most likely be melted by the heat of the magma. If the shell of the device managed to survive, the electronics and sensors would be damaged to the point of being inoperable. If a device were to survive the heat how would the device send signals to the surface of the Earth? Extreme ultra low frequency radio might work, but the source signal would need to be very strong and I don't envisage that being possible for a device dropped into a volcano. Getting a device to sink into magma would require the device to have a density higher than that of the magma. Drilling very deep holes to conduct a seismological survey of mantle magma is not possible given that the deepest hole ever drilled was the Kola Superdeep Borehole, drilled by the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s. Its final depth was 12 262 metres - one-third of the way through the Baltic continental crust. Drilling was terminated short of the 15 000 metre target due to the rock temperature being 180 degrees Celsius. Using electric potential variations within magma to study magma within the mantle would not be possible because the technique requires an antenna to be place in a drilled hole. 

Two sites in Australia, at opposite ends of the continent, that have such fossils are Cable Beach in Broome, Western Australia (in the north west of the Australia) and Dinosaur Cove, in Victoria (in the south east of Australia). The fossils in Broome can only be seen at low tide and are of dinosaur footprints from the Cretaceous period, about 130 million years ago. Dinosaur Cove has yielded bones that lead to the discovery of hypsilophodontid-like dinosaurs as Leaellynasaura amicagraphica and Atlascopcosaurus loadsi, and a Coelurosaur, as well as fragments of what may be a caenagnathid (relatives of the Oviraptors) Other information can be obtained from: 

This question would probably be better suited to engineering or electronic/electrical engineering. My guess is that the breadboard will be used to test potential electronic circuits & being for ESA, possibly electronic circuits for satellites or probes. Breadboards can be used to test different connection geometries of electronic components. These would need to be optimized for weight & energy consumption, particularly if they are to be launched into outer space. Software (algorithms) exist where this can be done using a virtual breadboard rather than a physical one 

Your maths is not detailed, but you have the correct answer. The Earth rotates at 15 degrees per hour (360 degrees/24 hours). The time required to rotate 10 degrees is 10/15 = 0.666 hours, which is 40 minutes. 

For water to lose heat time is required. By changing the albedo of the ocean just prior to a hurricane/cyclone/typhoon passing over a section of water will not give the water enough time to cool down to have any significant effect. If it were possible to change the temperature of water to minimize the strength of hurricanes/typhoons/cyclones, large sections of ocean would need to have their albedos changed for a long period of time. 

I'm not sure why you are including shale in your question, unless you are referring to carbonaceous shale, which in not coal, but shale with carbon throughout the matrix of the shale. Shale is an argillaceous rock, and argillaceous rocks are "detrital sedimentary rocks" [1]. They are composed of clays and the bedding plane within the shales is "due to the orientation of the clay minerals" [1]. Clearly a sedimentary rock. Coal however, as you state in your question is derived from organic material - vegetation. The deposition of the vegetation material is analogous to the deposition of minerals that formed sedimentary rocks. Both materials, vegetation and minerals, were transported to a location. In the case of minerals the transportation may have been a long or short distance and carried out by wind, water or gravity (mudslides). Vegetation tends to travel shorter distances than minerals but like the minerals it has traveled and it accumulates. Over time the vegetation compacts, is heated, undergoes chemical reactions and experiences a very slow form of metamorphosis and petrification. Being composed of carbon, coal forms a carbonaceous deposit. Having been transported and accumulated in a single deposit it is sedimentary. Having undergone metamorphosis and petrification it is a rock. Consequently it is reasonable to classify coal as a carbonaceous sedimentary rock. [1] D. G. A Whitten with J. R. V.
