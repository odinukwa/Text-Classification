Since this is the best I can find, I'm posting it here as an answer, but by all means if someone else finds more details post that up. 

This is from the wikipedia entry on the plumbing and piping context of the word Nipple as suggested by Daniel R. Hicks' comment. Can anyone elaborate on the etymology of this, or why this term for short pieces of pipe was used for spoke ends (perhaps proper piping nipples were used in the past)? 

If you're confining this to city/urban riding only, that's fair - I just wanted to give some rationale behind the opposing view in certain situations (sorry I don't have any statistics). However, the statistics I see and safety guidelines seem to be from a densely populated/urban point of view. 

Let: n = number of teeth L = chain pitch (link length) (12.7mm for most bicycles) See below for valley, roller top, and tooth top measurements. Note that tooth tops can vary between manufacturers and will vary throughout the life of the ring. The alternate method at the bottom is probably the easiest method to use for frame clearance. Since you know the pitch of the chain (1/2" or 12.7mm is a 40 series chain typically used on a bicycle), the chain-pins will form a regular n-gon (a polygon with n-sides of equal length), with each side being equal to 12.7mm. The formula for the perimeter of this n-gon is rather simple (below) and would be fine for most approximations. Note that this is also equal to the chain length that would be wrapped around the ring (the chain would follow the n-gon, not the circle). Perimeter of n-gon made by pin centers Perimeter of n-gon = L * n = 12.7 * n mm However, this is not entirely accurate to describe the circle through the pin centers. The more accurate formulas are below: Circle through pin centers circumference = pi * L / (sin (180 / n)) = 39.8982 / (sin (180 / n)) mm radius = L / (2 sin (180 / n)) = 6.35 / sin (180 / n) mm = 'pcRad' (pin center radius) diameter = L / sin (180 / n) = 12.7 / sin (180 / n) mm = 'pcD' (pin center diameter) Now, we will need additional information to describe the two related circles / n-gons: For the valley floors and roller tops, we need to know the radius or diameter of the chain roller around the pin. According to $URL$ a 40 series chain has a roller-diameter of 0.312" (7.92mm). Since the distance from pin-center to the bottom of the valley is the radius of the roller: Circle / n-gon about valley floors rRad = roller radius (3.96 mm for most bicycles) Perimeter of n-gon of valley floors = 2 * n * (pcRad - rRad) * sin (180 / n) = 2n * (pcRad - 3.96) * sin (180 / n) mm floorRadius = pcRad - rRad = pcRad - 3.96 mm floorDiameter = 2 * fRad = pcD - 2 * rRad = pcD - 7.92 mm Circle / n-gon of the tops of the chain rollers Perimeter of n-gon of roller tops = 2 * n * (pcRad + rRad) * sin (180 / n) = 2n * (pcRad + 3.96) * sin (180 / n) mm rollerTopRadius = pcRad + rRad = pcRad + 3.96 mm rollerTopDiameter = 2 * rtRad = pcD + 2 * rRad = pcD + 7.92 mm rollerTopCircumference = pi * rtD = pi * (pcD + 2 * rRad) = pi * (pcD + 7.92) mm Now, for the final circle / n-gon to describe, we need the tooth height above the pin centers. I would expect this to be positive on a new chain ring and negative on a worn one: Circle / n-gon of the tooth tips t = tooth tip height above pin centers (negative if below) Perimeter of n-gon of tooth tips = 2 * n * (pcRad + t) * sin (180 / n) tipRadius = pcRad + t tipDiameter = 2 * tRad = pcD + 2 * t tipCircumference = pi * tD = pi * (pcD + 2 * t) Alternatively, to make this computation a bit easier (yet slightly less accurate on a worn chain ring), you can measure your own individual tooth spacing. Ideally they would be slightly longer than the chain pitch, but that will change as the chain wears: Circle / n-gon of the tooth tips - Alternate tSpacing = average distance between tooth tips Perimeter of n-gon of tooth tips = n * tSpacing tipRadius = tSpacing / (2 sin (180 / n)) tipDiameter = 2 * tRad = tSpacing / sin (180 / n) tipCircumference = pi * tD = pi * tSpacing / (sin (180 / n)) 

Is it conceivable that you could practice this and be proficient enough that you would rarely crash, if ever, when bunnyhopping up a curb? Absolutely! I'm sure Danny Mcaskill could do this all day long. 

I use a sort of wave, raising my hand but with no movement in it (so not a 'Hey buddy' or 'I need help' side to side movement).... it works on my bicycle, on my motorcycle, and while driving a vehicle. It's got somewhat of a dual purpose: acknowledgement that I did something wrong, and/or 'thanks for letting me in' gratitude gesture. This is the same gesture I seem to get from many other people. There's no side/side or waving motion (would be more like "Hi!"), just a hand up, fingers together, "Thanks/Sorry". 

I have been searching for a while, and I cannot find any information on my rear u-brake. It has served me well for many years (10+), and has a surprising amount of force. It's stronger than any cantilever and most V-brakes I've ever used or felt. Adjusted for maximum power, it has crushed a few single walled rims for me, so I usually adjust it off peak for the sake of my rims (though it would probably be fine with dual walled ones). This isn't to say it's phenomenal, it's difficult to get wide tires through it, and if it's not adjusted properly it will hit the knobbies on large tires. I have searched every millimeter of it for any markings or lettering, and it is devoid of any. If anyone has seen one like this, or can identify the brand or model, I'd like to know more about the company, the design, and the specifications. Unidentified U-Brake 

Basically what I'm really asking here is, can I use it like grease in my hubs, bottom bracket, and headset? It doesn't really harden, and is rather lubricative, so what would happen? Nickel Anti-Seize Data Sheet: .pdf 

I'm looking to adapt my 160mm post mount front fork to accept a 180mm rotor. As I'm looking between adapters, I find them falling into two very distinct categories, and I'm wondering if there are any trade offs or reasons for preferring one style over the other. The first style bolts to the 160mm post mounts with separate standard length bolts, then juts out farther and drops down to accept the brake with standard length bolts. 

Hub Width On road, mountain, and hybrid, the front hubs are 100mm in width. On road bicycles the rear is typically 130mm, where on a MTB it is typically 135mm. Measure this from your old hub, and DON'T stretch/force a different hub width. Wheel (Rim) Diameter The most typical road rim is a 700c which will mean the bead seat diameter of the rim is 622mm, and the typical mountain bicycle will either have 26" (559mm BSD), 29" (622mm), or one of each. There are many non-typical sizes, however, so see Sheldon Brown's Tire Sizing Page. While some of this is rim sizing, it's the overall wheel size that matters - note that 29" MTB and 700c rims have the same BSD, but are unlikely to work well or fit at all (without serious brake modifications, to say the least). If you want to see what various rim/tire combinations look like visually to compare them to your current setup, you can pick various ones (and see the resulting measurements in mm) on a site I built. Brake Compatibility You're either going to have rim brakes, which require rims specifically made with a braking surface and additional strengthening in that area (read: a bit heavier), or disc brakes which require a hub that can accept a disc rotor (and matching disc mounts on the frame and/or fork). For best results, if you have rim brakes and don't plan to upgrade, get a non-disc hub and rim brake designed rim, and if you have disc brakes then get disc compatible hubs and rims without a braking surface (disc brake rims). This will lessen the additional (unused) weight and likely shave off some cost as well, but it is possible to have a rim brake rim with a disc hub. With some road-style (caliper) brakes, you may have to adjust or even replace the brakes if you vary too far from their rim/tire clearance capabilities, so for best results stay somewhat close to what you had (or have the possibility of replacing brakes as well). V-Brakes, cantilever, and disc brakes are more forgiving on rim/tire size variances. Tire Width This is the most tricky part on a hybrid, as their tires (and thus rims) are typically somewhere between a MTB (1.8", 1.9", 2.0", 2.1", 2.3" being common) and a road bike (18mm, 20mm, 23mm, 25mm and 28mm being common). You'll need to use a caliper where the tire fits through the forks and frame to get a handle on your maximum size (allowing for some clearance) and then selecting a desired tire width up to that maximum. Rim Width This needs to match the desired / compatible tire width, see below (from Sheldon Brown's site). 

The problem that you'll likely run into is the stop in the lever/shifter ends. I'm not aware of any systems that will accept bare cable at this end: Cable Ends $URL$ If you wanted to pair your spool of wire with some sort of crimper (or go all out with some sort of mold/press), you could make your own - but investing $3,000 - $30,000 on some machine that melts metal on the end of the cables probably isn't worth your while. I don't have much experience with bike shops (I buy most everything on eBay), but I would think they have boxes of these cables packaged in bulk like this: Bulk Cables $URL$ 

The main issue with what you're talking about is that from a mathematical perspective, 'average' already has a strict meaning, and in this context nearly always means 'arithmetic mean'. 

Resolution: I ordered the 6061-T6 aluminum, and compared it with an aluminum steer tube and I clearly saw the internal difference of the butting. I would have also needed to lathe a groove into the tubing for the shims that surround it for the fork. Luckily, however, I found someone at a LBS that had some Anti-Gravs in back and sold me a steel threadless steer tube ready to rock for it, so I've abandoned the aluminum retrofit. It does look that in this case, because of the surrounding shims, I could have pressed/hammered some 0.995" OD steel tubing up the bottom of it (like they did on the steel ones) and been fine. On a side note, I really appreciate this design. I realize that it may be some extra weight to have the two bolts, but given the pain in the ass of having too short a steer tube in a threadless system, making fork swaps painful, I would gladly take the weight hit for the ability to replace the steerer tube only, not half the fork. The Anti-Gravity forks accommodated both 1 1/8" threaded and threadless, and 1 1/4" systems with this design (and possibly 1" systems as well). Outdated, but I appreciate their thinking! 

There's no 'official' standard, as mentioned in the comments. However, in a crude sense, I'd call them 'road frames.' 

I'm finding pump specifications quite difficult to find (I need piston diameter and stroke length), but here's a comparison of some shock pumps on an empty shock cylinder of a 2007 Fox 36 RLC 160mm Fork.
