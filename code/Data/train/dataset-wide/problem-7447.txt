As a starting point for online sources for those of us without a thing called library nearby I recommend Rehmann's list. BTW I think that Furtwängler's name is missing from your list; he proved the existence and all the main properties of Hilbert class fields between 1902 and ca 1910. Finally, the letters between Hasse and Artin, along with quite a lot of comments, are available here (as a free pdf file; unfortunately it is in German). 

Since these definitions involve ideals rather than ideles my guess is that the most simple proof of the equivalence of these definitions uses the classical approach. This approach in turn uses analytic tools, and for these tools sets of prime ideals with density $0$ are invisible. Thus in the classical theory, which is based on Takagi's definition, the equivalence with Weber's definition for all ideals (and not just all except for a set of density $0$) is proved after all the main theorems. What is clear from the definitions is that if $K/F$ is a Takagi-Hilbert class field, then each prime ideal that splits completely in $K/F$ must be principal. The proof that in a Takagi-Hilbert class field exactly the princiapal primes split completely up to a set of exceptions with density $0$ may be accomplished using analytic tools and should not be too difficult. It is also clear that an Artin-Hilbert class field is a Weber-Hilbert class fields, since prime ideals have trivial Artin symbol if and only if they split completely. For proving the converse you have to show that a Weber-Hilbert class field is abelian. Arnold Scholz ( Zur Klassenkörpertheorie auf Takagischer Grundlage, Math. Z. 30 (1929), 332--356) has shown that Takagi-Hilbert class fields must be abelian, and perhaps this proof may be transferred to Weber-Hilbert class fields. You will get a proof that Takagi-Hilbert class fields are Weber-Hilbert class fields by taking the classical approach to class field theory based on Takagi's definition and following the proof up to the decomposition law, restricting everything to unramified extensions (which simplifies a few things, but not dramatically). If anyone has a better idea, I'm all ears. Addition. It is of course also possible to define the Hilbert class field $H$ of a number field $K$ as the maximal abelian unramified extension of $K$. A naive idea for showing that exactly the principal prime ideals split completely in $H/K$ would be trying to prove this in its cyclic subextensions; but this is bound to fail: if $K$ has class group of type $(2,2)$, then the prime ideals from a class of order $2$ remain inert in two of the three quadratic unramified extensions. Thus for proving the decomposition law you will have to use the maximality condition, which brings me to the first question: Is there a simple proof that the maximal abelian unramified extension of a number field is finite? If one could generalize Hilbert's Satz 94 to noncyclic extensions I would guess that the answer to this question is yes. The main ingredients of such a proof certainly would be Dirichlet's unit theorem (finite generation of the unit group) and the finiteness of the class number. Or is there a different way of linking unramified abelian extensions to the class group? The classical proof of the finiteness of the Hilbert class field runs as follows. Let $L/K$ be a cyclic unramified extension, and consider the index $$ h_{L/K} = (D_K : ND_L \cdot P_K). $$ Using elementary transformations and the ambiguous class number formula (essentially the Herbrand unit index calculation) this can be shown to equal $$ h_{L/K} = (L:K) (E_K : E_K \cap NL^\times) (Cl(L)[N] : Cl(L)^{1-\sigma}), $$ where $\sigma$ generates the Galois group of $L/K$. By the first inequality (a consequence of the fact that the Dedekind zeta function has a pole of order $1$ at $s = 1$) we must have $h_{L/K} \le (L:K)$ for all cyclic unramified extensions, from which we conclude that $h_{L/K} = (L:K)$, and that $$(E_K : E_K \cap NL^\times) = (Cl(L)[N] : Cl(L)^{1-\sigma}) = 1$$ for all cyclic unramified extensions $L/K$. From here it is not difficult to prove that $h_{L/K} = (L:K)$ holds for all abelian unramified extensions. This in turn proves that $(L:K) = h_{L/K} \le h_K$ for any abelian unramified extension. I do not think that this inequality is sufficient for getting hold of the decomposition law. If the maximal unramified abelian extension of $K$ has degree $< h_K$ then you are in trouble. If, for example, ${\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-5})$ were its own Hilbert class field, all ideals would split in $H/K$, not just the principal ones. Thus I fear that for proving the decomposition law you actually need the existence of an unramified abelian extension of degree $h_K$. If this is true, then I guess that there really is no simple proof of the decomposition law: the existence theorem in class field theory is a technical tour de force even (and perhaps even more so) if you restrict your attention to unramified extensions. 

There is no cube that can be divided into two cubes. There is only one square number which, augmented by $2$, makes a cube, namely $25$. There are only two square numbers which, augmented by $4$, make a cube, namely $4$ and $121$. All squared powers of $2$ augmented by $1$ are prime numbers. 

Let $K$ be a number field, $Z_K$ its ring of integers, and $p$ a rational prime number. Then $A_p = Z_K/(p)$ is a finite ${\mathbb F}_p$-algebra. Using ideal arithmetic in $Z_K$ and the Chinese remainder theorem it is easily checked that $A_p$ is the direct sum of finite fields if $p$ is unramified, and has additonal nil-rings as components if $p$ is ramified. This decomposition result looks simple enough to have a direct and not too complicated proof. Basing it on the close relation between $A_p$ and ${\mathbb F}_p[X]/(f)$, where $f$ is the minimal polynomial of a generator of $K$, brings in problems with primes dividing the discriminant of $f$. Thus let me state my main question explicitly: Is there a simple proof that $A_p$ is a direct sum of finite fields and some easily described nil rings? In addition, I'd be grateful for pointers to the relevant literature, in particular to classification theorems of which the result above is a special case. 

Let $D_n$ be the minimal absolute value of the discriminants of number fields with degree $n$. Arnold Scholz conjectured in 1936 that $D_{397} > D_{400}$, which is, of course, still open (Scholz had constructed a field with degree $400$ and "small" discriminant by taking the Hilbert class field of the field of $55$-th roots of unity). But are there any chances of finding an integer $n$ such that $D_n > D_{n+1}$? Are there reasons to believe that Odlyzko's lower bounds can be improved for prime values of the degree? What about the corresponding question for the root discriminants $E_n = D_n^{1/n}$? I would be grateful for any suitable reference or heuristic argument. 

Cauchy and Jacobi proved that for a prime ideal ${\mathfrak p}$ in a complex quadratic number field with prime discriminant, the h-th power of ${\mathfrak p}$ (with $h$ as in your question) is principal. Their technique was what we nowadays know as the Stickelberger ideal. You should find references in Ireland-Rosen. Venkov, in the 1920s, gave an arithmetic proof of a large part of Dirichlet's class number formulas based on Gauss's work on ternary quadratic forms and the arithmetic of quaternions. There are modern accounts floating around, and I remember the names Rehm and Shemanske in this connection (if google doesn't help, I'll provide you with references when I'm back from the holidays -). This approach is probably more involved than Dirichlet's, so I don't know whether it explains anything. 

The genus class field of an extension $K/F$ is defined to be the largest extension $L/K$ with the following properties: 

A very classical introduction is Swinnerton-Dyer's Analytic theory of abelian varieties (London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series 14). Another good place to start is M. Schlichenmaier, An introduction to Riemann surfaces, algebraic curves and moduli spaces, Theoretical and Mathematical Physics, Springer-Verlag 2007 (2nd ed.) 

If you had a fast method for solving Pell equations $x^2 - dy^2 =1$, you can factor numbers $N$ quickly: all you have to do is compute gcd$(x-1,d)$ for $d = N, 2N, 3N, \ldots$ until you find a factor; if the factor is not prime, repeat the procedure. Schoof showed that you don't have to know the actual solution of the Pell equation, but that the size of the regulator is sufficient. His method uses Shanks' idea of infrastructure (see e.g. Jacobson and Williams, Solving the Pell Equation). By computing an ambiguous ideal (if the norm of the fundamental unit is positive) he can then factor $d = N$; if the ambiguous ideal is trivial, do the same for $d = 3N$ etc. Of course you cannot expect to factor Fermat numbers by simply writing down a solution of the corresponding Pell equation. In the early days of factoring in the 1970s, Brillhart and Morrison suggested using small multiples of $N$ if the period of the continued fraction of $\sqrt{N}$ is too small - this hasn't changed.
