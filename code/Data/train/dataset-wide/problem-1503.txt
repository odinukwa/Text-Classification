Again, because of the elliptical orbit of the Moon, the length of totality or annularity still can vary. Even during a single eclipse, the length of totality depends on your exact location on Earth. Your exact location determines your exact distance from the moon during the eclipse, which will vary depending on whether the Moon is getting closer/farther and how fast. There are formulas for calculating this, but I'm sure they are quite complicated even with the moon orbiting over the equator and with Earth having no axial tilt. 

With respect to the Sun, the Earth rotates once every 24 hours. But because the Sun's apparent position changes in the sky due to Earth's revolution around the Sun, the Earth rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds with respect to the stars. Because of this 3 minutes, 56 seconds difference, all stars rise and set 3 minutes, 56 seconds earlier each succeeding day. This applies to the time of a star passing through the meridian as well. So, on the next day, April 29, Arcturus will pass the meridian at 22:56:04. 

You just found the difference between the sidereal year and the tropical year, and that was no coincidence. Addition The number of sidereal months in a sidereal year is one more than the number of synodic months in a sidereal year. That is because the Earth goes around the Sun once of year (of course), leading to one less synodic month than sidereal month. Here, $P_{syn}$ is the synodic period and $P_{sid}$ is the sidereal period, and $Y_{sid}$ is the sidereal year, all in days. $$\frac{Y_{sid}}{P_{sid}} = \frac{Y_{sid}}{P_{syn}} + 1$$ Dividing both sides by $Y_{sid}$ yields: $$\frac{1}{P_{sid}} = \frac{1}{P_{syn}} + \frac{1}{Y_{sid}}$$ Solving for $Y_{sid}$... $$\frac{1}{P_{sid}} - \frac{1}{P_{syn}} = \frac{1}{Y_{sid}}$$ or $$P_{sid}^{-1} - P_{syn}^{-1} = \frac{1}{Y_{sid}}$$ Multiplying both sides by $Y_{sid}$ and dividing both sides by $P_{sid}^{-1} - P_{syn}^{-1}$ yields $$Y_{sid} = \frac{1}{P_{sid}^{-1} - P_{syn}^{-1}}$$ 

A quasar is a type of AGN. Its main property is that it's galaxy axis points towards the earth and this way we receive its light and radio signals. That's why they are one of the most energetic AGN. Here you can see a relation of all the AGN types: $URL$ 

Exactly. Seasons and its difference between northern and southern hemisphere are caused due to the tilt of the Earth's axis. But this is not the only thing involved. An other important fact is the orbit's eccentricity: a very eccentric orbit would cause a whole planet "summer" when around the perihelion and a whole planet "winter" near the aphelion. There would be also extreme permanent hot zones near the equator and extreme permanent cold zones at poles. 

We could compare a big star to a small one like a Formula 1 car to a simple car: the F1 is faster, but it runs out of fuel earlier. 

Referring to your #gravity tag this would only create a peak in the planets tidal forces. But this would be a visible effect in case the planets would be big and close enough... Last night happened that with Sun-Earth-Moon although they were not aligned as you say. To sum up: a proper alignment would increase the effect of tidal forces. 

Use Stellarium. You can set your location and date as needed and simulate all the conditions (ignoring weather...) :) $URL$ 

The Sun will never run out of Hydrogen. This is a common misconception. At this moment the Sun is fusing Hydrogen into Helium. This fused Helium remains at the core until it will reach a critical mass. At this point the core will begin to collapse. This collapse increases the temperature and pressure around the core where Hydrogen is being fused causing the increase the Hydrogen fusion which also causes an increase of the radiation pressure making the outer layers to expand and cool. Once the core reaches a temperature of about 100 million Kelvin Helium fusion starts dramatically (Helium Flash) with high radiation pressure in the core. Here is where the Sun will reach 250 times it's current radius. When the Helium fusion stabilizes the radiation pressure at the cores decreases making the Sun's radius to shrink. The temperature will only drop at the surface because as it's expands it's further from the core. 

For the same reason as (1), the path of totality would vary from a maximum amount down to nothing. For annular eclipses there would be a similar path of annularity instead. But whichever path it is would always be centered on the equator. 

They could time the transit, which would last hours, with great precision. But they had to wait until the next transit of Venus in 1761. Then, observers observed the black drop effect, which made it very hard to time the event from start to finish precisely. 

Generally not correct. Solar time is based on the average time it takes for the sun to cross the meridian (24 hours), and sidereal time is based on the time it takes for a star to cross the meridian. Sidereal time counts 24 "hours" in 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds, meaning that it runs slightly faster than our normal solar time. There is one day in which solar and sidereal time are 12 hours off, on the northward equinox in March. The Sun is on the northward equinox, but solar time is measured since midnight where sidereal time is measured since passing the meridian (local noon). There is one day in which solar and sidereal time coincide, on the southward equinox in September. The Sun is on the southward equinox, 180 degrees in the sky from the northward equinox, so the 12 hours off from midnight and the Sun being 12 hours off from the northward equinox cancel. 

Incorrect. Even if the Earth had no axial tilt and the Moon had an equatorial orbit, that doesn't mean that every new moon would be a total solar eclipse. Yes, the moon would always generate some kind of an eclipse at every new moon, but it's orbit shape hasn't changed -- it's still an ellipse. It's further at some points in its orbit and closer at others. When it's further away at new moon, it appears smaller than the sun in the sky, making an annular (ring) eclipse, not a total eclipse. 

I don't know any specific text but I can recommend you a course I took last year at Coursera.org. It says "introduction" but I can assure you it is really complete, 12 week that include a lot of mathematics and physics. $URL$ 

It would be detectable due to its gravity effect on other planets, comets and the Sun. Check these sites for further info: $URL$ $URL$ 

As you said in your question we only know about Black Holes creating in Super Novae, which lead to relatively big BH. The reason they can't be smaller in these cases it that they are created when the core of the star reaches a critical mass that overflows both the electron and the neutron degeneracy. Lower masses can be hold by those degenerate mass states and won't collapse any further. Theoretically BH with masses less than the solar one could exists if there was some method capable to compress it's mass reaching radii smaller than their Schwarzschild radius. 

I can't give you an explicit ant mathematical explanation but maybe this simulations give you a hint. If you look at the bottom one with beta=0.01 (faster initial rotation speed) you will see how possibly a binary or even ternary system is formed. I guess this could be picked as an example for planetary formation. $URL$ 

The Tidal acceleration between 2 bodies is calculated with this formula: $$ a_T = \frac{2GM_MR_1}{Dm^3} $$ Where $M_M$ is Mar's mass, $R_1$ Earth Radius and $D_m$ the distance to the Moon. If you equal this to Moon's Tidal acceleration you will get $D_M$ as distance to Mars to get the same Tidal acceleration having $\frac{M_M}{M_m}=8.73328184501$: $$ D_M = \sqrt[3]{8.73}D_m\simeq2.06Dm $$ 

Any bacteria present in a meteor would not necessarily burn. According to the Bad Astronomer's "Bad Addendum" to another unrelated point, "A Meteoric Rise", meteors sure do get extremely hot, but that outside part usually ablates away, leaving the inner part that was extremely cold for who knows how long, which may not have warmed up much during the fall. 

Using the Earth-Moon distance and the separation of the Moon from the Sun in the sky when the Moon was at exactly half-phase, Aristarchus calculated the Earth-Sun distance. 

But then there was the transit of 1769. Observations in Norway and in the Hudson Bay were made for the northern observations, and Captain James Cook was sent to what is now Tahiti to make a southerly observation. Jérôme Lalande compiled the figures and calculated a solar parallax of 8.6 arc-seconds, close to the modern figure of about 8.794 arc-seconds. That calculation yielded the first fairly accurate calculation of the Earth-Sun distance, of 24,000 Earth radii, which given the Earth's radius of 6,371 km, about 153,000,000 km, the accepted value being about 149,600,000 km. 

The average angular diameter of the Moon, as seen from the Earth, is about 31 arcminutes. The angular diameter depends on the distance between the two objects and the diameter of the object being viewed. Specifically, for small angles, it is the diameter divided by the distance. When the distance is the same, the angular size is proportional to the diameter. The distance remains the same when viewing the Earth from the Moon, but the Earth is larger. According to NASA, the diameter of the Moon is 3,476 km, and the diameter of the Earth is 12,756 km. So, because it's proportional, the angular diameter can be calculated as follows: $a_{Earth} = a_{Moon} \times {d_{Earth}\over d_{Moon}}$ $ = 31 arcminutes \times {12,756 km \over 3,476 km}$ $ \approx 114 arcminutes$, or just under 2 degrees. This is approximate, because not only is this valid only for small degrees, where the tangent of an angle can be approximated by the angle itself (in radians), the Earth-Moon distance varies because the Moon's orbit around the Earth is an ellipse. 

The deepest we look into the space the further in the past we look. So if we take pictures of galaxies that are 10 billion ly away we see them as they were 10 billion years ago. 

This picture was taken by the WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) space telescope. It is in deed an infrared picture of the entire universe but what you see in this line is our home galaxy, the Milky Way. This telescope has taken infrared pictures of the entire Universe (as we see from the Earth) and joined them in this full-sky view. More info: $URL$ 

It all starts in a molecular cloud, which are clouds in space with high densities. They can contain all kind of gases and dust and also due to their densities and relatively low temperatures they also contain molecules like H2, CO2 and H2O. These are in a thermodynamic equilibrium until something disturbs them (usually nearby supernovae). For some reason a zone of this cloud becomes more dense and gravity wins to and starts to collapse the could until it forms a star. Theses molecular clouds can be the remains of dead stars or simply a bunch of gas and dust collected and hold at the high density zones at the galaxies spiral arms or arround the core. 

The amount and kind of gases a body can trap depends on the object's surface temperature, and its density & radius (which refers to it's gravity). An object with high gravity and low surface temperature will be able to hold more gases in it's atmosphere. In the case of the Moon, due to its low gravity it could barely trap an atmosphere of Xenon. 

Over the course of an entire year, about 365 days and 6 hours, these 3 minutes and 56 seconds adds up to an entire day, so that exactly one year later, the same star will pass through the meridian at the same time of day. For Arcturus to pass the meridian exactly 22 hours earlier, it should be 22/24 of a year before then, or about 335 days later, or about 30 days earlier, or March 29. 

This American Meteor Society resource seems also to indicate that meteorites can fall to the ground without being extremely hot. 

Basically, Huygens used good methods, except for using "numerology and mysticism" to determine the size of Venus. He was lucky that Venus was almost the size of Earth; that made his estimate for the AU pretty close. Not long after, Cassini used the parallax of Mars to determine the AU. (Same article as linked above.) 

Generally, the closer you are to the equator, the more the sun would be covered. But this would vary slightly depending on the distance of the Moon from the Earth, and it wouldn't depend solely on your latitude. As Gerald points out, the moon's shadow, in which you would see a total solar eclipse, is cone-shaped. Different points on the Earth close to the equator would experience a different cross-section of the cone, which may be narrower or wider depending on your exact location. Where the eclipse is partial, the apparent size of the moon would control how much of the Sun is covered. A further-away moon would appear smaller in the sky and thus cover less of the Sun. Close to the borderline where the Moon appears to graze the Sun, the Moon may miss the Sun entirely if it's far enough and it appears small enough. 

You can check this thanks to this amazing plot: $URL$ But this is not all you need to hold an stable atmosphere like the Earth does. The object will also need some protection against the solar wind. In the Earth we have a magnetic field that prevents the solar wind to reach our atmosphere, but in the case of Mars it has a weak and poor magnetic field to defend itself against the solar wind that rips it's atmosphere. 

Yes, and not only from space but from the Earth surface too. Stars emit in almost all wavelengths depending on their surface temperatures. The hotter the star is the shorter (higher energy) wavelengths it'll emit. You can try this simulator to check this: $URL$ 

To calculate that you will have to build a 3D model based upon the distance of each of their stars and then calculate the resulting 3D object's volume. I know this may not answer the question, but I give the way to answering it. It's not an easy job. Making a quick guess based upon the distances of the stars of both constellations in my opinion I guess the Small Dipper has a bigger volume since it's starts have bigger distance differences ranging from < 100 ly up to > 500 ly. In the case of the Big Dipper all distance are very similar since all stars come from the same open cluster. Their distance range between 78 and 124 ly. Source: 

This is the classic misconception about the expansion of the Universe: there is no center of the Universe. The whole universe expands as one, not from a single point nowhere. Knowing this it makes no sense speaking of the direction of an object due to the Universe. You could compare the directions of two objects in it though. Therefore star's direction depend on where and how they where created and also the interaction with other stars and their home galaxy.
