In a previous version of my answer, I wasn't careful in how I thought about and explained these ideas and I have clarified a few ideas in my head since then which hopefully translates to a clarified answer. Now to answer your question: We have an urn with 60 balls. We are uncertain about the number of black balls and yellow balls in this urn. Imagine we present this urn with the above specified lotteries to an individual (with a monotonic utility function $u$) and ask them to choose between $L_{A'}$ and $L_{B'}$. Without loss of generality, imagine they choose to take $L_{A'}$. This tells us by revealed preference $L_{A'} \succ L_{B'}$ which then implies $$u(30) > u(B)$$ where $B$ is the number of black balls that are believed to be in the urn (no probabilities here, this is some number the decision maker arrived at and at this point we don't know how). This implies $$B < 30$$ Now imagine that you give the agent the choice between $L_{C'}$ and $L_{D'}$ and the agent chooses to face lottery $D'$. Then $$u(60) > u(30 + (60-B))$$ where $(60-B)$ is the number of yellow balls that the agent must think are in the urn. This implies $$60 > 30 + (60-B) \Rightarrow B > 30$$ This means that an agent cannot prefer $L_{A'}$ to $L_{B'}$ and prefer $L_{C'}$ to $L_{D'}$ because that would imply $B > 30$ and $B < 30$. It is difficult to talk about where $B$ comes from because it is a hard concept to think about when we are used to working in expected value terms, this agent cannot compute any type of expectation over the sets of values that he thinks $B$ lies in. As an example of this, let me use a max-min approach. Imagine that when he is presented the urn and lotteries that he is told that the number of black balls is either 15 or 45, but the agent doesn't know with what probability it is 15 and what probability it is 45. 

Suppose I earn factor wage ₹1000 in the year 2018 and I pay a tax of ₹100 to the government. So GDP by income method is ₹1000 as we ignore transfer payments. Now if I spent all my 900 on domestic consumption good but government expenditure is zero. So GDP by expenditure method is ₹900. What am I missing? 

Basically I'm interested in solving tricky thought provoking exercises based on National income and on IS LM model. I've read mankiw but it didn't satisfy my needs. 

Firstly they have given output elasticity of a factor, use of which is clear to me. It says to what degree my total output will vary due to a change in the quantity of a factor. But what else do we get to know from elasticity of Average product? 

Consider a standard exchange economy (agents are endowed with some set of goods that they will use to trade with others). Piccione and Rubenstein wrote a somewhat interesting paper about "jungle equilibria" of an exchange economy. In their paper, allocations are decided by allowing more powerful animals are able to take goods from weaker animals (I don't think their preferences were necessarily monotonic -- i.e. I think there was satiation). They not only show that an equilibrium of this form exists, but that it is Pareto efficient (you can't make anyone better off without making someone else worse off). Obviously this paper isn't exactly a model of the jungle, but the point is that there could be an equilibrium in the wild which follows a framework similar to this (and I think it is a cool paper and your question reminded me of it). 

I've read that liquidity trap means interest rate is at its minimum and increase in real money stock will not lead to fall in interest rate because people will be demanding whatever the amount is being supplied at that minimum interest rate. Now in books they say that in this situation when government expenditure rises leading to a rise in income and hence a rise in money demand would not lead to a change in interest rate. But according to me when the demand for money goes up it shifts the money demand curve to the right and above. Given the money supply and fixed price, this should lead to a rise in interest rate. Same confusion arises when we reduce the real money supply under the liquidity trap situation. Book says that interest rate will not go down when money supply goes up but it says nothing about money supply going down. 

Additional Comment: The two cases you present are more or less covered by the guess $V(k) = A + B \frac{k^{1-\sigma}}{1 - \sigma}$ since this reduces to logs as $\sigma \rightarrow 1$. The guesses are certainly tied to the particular form of the return function as the value function is related to the one period return (reward) function repeatedly obtained throughout an infinite history (if consumption were constant then it would reduce to a geometric sum). 

thus he would choose lottery $D'$. This is one example of how uncertainty can be treated in a problem like this, but by no means is the only. Note: Earlier I thought had a piece of my answer that talked about priors over the value of $B$, but this wasn't carefully thought through. You can have multiple values that you might imagine $B$ takes, but as soon as you assign a probability distribution to any of these values then you have left the realm of uncertainty and moved to the realm of risk. 

Slutsky identity is given by: ∆x/∆p = (∆x/∆p)|substitution effect + (∆x/∆p)|income effect Now we know ∆m= x*∆p => ∆p=∆m/x Therefore, ∆x/∆p = (∆x/∆p)|substitution effect + (x*(∆x/∆m))|income effect But in HAL Varian's book there's minus sign in front of income effect. I am not being able to figure out how the minus sign came there. I think of income effect as total effect minus substitution effect. 

Suppose that a change in government regulations allows banks to start paying interest on checking accounts. The money stock is the sum of currency and demand deposits, including checking accounts. (a) How does this change affect the demand for money? (b) What happens to the velocity of money? (c) What will happen to the LM curve? (d)If the price level is fixed, what will happen to the output and interest rate? Use the IS-LM framework to explain your answer. This was the question given. According to my understanding: (a) interest on checking accounts means lower cost of holding money so money demand goes up. (c)Since demand for money has gone up interest rate will go up, hence LM curve shifts to the left. (d) due to the leftward shift of LM curve interest rate go up and output goes down. Are my answers correct? How do I insert velocity of money in ISLM model? 

Short answer It doesn't seem like you've tried very hard to find estimation using Dynare (google results of "Dynare estimation"). Dynare is in fact capable of doing estimation and typically people use some sort of data to estimate the parameters that govern their model. Longer Answer What is a DSGE model? A DSGE model is a series of equations (and variables and parameters) that describe a "model" economy. Once you write everything down and take into consideration the optimizing decisions made by the agents, it is simply a system of stochastic difference (differential) equation that you can imagine writing in some form along the lines of: $$ E_t F(y_{t+1}, y_t, y_{t-1}, u_t) = 0$$ What does Dynare do? The majority of introductory examples only use Dynare to solve the model and run some simple simulations. In addition to being able to solve the model, Dynare is also capable of doing Bayesian estimation of the parameters that make up the model by feeding in data. Solves and simulates the Model Dynare takes this system of equations (and the given parameter values) and solves them using perturbation methods. One of the outputs of the solution is a law of motion for all of the variables in the economy -- i.e. one can write something along the lines of $$y_{t+1} = F(y_t, u_{t+1})$$ This law of motion allows you to generate model analogues of the data that you are interested in -- i.e. capital, labor, consumption etc... Estimates the model Once Dynare has a law of motion and has obtained simulated moments, it can compare the output of the model to data that you have provided. Dynare uses Bayesian estimation (though it is possible it does other types, but I'm not familiar with it) to estimate parameters which means that you need to provide it with a prior for each variable that you would like to estimate. It then uses a simple Metropolis Hastings algorithm to obtain estimates for the distribution over parameter values. References I would recommend you read both of the following references.
