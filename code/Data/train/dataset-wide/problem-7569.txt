In Section 2 of my talk "Simple ideas for famous problems" (available from $URL$ given in 1996, you will find a detailed proof of Erdos' result in his 1950 paper published in Summa Brasil. Math. In the proof, an extra congruence $x\equiv 3\pmod{31}$ is used. In my paper "On integers not of the form $\pm p^a\pm q^b$" [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 128(2000), no.4, 997--1002] (available from $URL$ I introduced a method to avoid a bunch of extra congruences, and used the technique to improve the Cohen-Selfridge work (with a detailed proof). After reading my 1996 talk material and my 2000 paper in Proc. AMS, you will remove your puzzle definitely! 

Here I ask a somewhat curious question on Euler's totient function $\varphi$. QUESTION: Can we write each integer $n>8$ as $k+m$ with $k$ and $m$ distinct positive integers such that $\varphi(k)\varphi(m)$ is a square? Based on my computation, in 2014 I conjectured that the answer is yes. For example, \begin{align*}17&=5+12\ \ \text{with}\ \varphi(5)\varphi(12)=4\times4=4^2, \\24&=4+20\ \ \text{with}\ \ \varphi(4)\varphi(20)=2\times8=4^2, \\56&=8+48\ \ \text{with}\ \ \varphi(8)\varphi(48)=4\times16=8^2. \end{align*} Though the graph available from $URL$ reflecting the growth of $$\text{A236998}(n)=\left|\left\{0<k<\frac n2:\ \varphi(k)\varphi(n-k)\ \text{is a square}\right\}\right|$$ supports my conjecture, I feel rather puzzled since I do not see why the conjecture is reasonable. By the way, in 2013 I conjectured that any integer $n>5$ can be written as the sum of two positive integers $k$ and $m$ such that $(\varphi(k)+\varphi(m))/2$ is prime (cf. $URL$ This is still open. Any comments are welcome! 

There is a stronger result: Every r.e. set is primitive r.e. in your sense. Short proof: Kleene's Normal Form Theorem. Longer proof: Let S be an r.e. set, assumed WLOG nonempty; fix a ∈ S, and fix an algorithm e where S is precisely the range of the function computed by e. Consider the following algorithm: Given the input pair (n, M), run e on input n for M steps. If it gives an output by then, output whatever e outputs; otherwise output a. The functions which set up the initial state of computation, advance a state by one step, and extract the output from a final state, are all p.r. Thus the above algorithm defines a p.r. function, and it is easy to check that its range is S. Edit: Cutland's Computability is a decent resource for these questions. 

Is any integer $n>1$ the sum of a number of the form $4^k-k$ $(k=0,1,2\ldots$) and a positive squarefree number? Though such representations are very sparse, I conjecture that the answer is yes! For any positive integer $n$, let $a(n)$ be the number of nonnegative integers $k$ with $n-(4^k-k)$ positive and squarefree. The sequence $a(1),a(2),\ldots$ is available from $URL$ Note that $1\leqslant a(n)\leqslant 7$ for all $n=2,3,\ldots,10^5$. I have verified that $a(n)>0$ for every $n=2,3,\ldots,10^{10}$. It is natural to look at those integers $n>1$ with $a(n)=1$. I have found totally 112 such values below $2\times 10^9$ (cf. $URL$ the last of which is $180196927$ with $$180196927=4^{11}-11+2\times139\times227\times2789.$$ I guess that there are no other values of $n$ with $a(n)=1$. I have some other similar questions. For example, I conjecture that any positive integer can be written as the sum of a Fibonacci number and a positive odd squarefree number (cf. $URL$ Any comments are welcome! 

The Axiom of Determinacy (AD) fails. What that means: Partition the set ωω into two sets S and T, and think of this partition as a game (S, T) with two players. To play, player 1 picks a natural number a0, then player 2 picks b0 (as a function of a0), then player 1 picks a1 (as a function of b0), then player 2 picks b1 (as a function of a0 and a1), and so on until an and bn are selected for all n ∈ ω. Then the sequence a0, b0, a1, b1, … is either in S (in which case player 1 wins), or in T (in which case player 2 wins). The game (S, T) is determined if either player 1 or player 2 has a winning strategy, i.e., if there are functions fn: nω → ω where choosing an = fn( b0, …, bn–1 ) guaranteed player 1 victory, or similarly for player 2. (We can't have both.) AD is just the statement that every such game is determined, which is false in ZFC. As with most of the weird examples, the undetermined game is constructed with a well-ordering of R. What makes this so unintuitive to me is that both AC and AD are generalizations of statements that are easily seen for finite objects. (Any finite game, or even any game with finite depth, is determined, by an easy induction on the depth.) There are apparently many set theorists that agree with this assessment, since they try to rescue AD as relativized to L(R). That the relative consistency strength of this statement is equivalent to that of large cardinals is considered good evidence that those large cardinals are, in fact, consistent. More precisely, ZF + AD is consistent iff ZFC + "there are infinitely many Woodin cardinals" is consistent, and ADL(R) is outright provable in ZFC + "there is a measurable cardinal which is greater than infinitely many Woodin cardinals". 

Let $\mathbb Z^+$ denote the set of positive integers. Here I ask the following question. QUESTION: Does each integer have the form $x^4-y^3+z^2$ with $x,y,z\in\mathbb Z^+$? I guess that the answer is affirmative. I have verified that any integer $m$ with $|m|\leqslant 10^5$ can be written as $x^4-y^3+z^2$ with $x,y,z\in\mathbb Z^+$ (cf. $URL$ For example, \begin{gather*}0=4^4-8^3+16^2,\ \ -1=1^4-3^3+5^2,\\-20=32^4-238^3+3526^2,\ \ 11019=4325^4-71383^3+3719409^2.\end{gather*} Moreover, based on some heuristic arguments, I conjecture that if $\{a,b,c\}$ is among the multisets $$\{2,3,3\},\ \{2,3,4\},\ \{2,3,5\},$$ then any integer $m$ can be written as $x^a+y^b-z^c$ with $x,y,z\in\mathbb Z^+$ in infinitely many ways. See Conjecture 5.1 and Remark 5.1 of my paper New conjectures on representations of integers (I). I don't know how to prove that the question has a positive answer. Any comments on the question are welcome! 

Suppose you've got your polygon P, embedded in the Euclidean plane with some standard coordinate system. Then there's some rectangle R with horizontal and vertical sides which encloses P and is as small as possible among all such rectangles (just take horizontal lines through the topmost and bottommost points, and vertical lines through the rightmost and leftmost points). Translating the coordinate system doesn't change the rectangle or its area, but rotating it through an angle θ will; so the rectangle Rθ and its area Aθ are really functions of θ (and (π/2)-periodic functions at that). As such, A definitely has a minimum at some angle θmin. The meat of the theorem is that, for any angle φ where Rφ does not meet the conclusion, the function A does not even have a local minimum. To see this, note that Rφ intersects P at a finite set of points S — usually |S| = 4, but 3 or 2 are also possible. Now consider the rectangle R'θ which is the smallest rectangle with sides parallel to the θ-axes and which contains S, and let A'θ be its area. Note two things: 

Let $p$ be any prime. It is well known that the set $$G_p=\{0<g<p:\ g\ \text{is a primitive root modulo}\ p\}$$ has cardinality $\varphi(p-1)$, where $\varphi$ is Euler's totient function. It is interesting to investigate the structure of the set $G_p$. In 2014 I conjectured that $G_p$ always contains a number of the form $x^2+1$ with $x$ an integer (cf. $URL$ This is still open. Here I ask a further question. QUESTION: Is it true that for each prime $p>7$ the set $G_p$ always contains a number of the form $5^k+10^m$ with $k,m\in\mathbb N=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$? I conjecture that the answer is affirmative, i.e., for any prime $p>7$ there are $k,m\in\mathbb N$ such that $5^k+10^m$ is not only smaller than $p$ but also a primitive root modulo $p$. I have verified this for all primes $p$ with $7<p<10^9$. For the number of ordered pairs $(k,m)\in\mathbb N^2$ with $5^k+10^m\in G_p$, one may visit $URL$ For example, for the prime $p=6276271$, the integer $$5^5+10^1=3135$$ is the unique element of $G_p$ in the form $5^k+10^m$ with $k,m\in\mathbb N$. My above question looks somewhat curious and quite challenging. Any comments are welcome! 

This question may be better answered by going to the intuition. Let X be a set with some sort of "local structure"; a metric space will do, but any reasonable sort of "closeness" is fine. We want to say a set U ⊆ X is open if, whenever U contains a point p, it also contains all those points q ∈ X which are "near p". Given this, U = X is clearly open. If p ∈ U, we want all the points of X "near p" to be in U; but every point of X is in U, so this is trivially true. ∅ is also clearly open. For this to be false, ∅ would have to contain a point p but not all the points near p; but as ∅ contains no points, this is impossible. Also consider the following: Let f : X → {0,1} be the constant function sending every p ∈ X to 0. We want constant functions to be continuous, no matter how fine the topology on {0,1}. So f -1[{0}] = X and f -1[{1}] = ∅ both must be open (and both must be closed). 

Recall that the Mersenne numbers are those integers $M_p=2^p-1$ with $p$ prime. QUESTION: Is it true that for each prime $p>3$ there is a Mersenne number which is a quadratic nonresidue modulo $p$? In 2014 I conjectured further that for any prime $p>3$ there is a prime $q<p/2$ such that $M_q=2^q-1$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ (cf. $URL$ or $URL$ For example, $M_{17}=131071$ is a primitive root modulo the prime $37$. Of course, the question is easier than this difficult conjecture. I'm even unable to prove that each prime $p>3$ has a quadratic nonresidue of the form $2^n-1$ with $n$ a positive integer. Any ideas towards the proof? By the way, in 2014 I also conjectured that for each prime $p>3$ there is a Fibonacci number smaller than $p/2$ which is a quadratic nonresidue modulo $p$ (cf. $URL$ This should be quite challenging. Any comments are welcome! 

Let $z$ be a word, and let $M=FM(a,b)/z^{-1}$. If we wish $a$ and $b$ to be invertible in $M$, then $z$ must contain both $a$ and $b$ at least once. (For example, $FM_2[a^{-n}]=FM_2[a^{-1}]\cong F(a)\ast FM(b)$ by the canonical maps.) Suppose $z = a^nwa^m$ with $n, m>0$. If $z^{-1}$ exists, then $a$ has a right inverse $r = a^{n-1}wa^mz^{-1}$ and a left inverse $l = z^{-1}a^nwa^{m-1}$, and in fact these two are equal by the standard argument ($l = lar = r$); so just say $l=r=a^{-1}$. Then $z^{-1}a^nwa^m = e$ implies $z^{-1}a^nw = a^{-m}$ implies $a^mz^{-1}a^nw = e$ ($w$ has a left inverse), and similarly $w$ has a right inverse which is the same. If $z$ contains any occurrences of $b$, then we choose $w$ to begin and end with $b$; by the earlier argument applied to $w$, $b$ is invertible. Symmetrically, if $z$ begins and ends with $b$ but contains an occurrence of $a$, then $z^{-1}$ exists implies $a^{-1}$, $b^{-1}$ exists. I suspect these are the only cases which work (i.e., inverting a word of the form $awb$ or $bwa$ would not invert $a$ or $b$) but cannot yet prove it. (EDIT: This is false, see Mark's comment below.) EDIT: Partial result! Consider the structure $M$ whose underlying set is $\{(m,e) \in \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{Z} : m\ge e\}$ with binary operation $(m,e)\ast(m',e') = (\max(m,e+m'), e+e')$. It is routine to check that this is a monoid. Let $z=awb$ contain $i$ copies of $a$ and $j$ copies of $b$, and consider the morphism $f\colon FM(a,b)\to M$ with $f(a) = (0,-j)$ and $f(b) = (i,i)$. From counting it is clear that $f(z) = (m,0)$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$. If $m=0$ (as it will be for any word of the form $a^ib^j$, and many other words besides), then $f$ extends to a morphism $FM(a,b)[z^{-1}]\to M$. But $f(a)$ has no left inverse; if $(m,e)\ast (0,-j) = (0,0)$, then $e=j$ and $\max(m,j)=0$, which is impossible ($j>0$ by assumption). Thus $a^{-1}$ cannot be a member of $FM(a,b)[z^{-1}]$, i.e., inverting $z$ does not invert $a$. (Intuition: For each word in $FM(a,b)$, start at zero and read the word from left to right. For each $a$, descend $j$ steps; for each $b$, ascend $i$ steps; and track both your peak and your current position. If reading $z$ never gets you to the positive numbers, then adjoining $z^{-1}$ does not get you $a^{-1}$ (or similarly $b^{-1}$).) 

For $x>0$ let $\pi(x)$ denote the number of primes not exceeding $x$. A well-known conjecture of Legendre states that $\pi(n^2)<\pi((n+1)^2)$ for any positive integer $n$. Here I ask the following natural question. QUESTION: Are all the numbers $\pi(n^2)/n^2\ (n=1,2,3,\ldots)$ pairwise distinct? Based on my computation, in 2015 I conjectured that the answer is yes. Moreover, my computation suggests that the sequence $$\frac{\pi(n^2)}{n^2}\ \ (n=15647,15648,\ldots)$$ is strictly decreasing. For each $k=3,4,5,\ldots$, I also conjectured that the sequence $$\frac{\pi(n^k)}{n^k}\ \ (n=2,3,\ldots)$$ is strictly decreasing. Any comments on the question are welcome! 

Here I ask the following question in additive combinatorics. QUESTION: Let $A$ be any finite subset of an additive abelian group $G$ with $|A|=n>3$. Can we write $A$ as $\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ so that all the $n$ sums \begin{gather*}a_1+a_2+a_3,\ a_2+a_3+a_4,\ \ldots, \\ a_{n-2}+a_{n-1}+a_n,\ a_{n-1}+a_n+a_1,\ a_n+a_1+a_2\end{gather*} are pairwise distinct? Note that if $G=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ is an addtive abelian group with $|G|=n>3$ then $2(a_1+\ldots+a_n)=0$ and hence \begin{align*}&(a_1+a_2+a_3)+\ldots+(a_{n-2}+a_{n-1}+a_n) \\&+(a_{n-1}+a_n+a_1)+(a_n+a_1+a_2) \\=&3(a_1+\ldots+a_n)=a_1+\ldots+a_n.\end{align*} This is the main motivation of my question. In 2013 I conjectured that the question always has a positive answer, and showed this when $G$ is torsion-free (cf. $URL$ However, I'm even unable to answer the question for $G=\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ with $p$ prime.
