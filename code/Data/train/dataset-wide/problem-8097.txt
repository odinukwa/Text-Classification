Let $f:X\to BGL_1(\mathbb{S})$ be a morphism of $E_n$-spaces and determine a principle $GL_1(\mathbb{S})$-bundle over $X$. Then it can be shown in the classical case that there is always a Thom isomorphism $Mf\wedge Mf\to Mf\wedge X_+$ (Mahowald shows this, for instance here, modulo the concerns about operadic structure). I'm interested in understanding how this map is produced in the modern $\infty$-categorical framework developed in work of Ando, Blumberg, Gepner and others. What this comes down to is showing that there is an orientation of $f$. This can be described as an equivalence of functors between $F=f\circ(-\wedge Mf):X\to BGL_1(\mathbb{S})\to BGL_1(Mf)$ and $\ast:X\to BGL_1(Mf)$. In other words, there should be an equivalence $F\simeq p^*Mf$ in the category $Mf_X\mathrm{-line}\simeq Fun(X^{op},Mf\mathrm{-line})$ where $Mf\mathrm{-line}$ is the category of $Mf$-modules which are equivalent to $Mf$ and $p:X\to \ast$ is the terminal map (note that to simplify notation I've called the composite map $F$). Such an equivalence would, upon applying $p_!$, yield an equivalence $Mf\wedge Mf=p_!F\simeq p_!p^\ast Mf=Mf\wedge X_+$. One way to try to obtain such an orientation is to notice that the multiplication map $Mf\wedge Mf\to Mf$ is actually a map $p_!F\to Mf$ in $Mf\mathrm{-mod}$, which yields a map (simply by noting that $p_!$ is left adjoint to $p^\ast$) $F\to p^\ast Mf$ in $Mf_{X}\mathrm{-mod}$. My question is the following: why is the map so obtained an equivalence? If it is not, is there another map $MF\to Mf$ that does give us this equivalence? 

What are the chances that, for an arbitrary $p$-local harmonic spectrum $X$, if $K(n)\wedge X\simeq\ast$ for all $n$, then $X$ is contractible? This, I believe, holds for suspension spectra and finite spectra. Does anyone know of any harmonic (i.e. local to $\vee_{n\in\mathbb{N}}K(n)$) spectra for which this does not hold? Thanks! 

I'm essentially trying to figure out exactly what the title asks for. I've been scouring old Seminaires Henri Cartan and books by Stong to try to see exactly how to do this, but the combination of French and older terminology has made it rough going. In particular, I've been able to work out (I think!) that, modulo 2, the map $$H_\ast(BSp;\mathbb{Z}/2)\to H_\ast(BU;\mathbb{Z}/2) $$ takes $y_{4k}$ to $(x_{2k})^2$, and that the map $$H_\ast(U;\mathbb{Z}/2)\to H_\ast(SO;\mathbb{Z}/2)$$ takes $a_{2k-1}$ to certain polynomials $t_{2k-1}$ (the primitives) defined recursively as $$t_1=c_1,t_3=c_3+c_1c_2,\ldots,t_{2k-1}=\sum_{\substack{i+j=2k+1\\0\leq i<j}}c_ic_j$$ where the $a_{2k-1}$ and $c_k$ generate the homology groups. I'd really appreciate anything, from a complete exposition, to a reference, to a hint about something that I've missed or gotten wrong. I'm obviously especially interested in working out how to lift that last map to the classifying spaces (which would require completely knowing what the so-called "suspension" maps look like). Thanks so much! -Jon 

It is a theorem of Neil Strickland's that the category of harmonic spectra (i.e. the category of $p$-localized spectra localized at the infinite wedge of Morava K-theories) has no small objects. That is to say that there is not a single spectrum $X$ in the category of harmonic spectra such that $[X,\bigvee X_i]=\bigoplus[X,X_i]$. Take a finite spectrum in this category (for instance the sphere spectrum $\mathbb{S}$). Does anyone have an example of a coproduct in the category of harmonic spectra for which the above is NOT true? While Strickland's proof makes sense, it seems completely amazing to me. What HAPPENS to the sphere and the cells of finite spectra when we localize? It seems that if something were small to begin with, i.e. the above homotopy groups factored globally, killing some spectra shouldn't change this! Note that the same question can be asked of the $BP$-local category. Are there conditions (other than finiteness) that we can put on the coproduct to make the statement true when the object on the left is finite (i.e. in the thick subcategory generated by the sphere)? 

So, this ends up being simpler than I realized, and is in some sense this question's existence is purely a result of me not reading the above cited DAG II closely enough. In the first section of DAG II it's proven that if we start with a simplicial monoidal category in which the monoidal functor $C\times C\to C$ is simplicially enriched and such that $C$ is fibrant in the Bergner model category of simplicial categories in which the fibrant objects are enriched in Kan complexes (e.g. we might take $C$ to be topologically enriched from the start) then we can obtain a cocartesian fibration of simplicial sets $C^\otimes\to N(\Delta)^{op}$ whose fiber over $[1]$ is equivalent to $N(C)$. Later, it's proven that there is an equivalence of $\infty$-categories between the cocartesian fibrations $C^\otimes\to N(\Delta)^{op}$ and the cocartesian fibrations $D^\otimes\to \mathcal{A}ss^\otimes$ (actually Lurie calls these things Segal monoids, but you can check that these correspond to the $\mathcal{A}ss^\otimes$-monoids from Higher Algebra). What's important however is that this equivalence is given by composing with an ``approximation map" $N(\Delta)^{op}\to \mathcal{A}ss^\otimes$. In other words we have complete control over what the fiber over $\langle 1\rangle$ is in the $\mathcal{A}ss^\otimes$-monoid associated to $C^\otimes\to N(\Delta)^{op}$, and indeed it remains $N(C)$. What's even more important is that later, it is shown that there is an equivalence of $\infty$-categories between the algebras of $C$ with respect to the fibration $C^\otimes\to N(\Delta)^{op}$ and the associated composition $C^\otimes\to \mathcal{A}ss^\otimes$. Thus, we still have complete control over specific algebras for the latter (Segal) monoidal structure. And these are indeed the monoids of the original category $C$. It seems possible to me that this can be determined from some of the stuff in Higher Algebra, but for this particular question this seems like the quickest route to getting an answer (in particular there is a Quillen equivalence between categories of preoperads, as I discuss above, but this introduces questions of fibrancy and so forth). I'd really like to know if there are other ways to answer this question! 

Suppose I am given a morphism $f:BG\to BGL_1(R)$ for $R$ some at least $E_1$-ring spectrum and $G$ a loop space. Then This corresponds, I believe, to an action of $G$ on $R$, coming from a morphism $G\to GL_1(R)$. The first part of my question is: does this imply a map of spectra $R[G]\wedge R\to R$ or something like this? The second part of my question is regards the Thom spectrum $Mf$ associated to $f$. There are several standard constructions of $Mf$ from the given data, but I'm particularly interested in the interpretation of $Mf$ as $R/G$, the "quotient" of $R$ by the $G$ action (the first place I saw this discussed was in the preprint of Ando, Blumberg, Gepner, Hopkins and Rezk on units of ring spectra). Specifically, can $R/G$ be constructed by some specific bar construction, or something along these lines, in the $\infty$-category of spectra? ABGHR seem to indicate that the construction of the Thom spectrum as the colimit of the $BG$-shaped diagram inside of $R$-modules makes it obvious that we should call it $R/G$, but it's not as clear to me. 

For my own convenience I'll work in $\infty$-categories, feel free to answer in whatever framework best suits you. My question is essentially how to show, given an $E_\infty$-ring object $R$ in an $\infty$-category $C$ and another object $M$ with a map $R\otimes M\to M$, that the pair $(R,M)$ is in fact an algebra, as Lurie calls it in Higher Algebra, for the $\infty$-operad $LM^\otimes$. In other words, how to show that $M$ is a module over $R$ with respect to all of $R$'s structure (not just the structure of being "homotopy associative and commutative"). One idea I have is the following: I'd like to produce a map of $\infty$-operads $F:LM^\otimes\to C^\otimes$, where $C^\otimes\to Fin_\ast$ is the coCartesian fibration determining the symmetric monoidal structure on $C$. To produce $F$ I need to have that it takes inert morphisms of $LM^\otimes$ to inert morphisms of $C^\otimes$. Now, recall that the inert morphisms of $LM^\otimes$ are precisely morphisms which map to inert morphisms in $Fin_\ast$ along the forgetful map $LM^\otimes\to Fin_\ast$, which are morphisms $\langle n\rangle\to\langle m\rangle$ that represent $\langle m\rangle$ as a "quotient" of $\langle n\rangle$, where everything we quotient out by gets sent to $\ast\in\langle m\rangle=\{\ast,1,\ldots,m\}$. However, to describe an $R$-action on $M$, we certainly never send $M$ to $\ast$. As such, the inert morphisms in $LM^\otimes$ shouldn't have anything to do with $M$ (it's just coming along for the ride, so-to-speak). In other words, we need that the morphisms describing the monoidal structure on $R$ (inside of $LM^\otimes$) go to the right place, but we don't have to check anything involving inert morphisms with respect to $M$. Hence a functor $LM^\otimes\to C^\otimes$ which picks out an associative algebra object $R$ of $C$ also picks out an object of $LMod(R)$. If $R$ is in fact $E_\infty$ then we also know that $LMod(R)\simeq Mod^{Comm}(R)$, giving us what we need to know. Does this seem valid? I have very little experience working with $\infty$-operads, and can't find this sort of thing anywhere anyway, so I might be making some very silly mistakes. Assuming my argument above doesn't make any sense, does anyone have any other ideas? Thanks! 

So it seems to me that, using Peter May's paper above, for two distinguished triangles $X\to Y\to Z$ and $X'\to Y'\to Z'$, we have a 'filtration': $$Z\wedge Z'\overset{f_1}\leftarrow Y\wedge Y'\overset{f_2}\leftarrow X\wedge X'$$ where the cofiber of $f_1$ is $Z\wedge Z'\to\Sigma V=\Sigma(X\wedge Y'\cup_{X'\wedge X}X'\wedge Y)$ and the cofiber of $f_2$ is just what it is, though Peter May's paper denotes it by $W$ and gives other distinguished triangles as well as several Cartesian squares that $W$ fits inside of. That way, we can attempt to understand what it is. Perhaps there is a better way to combine these things, but this is the best way I've determined thus far. 

Suppose we have $(M,\otimes,1)$, a monoidal simplicial model category. Then we can consider the opposite model category $M^{op}$ with the opposite model structure (fibrations become cofibrations, etc.). This category is also still a monoidal category (the opposite of a monoidal category is canonically a monoidal category). How do all of these possible adjectives interact? Is it still closed? Does the push-out product axiom still hold? It seems like we must lose some things, for instance, if we wanted the axiom "for any cofibrant object $X$ there is an equivalence $1\otimes X\simeq X$" this can't in general be true anymore, can it, since the cofibrant objects are completely different now? In general it seems clear that things break down, but I'm interested in precisely what breaks down. Do we still have a simplicial model category, but we're just missing some of the monoidal model category axioms? I'm also okay with dumping the simplicial requirement. 

Does anyone know of a good, complete reference for non-commutative formal group laws (i.e. construction of a "Lazard ring," discussion of non-commutative formal groups, perhaps some discussion of their moduli stack)? I seem to recall being told that there were at least a few South American mathematicians doing some really nice work on this sort of stuff, but don't know their names and haven't been able to find it. Thanks for any references on this! :) 

Is there a classification of the compact MU or BP modules in any category of spectra? Can the periodicity theorem be finagled to give a MU-module structure on finite spectra? 

So I've been fiddling with this for a long time, so apologies to anyone that's already heard me talk about this ad nauseum. I haven't been able to get anywhere with it, and it seemed that as such, it might be worth posting here, since if it's true, I think it'd be interesting. Suppose I've got an inclusion of (at least) $\mathbb{E}_2$-groups $j:H\hookrightarrow G$ such that I've got a fibration $H\overset{j}\to G\overset{q}\to G/H$, and I've got a Thom spectrum $Mf$ induced by a continuous map $f:G\to BGL_1(\mathbb{S})$. From Fridolin Roth's thesis, (and really ultimately from ABGHR) we know that under nice circumstances (e.g. if $Mf$ is $H\mathbb{Z}$-oriented) then $Mf$ is a Hopf-Galois extension of the sphere spectrum with associated Hopf-algebra the spherical group ring $\mathbb{S}[G_+]$. In particular, we have that the spectral sequence which computes the cofixed points of the coaction (in this case just the Thom diagonal) $Mf\to Mf\wedge \mathbb{S}[G_+]$, which is just the BKSS of the cosimplicial spectrum computing that limit, converges to the homotopy of the sphere spectrum (it's just a sort of Adams spectral sequence). Now, the map $G\to G/H$ would seem to induce a coaction $$Mf\to Mf\wedge \mathbb{S}[G_+]\to Mf\wedge\mathbb{S}[(G/H)_+].$$ And thus one might ask what the cofixed points of this new coaction are. There should be at least a sort of "unit" map $\mathbb{S}\to Mf^{hco(G/H)_+}$, and in an attempt to determine a sort of "intermediate" Hopf-Galois extension, one could hope to identify this object in between $\mathbb{S}$ and $Mf$. In the case that the morphism $G\to BGL_1(\mathbb{S})$ is the trivial one, or in other words $Mf=\mathbb{S}[G_+]$, one can identify this cofixed point object as $\mathbb{S}[H_+]$ by noticing that the cosimplicial object defining the cofixed points is precisely the diagram defining the homotopy limit of the diagram $\ast\leftarrow \mathbb{S}[G_+]\to \mathbb{S}[(G/H)_+]$, or, in other words, the suspension spectrum of the homotopy fiber of the quotient map $G\to G/H$. This, and other vague considerations, have led me to believe that perhaps there is a general way of realizing the Thom spectrum $M(f\circ j)$ as the cofixed points of $Mf$ under the induced coaction of $\mathbb{S}[(G/H)_+]$. I am concerned that there is some elementary consideration that would cause this to be true that I am just not seeing. I have attempted to get at this thing by thinking about the bundles of spectra defining $Mf$ and $M(f\circ j)$, and using some kind of six-functor yoga, as well as just straight up computation, but haven't really gotten anywhere. Any thoughts would be dearly appreciated. One last remark: note that by cofixed points I do not mean homotopy orbits. In algebra, for a group $X$ which is coacted upon by a Hopf-algebra $C$, $\Delta:X\to X\otimes C$, the cofixed points of the coaction are the elements $x\in X$ such that $\Delta(x)=x\otimes 1$.
