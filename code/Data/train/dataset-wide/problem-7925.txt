Let $n,k$ be any positive integers. What is the lowest $r$ (possibly depending on $n,k$) such that given real numbers $0\leq a_1,\dots,a_n\leq 1$, it is always possible to partition them into $k$ blocks, where each block contains consecutive elements of the sequence, so that the sums of any two blocks differ by at most $r$? Taking the example when $a_1=1$ and $a_2=\dots=a_n=0$, we need $r\geq 1$. On the other hand, $r\leq 2$ as we can use an algorithm where we process numbers from left to right and create a new block each time the total sum exceeds $\frac{i}{k}(a_1+\dots+a_n)$ for $1\leq i\leq n-1$. I suspect this problem must have been studied before. Are there any references? 

Up to how many subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,2n\}$ of size $n$ can we choose so that each pair has an intersection of size at least two? The original Erd≈ës-Ko-Rado paper shows that taking all subsets that contain two fixed elements (thus yielding $\binom{2n-2}{n-2}$ subsets) is not necessarily optimal, but doesn't show what is optimal. What is known about this problem? 

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of schemes (or algebraic spaces), and $s:Y\rightarrow X$ is a section to $f$, i.e. $fs=1_{Y}$. Question: Is $s$ an (closed) immersion? 

Is an algebraic space over a DVR, whose special fibre (and all its infinitesimal neighborhood) and generic fibre are schemes, actually a scheme? 

should be not true! What is the cokernel of the map $\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow A$ with $A$ an abelian variety and $\mathbb{Z}$ the constant group scheme represented by the ring of integers? But if you consider only commutative algebraic group scheme over a field $k$(i.e. of finite type over $k$), then it should be abelian. 

It is said so in Knutson's book 'algebraic sapces' in several places for different topologies on schemes, see Chapt. I, 2.19 for Zariski top, 3.13 for flat top., 4.11 for etale topology. But this seems to be clearly wrong to me. For example, let $f$ be the identity from $P^1$ to itself which is clearly surjective, consider the Zariski open covering $A^1\cup A^1\rightarrow X=P^1$, then $A^1\rightarrow X$ is not surjective. 

You are going to need to pass to an extension first. There is a bundle over $G(n,k)$ whose fibers are the complete flags on the vector spaces in the canonical bundle. Lets call it $q:P(n,k)\rightarrow G(n,k)$. The pullback of the conical $k$-plane bundle to $P(n,k)$ now splits as a direct sum of line bundles, so by the sum formula for characteristic classes it factors as a product of linear factors as you wrote above. The problem is that the factorization is in the cohomology of the total space of $P(n,k)$. Its not that bad, because the cohomology of $P(n,k)$ is a module over the cohomology of $G(n,k)$. However to get an explicit answer you are going to have to learn to do computations in the cohomology of $G(n,k)$. 

In the case of a nonsingular algebraic curve, I guess this is the point of Atiyah and Bott's Yang-Mills on Riemann surfaces, or the work of Narasimhan and Seshadri. Choose a Hermitian pairing on your complex bundle and then search for a unitary connection with central curvature. There is a really great book by Kobayashi "The Differential Geometry of Complex Vector Bundles" that explores this approach in more generality. Once you have reduced to unitary connections with central curvature you can understand them as representations of a central extension of the fundamental group of the manifold, which then puts you in a finite dimensional situation with a compact group acting. The quotient corresponds to the geometric invariant theory quotient. 

The group cohomology of cyclic groups can be computed easily due to the periodity. Now how can one compute the group cohomology $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? As least in some special case, e.g. $M$ has trivial action, or even $M=\mathbb{Z}$? I would like to know the case that $M$ is not $\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, can one compute $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times\cdots\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? 

I am interested in the following example! Let $k$ be a field, let $X_0$ be the scheme $\mathrm{Spec}R$ with $R_0=k[x,y]/(xy)$, let $R$ be the strict Hensilian localalisation of $R_0$ at the origin and $X=\mathrm{Spec}R$, we define a sheaf $F$ on $X$ by $F(U)=\mathbb{Z}^2$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ for $U$ open in $X$ depending on if $U$ contains the origin or not (hence the stalk of $F$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$ at the origin, and $\mathbb{Z}$ at other points). The restriction maps for defining $F$ are given by $\mathbb{Z}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}:(m,n)\mapsto m+n$ (in fact the sheaf comes from the log structure associated to the embedding $X_0\subset \mathbb{A}^2$ ). Since $X$ is strict Hensilian, we have $H^1(X,F)=0$. Now consider the projection $p:\mathbb{G}_{m,R}\rightarrow X=\mathrm{Spec}R$. What would be the group $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},p^*F)$? Maybe an easier version, is $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},\mathbb{Z})$ zero? We do know $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m},\mathbb{Z})=H^1(\mathrm{Spec}R,\mathbb{Z})=0$! 

Consider a graph with the vertices being all subsets of size $n$ of a set of size $2n$. Two vertices are connected if their overlap has size at most one. What is the chromatic number of this graph? If we have two vertices connected when the overlap is empty, then this corresponds to the Kneser graph, for which we know the chromatic number for any $n,k$. In this special case $k=n/2$, the chromatic number of the Kneser graph is trivially two. In our case, we have the generalized Kneser graph $KG(2n,n,1)$. It seems that the chromatic number is always $6$ for any $n\geq 2$. Can we prove this, or does it follow from some known result? As domotorp wrote in the comments, the graph is also called the discrete Borsuk graph. Is something known about its chromatic number? 

For one-dimensional random walk, it is well-known that if the walk goes for $n$ steps, with constant probability it ends within $\pm\sqrt{n}$. What is the bound, in terms of $n$, such that if the walk goes for $n$ steps, with constant probability it always stays within that bound? It is probably no longer on the order of $\sqrt{n}$, but is it still less than the order of $n$? 

There is a simple answer to your first question. Imagine two circles of the same radius lying in parallel planes so that the segment joining their centers is perpendicular to the planes. There are two minimal surfaces that bound this configuration. One consists of two disks, one in each plane, and the other is a section of a catenoid. By playing around with the radii and distance you can even have two least area surfaces with the same boundary. Clearly there is not a unique minimal surface spanning the same piecewise linear curve. You could build a curve that bounded both a minimal disc and minimal Moebius band with little difficulty. I read this in a paper in German that was written in the 50's. I can't remember the author. I think you can find the example in Blaine Lawson's book on minimal surfaces. Also, Peter Hall gave some examples of nonuniqueness in the late 1980's. There is a Memoir of the AMS written by Dave Hoffman that constructs lots of families of minimal surfaces, using the Weierstrass representation, and counts of dimensions of holomorphic sections of line bundles to build lots of families. 

Is there anyone familiar with this paper? It seems to me it contains "some" typos and even some small elementary mistakes, which makes my reading very slow. Of course the key reason for my slow reading is I wasn't familiar with Faltings and Chai's book, from which the paper use the notations and results. Maybe I have some (or many) misunderstanding. I hope someone could help me clear up my confusions: 

How to determine a functor (natrually arising from geometry or homological algebra) to be locally of finite presentation? Is there any reference for such staff? My example of functors underlying this question is functors of the form $$\mathcal{E}xt^1_S(A,\mathbb{G}_m)$$ for $A$ some group scheme or even some fppf-sheaf of geometric meaning over some base scheme $S$, and $\mathcal{E}xt^1_S(,)$ denotes the 1st fppf extension sheaf in the category of abelian fppf-sheaves over $S$. 

How far is it to extend the results of SGA III Exp. VIB from group schemes to group spaces? In particular, does Corollary 4.4 from SGA III Exp. VIB hold for G/S being merely a group space? Here the base $S$ is still a scheme. Is there any reference for group spaces? I checked stack project, but the section 'properties of group algebraic spaces' from Chapter "groupoids in alg. sp." is less than 1 page. Raynaud's IHES paper contains a few pages. To be more precise, I would like to know if the following is ture: Let $G/S$ be group space locally of finite presentation with $S$ a trait (to make it easier), let $s,t$ be the closed point and generic point of $S$ respectively. Suppose $G_s$ and $G_t$ are smooth over $k(s)$ and $k(t)$ respectively, and $\mathrm{dim}G_s=\mathrm{dim}G_t$. Then the functor $G^0$ (defined as in SGA III Exp. VI B Def. 3.1) is represented by a smooth group scheme over $S$. 

Yes. There are a lot of ways to approach this. Following Roseman, you can take a generic projection of the torus into R^3, with overcrossing and undercrossing data. It will have double points, triple points and branched points. There is a presentation of the fundamental group of the complement of the torus using meridians around each facet of the immersed surface with Wirtinger type relators of from the double curves. If you can show it it isn't the fundamental group of the complement of the standard torus you are in. Roseman also developed Reidemeister like moves for these. Also the number of triple points can be used to detect knottedness. An alternative approach is due to Carter and Saito, it involves looking at slices of the knots as a family of R^3's moves through R^4 to give a movie of a link progressing in space with Morse type singularities. There are movie moves similar to the Reidemeister moves. From these you can attempt TQFT type invariants of the knotted surface to detect knottedness. There is also a theory of braids in 4 dimensions due to Kamada. However, there are more subtle invariants of knottedness than the fundamental group. You can start looking at characteristic classes of the normal bundle for instance. 

In Raynaud's paper "Specialisation du foncteur de Picard", Theorem 3.3.1 says that algebraic group spaces, which are locally of finite type and separated over any locally noetherian normal 1-dim scheme, are group schemes. On the other hand, relative Picard functors for proper flat finite presentation schemes $f:X\rightarrow S$ over DVR such that $f$ is cohomologically flat are represented by algebraic sapces, but are often not schemes, see also that paper or the book Neron Model. 

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a proper surjective morphism over some base scheme $S$ of finite type, suppose $f$ restricts to an isomorphism over some open $U$ of $X$, we also suppose both $X$ and $Y$ are integral for simplicity. I guess now $f$ is a covering for the cdh-topology. Now is there anyway to get an injection $$0\rightarrow \mathrm{Pic}^{\tau}_{Y/S}\rightarrow \mathrm{Pic}^{\tau}_{X/S}$$. By the way is $\mathbb{G}_m$ a sheaf for the cdh-topology? Could anyone give me a good reference for cdh topology treated in a general way instead serving only for motivic cohomology?
