Here's a more likely hypothesis for what this actually is. The depression The blue oval contains a slight depression. It could be a number of things, including an old crater, a basin, or the result of the collapse of part of the surface. I'm actually a little bothered by the idea of it as an impact crater. We can see from the shadows on the western walls that it is only a little shallow, especially compared to other similarly-sized impact craters in the area. It's possible that it's a crater that was filled in with sediment. If it's a natural basin, it could once have been a Martian lake - although this is quite speculative. It could also be the remains of a pit crater (there are many pit craters in the area), formed possibly from the cave-in of a series of lava tubes. Again, this is also speculative, and the depression is quite large, about 10 miles long on its major axis. If one of these options is correct, the depression is not very mysterious. You've identified the grey part of it as the location of the other half of the formation, partly because it appears to be roughly the same size. I find this unlikely, for a couple reasons: 

Seasons depend on the tilt of a planet's axis. Unfortunately, it is hard (if not impossible) to measure the tilt of the axis of Alpha Centauri Bb (I haven't been able to find any measurements). I would assume that it would experience some seasons, but I don't know how much they would extend. As for question 3 - I'm not quite sure what you mean by "calendar." If you mean an artificial calendar, I would think that any beings on the planet (life there is extremely unlikely) would only use Alpha Centauri B to determine their years (just over three days and five hours).

It might make more sense to use this latitude to describe the position of an orbiting object, but the vector from the focus to the object's position $(r,\theta)$ is perpendicular to the tangential component of the object's velocity vector, meaning that the geodetic latitude may be better. 

Normally, the two main sources of cosmic rays are considered to be the Sun (solar energetic particles) and galactic or extragalactic sources, although extragalactic sources are more common. Surprisingly, though, there is a third source, a family of particles known as anomalous cosmic rays (see Hovestadt et al. (1973) and Garcia-Munoz et al. (1973)). These are particles - generally ionized nuclei of lighter elements - primarily originating from interstellar space with energies on the order of $\sim10$ to $\sim10^2\text{ MeV}$. Anomalous cosmic rays are generally accelerated at the termination shock of the heliosphere, moving into the heliosheath. Some may then escape into the inner Solar System. Here's an image from Stone et al. (2005), which shows them as a distinct population from galactic cosmic rays: 

This is part of the spectral energy distribution of Sagittarius A*, a flot of $\nu$ (frequency) vs. $\nu L_{\nu}$ (frequency times luminosity). For comparison, visible light is in wavelengths from $\sim4\times10^{14}\text{ Hz}$ to $\sim8\times10^{14}\text{ Hz}$, which happens to be around the bottom of the trough of nonthermal electron emission. Right away, this makes submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths good candidates, leading to studies using Very Long Baseline Interferometry. Likewise, infrared emissions are a good target, and so the Spitzer Space Telescope, for instance, has been used. X-ray flares of up to $\sim10^{36}\text{ erg/s}$ also occur from time to time,1 so that part of the spectrum is sometimes used to observe this activity. Finally, of course, Sagittarius A* is a very strong radio source, and it was initially observed in radio wavelengths (and it still is!). As Fish & Doeleman write,2 

1 I've never liked the usage in this context, as this was the first time they combined; the "re" is kind of misleading. 

So the original concept of nature was life, but we've expanded since then into everything that isn't made by humans. So I suppose it depends partly on your personal viewpoint (or time period!), but it does seem like nature today refers to the entire universe. 

From theory It is possible to numerically integrate the equations of stellar structure over time to figure out how a star will evolve. Some basic informed "guesses" about the central and surface properties of the model star need to be made, but as the model is created, future iterations can use different values for these, making the model more and more accurate until it is self-consistent. The equations are based on several key assumptions (for which there is a good amount of evidence). Here are a few: 

You were so close! The answer was actually given lower down on the Wikipedia page: roughly 20 parsecs. Since one parsec is about 3.26 light-years, we can calculate that that comes out to about 64 light-years, as this seems to corroborate. The outer layers of the remnant are expanding outward at an outrageous rate - 11 million miles per hour, according to NASA. I invite you to do the calculations to figure out how large it will be at a certain point in time. 

It's not out of the question, but it would be very difficult to use direct imaging for any of the exoplanets around TRAPPIST-1: 

I came across a 1938 paper by Arthur Eddington1 in which he discusses stellar polytropic models where the polytropic index $n$ varies inside the star, decreasing from a value $n_2$ at the surface to a value $n_1$ at the center. He specifically mentions that the case of $n_1=1.5$ and $n_2=3.5$ should represent "ordinary gaseous stars" quite well. In his conclusion, he states 

Well, currently, we don't have a shred of evidence that they exist. White holes are hypothetical objects predicted by certain solutions to Einstein's theory of general relativity. To be specific, they come from the maximally extended Schwarzschild solution. We can deal with them a little mathematically, but nobody will really believe in objects like these unless we have experimental evidence for them. Do we? I quote NASA here 

It would seem so. Think about brown dwarfs. At the lower end of the mass spectrum, they're only a couple dozen times that mass of Jupiter, and only a couple times the mass of Hot Jupiters. Some brown dwarfs have been found to have planets. Taking a look at some examples: 

More accurate measurements have been made since then, but the general shape is still applicable. The warm neutral medium occupies the area near the sharp change at around $\sim10,000\text{ K}$, and the cold neutral medium occupies the area in the left of the diagram. Another way to visualize this is on a $\log P/\log n$ diagram like this one (from these slides, annotated from Wolfire et al. (1995)): 

I only have time for a partial answer, so I'll discuss the bit about rotating the comet. We have to do some calculations with radiation pressure, the force on an object from light.$^1$ This pdf has some good starting calculations, although they assume that the source is spherical - the Sun. Our laser clearly is not. However, the beam will diverge over such a long distance, so I'll have to use a substitution (given by CountIblis). The force due to radiation pressure is $$F_{\text{rad}}=\frac{2I}{c}A$$ where $I$ is the intensity, $c$ is the ubiquitous speed of light, and $A$ is the area onto which the force is applied. However, $$I=\frac{\text{power}}{4 \pi r^2}$$ so we get $$F_{\text{rad}}=\frac{\text{power}\times A}{2 \pi r^2c}$$ The $4 \pi$ has to be replaced (by CountIblis' substitution) with $$\Omega=\pi \left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)^2$$ For an ideal laser, $$\alpha=2.44\frac{\lambda}{d}$$ where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $d$ is the initial beam diameter. Let's assume that our laser has a power output of one megawatt - the COIL laser, from a Boeing YAL-1, as per Randall Munroe's idea. $1,000,000 \text{ watts}$ is a lot from a laser. Let's also assume that no power is lost. For COIL, $\lambda=1.315 \times 10^{-6}$ and $d=0.1016 \text{ meters}$. This gives an $\alpha$ of $3.158070866 \times 10^{-5}$, and thus an $\Omega$ of $7.83309915 \times 10^{-10}$. Philae is currently on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which has, on its longest side, a surface area (combined lobes) of about $19,370,000 \text{ meters}$. However, it's about $310,000,000 \text{ miles}$ from Earth, which is $4.9879 \times 10^{11} \text{ meters}$. Knowing that, to rotate the comet, we have to apply force on only half the area of one side, we find that this laser would apply a force of $$F_{\text{rad}}=\frac{1,000,000 \text{ watts}\times 9,685,000\text{ meters}^2}{7.83309915 \times 10^{-10} \times 2.487914641 \times 10^{23} \text{ meters} \times 299,792,458 \text{ meters/second}}$$ $$=1.65771483 \times 10^{-10} \text{ Newtons}$$ Yep, we're not rotating a comet any time soon. I'll try to add in the bit about recharging Philae by laser sometime later. I do think that will be a lot more plausible. 

White dwarfs are not formed from supernovae, but from stars that (relatively) gently shed their outer layers to form planetary nebulae. So no, the stellar remnant will not have gone supernova already. Back to the main question. If a white dwarf exists, its mass is less than the Chandrasekhar limit. To surpass that, it needs to gain mass. This can happen in binary systems where the white dwarf accretes matter from the more massive star (generally a giant). The white dwarf can then undergo a Type Ia supernova and explode. The light curve will look a bit like this: 

More recent results (Buckley et al. (2017)) indicate that the radio emissions from the system are polarized, similar to those of neutron stars. It seems that AR Sco shares even more characteristics with pulsars than was previously thought. 

The cause of this phenomenon is the tilt of the Earth's axis. As the Earth revolves around the Sun, the tilt changes, the seasons progress, and more or less sunlight hits a given region of Earth, depending on where it is and which way the axis is tilted. This tilt means that the Sun appears to be at a different angle in the sky, which in turn means that in winter, the Sun appears lower in the sky. In summer, the Sun appears higher in the sky. So as September progresses, the Sun should start getting lower and lower. This graphic sums it up: 

This is an excellent question. Think about the way in which emission happens. $\text{H}\alpha$ emission happens when an electron makes a transition from the third energy level to the second, emitting a photon in the process with the energy equivalent to the difference of the energies of the two states, roughly $1.9\text{ eV}$. There's a lot of hydrogen in emission nebulae - and in nebulae in general - and so it plays an important role in the emission spectrum. Emission from $[\text{O III}]$ comes from a different process: collisions. Free electrons with energies of $\sim1\text{ eV}$ - about the amount of the oxygen's low excitation potential - collide with oxygen atoms. This produces forbidden lines that would otherwise have been unlikely to be created, as the ionizing photons typically would not have the right energies. Therefore, doubly-ionized oxygen (in particular) becomes extremely important in spectra, generally second only in intensity to $\text{H}\alpha$. Given that $[\text{O III}]$ emission is collision-based, it makes sense that there is a temperature dependence - which there is, as is the case with $[\text{N II}]$ lines and is responsible for their high intensities. Conditions in many hot nebulae (in this case, $>10,000\text{ K}$) are right for such collisions and thus forbidden line emission. Hot host stars can sometimes help achieve high electron temperatures. 

The question seems to be based on some misconceptions, so I'll try to clear them up. Dark matter is not the same as dark energy. Dark matter and dark energy are two completely separate and unrelated concepts. It's unfortunate that many articles trying to entice readers with tales of the unexplored frontiers of astronomy tend to use the phrase "dark matter and dark energy" quite a lot, typically with the buzzwords "mysterious," "unknown," and even "spooky." Obviously, the best introduction here is to read the Wikipedia articles on dark matter and dark energy. You can also see the dark-matter and dark-energy tags (and the questions that use them) for more information. Physics also has some good questions about these topics. I'll give you the important points:
