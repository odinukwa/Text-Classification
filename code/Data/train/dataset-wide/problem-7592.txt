Maybe It is time to sum up the work that has been down up to now : Let $X$ and $Y$ be normed spaces, and $f$ a function $X\to Y$. Denote by $\cal C$ the condition "$||x-y|| = n\in \mathbb N \Rightarrow ||f(x)-f(y)|| = n$". 1) If $\dim(X)=1$, no proper condition can be added to $\cal C$, and even to the stronger condition set by the asker, that would imply that $f$ be an isometry (MikeTex) ; 2) If $\dim(X) > 1$, then $f$ is an isometry if and only if $f$ is continuous and fulfills the condition "$||f(kx)-f(ky)|| = k||f(x)-f(y)||$ for every $x,y$, and every $k\in \mathbb N$" (MikeTex) ; 3) If $X$ and $Y$ are Hilbert space and $\dim(X)>1$, then condition $\cal C$ implies that $f$ is an isometry (Terry Tao) ; 4) More generally, if $\dim(X)>1$ and $Y$ is strictly convex, then condition $\cal C$ implies that $f$ is an isometry (Eric Wofsey). It is interresting that the additional condition $||f(x)-f(y)|| = n \Rightarrow ||x-y|| = n$ present in the question of the asker has not been used in the argument of Eric Wofsey (hence is unnecessary, if used, in the argument of Terry Tao). The question is now : can this additional condition be used in order to weaken the assumptions of Eric and Terry. 

As pointed out above, the answer of Count Dracula is also valid, mutatis mutandis, if one desires counter-examples where the field extensions are of characteristic $p>2$. It turns out that it can also be adapted to provide an example where the characteristic of the base field extension is $0$, and is $2$ for the residual field extension. Here is how: Let $R={\mathbb Z}[t_i, x_i, i\in \mathbb N]$, and $L$ the fraction field of $R$. Define the order 2 automorphism $\sigma$ of $R$ by $\sigma(z\in \mathbb Z)=z$, $\sigma(t_i) = t_i$ and $\sigma(x_i) = t_i-x_i$. Let $S$ be the fixed sub-ring under the action, and $K$ its fraction field. Then $\sigma$ extends to a $K$-automorphism of $L$ in an obvious manner, hence $[L:K]=2$ by Galois theory. $R$ is integrally closed (since factorial), and is integral over $S$ because every $f\in R$ satisfies an integral dependance relation over $S$ of the form $(X-f)(X-\sigma f)=0$. It follows easily that $S$ must be integrally closed too. We consider the ideals ${\frak P} =(2,t_i)\subset R$, and ${\frak p} = S\cap {\frak P}\subset S$. It is not difficult to see that $\frak P$, and hence $\frak p$, is prime. Now, as in the proof of Count Dracula, we see that $f\in R$ can be written $$f_0 + \sum_i t_i f_i + \hbox{terms multiples of $t_j t_k$},$$ where $f_0, f_i$ depends only on the $x_j$ (eventually, consider the polynomial $f_0$ lacunary in some variables, and add some null $f_i$ in order for the variables in all the $f_0,f_i$ to be the same). If $f\in S$, then $$ \sigma f(\star) = f_0(-\star) + \sum_i t_i(f_i(-\star) + {\partial f_0/\partial x_i}(-\star)) + \hbox{terms multiples of $t_j t_k$}.$$ Therefore $$\sum_i t_i \partial f_0/\partial x_i(-\star) = f_0(\star)-f_0(-\star) + \sum_i t_i(f_i(\star) - f_i(-\star)).$$ But $-1 = 1 \pmod2$ hence $ \partial f_0/\partial x_i = 0 \pmod2$. It follows, as in the proof of Count Dracula, that $A/{\frak p}={\mathbb F_2}(x_i^2)$, and that $B/{\frak P}={\mathbb F_2}(x_i)$ is infinite over $A/\frak p$. Considering finitely many variables, it can be shown similarly that $[L:K]=2$ is not divisible by $[B/{\frak P}:A/\frak p]$. NOTE: to obtain a more general counter-example, it suffices to consider the order $p$ automorphism $$\sigma(t_i)=t_i,\quad \sigma(z\in {\mathbb Z}[\zeta])=z,\quad \sigma(x_i)= t_i+\zeta x_i,$$ where $\zeta$ is a p-root of unity. The adaptations are straightforward, except, perhaps, the fact that the ideal $(2,t_i)$ must be replaced by the ideal ${\frak P}= (1-\zeta, t_i)$ and not $(p,t_i)$: this is because $(1-\zeta)$ is the only maximal ideal above $(p)$ in ${\mathbb Z}[\zeta]$. 

It sounds like you also want an introduction to differential geometry, as well as a good grounding in ODE's. As an undergraduate, I had Martin Braun's book on differential equations and their applications, and Barrett O'Neill's Elementary Differential Geometry. They should be quite approachable, and a thorough reading should give you enough background for later courses. I recommend doing some of the computations, because knowing some of the numerical analysis issues can be important, even though they are addressed less than superficially if at all in these books. Also, it's important that you "feel you could start doing calculus on a Moebius strip", at least locally, even if you don't actually do it. Such a feeling can give one comfort when one approaches the subject in depth. I missed having such a bedrock in some of my analysis/PDE courses; this may be why I ended up doing more algebra and logic instead. Gerhard "Ask Me About System Design" Paseman, 2010.06.18 

Humbled by Dietrich Burde's example, here is my motivation for saying that there won't be many such. Consider $\sigma(n)/n$. This is bounded above by a number I will call $P(n)$ and define as $P(n) = \prod_{0 \lt i \leq \omega(n)} \frac{p_i}{p_i - 1}$, which involves the smallest primes $p_i$. Note that when $\omega(n) \gt 4, P(n) \lt \omega(n).$ So any hope of the first equation having a solution implies that $n$ has at most 4 distinct prime factors. The case when $\omega(n)=2$ nicely captures the even perfect numbers, so let us move on to $\omega(n)=4$. Using the finer inequality $\sigma(n)/n \lt \prod_{p |n, p \text{ prime}}\frac{p}{p-1}$ gives $n = 2^a3^b5^cp^d$ for some prime p and positive integers $a,b,c$ and $d$, and further $15p/4(p-1) \gt 4$, so $p \lt 16$. Now that we have a limit on p, we can use Zsigmondy's theorem and multiplicativity of $\sigma(p^k) = \frac{p^{k+1} - 1}{p - 1}$ to limit the exponents $a,b,c$ and $d$ to at most $6$. So there will be at most finitely many cases to check. More on the finitely many cases later. For $\omega(n)=3$, a similar analysis implies $n=2^a3^bp^c$, although there seem to be more primes $p$ to check. However, appealing to Zsigmondy again gives bounds on the exponents, and again there will be finitely many cases. Having exhausted myself before the exhaustive search, I will report back later with additional findings. EDIT 2013.05.16 So I was right, but in a somewhat surprising fashion. There are finitely many cases to check, it can be done by hand, Zsigmondy's theorem can help, and there are examples, two for $\omega(n)=3,$ and one for $\omega(n)=4$. In the 4 case, as noted above $p$ is one of $7, 11,$ or $13$, and then one computes $\sigma(p^d)$ and notes those whose prime factors fall in the set of primes at most 5. Zsigmondy's theorem says we can restrict our attention to $d \lt 5$. This leaves $p^d$ being one of $7, 11,$ or $343$. Then one computes $\sigma(q^k)$ for $q=2,3,5$ to ensure its prime power factors do not lie outside of $2^x,3^y,5^z,$ or one of the three choices for $p^d$. Zsigmondy tells us we can stop bumping up $k$ once we've seen all the small primes as factors for each $q$, which is at most 9 when $q=2$, and smaller for the other choices of $q$. After doing this, we rule out 11 as a candidate for $p^d$, and find that $3^b=3^3$ and $5^c=5^1$, leaving $2^a$ to determine. Since $p=7$, this leads quickly to $a=5$ and $d=1$, so $30240$ is the unique example with 4 distinct prime factors. In the 3 case, Zsigmondy tells us that if $\sigma(2^a3^bp^c) =2^a3^bp^c3 $ for some prime p, then $c$ is at most 2. This is because $\sigma(p^c)$ will be divisible by some prime larger than $3$ when $p$ is a prime larger than 3 and $c$ is larger than 2. But $\sigma(p^2)= p^2+p+1$ is odd and congruent to 3 mod 9, and cannot be of the form $2^x3^y$ for large enough $x$ and $y$. So as a result, $c=1$, and we now must have $\sigma(2^a)$ being a power of 3 or $\sigma(3^b)$ being a power of 2, each of which relates to a simple case of the Catalan conjecture (or use Zsigmondy yet again to bound either $a$ or $b$). It develops that $b=1$ and then $p \lt 9$ and one quickly finds the examples 120 and 672. END EDIT 2013.05.16 Gerhard "Off To Find More Coffee" Paseman, 2013.05.14 

Just for completeness, here's another argument without spectral sequences via rational homotopy theory. Recall a theorem of Hopf, which states that the rational cohomology of a path-connected H-space of finite rational cohomology type (finite dimensional rational cohomology in each degree) is a free graded commutative graded algebra (cga) $(\wedge V,0)$ (The reason is, that the cohomology has a Hopf algebra structure.) This applies to a compact lie group $G$ and implies immediately, that the rational cohomology serves as a minimal model of $G$ and since the cohomology of a compact Lie group is finite dimensional, $V$ has to be concentrated in odd degrees. The long exact sequence of the universal fibration $G\rightarrow EG\rightarrow BG$ shows, that $\pi_i(BG)\cong\pi_{i-1}(G)$ since $EG$ is contractible. Recall that the minimal model of a space $X$ is a cdga whose underlying cga is the free cga generated by $\pi_*(X)\otimes\mathbb{Q}$ with a differential $d$, i.e. has the shape $(\wedge(\pi_*(X)\otimes\mathbb{Q}),d)$, so the minimal model of $BG$ has the shape $(\wedge(\pi_{*+1}(G)\otimes\mathbb{Q}),d)$. Since the minimal model of $G$ is concentrated in odd degrees, the one of $BG$ is concentrated in even degrees, so the differential must vanish for degree reasons and the minimal model of $BG$ is just $(\wedge(\pi_{*+1}(G)\otimes\mathbb{Q}),0)$. Since the cohomology of the minimal model of a space is the cohomology of the space, we get the claim. 

Let $M$ and $W$ be smooth manifolds (possibly with boundary) and $V\subseteq W$ a submanifold. We have a map between embedding spaces $$Emb(W,M)\rightarrow Emb(V,M)$$ given by restriction. Richard Palais proved around 1960 that if all manifolds have no boundary, $V$ is compact and the embedding spaces are equipped with the weak Whitney $C^{\infty}$-topology, then this is a fiber bundle, in particular a Serre fibration. (The path-lifting property of the fibration reflects the isotopy extension theorem.) In conclusive remarks (section 6 of the cited paper), he mentions that the result is also true allowing $W$ and $V$ to have boundary but still insisting on $V$ being compact and $M$ having no boundary. It is said that these results will appear, among others, in a joint paper with Morris Hirsch. It seems to me that this paper was never published. 

As Eric Tressler mentioned in the comments, you could use bucket sort which essentially means (by somehow using knowledge of f()) for each b, place b in the list at hash index f(b), then starting at the max index and looping down, use the list to update the values needed. While this does not directly compare values of f, it does assume some external ordering to the set of values which is accessible to the loop, and for me seems like an implicit comparison. Further, there are f for which you will need to loop through all the values before getting enough info to fill in for all the v_n. Even if f satisfies your condition that it is injective, you may still need to go through half the values, which for bucket sort gets prohibitive even for n above 25. If you don't know enough about f, you have to look at all of the values to find the largest one. Once you have the set of b for which f(b) is largest, say it has s-many such b, you have enough information to fill in about n + lg(s) instances of the max subexpressions for v_n, where I use lg to be log in base 2 rounded down to the nearest integer. While it may be possible to memoize and save on f(b) comparisons, a straightforward algorithm gives the result after at most (n+1)2^n comparisons, and minor modifications might get the (n+1) factor down to (1+lgn), but not without a lot of additional comparisons of values of b or parts of b. I recommend tracking the k largest useful values to start, for some small value of k < 2n, and iterating through the necessary b. You can repeat this as often as needed to resolve unknown values of v_n. Like Douglas Zare, I would appreciate more context. I would like to know if this is homework-related before sharing any more on this problem. Gerhard "Ask Me About System Design" Paseman, 2013.04.22 

Not an answer, but a formulation of the problem in term of additive number theory (this is probably what the tag of the post suggested). It is clear that a sufficient condition for $k$ to be "magical" is that there exists a subset $A$ of $\{0,1,2,\ldots, k-1\} \mod k$ such that, the multiset $A - A$ is composed of a certain number of copies of $0$, and of another number of copies of $\{1,2,\ldots,k-1\}$ (this condition is also necessary if $k$ is prime). In other words, $A$ is a so called "$\lambda$-difference set" of the additive groupe ${\mathbb Z}/k\mathbb Z$ (notice that I have in fact shown in the previous answer that $\lambda$-difference sets exist for all primes $k=-1\mod 4$ (Paley difference set). Notice also that this condition is realized if $A$ is a perfect difference set modulo $k$, and these are known to exist whenever $k$ is of the form $r^2+r+1$ and $r$ is a power of some prime $p$. But this condition is not necessary if $k$ is not prime : in this case, it is sufficient to replace the copies of $\{1,2,\ldots,k-1\}$ (related to the non-zero $x$ powers of the polynomial $m(1+x+x^2\cdots+x^{k-1})$, $m\in \mathbb N$)) by a subset comming from the non-zero $x$ powers a polynomial of the form $R(x)\Phi(x)$, where $\Phi$ is the kth cyclotomic polynomial, and $R$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients and of degree at most $k-1-\deg(\Phi)$. 

Here's an argument that works in the non simply-connected case and avoids the universal cover and spectral sequences assuming the existence of rationalizations. Assume that $X$ has rational cohomology of finite type up to degree $n$. Choosing a basis for $\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n}V_i$ corresponds via the map $V\rightarrow H^*(X,\mathbb{Q})$ to a map of spaces $$f\colon X\rightarrow \Pi_{i=1}^{n}K(\mathbb{Q},i)^{dim(V_i)}.$$ The induced map in rational cohomology $$\mathbb{Q}[\bigoplus_{i=1}^{n}V_i]\cong H^*(\Pi_{i=1}^{n}K(\mathbb{Q},i)^{dim(V_i)},\mathbb{\mathbb{Q}})\rightarrow H^*(X,\mathbb{Q})$$ is an iso up to degree $n$ by assumption. Therefore, it is also an iso on rational homology in these degrees. Since $X$ is a simple space, it's rationalization $X_\mathbb{Q}$ exists and we conclude that $$f_\mathbb{Q}\colon X_\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow\Pi_{i=1}^{n}K(\mathbb{Q},i)^{dim(V_i)}$$ is an iso on integer homology up to degree $n$, hence on homotopy groups up to degree $n$, hence $f$ induces an iso on rational homotopy groups up to degree $n$. Therefore $$\Omega f\colon\Omega X\rightarrow \Pi_{i=1}^{n}K(\mathbb{Q},i-1)^{dim(V_i)}$$ induces an iso on rational homotopy groups up to degree $n-1$. So does $$\Omega_\bullet X\rightarrow \Pi_{i=2}^{n}K(\mathbb{Q},i-1)^{dim(V_i)}$$ by restricting to path components. By doing the same reasoning as before backwards, this map induces an iso on rational cohomology up to degree $n-1$, hence $$\mathbb{Q}[s^{-1}(V)]\cong H^*(\Omega_\bullet X,\mathbb{Q})$$ up to degree $n-1$ as desired. 

As John Klein remarked, the answer to this question will depend on the classifying space functor $B$ one uses. Let me present one case for which the question can be answered positive which is basically the case Dan Ramras mentioned. We define $BG$ for a topological group $G$ to be the fat realization of the simplicial space obtained by applying the topological nerve construction to the topological category one obtains by regarding $G$ as a category in the usual way and including its topology. (See Segal's 'Classifying Spaces and Spectral Sequences' §3) A continuous group homomorphism $G\rightarrow H$ which is a homotopy equivalence will induce a morphism of the corresponding simplicial spaces which is a degreewise homotopy equivalence. (This is easy to check, right from the definitions.) Since we have chosen the fat realization the induced map $BG\rightarrow BH$ will be a homotopy equivalence by Proposition A.1 in Appendix A in Segal's 'Catgeories and Cohomology Theories'. Up here, no point-set topological restrictions are needed, it even all works if the spaces are not compactly generated. In the last paper cited, you'll also find information about the question, in which cases the fat realization is homotopy equivalent to the usual one. In the case of well pointed compactly generated groups, their simplicial nerves will be "good" in the sense of Segal. A survey on the results of that manner is given here. 

If you consider ways of going backwards, i.e. finding a point set that realizes a given shadow, I expect you will find many ways of getting non-inherited symmetries. Fascinated as I am by constellations, I sometimes remember that Orion's belt is not three stars almost in a row, but three stars that look to me like they are in a row. Similarly, take any 2-D symmetric configuration of points, and throw some of them straight up into 3-D at different heights, you will get a configuration of points which has few if any symmetries. About the only thing that you can depend on is that each such collection of symmetries for a point set will be a group. I expect many other possible things to be realized. If you place certain restrictions on the original point set, you may get a theorem. The only thing I see is that the full symmetric group contains the group of the shadow which in turn contains the group of the original point set.

I made a post to sci.math regarding this question. You might check that post for some suggestions. Others might check the thread for more history on that problem. Gerhard "Ask Me About System Design" Paseman, 2010.02.18 

I agree with Andreas Blass: the best notion depends on what you need to do. If you are going to do many general algebraic constructions, you might benefit from George Graetzer's classic textbook "Universal Algebra", which develops much theory starting from partial algebras. My hunch is he uses your 1) to build varieties of partial semigroups, but you should check it out for yourself. Gerhard "Ask Me About System Design" Paseman, 2013.03.05 

To avoid leaving this question open: Assuming we work in the category of compactly generated spaces, geometric realization commutes with pullbacks.(It's crucial that we use the compactly generated product.) The proof is basically the same as for simplicial sets. A reference in the space-case is Corollary 11.6 of Peter May's book 'The Geometry of Iterated Loop Space'. The terminal object is preserved as well, so the claim follows by abstract nonsense, since a functor preserves all finite limits iff it preserves pullbacks and the terminal object. 

Has a proof of the announced result been published elsewhere in the meanwhile? Does it fail for $M$ having boundary or $V$ being noncompact? If so, is the map still a fibration? I am especially interested in the case of $V,M,W$ all being compact and with boundary. 

Since my comment answered Emanuele Dotto's answer, I post it as an answer: Stefan Schwede discusses equivariant bordism in his book project about global homotopy theory in detail. 

I am trying to better understand these two claims. Lawson and Michelson simply write in their book "Spin Geometry", that (2) follows from "deep work of Adams and Milnor". Since I am absolutely not an expert in this field, can someone elaborate a bit (more than "It follows from the work of Adams and Milnor.", what is not really helpful for me.) on what I really need to prove (2) and how one can place it in a wider context? How can one prove (1) and is there a reference for it? I searched the literature without good results, so simply giving references might also answer my question.
