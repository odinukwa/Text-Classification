Like a large glider than can reach 10km in altitude and glide a distance of 1000km ? Sounds fine to me. You really need to read up on gliding to develop this idea properly, IMO. But consider - what advantage or practical evolutionary niche is gliding or flying very high giving your creature ? 

You would need to create a gravitational field that you could control. There's no practical way to do this now. Future possibilities include making things like Kugelblitz black holes and/or doing some very complex things to create gravitational fields with very large amounts of energy or matter. These require enormous amounts of energy. They are barely conceivable now. Why would you do this ? You'd basically kill all life on the planet if you moved it. It would be a complicated way to commit planetary suicide. It's hard to imagine any population surviving long enough to develop this level of technology (if it's possible) and then being dumb enough to use it like that. 

... In a hail of fire which will ensure they're not going to reach any target, because pretty quickly word will spread that kamikaze goblins are active and it's shoot-on-sight time everywhere for any goblin. If they had it in an external container they could throw it when they were close enough, starting the fuse when they want to. But inside their bodies ??? If they're wounded approaching the enemy all they can do is die unless they could throw their stomachs (a rather revolving possibility which I suspect neither novel not video need explore). This is so counterproductive from a military standpoint. Strapping explosives outside your body : it works for humans, it will work for goblins. Why make it complicated ? 

As this is a reality check I'd say : Not possible. Your big problem is maintaining an air atmosphere (and I am presume something like Earth's). To do that you basically need a surface gravity of about one gee. Anything less and the atmosphere can escape into space over time. You are particularly constrained by requiring an air atmosphere and (at the same time) a liquid water ocean on the surface. This restricts the sizes you can get away with. To get that you need to account for the mass of the water and the air in the core. The gravity at the surface of the water will need to be about one gee. That gravity is given (approximately) by : $$g_e = G4\pi\sigma_{water}H_{water}+\frac {GM_{core}}{R_{core}^2}$$ You know $H_{water}\approx 305m$ and $\sigma_{water}\approx 1000\,kg\,m^{-3}$ so we get : $$\frac {GM_{core}}{R_{core}^2} \approx g_e$$ because the gravitational effect of the 1000 ft ocean is small. Note that the microgravity is a dead duck. The gravitational pull at the edge of the air core is one gee (or whatever we need to maintain an atmosphere outside) and will decrease slowly as we get to the interior. It will only be microgravity near the center of the core itself. This means we need either a very large or very dense core. As much as $4500$ times Earth's radius. But problem with that is preventing the gas in the interior from compressing. It simply will not stay at a nice even density - it will gravitationally collapse into a dense (probably liquid) inner core and a much less dense outer core. You'll end up with a mini gas planet inside a shell with no way to prevent them from destabilizing and "wobbling" into each other in the long run. The outer core won't have enough pressure to support the shell and prevent it "wobbling" (sorry to keep using that "technical" term :-)). Even if we ignore this and somehow (magically) give you a constant density in the core, the problem become that tunnel. That tunnel needs to be sealed, perhaps with an airlock like structure. Why ? To get an Earth-like atmosphere outside the sea you need a roughly Earth-like density for the air at the surface. To get that with an open tunnel you need the density of the air inside the core to be the same (not more, not less, but the same) or there will be a flow of air from one to the other. But a core density of $1.225\,kg\,m^{-3}$ (average surface air density on Earth) requires a radius for the core of $R_{core}\approx 2.7\times 10^{10}\,m$ which is about $4500$ Earth radii ! That's 45 times larger than the Sun's radius. That's impossibly large. The mass of the air core would be $1.32\times 10^{32}\,kg$ which is $60$ times the mass of the Sun. So what would happen the air in the core : it would collapse into a star (initially, probably) and then eventually become a black hole. Your shell would become a Dyson sphere orbiting a huge star at a distance I suspect would be inside the star's atmosphere. It would be vaporized. Now I do not think any combination of numbers will produce a stable (or even nearly stable) shell with an air core, water ocean and air atmosphere. Even if you seal the tunnel I don't see a way to avoid the liquid core happening (even if you can somehow avoid a star being created). 

Magic created this problem and it's (more or less) immune to tech and you won't let me kill people with runes (or tattoos ?), which is a bummer . That leaves us with more magic to fix this mess. So someone discovers runes that can be placed on things (buildings, packets of cornflakes, condoms, etc.). The runes protect the things from other magic (maybe up to some limit - maybe a thousand people can combine and overcome them or something like that). Maybe you can be permanently branded with a rune that disables the other runes. Useful for criminal types. 

Sell the business to someone else. Not joking - that's the only strategy that is 100% safe from this risk. 

This in no way has a connection with inheritance tax. Inheritance tax is supposed to affect the person inheriting, not the person who owned the property before they died. This idea doesn't make a lick of sense. "Everyone" ? Everyone does not have the option of selling their property at all as about one third of Americans do not own a home. And of those that have property to sell, many people find themselves trapped in properties that they would loose money on if they had to sell. This issue really only affects the upper middle class and the wealthy. As most people still owe money on their properties ( in the form of mortgages ) when they're fifty years old, I'd anticipate a great deal of property being rented out. As anyone nearing 50 would have an incentive to sell up and shift their money into other investments, this would artificially alter the amount of money directly invested in stocks and/or the growth of REITs ( Real Estate Investment Trusts ). However it's not desirable to force a huge section of the population to become renters. Renting is a very bad idea as you get no capital return for your money. The effect of increasing the number of older people who have to rent would be drastic as they would be reliant on less stable investments (stocks, etc.) for income to pay their rent. Experience has shown that this is not a good idea. In addition it makes people who are older even more vulnerable to becoming homeless. It would be a social disaster, in fact. People whose health would, as a matter of natural fact, be declining are now obliged to depend on the vagaries of the investment market to finance their old age. If they become ill, or unemployed before natural retirement age then they will suffer even more. Of course they could try not selling before 50, but this is very risky. If they have a downturn in their lives after 50 they can't sell up their one asset. It's also very unfair on couples who have different ages. So I'm Bob and I'm 53 and I'm married to Mary who is 49. I can't sell my "part" of the mutually mortgaged house we have, but Mary can ??? And what about the bank who holds the mortgage ? Does the bank's "age" matter ? Maybe my bank manager's age or the bank president's age ? If businesses can hold property regardless of age, then why can't we all set up companies to own our properties and rent them directly (REITs) ? Let's say Mary dies in a car crash one day. I'm now stuck with a property I may not be able to afford to pay for on my own, but can't sell. I also can't move (e.g. because it depresses me to be in the house we used to share or to be closer to our kids in another State). I'm trapped by a stupid law that will inevitably mean I end up loosing the property to the bank when they foreclose because I can't pay the mortgage on my own. But it's OK - I can become a pauper and a financial burden to my kids when I have to move in with them - if they'll let me or can do it at all. So it's a dumb idea. It's probably not legally doable and it's going to cause misery for practically everyone. Can I take it the Republican's are to blame as usual for a law that only benefits the rich ? :-) As for getting around this law. Which half of the population will "get around it" ? Well I think it's a safe bet the ones who are better off. They'll be able to access the lawyers and accountants and investment groups who avoid these laws. Poorer people typically will not be able to access these "services". So the poorer people will get totally screwed by this law and the well off will be inconvenienced. Yes, that sounds like America to me. :-) So net result : lots of emigration to Canada. :-) 

They can't get jobs ? They can't find some way to use their skills to generate income ? Just in terms of becoming delivery people in a city they'd clean up - no more bikes ! Police and medical flying units takes on a whole new meaning. And they have human brains. They can't use they for anything but diving off buildings in search of food ? And what food ? They're mostly human and they should end up with our very versatile digestive system. There's no reason theses creatures shouldn't be queuing up outside Italian restaurants (assuming the get work) or hanging out in the supermarket or in coffee shops.
