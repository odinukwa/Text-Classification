I understand why homology commutes with arbitrary direct sums when the direct sum of a collection of monics is a monic (i.e the direct sum functor is exact) but I was under the impression that there were abelian categories where the direct sum functor is not exact. After a bit of thought, I realised that I don't know an example of an abelian category in which the coproduct functor is not exact. Sheaves of abelian groups on a fixed topological space give an example of an abelian category in which the product functor is not exact. 

Let $X$ be an affine variety and $A$ its coordinate ring. Then a $ \mathbb{Z} $ grading on $A$ is the same thing as a $ \mathbb{G}_m = k^{\times} $ action on $X$. If $Y$ is a closed subvariety cut out by the ideal $I$, then $I$ is graded if and only if $Y$ is invariant under the torus action. This should give you some intuition for graded ideals: they are exactly those which cut out torus invariant subvarieties. 

The version of the Baire Category Theorem I have in mind is the statement that a countable intersection of dense open subsets of a complete metric space is dense. The question is: is it likewise true that the countable intersection of dense open subsets of a complete uniform space is dense? A look at the proof suggests that the answer should be no---it makes crucial use of the fact that the canonical uniform structure on a metric space is generated by the $\varepsilon$-balls of radius $\frac{1}{m}$ for $m\ \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. I thus started looking at complete topological groups that were not first-countable for a counter-example, with no luck (topological groups because they provide easy examples of uniform spaces, and not first-countable because first-countable topological groups have uniformities generated by a countable collection of covers (and also because (I think?) first-countable topological groups are metrizable).) Surprisingly, a quick Google search only pulled up one source that seems to mention this at all---Joshi in his Introduction to General Topology states (pg. 363) 

I know very little about how computers work, so please excuse my ignorance! I think of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler as a program that eats up extensional type theory and spits out a program which can be run on my computer. 

Motivation for the question: I have a standard working knowledge of sheaves. Given a scheme, a coherent module over its structure sheaf and a few hours I can compute things. Despite this I have always been unsure how to prove that the category of sheaves has all the properties which I know about. Whenever I try and prove foundational results about sheaves, I end up producing circular arguments. The reason this happens is because for me, it is impossible to think about sheaves without my intuition kicking in. This is great for geometry, but not so great when I am trying to explain why you can check exactness at a local or stalk level to someone who is just starting Hartshorne. I always end up saying "it's just true!" or "its a standard exercise" which is never a good thing in mathematics. I suspect the issue is that I don't really know how to prove that sheaves of abelian groups form an abelian category (at least i got stuck trying to do this). 

For what it's worth, the motivation is that this colimit is the usual definition of the sheaf on a not-necessarily-open subset $K$ (or if you like, the global sections of the inverse image sheaf under the inclusion $K\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$), and so it would be nice if this colimit had a relatively concrete description. 

For $K\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ compact, let $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)$ denote the space of smooth functions on (an open neighborhood of) $K$ with compact support contained in $K$ with the usual Fréchet space subspace topology inherited from $C^{\infty}(K)$, and denote by $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)^*$ the dual with the Mackey topology (or, equivalently, the strong polar topology). For $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ open, let $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)$ denote the LF-space of smooth functions with compact support contained in $U$, and denote by $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)^*$ the space of generalized-functions on $U$, again, with the Mackey topology (or equivalently the strong polar topology). If $K\subseteq U$, we have extension-by-zero maps $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)\rightarrow C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)$, and we thereby obtain restriction maps $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)^*\rightarrow C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)^*$. 

but yet does not provide a counter-example either. Also, I doubt this will make too much of a difference, but I would prefer the counter-example to be $T_0$. Finding an example of a highly pathological space that is, uhh, pathological, isn't exactly what I'm looking for. 

I understand the intuition behind this result: Since the open sets are so big, the scheme $$ \varprojlim_{p \in U\subseteq X \; \text{open}} U $$ captures a lot of infomation about $X$ at the point $p$. I can imagine a proof which goes like this: We can assume without loss of generality that the varieties in question are affine. Therefore we are reduced to proving that an isomorphism $ R_{\mathfrak{p}} \to S_{\mathfrak{q}}$ of rings induces an isomorphism $ R_f \to S_g$ for suitable elements $f \notin \mathfrak{p} $ and $ g \notin \mathfrak{q} $. This approach is a bit disappointing in my opinion because the result is so geometric and we reduce it to a formal proof about localization. 

The following is paraphrased from Lee's introduction to topological manifolds: "A Fundamental fact about continuous functions is the extreme value theorem: A continuous real valued function on a closed bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$ attains its maximum and minimum values. The proof of this result hinges on the compactness of closed bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. This indicates that one might be able to formulate the extreme value theorem in more general situations, and it might be fruitful to study the notion of compactness further." My guess is that there is no really simple way to motivate the modern definition compactness. Does anyone know when the modern definition appeared? Im guessing that the definition of sequential compactness appeared before the definition of compactness Edit: The History behind the definition of compactness is given on the wikipedia page. 

(There are of course left and two-sided versions of the above definitions.) It is well-known that every field possesses an algebraic-closure, which is unique up to (nonunique) isomorphism. What about division rings? 

In what follows, $x$ is always taken to commute with the coefficient ring. This means that for any given polynomial, you can put the coefficients to the right or the left of $x$ as you please. This doesn't make a difference to the ring itself, but it will make a difference for the roots: a right root is an element that yields zero upon evaluation when you write $x$ to the right of the coefficients. (Similarly for left root. I suppose a two-sided root would be an element that is both a right and a left root.) For example, $\mathrm{j}$ is a right root but not a left root of the following polynomial (working in the quaternions). $$ \mathrm{i}x-\mathrm{k}. $$ 

I have recently been interested in studying an extension of 'usual' algebraic geometry to take into account the topology of $R$ in the definition of the affine scheme $\mathrm{Spec}\, (R)$ when the ring comes equipped with a given topology. For example, I am curious to investigate schemes over $C ^\infty (\mathbb{R}^d)$, where it is obvious from the beginning that it would be 'wrong' to ignore the canonical Fréchet space topology (for example, the 'correct' definition of $\mathrm{Spec}\, (R)$ in this case should probably be the collection of all closed prime ideals). (Part of the motivation for this is, in the spirit of Grothendieck's famous quote, to replace a bad category of only good objects (the smooth category) with a good category containing some bad objects.) I can't imagine that people haven't investigated things like this before. On the other hand, I don't know what this subject would be called, and so I don't know where to begin looking to read up on the subject. Could someone help point me in the right direction? 

Let $M$ be a manifold and $\pi : E \to M$ a rank $n$ vector bundle on $M$. We can define a connection on $E$ in two ways: 

In a problem I am trying to solve, the following situation occurs. $X$ is a smooth variety and $G$ is a reductive group acting transitively on $X$. We have the stack $X/G$ and a morphism $\pi : X \to X / G$. Fix a basepoint $* \in X$ and let $H$ be the stabilizer of $*$. I don't know much about stacks but I was wondering if the following statements are correct and if someone could give me a reference where I can read about them: 

Most books on commutative algebra explain Grobner bases in the non graded case and minimal free resolutions in the local case. I like projective geometry and want to compute the minimal free resolution of a coherent sheaf on projective space. What follows is my understanding of how this should work, along with some points at which I am confused: We are given a coherent sheaf $ \mathscr{F}$ on $ \mathbb{P}^n$ via generators and relations. That is, we have an exact sequence $$ \oplus \mathscr{O}(-b^2_{p}) \to \oplus \mathscr{O}(-b^1_{p}) \to \mathscr{F} \to 0 $$ with $ b^2_{p} \geq b^1_{q} $ for each $ p,q$. The first map in this sequence is given by a matrix $ (F_{ij})$ of homogeneous polynomials such that $ F_{ij}$ has degree $ b^2_j - b^1_i$. For the resolution which we are going to compute to be minimal we want $b_p^2 > b^1_q$ for each $p,q$. This brings us to our first question: 

If $x:\Lambda \rightarrow X$ is a net in a topological space $X$ and $\Lambda '\subseteq \Lambda$ is a cofinal subset of the directed set $\Lambda$, then $x|_{\Lambda '}$ is a subnet of $x$. We call subnets of this form strict subnets. Of course, not all subnets are of this form, and indeed, the definition of a subnet is chosen the way it is in part so that certain theorems we would like to be true are in fact true. I am in particular curious about the following standard theorem. 

What I have in mind is the following: a (sequence of) functor(s) $K_\bullet$ on the category of topological $^*$-algebras (with values in the category of commutative groups) that satisfies (among other properties one would wish a $K$-theory functor to possess) (i) $K_\bullet (A)=K_\bullet ^{\text{op}}(A)$ when $A$ is a $C^*$-algebra and (ii) $K_\bullet (A)=K_\bullet ^{\text{alg}}(A)$ when $A$ has involution the identity and the discrete topology. As a matter of fact, a quick skim of the construction of $K_0^{\text{op}}(A)$ (as the grothendieck group of unitary equivalence classes of projections in $M_\infty (A)$) seems as if would work verbatim for an arbitrary topological $^*$-algebra, and furthermore, would give the same definition in the case of involution the identity and the discrete topology (this uses the fact that if self-adjoint elements are conjugate, then they are in fact unitarily equivalent). (I suppose one possible issue with extending this to the higher $K$-groups in the most obvious way is determining the 'right' topology to put on the tensor product of topological $^*$-algebras in order to define the suspension.) Does there exist such an extension? If not, why not? If so, is there a reference?
