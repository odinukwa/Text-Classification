This is only a very partial answer but is a short argument to show that this is true in $\mathrm{SL}_d(\mathbf{R})$, namely that if any two subsets $X_1,X_2$ of the set $D$ of diagonal matrices have the same connected centralizers in $\mathrm{SL}_d(\mathbf{R})$ then they have the same centralizer. Indeed let $A_i$ be the subalgebra generated by $X_i$. A simple observation is that the (unital) $\mathbf{R}$-subalgebras of $D\simeq\mathbf{R}^d$ (product of rings) are classified by equivalence relations on $\{1,\dots,d\}$, namely if $R$ is such an equivalence relation, then $D_R=\{(x_1,\dots,x_d):x_i=x_j$ whenever $i\,R\,j\}$ is a subalgebra and these are the only ones. Since the centralizer of $X_i$ is the same as the centralizer of $A_i$, to conclude it is enough to check that for any two distinct equivalence relations $R,R'$ the connected centralizers of $D_R$ and $D_{R'}$ are distinct and this is easy: for $R$, the centralizer is the set of determinant one matrices withs diagonal blocks along the $R$-decomposition, and the connected centralizer is the set for which all diagonal blocks have positive determinant, and this clearly remembers $R$. Maybe a similar approach can be done with other groups, at least for linear ones, using a linear embedding (the above argument always shows that there are only finitely many subgroups occurring as a centralizer of a subset of a connected Cartan subgroup!). Note that the case of $\mathrm{SL}_d$ does not imply the case of groups locally isomorphic to $\mathrm{SL}_d$, so for example $\mathrm{PSL}_d(\mathbf{R})$ for even $d$ should be checked. 

First, several bullet points in your question are nontrivial results. However, there is another way to see $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}$ does not holds in $L(\mathbb{R})$. Using a two step game, you can show $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}$ can prove uniformization for all sets of reals. Consider the relation $R(x,y)$ if and only if $y$ is not ordinal definable from $x$. Assuming that $L(\mathbb{R}) \models \mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}$, $R$ would have a uniformization. Every set of reals in $L(\mathbb{R})$ is ordinal definable from some real. Use this real to get a contradiction by diagonalization. Also note that if you put the discrete topology on $\mathbb{R}$, a two point game is a closed game. Hence $\mathsf{ZF + AD}$ can not prove the Gale-Stewart theorem (closed determinacy) for games on $\mathbb{R}$. Of course, this is because there is no well-ordering of $\mathbb{R}$. 

Another way to see this: If $A$ is closed, Borel, or analytic in code $x$ and $A$ is countable, then $A$ consists entirely of $x$-hyperarithmetic elements. This means, let $\omega_1^x$ be the sup of $x$-computable ordinals. Then $A \subseteq L_{\omega_1^x}[x]$, a level of Godel constructible hierarchy. In $V[G]$, if $A$ is analytic in parameter $x \in V$ and $A$ is countable, then $A \subseteq L[x] \subseteq V$. So $A$ has only ground model elements. 

(After the discussion in the comments.) $BS(m,n)$ is bi-orderable iff $mn>0$ and $\min(|m|,|n|)=1$. Since it was already mentioned that $mn<0$ implies $BS(m,n)$ not bi-orderable and that $BS(1,n)$ is bi-orderable for all $n\ge 2$, all remains is to check that $2\le m\le n$ implies $BS(m,n)=\langle t,x\mid tx^mt^{-1}=x^n\rangle$ is not bi-orderable. Define $y=txt^{-1}$. Then $y^m=x^n$. So $x$ commutes with $y^m$. So (*) $x$ commutes with $y$. But this is not the case. (*) in a biorderable group, as mentioned by Salvo, $[X,Y^m]=1$, $m\ge 1$ implies $[X,Y]=1$, because otherwise if $XY<YX$, $X^mY<X^{m-1}YX<\dots<YX^m$ and similarly $YX<XY$ implies $YX^m<X^mY$. 

Edit: (Jan 25' 2018) Thinking a little about the remaining cases $p=3,5$, they seem different and deserve separate additional comments: first recall by above remark that for any odd $p$, the nilpotency length of any example should be $\ge 3$. 

Let $X$ be a countable compact Hausdorff space consisting of a unique accumulation point $0$ with discrete complement $X'$. Let $j$ be a bijection $\mathbf{N}\to X'\times\mathbf{N}$. For $n\in\mathbf{N}$, write $F_n=\{(0,n),j(n)\}$. This is a 2-element subset of $X\times\mathbf{N}$. Then $(F_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}}$ is a countable closed partition of the Hausdorff locally compact space $X\times\mathbf{N}$, and none of the $F_n$ is clopen. (If we 1-point compactify, and add $F_\infty=\{\infty\}$, we even have a compact example, homeomorphic to $X^2$.) 

In every case, unless $G$ is false, $G$ is amenable to proof, but the proof will have to assume axioms that are strong enough to prove the desired conclusion. There is no sentence which could "never actually be proved", although there are plenty of sentences that cannot be proved in PA, and false sentences can only be proved from false axioms. The question is simply which axioms are required to prove a particular sentence. 

The statement in question can be formalized in the language of Peano Arithmetic, and I will treat it as a statement in that language. A similar analysis works for any effective theory stronger than PA, such as ZFC. Consider the set of all sentences in the language of PA; define an order relation $R$ so that $\phi \mathbin{R} \psi$ if $\phi \to \psi$ is provable in PA. This gives a pre-order; if we perform the usual equivalence class construction then the resulting algebra is a partial order called a Lindenbaum algebra (*). Because the graph reconstruction conjecture corresponds to a sentence $G$ in PA, it corresponds to a particular node in this algebra. 

Here's an argument. It works under the assumption that $K$ is a complete normed field and has countably many finite extension up to $K$-isomorphism. This holds in particular when $K$ has finitely many extensions in each given degree, e.g., $p$-adic fields. Since given a finite extension it has finitely many embeddings into $\hat{K}$ (I avoid $\bar{K}$ which is confusing), this implies that we can write $\hat{K}=K_n$, where $K=K_0\subset K_1\subset\dots$. Since $K_n$ is complete, it is closed in $\hat{K}$. Now let $G$ be a compact subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\hat{K})$. Then $G=\bigcup G_n$ where $G_n=G\cap\mathrm{GL}_n(K_n)$. By Baire's theorem, some $G_n$ has non-empty interior, hence is an open subgroup of $G$, hence by compactness has finite index in $G$. Hence for some possibly larger $n$, $G_n=G$. Note that the conclusion is false when to consider instead the completion $\bar{\hat{K}}$ of $\hat{K}$. Indeed, just pick $x\in \bar{\hat{K}}\smallsetminus\hat{K}$ and consider the group of order 2, generated by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix}1 & x \\ 0 & -1\end{pmatrix}$. On the other hand, it might necessarily be conjugated into a finite extension, but I can't prove it. 

My ideas were: Since $|\mathbb{P}| < \kappa$, $\kappa$ would still be measurable in any forcing extension of $V$ by a generic of $\mathbb{P}$. So if there exists $G \subseteq \mathbb{P}$ which is $V$-generic and $\pi'' g \subseteq G$, then if one could lift $\pi$ to a map $M[g] \rightarrow V[G]$ which takes some measure $\tilde U' \in M$ to some measure $\tilde U \in V[G]$, then this should show $M[g]$ is iterable. However, I am not sure such a $G$ can exists. Since $g \in V$, I do not think it can be used make $G$ in the ways that usual liftings are done. Thanks for any information about this problem. 

Of course, a formula $\varphi$ with all these properties must be a counterexample to the Vaught's conjecture. So the real essence of this question is whether (regardless of the status of Vaught's conjecture), is it possible that the Scott rank of models of $\varphi$ take on all admissible values but no model of $\varphi$ has Scott rank in between two consecutive admissible ordinal. The natural idea to try is to use Barwise compactness to produce a model of $\varphi$ of intermediate Scott rank. However, whenever one works in a countable admissible fragment $\mathscr{L}_A$, one can not really express non-isomorphism to the model whose Scott rank is the ordinal height of the admissible set $A$. So any model $M$ produced using a Barwise argument using $L_A$, could just be isomorphic to the possibly unique model with Scott rank the ordinal height of $A$. The question is whether by some reason there must be a model of $\varphi$ whose Scott rank is between two consecutive admissible ordinals. Thanks for any information on this question.
