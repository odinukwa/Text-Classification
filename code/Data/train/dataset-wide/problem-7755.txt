Here is the set up : I consider the unitary tangent bundle of a surface $(S,g)$ endowed with the Sasakian metric ; $(T^1S, g_s)$, in fact we have the following fibration : \begin{equation*} \mathbb{S}^1 \to T^1 S \underset{p}{\to} S \end{equation*} where $p$ is Riemannian submersion. We also have a natural action, the rotation in the fiber, which give a structure of $\mathbb{S}^1$-principal bundle. I am interested in the eigen one-form of the Laplacian associated to the Sasakian metric, differential forms defined on $T^1S$ verifying $\Delta \omega = \lambda \omega$, with $\Delta$ the Hodge laplacian. My question is : Given all the eigenfunctions and eingenforms, let say $\eta$, associated to the Hodge Laplacian on the basis (and there pull back in $T^1S$ ,$p^*(\eta)$ ) and all the $\mathbb{S}^1$-invariant function (like the euler class for instance) does it possible to give a kind of formula which gives all the eingenforms of the Hodge Laplacian for the Sasakian metric ? Any references would be appreciated. 

No, I claim that the set of $d$ unit vectors, $e_1=(1,0,\ldots,0)$, $e_2=(0,1,0,\ldots,0)$, $\ldots,$ $e_d=(0,\ldots,0,1)$, along the axes can be shattered, except that for every $\mathcal H$ either the empty set, or all $d$ of the won't be in any $h\in \mathcal H$, so the VC-dimension is $d-1$. (For similar reasons, it cannot be $d$ for any point set.) Indeed, if $\mathcal H$ is the opposite of the cone spanned by the above $d$ vectors, i.e., the all-negative hyperoctant, and $h_I=-\sum_{i\in I} e_i$, then $f_h(e_i)=0$ if and only if $i\in I$. 

Here is a very very simple observation, inspired by Nick's three R's in a row approach. Claim: If there is a maximal rectangle Q in C, such that C\Q is connected, then there is a corner of C (and also Q) that must be in every maximal antirectangle. Proof: This follows simply by noticing that the boundary of C and Q intersect each other in a continuous arc, so if the corners of Q are denoted abcd, then (without loss of generality) ab and bc are also sides of C and so are the beginning of the segments ad and cd. In this case b can see at most as much as any other point in Q. Of course, there are polygons without such a Q, e.g., a cross. 

We can assume the category is Abelian and the product functor is right exact in both variables I expect something of the sort "any simple (in some sense) module category is equivalent to $Vect$", although I have no idea how braided and symmetric are different in this repsect 

Given an algebraically closed field $k$ and a finitely generated commutative $k$-algebra $A$, all simple modules over $A$ are 1-dimensional 

The Lebesgue differentiation theorem says that for certain metric spaces $X$ (see below), any Borel measure $\mu$ that is finite on bounded sets and any $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ locally $\mu$-integrable, there is $A \subseteq X$ s.t. $\mu(X \setminus A)=0$ and $$\forall x \in A: \lim_{r \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\mu(B_r(x))} \int_{B_r(x)} f(y) \mu(dy) = f(x)$$ Here, $B_r(x)$ is the ball of radius $r$ with center $x$. This holds for $X$ a Riemannian manifold or $X$ a locally compact separable ultrametric space. I'm interested to understand how it fails on somewhat more general spaces. In particular: 

Let $M_{\Gamma}$ a Riemannian covering of a closed compact manifold $(M,g)$ with deck transformation $\Gamma$ (its neutral element will be denoted by $e$). If we denote by $p_t^{\Gamma}(x,y)$ the heat kernel associated to $M_{\Gamma}$ does the following proposition occurs : There exist a probability measure $\mu$ on $\Gamma$ such that the associated random walk on $\Gamma$ of law $\mu^{*n}$ satisfies that there exists two constants $C_1, C_2 > 0$ and a point $x \in M_{\Gamma}$ such that : $$ C_2 \mu^{*n}(e,e) \le p_n^{\Gamma}(x,x) \le C_1 \mu^{*n}(e,e) $$ 

Let $M$ a compact manifold with surfaces $S_1,...,S_p$ as boundaries. Let us suppose that $M$ admits a complete hyperbolic structure. Then, from the ending lamination theorem, given either laminations or conformal structures (the end invariants) on $S_1...S_n$ one is able to find a unique complete hyperbolic structure on $M$ with ends $E_1,...E_N$ admitting exactly these end invariants. My question is, are these invariants localized in the ends ? More precisely, given $f$ a pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphism of the surface $S_1$ and its associated lamination when $f$ is iterated in positive time. Then, one can consider the hyperbolic structure given by the ending lamination theorem associated to this lamination for the surface $S_1$ and with whatever end invariants you want for the rest of the surfaces ($S_2...S_N$). Does the resulting hyperbolic structure satisfies that the end associated to $S_1$ is asymptotically isometric to a $\mathbb{Z}$-cover of a hyperbolic compact 3-fold which fibers over the circle with fiber $S_1$ and monodromy $f$ ? I know from McMullen's book (theorem 3.12) $URL$ that this is true for one degenerated end quasi-Fuchsian manifolds or, more obviously, for $\mathbb{Z}$-cover of compact manifold I wondered whether this result may be generalised. A very first question is what happens if we consider two pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms $(\Phi_1, \Phi_2)$ for which the laminations given by iterating these in positive time are in transversal position. So that the sequence of quasi-Fuchsian manifolds given in Bers coordinates by $(\Phi_1^n, \Phi_2^n)$ converges by Thurston's theorem. Can I say that the end $E_1$ (resp $E_2$) of the limit representation are asymptotically isometric to the $Z$-covering of the compact manifold which fibres over the circle of monodromy $\Phi_1$ (resp $\Phi_2)$ ? Thank you for your reading. 

I'm mostly interested in the case of cocommutative $H$. For such $H$, coPoisson structure is morally an infinitesimal deformation away from cocommutativity (the structure needed for "coquantization" preserving bialgebra structure). Also, I'm mostly interested in the Hopf algebra case but this doesn't seem important for the question The category of left modules over $H$ is a $k$-linear Abelian category (just because H is a $k$-algebra) equipped with a tensor product functor (due to the coproduct $\Delta$ on H). For cocommutative $H$ the tensor product is symmetric. The question is: 

Are the following definitions known? Consider H a Hilbert space. A "quantum topology" on H is a set Sigma of closed subspaces satisfying the following conditions: (a) {0} and H lie in Sigma (b) If {V_alpha} is a subset of Sigma then the closure of the sum of the V_alpha lies in Sigma (c) If V, W lie in Sigma then their intersection lies in Sigma Given a quantum topology, we introduce the notion of s a "quantum sheaf of operators" s corresponds to every V in Sigma s(V), a C*-algebra of bounded operators on V. We demand the following conditions on s: (i) If W lies in V, A lies in s(V) and leaves W invariant, then the restriction of A to W lies in s(W) (ii) Suppose {W_alpha} is a subset of Sigma and V is the closure of their sum. Suppose A is a bounded operator on V which leaves every W_alpha invariant. Suppose further that the restriction of A to W_alpha lies in s(W_alpha) for every alpha. Then A lies in s(V) (iii) Suppose {W_alpha} is a subset of Sigma and V is the closure of their sum. Consider C the subalgerba of s(V) consisting of operators of the form defined by condition (ii). Then the commutant of C lies within C. 

I think the probabilistic method gives an A of size $O_d(n^{d/2}\sqrt\log n)$. (Formula updated according to js's comment.) Put every point to A independently with probability p. What is the probability that a point x will be in S(A)? For any x, we can find $\Omega(n^d)$ pairs of points that are all different such that x lies on the line of any pair. (This is true because e.g. for d=2 if x is in the bottom-left part of $K_n$, then we can take the $n/4\times n/4$ grid upper-right from it, contract the $n/8 \times n/8$ bottom-left of this grid, and double each point from x to get its pair.) The probability that both points of a fixed pair are in A is $p^2$, the probability that no such pair exists is $(1-p^2)^{n^d}$. So if $n^d(1-p^2)^{n^d}<1$, then we are done using the union bound. Unless I am mistaken this is true if $p>\Omega_d(n^{-d/2}\sqrt\log n)$. Now of course we cannot be sure about how big A is. But if we replace the above $<1$ with a $<1/2$, then we can even add the condition that A should be at most $pn^d$, for which the probability is $\ge 1/2$. So we get $O_d(n^{d/2}\sqrt\log n)$ points. Maybe this can be further improved with some more advanced probabilistic methods. 

Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemannian three-fold such that $H_2(M,\mathbb{Z}) = \mathbb{Z}$ and $S$ any surface representing 1. By Hodge theory there exist a harmonic differential one-form $\eta$ dual to the surface $S$, meaning for all closed 2-form $\alpha$ we have : \begin{equation} \int_M \eta \wedge \alpha = \int_S \alpha \end{equation} and \begin{equation} \Delta \eta = 0 \end{equation} where $\Delta$ is the Hodge De Rham Laplacian acting on one-forms. My question is : does it possible to control the $L^1$ and the $L^2$ norm of $\eta$ with geometric quantities ? I was thinking about the following : any such $\eta$ gives an application $M \to \mathbb{S}^1$ by integrating $\eta$ on any path and takes the result modulo $\mathbb{Z}$ (it does not depend of the path by the assumptions on $\eta$ to be an integer class and being closed). Therefore, by the co-area formula, I expect the $L^1$ norm to be related to the area of surfaces representing $S$, the minimal one for instance. 

Consider $\phi(A)$ a formula of second-order arithmetic with one free variable $A$ of type "set". Suppose $\exists A : \phi(A)$ is a true sentence. Does it follow (not in second order arithmetic itself, but in a stronger theory of your choice, e.g. ZFC) that there is a formula of second-order arithmetic $\psi(n)$ with one free variable $n$ of type "number", such that $\phi(\lbrace n | \psi(n)\rbrace)$ is a true sentence? 

The antisymmetry of $\pi$ imposes the following additional condition: Note that $i(X) \hat{\otimes} Y \cong X \otimes Coker \space h_Y$ which follows by observing that $h$ annihilates $i(X) \hat{\otimes} Y$ due to $k[h]$-linearity of $\hat{\otimes}$, applying $Coker \space h$ and using its tensor functor structure We have the short exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow X \xrightarrow{Ker \space h} X[h] \xrightarrow{Coker \space h} X \rightarrow 0$$ We apply $\hat{\otimes} Y[h]$ and use its exactness to get the short exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow X \otimes Y \rightarrow X[h] \hat{\otimes} Y[h] \rightarrow X \otimes Y \rightarrow 0$$ This sequence yields an element $\epsilon(X, Y)$ of $Ext^1(X \otimes Y, X \otimes Y)$ Due to $b$, $\epsilon(X, Y)$ and $\epsilon(Y, X)$ belong to canonically isomorphic spaces. We demand $$\epsilon(X, Y)+\epsilon(Y, X)=0$$ The problem is I need the case in which $\otimes$ is merely right exact. What currently confuses me is that in the bialgebra picture the last sequence is still exact for general $k$ but I can't prove it in the category-theoretic language 

I remember reading about this in the Geometric Discrepancy book of Matousek. Another way of putting your statement is that if the discrepancy of squares is small, then so is that of rectangles. I think that the higher dimensional version of expressing the characteristic vector of a brick with characteristic vectors of cubes is still open. Here is a recent related paper that might be interesting for you to find the exact bound for your question: $URL$ 

Is there (if not, why?) a software where I can input a sequence of integers, like into the OEIS, and then it makes some simple transformations on it to check whether the sequence can be obtained from some other sequence(s)? For example, if I enter 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, then currently OEIS returns A005843: The nonnegative even numbers (which starts with 0, but OEIS can search for subsequences). But suppose that A005843 is not in the database yet. Then OEIS will not return anything. Instead, a more intelligent search software could return A000027: The positive integers. I know that this raises several questions, like what transformations, which sequences to display first etc., but the feature could be quite useful. Even better, if the software could do more complicated things, like check whether my sequence is the sum of two OEIS entries. ps. My motivation came from the sequence 2, 4, 9, 16, 27, 38 currently missing from OEIS, which was posed on this Hungarian puzzle page. (The puzzle has already expired, so feel free to discuss.) 

Let $X$ be a compact Polish space and $Y$ be a separable real Banach space. Assume $U \subseteq X \times Y$ is open, bounded in $Y$-norm, and s.t. for any $x \in X$, $\{y \in Y \mid (x,y) \in U\}$ is convex and nonempty. Does it follow that there is a continuous function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ s.t. the graph of $f$ is contained in $U$? 

Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ be a probability space, $\{\mathcal{F}_n \subseteq \mathcal{F}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ an increasing filtration, $S$ a finite set and $X: \Omega \rightarrow S$ a random variable. Denote $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ the space of probability measures on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ and assume that $\{Q_n: \Omega \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\Omega)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ are regular conditional probabilities corresponding to $\mathcal{F}_n$. That is, for any $A \in \mathcal{F}$, $Q_n(\omega)(A)$ is an $\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable function of $\omega \in \Omega$ and for any $B \in \mathcal{F}_n$ $$\int_B Q_n(\omega)(A) P(d\omega) = P(A \cap B)$$ For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, define the information gain $I_n: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \sqcup \{+\infty\}$ by $$I_n(\omega):= D_{KL}(X_* Q_{n+1}(\omega) \mid\mid X_* Q_{n}(\omega))$$ Here, $X_*$ denotes push-forward by $X$, i.e. $X_* Q_{n}(\omega)$ is the probability measure on $S$ s.t. for any $A \subseteq S$ $$X_* Q_{n}(\omega)(A) := Q_n(\omega)(X^{-1}(A))$$ $D_{KL}$ is the Kullback–Leibler divergence, i.e. given probability measures $\mu,\nu$ on $S$, regarded as functions from $S$ to $[0,1]$: $$D_{KL}(\mu \mid\mid \nu) := \sum_{s \in S} \mu(s) \ln{\frac{\mu(s)}{\nu(s)}}$$
