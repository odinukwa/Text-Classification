I have seen this claim on the Wikipedia page for the Yang-Mills Millenium problem by Alexander Dynin. He is a mathematician working at the Department of Mathematics of Ohio State University and so, I think his should represent respectable work. The question is that I am a physicist and I have not the right knowledge to approach Dynin's work. Please, could you give me some hints and references about so I can make an idea by myself of these techniques? My aim is to get a comparison with the work currently pursued in the area of theoretical physics about this same problem. Thanks a lot beforehand. 

I am currently working on complex networks. I consider a matrix $\cal N$ with random entries $\delta_{ik}$. These entries are varying randomly in time and so I have a sequence of random matrices that determines a stochastic process. My question is quite simple: Does it exist a generalization of standard stochastic differential equations to random matrices like the case I am considering? Also relevant references are a good answer. Thanks beforehand. 

I refer to this paper. There is a straightforward approach in this case. You can separate the refraction index in the following way $$ n^2=n_0^2+\xi $$ where $\xi$ is the random part. Then, the equation is $$ \nabla^2U+k^2n_0^2U=-\xi k^2U. $$ Now, turning to the paper I just cited, take the Green function to be ($d=3$ for the sake of simplicity) $$ G(|{\bf r}|) =\frac{e^{ikn_0|{\bf r}|}}{4\pi |{\bf r}|} $$ and the differential equation turns into an integral one $$ U({\bf r}) = U_0({\bf r}) - k^2\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U({\bf r'}). $$ One can iterate this equation and obtain the following solution series $$ U({\bf r}) = U_0({\bf r}) - k^2\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U_0({\bf r'})+k^4\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U_0({\bf r'})\times \int d^3x''G(|{\bf r'}-{\bf r''}|)\xi({\bf r''})U_0({\bf r''})+\ldots. $$ By averaging on the distribution for $\xi$, a normal one by hypothesis, one gets a solution series in terms of the correlation function of the random variable. A simple case is this $$ \langle\xi({\bf r})\rangle =0 \qquad \langle\xi({\bf r})\xi({\bf r'})\rangle=\xi_0^2\delta^3({\bf r}-{\bf r'}) $$ yielding $$ U({\bf r}) \stackrel{?}{=} U_0({\bf r})+k^4\xi_0^2G(0)\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)U_0^2({\bf r'})+\ldots. $$ that is not well defined mathematically. You can consider a case with a finite volume and recover from this situation. 

The algebra is $A=kQ/I$ with the assumptions $I \subseteq J^2$ and $I/(JI+IJ) \neq 0$, where $J$ is the ideal in $kQ$ generated by the arrows. Assume $A$ is hereditary. Then $J/I$ is a projective $A$-module and the exact sequence of $A$-modules $$0 \rightarrow I/IJ \rightarrow J/IJ \rightarrow J/I \rightarrow 0$$ must split. Let $s \colon J/IJ \rightarrow I/IJ$ denote a retraction. Let $x$ be an element in $I \smallsetminus (JI+IJ)$. Since $I \subseteq J^2$, we can write $$x=p_1 q_1 + \cdots + p_n q_n$$ with $p_i,q_i \in J$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. Then $$x+IJ=s(p_1 q_1 + \cdots + p_n q_n+IJ)=p_1 s(q_1) + \cdots + p_n s(q_n) +IJ \in JI+IJ,$$ a contradiction. Therefore $A$ is not hereditary. 

Here are some more details. Lemma 3.2.4 written in the notation of Theorem 3.2.5 becomes the statement that $$\phi_{M,N[n]}\colon {\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\operatorname{mod} \Lambda)}(M,N[n]) \to {\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TM,F_TN[n])$$ is an isomorphism for all $M,N$ in $\mathcal Y(T)$ and $n \geq 0$. It is also an isomorphism when $n<0$ since then both sides are $0$. For any $N$ in $\operatorname{mod} \Lambda$ there is a triangle $$N'\to P\to N\to N'[1]$$ with $N',P$ in $\mathcal Y(T)$, and for all $n \in \mathbb Z$ we get a commutative diagram $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} \scriptsize {\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b({\rm{mod}}\Lambda)}(M,N'[n]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\operatorname{mod} \Lambda)}(M,P[n]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\operatorname{mod} \Lambda)}(M,N[n]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\operatorname{mod} \Lambda)}(M,N'[n+1]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\operatorname{mod} \Lambda)}(M,P[n+1])\\ @VV{\wr}V @VV{\wr}V @VVV @VV{\wr}V @VV{\wr}V\\ \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TM,F_TN'[n]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TM,F_TP[n]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TM,F_TN[n]) @>>> \scriptsize {\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TM,F_TN'[n+1]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TX,F_TP[n+1]) \end{CD} Since all the other downward arrows are isomorphisms, it follows from the five lemma that the middle downward arrow is an isomorphism. So $$\phi_{M,N[n]}\colon {\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\operatorname{mod} \Lambda)}(M,N[n]) \to {\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TM,F_TN[n])$$ is an isomorphism for all $M$ in $\mathcal Y(T)$, $N$ in $\operatorname{mod} \Lambda$ and $n \in \mathbb Z$. A similar argument in the other variable gives that $\phi_{M,N[n]}$ is an isomorphism for all $M,N$ in $\operatorname{mod} \Lambda$ and $n \in \mathbb Z$. This is the basis for the induction. The inductive step uses triangles of the form $$Y' \to Y \to Y'' \to Y'[1]$$ with $\ell(Y') = \ell(Y)-1$ and $\ell(Y'') = 1$. We apply the five lemma to the commutative diagram $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} \scriptsize {\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b({\rm{mod}}\Lambda)}(X,Y''[n-1]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b({\rm{mod}}\Lambda)}(X,Y'[n]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b({\rm{mod}}\Lambda)}(X,Y[n]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b({\rm{mod}}\Lambda)}(X,Y''[n]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b({\rm{mod}}\Lambda)}(X,Y'[n+1])\\ @VV{\wr}V @VV{\wr}V @VVV @VV{\wr}V @VV{\wr}V\\ \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TX,F_TY''[n-1]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TX,F_TY'[n]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TX,F_TY[n]) @>>> \scriptsize {\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TX,F_TY''[n]) @>>> \scriptsize{\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TX,F_TY'[n+1]) \end{CD} and a similar version for the other variable to conclude that $$\phi_{X,Y}\colon {\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\operatorname{mod} \Lambda)}(X,Y) \to {\rm{Hom}}_{\mathbf D^b(\mathcal A)}(F_TX,F_TY)$$ is an isomorphism for all $X,Y$ in ${\mathbf D^b(\operatorname{mod} \Lambda)}$. 

The simplest approach one can think is an iterative one. Let us consider the given equation $$ f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xG(x,y)f(y)f(x-y)dy. $$ Now, we assume as a first iterate $f^{(0)}(x)=1$ and so $$ f^{(1)}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xdyG(x,y) $$ $$ f^{(2)}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xdyG(x,y)\int_{-\infty}^ydwG(y,w)\int_{-\infty}^{x-y}dzG(x-y,z) $$ and so on. One is granted the existence of the n-th iterate provided the integral of $G$ exists and is properly bounded. 

Here is the answer by Alexander Dynin to the preceding criticisms that I post on his behalf. I cannot post it as a comment being too long. A point of view from mathematicians would be helpful at this point. 

I have seen your paper. You have worked out a series with $e'\rightarrow 0$. You can do the same on the other side $e'\rightarrow\infty$. Also for this series the integrals can be evaluated. In this way, you will be able to get a satisfactory numerical evaluation of the integral for a wide range of values of $e'$. That this can be done can be easily seen by noting the asymptotic series $$ t(x)=x+\ln 2+\frac{1}{2}\ln x+\left(\frac{1}{2}\ln 2+\ln x+\frac{1}{4}\right)\frac{1}{x}+\ldots $$ that entails both logarithm and power terms. For example, for your integral you will get $$ \int\frac{t(e'^2)-t(k^2\sin^2\sigma)}{e'^2-k^2\sin^2\sigma}\frac{\sin\sigma}{2}d\sigma= -\frac{1}{2}\cos\sigma+O\left(\frac{1}{e'^2}\right) $$ and you can evaluate the higher order terms by any computer based program you prefer. 

The problem here is that, with an error that does prove the main results false, a good paper may be forced to restart the review procedure. This will entail some severe delays. So, my suggestion is to wait and then, after the report of the referee, a resubmission of a properly revised version of the paper. 

This is a stochastic differential system of equations. I think this can help. You can also check the full syllabus of the course here with the proper references and other material to download. 

In order to iterate, you have to substitute the second equation into the first one. So, $$ n_{11}(x,z)=1+\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1)n_{11}(y_1,z). $$ This equation is generally the starting pointing for an iterative procedure, the main tool of perturbation techniques. E.g., you can choose for the first iterate $n_{11}(x,z)=1$ and you will get $$ n_{11}(x,z)=1+\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1) $$ $$ +\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1)\int_{-\infty}^{y_1}dy_2e^{-izy_2}u(y_2)\int_{-\infty}^{y_2}dy_3e^{izy_3}{\bar u}(y_3)+\ldots. $$ You can stop the procedure at any desired order to get an approximation to the solution of the integral equations. Then, you put this approximation to $n_{11}$ back into the equation for $n_{12}$ and you will get an approximate solution for it at the given order. 

Such a characterization was already given in the paper where standardly stratified algebras were first defined: 

It seems the ring $$A=\begin{bmatrix} \mathbb Q & \mathbb Q & \mathbb R\\ 0 & \mathbb Q & \mathbb R\\ 0 & 0 & \mathbb Q \end{bmatrix} / \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & \mathbb R\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$ is such an example. It is semiprimary, hence perfect on both sides, and the global dimension is $2$. The right ideal $$I=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \mathbb Q & \mathbb R\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} / \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & \mathbb R\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $$ is finitely generated, but not finitely presented, so $A$ is not right coherent. 

An example for the second question: Let $A$ be the $4$-dimensional algebra $$A=\begin{pmatrix} \Bbbk & 0\\ \Bbbk & \Bbbk \end{pmatrix} \times \Bbbk$$ and $$f=(\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix},0)$$ Then $B={\rm{End}}_A(fA) \cong \Bbbk$ and $${\rm{End}}_{B^{\rm{op}}}(fA)^{\rm{op}}={\rm{End}}_{\Bbbk}(\Bbbk^2) \cong M_2(\Bbbk),$$ which is also $4$-dimensional but not isomorphic to $A$. 

This is probably just a mistake in the preprint. If you look at the corresponding paragraph in the published version Claus Michael Ringel, MR 1128706 The category of modules with good filtrations over a quasi-hereditary algebra has almost split sequences, Math. Z. 208 (1991), no. 2, 209--223.), the category ${\mathscr F}(\Theta)$ is defined differently. Quote: 

The resulting graph $G$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, but the vertex-deleted subgraphs are isomorphic. 

Here is one way to construct a counterexample. Start with an unoriented cycle with a cyclic automorphism group (of order $\geq$ 3) generated by an automorphism $\varphi$. Insert arrows at vertices $a$ and $b=\varphi(a)$ pointing to new vertices $v$ and $w$ respectively. 

Proof: Suppose $X$ is tiling $B/BeB$-module, and let $T=Be \oplus X$. 1) $X$ has $l$ indecomposable summands, so $T=Be \oplus X$ has $n$ indecomposable summands. 2) For $n \geq 2$, we have $$\operatorname{Ext}^n_B(T,B) \cong \operatorname{Ext}^n_B(X,B/BeB) \cong \operatorname{Ext}^n_{B/BeB}(X,B/BeB)=0,$$ so the projective dimension of $T$ is at most $1$. 3) $\operatorname{Ext}^1_B(T,T) \cong \operatorname{Ext}^1_B(X,X) \cong \operatorname{Ext}^1_{B/BeB}(X,X)=0. $ 

I think your formula is not correct. The right kernel is invariant by interchanging $x$ with $y$. This symmetry must be preserved. Then, note that $$ L=-\Delta+ax^2+bx=-\Delta+a\left(x+\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}\right)^2-\frac{b^2}{4a} $$ and this operator is invariant for translations. This means that the kernel for $b\ne 0$ can be obtained from the kernel for $b=0$ by translation of a shift $\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}$ and multiplying for the overall factor $e^{\frac{b^2}{4a}t}$. Once this is observed, we can consider the kernel for $b=0$, just the argument of the exponential, to be $$ S_0(x,y;t)=\sqrt{a}\left[(x^2+y^2)\coth 2\sqrt{a}t-\frac{xy}{2\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\right] $$ and apply the above translation to get $$ S(x,y;t)=\sqrt{a}\left[\left(x^2+y^2+(x+y)\frac{b}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)\coth 2\sqrt{a}t\right. $$ $$ \left.-\frac{1}{2\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\left(xy+\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}(x+y)+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)\right] $$ and this gives the right kernel $$ K(x,y;t)=\left(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{2\pi\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\right)^\frac{1}{2}e^{\frac{b^2}{4a}t}e^{-S(x,y;t)}. $$ 

There is no change into the probability distribution due to the absolute value. The reason can be traced back on the Ito's lemma applied to the derivation of the (Fokker-Planck) equation for the probability distribution: This will depend on $\sigma^2$. 

The best way to proceed is to use Legendre polynomials through the formula $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2yx+x^2}} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty P_n(y) x^n. $$ In this way you will get closed form integrals with the error function. 

Let us consider the sum $$ m_N(x)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{cN}{2}-i(2c-1)\right). $$ The first step to get an asymptotic approximation is to extract the leading term in $N$ to obtain $$ m_N(x)=[f(x)]\log N+\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-\frac{i}{N}(2c-1)\right). $$ When $N$ is finite, we recognize a Riemann series and apply the average theorem. So, there exists a value of argument of the logarithm such that $$ m_N(x)=[f(x)]\log N+[f(x)]\log[z(x)]. $$ We can take $z(x)=\frac{c}{2}-t\[f(x)\](2c-1)$ being $t\in (0,1)$. Indeed, we can define a partition with $x_i=x_{i-1}+\frac{1}{\[f(x)\]N}$ and so $$ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-\frac{i}{N}(2c-1)\right)=[f(x)]\Delta x\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-i\[f(x)\](2c-1)\Delta x\right) $$ being $\Delta x=\frac{1}{\[f(x)\]N}$. But this, in the given limit, is nothing else than $$ \int_{\frac{c}{2}}^{\frac{c}{2}-\[f(x)\](2c-1)}\log(z)dz<\infty $$ as it should. 

It can be shown that $[dW(t)]^\alpha=0$ with $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha\ge 3$ generalizing the integer case. Let us consider the stochastic differential equation $dX(t)=[dW(t)]^\alpha$ with $\alpha>0$. We can write the solution in the form $X(t)=X(t_0)+\int_{t_0}^t[dW(t)]^\alpha$ with the integral in the Ito sense. Then, we have to evaluate this integral with the sum \begin{equation} S_n=\sum_{k=1}^n[W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^\alpha. \end{equation} The power of the Brownian process can be evaluated in the following way \begin{equation} [W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^\alpha = [(1+W(t_k)+W(t_{k-1}))-1]^\alpha= \end{equation} \begin{equation} (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1}(1+W(t_k)+W(t_{k-1}))^{l_1}= \end{equation} \begin{equation} (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\sum_{l_2=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c} l_1 \\ l_2 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1} [W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^{l_2} \end{equation} provided $|W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})|<1$. Now, we can use stochastic calculus to remove powers higher than 2 and it is easy to see that \begin{equation} S_n=(-1)^\alpha\sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1}- (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)l_1(-1)^{l_1}\sum_{k=1}^n[W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]+ \end{equation} \begin{equation} (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)\frac{l_1(l_1-1)}{2}(-1)^{l_1} \sum_{k=1}^n[W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^2. \end{equation} So, we have the required expansion with coefficients \begin{eqnarray} \mu_0&=&\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1} \nonumber \\ \mu_1&=&\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)l_1(-1)^{l_1} \nonumber \\ \mu_2&=&\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)\frac{l_1(l_1-1)}{2}(-1)^{l_1} \end{eqnarray} Now we see immediately that $\mu_0=\left.(1-x)^\alpha\right|_{x=1}=0$. Besides, we get immediately the result that, for any real $\alpha\ge 3$, we have again $[dW(t)]^\alpha=0$ as in this case the coefficients are all zero when $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are evaluated thorugh Abel summation. Finally, when $0<\alpha<1$ both the coefficients $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are divergent and maybe no meaning can be attached to them (I have in mind summable divergent series here, any suggestion is greatly appreciated). 

Yes, it is possible. (So the answer to the question in the title is no.) Consider the ring $$A = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbb Q & \mathbb R \\ 0 & \mathbb Q \end{bmatrix}.$$ It has primitive idempotents $e=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ and $f=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.$ Now $J=AeA$ is a heredity ideal and there is a heredity chain $0 \subseteq J \subseteq A$. As an $A$-module $J$ has a direct sum decomposition $$J=AeAe \oplus AeAf.$$ The first summand is isomorphic to $Ae$. The second summand decomposes further into infinitely many direct summands, each isomorphic to $Ae$, the sum indexed by a $\mathbb Q$-basis for $\mathbb R$. 

An idempotent $u$ is called primitive if the equation of idempotents $$(1-u)x=0$$ has a unique non-zero solution $x=u$. The primitive idempotents in $R$ are $\chi_{\{a\}}$ for $a \in (-1,1)$ and $\chi_{(-\infty,-1]}$ and $\chi_{[1,+\infty)}$. For ease of notation give two last mentioned primitive idempotents index $-1$ and $1$ respectively. The primitive idempotents in $S$ are indexed by $a \in \mathbb R$. A ring isomorphism $\phi \colon R \rightarrow S$ would then define a bijection $\tilde \phi \colon [-1,1] \rightarrow \mathbb R$. Let $A=\tilde \phi^{-1}(\mathbb Q) \subseteq [-1,1]$, where $\mathbb Q$ denotes the rational numbers. Then $\chi_A$ is an idempotent in $R$ with the property that $\chi_A \cdot \chi_{\{a\}} \neq 0$ for all $a \in A$ and $\chi_A \cdot \chi_{\{a\}}= 0$ for all $a \in [-1,1] \smallsetminus A$. The idempotent $\phi(\chi_A) \in S$ must be of the form $\chi_B$ for some $B \subseteq \mathbb R$. We must have $$\chi_B \cdot \chi_{\{\tilde \phi(a)\}}=\phi(\chi_A \cdot \chi_{\{a\}}) \neq 0$$ for all $a \in A$ and $$\chi_B \cdot \chi_{\{\tilde \phi(a)\}}=\phi(\chi_A \cdot \chi_{\{a\}}) = 0$$ for all $a \in [-1,1] \smallsetminus A$. Therefore $B$ contains all the rational numbers and no numbers that are not rational. But $\chi_{\mathbb Q}$ is not an element of $S$ and we reach a contradiction. Therefore there is no ring isomorphism $\phi \colon R \rightarrow S$.
