$E_8$, before string theory. The Monster, before the Moonshine Module, or at least before the Griess algebra. The 3-connected group that maps to a compact simple Lie group $K$, inducing isomorphisms on $\pi_k$ for $k>3$. (AKA the "string group".) 

I think more fundamental and interesting than the notion of "multiplicity" is the notion of "tangent cone". Given $x \in X = Spec \ R$ defined by an ideal $I$, it's an interesting fact that $I^\infty$ is small, so that $gr_I R := \oplus_n I^n/I^{n+1}$ is interesting to look at. (You can't do much with this if say, $R$ is the continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space, as $I=I^2$.) I think of the degeneration of $R$ to $gr_I R$ (given by the Rees algebra) as follows: we stretch $X$ away from the point $x$, and take the stretch factor to $\infty$. When we're done, there's lots to ask. Is the limit reduced, irreducible, etc.? But in particular, since the ring is now graded, we can compute its growth, and the leading coefficient thereof is the "multiplicity". 

One of the wholly unnecessary reasons that schemes are regarded with such fear by so many mathematicians in other fields is that three, largely orthogonal, generalizations are made simultaneously. Considering a "variety" to be Spec or Proj of a domain finitely generated over an algebraically closed field, the generalizations are basically 

Such an endomorphism of $M$ gives an automorphism of the cohomology ring that acts by $-1$ on top cohomology. The cohomology ring of your example $M = {\mathbb C \mathbb P}^{2n}$ doesn't have such automorphisms. 

I believe the following way (Kostant's, 1970) to be the best way to think about the Hamiltonian condition. First, "why" is there a central extension $H^0(M; {\mathbb R}) \to C^\infty (M) \to symp(M)$ of Lie algebras? Of what is $C^\infty (M)$ supposed to be the Lie group? For $symp(M)$, the Lie algebra of vector fields annihilating the symplectic form $\omega$, it's clear it should the Lie algebra of the group $Symp(M)$ of symplectomorphisms. Assume now that $[\omega]$ is integral. Then it is $c_1$ of some "prequantization" line bundle $\mathcal L$, and $\omega$ is the curvature of some Hermitian connection $\alpha$ on that line bundle. Let $Aut(M,{\mathcal L},\alpha)$ denote the group of Hermitian bundle automorphisms (moving the base around) of $\mathcal L$ preserving $\alpha$. This group obviously maps to $Diff(M)$, forgetting the action on the fibers, but because it preserves $\alpha$ on $\mathcal L$ it preserves $\omega$ on $M$, so the image lies inside $Symp(M)$. The kernel consists of bundle automorphisms that only act fiberwise, and for them to preserve the flat connection they must, on each component, rotate all the fibers by the same element of $U(1)$. The Hamiltonian condition, then, is about whether one can lift the action of $G$ on $M$ to an action on the line bundle over $M$. It's very easy, given such a lift, to write down a moment map. (Basically, now that you're dealing with a $1$-form $\alpha$ instead of a $2$-form $\omega$, you can pair vector fields from $\mathfrak g$ with it.) One example I find instructive is ${\mathbb R}^{2n}$ acting on itself by translation, with the space given the usual symplectic structure. That's acting as symplectomorphisms, and the space is simply connected, so there's no $H^1$ obstruction (as when $T^1$ acts on $T^2$). But one can't lift the action to preserve the (non-flat) connection on the (trivial) line bundle; it only lifts to an action of the Heisenberg group. Another subtle example is $SO(3)$ acting on $S^2$ with the area $1$ symplectic structure. On the Lie algebra level, yes, the action is Hamiltonian. But actually $SO(3)$ doesn't act on the line bundle; only its double cover $SU(2)$ does. Finally, think about the case that $G$ acts algebraically on $X \subseteq {\mathbb P}V$. I like to say that $X$ is "equivariantly projective" if $G$ acts on ${\mathbb P}V$ preserving $X$, and this is pretty nearly an algebro-geometric replacement for the Hamiltonian condition. (Non-example: $X$ is a nodal cubic curve, whose smooth locus is ${\mathbb C}^\times$, acted on by ${\mathbb C}^\times$.) 

I like the way you asked to avoid. Forgive me if I describe it in polytope rather than fan language. Step 1: ${\mathbb P}^1 \times {\mathbb P}^1$'s polytope is a square (or any rectangle). The four edges, taken clockwise, correspond to the ${\mathbb P}^1$s giving the classes $h_1,h_2,h_1,h_2$ Michael mentions. (EDIT: I had signs there before, by overthinking the Danilov relations.) I can only guess that by "tautological line bundle on ${\mathbb P}^1 \times {\mathbb P}^1$ you mean ${\mathcal O}(-1) \boxtimes {\mathcal O}(-1)$. If we blow down that ${\mathbb P}^1 \times {\mathbb P}^1$, we get the affine cone over the Segre embedding of ${\mathbb P}^1 \times {\mathbb P}^1$. The polyhedron of that is also a cone, on a square. Step 2: Blow the singular point back up, which corresponds to cutting the corner off that cone, leaving a square. So far we have an unbounded polytope that retracts to the square, just as the line bundle retracts to ${\mathbb P}^1 \times {\mathbb P}^1$. Step 3: Projectively complete. This corresponds to bounding the cone. Combinatorially, we now have a square-based pyramid with the top corner cut off, so there's a big square on the bottom (whose class is Michael's $h$) and a little square on the top. Step 4: Take the anticanonical class. On any toric variety, the boundary of the polytope defines an anticanonical divisor. So far our anticanonical class is the bottom square $h$ plus the top square plus the other four faces. To calculate the linear relations between them, one needs to be precise about the locations of the vertices. I have the bottom square at $(0,0), (2,0), (0,2), (2,2)$ with $z=0$ and the top one at $(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)$ with $z=1$. The Danilov relations from the $z$-axis vector says $$ (-1) \text{bottom} + (+1) \text{top} + 0 \text{west} + 0 \text{south} + (+1) \text{north} + (+1)\text{east} = 0 $$ so the total of the faces is $2\text{bottom} + \text{south} + \text{west}$, matching Michael's $2h+h_1+h_2$. (As it ought, since I learned at least some of this from him.) 

I have some affine varieties $X$ defined over $\mathbb Z$, and associated integers $c(X)$, with the property that $\# X_{\mathbb Z/p} \equiv c(X) \bmod p$ for all $p$. (In particular $c(X)$ is usually $1$ in my examples, but not always.) 

I don't mind assuming characteristic $0$ so then we can use the generic smoothness theorem to assume $f$ is a smooth morphism (through shrinking $X$ and $Y$). Quasiprojective is fine too. Feel free to add tags as seems appropriate. 

Definitely some combination $\sum_{w'\gtrdot w} c_{w'} [X_{w'}]$, all $c_{w'} > 0$, is Cartier; restrict a $G$-equivariant ample line bundle $\mathcal L_\lambda$ from $G/B$ and consider the unique $T$-weight section $\sigma$ that doesn't vanish at $wB/B \in X_w$. This vanishes along the set $\bigcup_{w'\gtrdot w} X_{w'}$ and for $w' = w r_\beta$, its order of vanishing $c_{w'}$ will be $\langle \lambda, \check\beta \rangle$. 

The basic answer is "yes, of course, because the toric variety is uniquely determined by the polytope. But no, because it's the wrong polytope for the question of Fanoness." The question is whether the anticanonical class, not the given class $[\omega]$, is ample. Translate the polytope to contain $0$ in the interior. Now translate the facets in/out from the origin, until they're at lattice distance $1$ from the origin. (I.e. a facet is $\{\vec v \in \mathfrak t^*\ :\ \langle \vec v, X \rangle = c > 0\}$ for some unique shortest $X \in \ker(\exp: \mathfrak t {\longrightarrow} T)$; move it to $c=1$). In this way you've computed the moment polytope w.r.t. the anticanonical class = the sum of the toric divisors (each with coefficient $c=1$). The question is whether each old facet still defines a facet of the new polytope. (It's possible that one of these hyperplanes might completely miss the new polytope. That corresponds to the anticanonical bundle having basepoints along that divisor.) Non-example: the trapezoid giving $\widetilde{\mathbb P^2}$. Then the intersection of the exceptional curve's facet with the resulting unit triangle is just a corner, not a facet. So no basepoints, but the exceptional curve blows down in the anticanonical non-embedding. 

Bert Kostant mentioned an odd fact to me some time ago. As usual (with such statements), fix a complex, connected, reductive) Lie group $G$, with maximal torus $T$, and Weyl vector $\rho$ equal to half the sum of the positive roots. Let $L_\beta := T \cdot $ the root $SL_2$ subgroup corresponding to the positive root $\beta$. Quoth Bert: the character of the irrep $V_{n\rho}$ is $T$-isomorphic to the tensor product over all positive roots of the $L_\beta$-irrep with highest weight $n\beta$. (The latter is a $T$-representation by sticking $T$ diagonally into $\prod_{\Delta_+} L_\beta$.) Once someone tells you, it's very easy to prove from the Weyl character formula. Geometrically, this says the following. Inside ${\mathbb P}^* (V^G_\rho)$, we have a copy of the flag manifold $G/B$ as the orbit of the highest weight vector. (Indeed, this is the smallest embedding by a complete linear series.) Identifying $V^G_\rho \cong \bigotimes_{\Delta_+} V^{L_\beta}_\beta$ as $T$-representations, we also have in this projective space a Segre-embedded $\prod_{\Delta_+} {\mathbb P}^* (V^{L_\beta}_\beta),$ a product of ${\mathbb P}^1$s. Kostant's observation is that these two subvarieties have the same $T$-equivariant Hilbert series. 

Again, I could easily believe that this question has very different answers depending on one's set theory. I don't have any especially good reason for asking this question. Feel free to retag. 

I often find it more useful to say $SU(3)$ is a $T^2$ bundle over the manifold of flags in ${\mathbb C}^3$ (itself a ${\mathbb CP}^1$-bundle over ${\mathbb CP}^2$). Partly this is because $T^2$'s homotopy groups are easier than those of $S^3$ and $S^5$. 

I suppose that the more natural construction would let $T$ be an arbitrary morphism instead of an endomorphism. In my context $\mathcal C$ is additive and I require also that $T^2=0$. 

The faces are all of the following form: $w W_P / Stab_W(\xi)$, where $W_P$ varies over the subgroups generated by subsets of the simple reflections. In particular, for $\xi$ regular, the number of them is $\sum_P |W / W_P|$. (Note that $\mathcal O_\xi$ is only $G/T$ when $\xi$ is regular; otherwise it's $G/Stab_G(\xi)$.) I wrote up a Hamiltonian-geometry-based proof of this, then realized the combinatorics is pretty easy too, assuming $\xi$ is regular as it seems you're doing. The set of faces ("external" faces, to us Hamiltonians) is obviously $W$-invariant. So it's enough to find the ones nearby the basepoint, then permute them. The polytope is "simple" -- it has the right number of edges coming out of each vertex, namely the rank of $G$. So the number of faces at the basepoint is $2^{rank(G)}$. Each $W_P$ gives one, so that's all of them. QED. Here are some related computations in the Hamiltonian formalism. If $S \leq T$ is a connected subgroup, then $ (G/T)^S = C_G(S) N(T)/ T $. Proof: $\subseteq$ is easy. For the reverse, let $s$ be a topological generator of $S$. If $s gT = gT$, then $g^{-1} s g \in T$, so $\exists n \in N(T)$ s.t. $n g^{-1} s g n^{-1} = s$, so $g n^{-1} \in C_G(s) = C_G(S)$. We're interested in the set $\coprod_S C_G(S) N(T)/T$ of all components, over all $S$, so we get the same set if we look at $\coprod_S N(T) C_G(S)/T$. Since the $T$-moment map is $N(T)$-equivariant, we just need to figure out which components of $\coprod_S C_G(S)/T$, i.e. which $S$, give external walls of the moment polytope. Every Levi subgroup of $G$ (w.r.t. a fixed Weyl chamber) arises as a $C_G(S)$, where $S$ is a dominant coweight. Each of those gives a wall around the basepoint of the Weyl polyhedron, and there are the same number of each: $2^{rank}$. So all the walls near the basepoint are images of $Levi/T$, i.e. with fixed points $W_P$. 

It seems like the answer should be nonunique (hence harder to find); it's easy to imagine deformations of the basis that don't change the structure constants at all. 

I believe the right reference is Borel-de Siebenthal. A finite-dimensional proof is as follows. The space of conjugacy classes $G/\sim$ can be identified with $T/W = (Lie(T)/\Lambda)/W = Lie(T)/(\Lambda \rtimes W) = Lie(T)/{\widehat W}$, where $\Lambda = ker(\exp:Lie(T)\to T)$, and the final equality uses $G$ simply connected. Then this last space is the Weyl alcove $\Delta$. There's an obvious action of $Z(G)$ on $G/\sim$, and the corresponding action on $\Delta$ is by isometries. In particular, it takes corners to corners. Some of those corners are in the orbit of the identity. So far we have an injection $Z(G) \to$ {corners of $\Delta$}, which of course then bijects to vertices of the affine Dynkin diagram. Lastly, we have to figure out the image. Given a point $t \in T$ lying over some point $p$ in the relative interior of a $k$-face of $\Delta$, the centralizer $C_G(t)$ has central rank $k$, semisimple rank $rank(G)-k$. If $p$ is a corner, then $C_G(t)$ is semisimple, and the neighborhood of $p$ in $\Delta$ is the Weyl chamber of $C_G(t)$. So the root lattice of $C_G(t)$ is finite index in that of $G$, and this index is the coefficient of the corresponding simple root in the affine root. The center is mapping to those vertices for which $C_G(t) = G$, i.e. this coefficient is therefore $1$. 

Let $G$ be a complex reductive Lie group, $G/P$ a flag manifold, and $\Phi: T^* G/P \to {\mathfrak g}^*$ the moment map. So $\Phi(T^* G/P)$ is the closure of a nilpotent orbit. Lots of classes of nilpotent orbits have special names. Is there a name for those nilpotent orbits arising as $\Phi(T^* G/P)$, where $G/P$ is cominuscule (also known as, a compact Hermitian symmetric space)? I'm trying to generalize some type $A$ examples, where every $G/P$ is cominuscule for $P$ maximal, but still one gets very few nilpotent orbits this way. 

Let $\pi\in S_n$. I recently needed to understand the permutations $\rho$ such that $\rho\not\leq\pi$ in Bruhat order. Since there are $O(n!)$ of those I really wanted a description of the $O(n^2)$ minimal such. I have a satisfying (to me) answer now, and so I am asking whether this question is addressed in the literature. My answer: It is easy to prove that the minimal $\rho$ are biGrassmannian, i.e. of the form $$1...r\ \ a+1...b\ \ r+1...a\ \ b+1...$$ for some $(r,a,b)$. In $\pi$'s permutation matrix, make a diagram by crossing out strictly North and West of each $1$. Let the co-essential boxes be the NW corners of the remaining regions, except for the region containing the SE corner. (The usual diagram comes from crossing out weakly South and East, and Fulton's "essential set" is the SE corners of what remains.) For each such box, let $r$ be the number of $1$s weakly NW of it, and $(r+b-a,a)$ its position, i.e. use those to define $(r,a,b)$. Then the biGrassmannian above is a minimal $\rho$, and they all arise this way, corresponding to the co-essential boxes. 

Let's start with $x \in Y$ a $B$-fixed vector. Then it's a high weight line in $M$, so the linear span $N \leq M$ of $Y$ is an irreducible subrepresentation of $M$. Do you mind if I assume we're in characteristic $0$, as Brion does? Then we can split $M = N \oplus N'$, and $M^* = N^* \oplus N'^*$.` (Which is to say, you can reduce to the case $M$ irreducible, if that helps understand the situation.) So it's sufficient (and in the general case, necessary!) to look for your $\eta$ inside $N^*$. Your first question is then why the $\eta \in (N^*)^B$, unique up to scale, has $\eta(m) \neq 0$. If it were zero, $$ 0 = \eta(m) = (b\cdot \eta)(m) = \eta(b^{-1}\cdot m) \qquad \forall b\in B $$ from which we learn that $\eta$ annihilates a spanning set of $N$, so all of $N$. But $\eta \in N^*$, ` so it's zero, contradiction. I'm not used to describing parabolic subgroups as "opposed" but I assume it means that $G_{[\eta]} G_y$ is dense in $G$. By definition of $\eta$, $G_{[\eta]} \geq B$, so it's enough to show $B G_y$ is dense in $G$, or that $B G_y / G_y$ is dense in $G/G_y$. This was exactly the condition used to pick $y$, that $B y$ was dense in $Y \cong G/G_y$.
