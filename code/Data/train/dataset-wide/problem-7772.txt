I am reposting the second question from here (after clarifying it) on the recommendation of user "GH from MO". Let $b_1,b_2,\dots$ be an enumeration of $\mathbb Q$. Question 2: Suppose I define $$G(x,y) = a_0(y) + a_1(y)(x-b_1) + a_2(y)(x-b_1)(x-b_2) + \dots$$ where the $a_k(y)$ are polynomials in $y$ and $g(x) = G(x,x)$. Suppose the $a_k(y)$ are not identically zero for $k$ large enough. Otherwise, we clearly get polynomials. Is this the only way to get a polynomial? That is, if $g(x)$ is equal to a polynomial function, then is $a_k = 0$ for $k \gg 0$? 

There is a generalization of the Kummer congruences to totally real number fields with characters due to Deligne-Ribet. For example, see the exposition here, more precisely see Theorem 2.1. What is confusing me is that they don't seem to use the L-functions with the Euler factor at p removed (which I will call the p-adic L function) but I thought that the Kummer congruences only held for the p-adic L functions. For instance, for the case of Dirichlet characters, I have only seen the theorem stated for p-adic L functions, for instance see Theorem 2.2 here. See also the wiki page for Kummer congruences without a character but with a higher order congruence. Conceptually, I thought of the Kummer congruences as equivalent to the continuity of the p-adic L function but I don't believe the L-function without the p Euler factor removed is continuous. What am I missing? Is it true that the Kummer congruences (even in the case of just Dirichlet characters) or am I misinterpreting the Deligne-Ribet result? 

What is more, several online sources include right from the start those normalizations in their definition of schlicht, e.g., planetmath.org, Wikipedia, and Wolfram MathWorld. 

This "discussion" has to do with some of the material we can find in pages 183-186 of the translation into English of the first part of E. Landau's Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie (published by the Chelsea Publishing Co. in 1966). 

In page 21 of A Problem seminar, D. J. Newman presents a novel way (at least for me) to determine the expectation of a discrete random variable. He refers to this expression as the failure probability formula. His formula goes like this $f_{0}+f_{1}+f_{2}+\ldots$ where $f_{n}$ is the probability that the experiment fails to produce the desired outcome for $n$ steps. He goes on to outlining two ways to establish the validity of this formula, but I'm having a hard time to unravel his second proof. I'll insert it here in order for my inquiry to be self-contained: 

For a locally compact group $G$, we define the Pontryagin dual as $\hat G = Hom(G,\mathbb T)$ where $\mathbb T$ is the circle group and the homomorphisms are continuous group maps. This duality has a lot of nice properties and shows up all over the place so it is probably the right definition. However, without the benefit of hindsight, why would one choose to define the dual of a group with respect to $\mathbb T$ (instead of some other locally compact group, say). Is there a reason to promote $\mathbb T$ to a special place among all locally compact groups? A little more broadly, are there other groups $H$ that also lead to a good theory of duality if we define $\hat G_H = Hom(G,H)$? One possible answer would be to explin the historical context/necessity which led to the definition. But there can also be other motivations and I would be open to both kinds of answers. On a closely related note, one can also ask a similar question for the Cartier duality in algebraic geometry. Probably, the two will have similar answers. 

I consider that the following lines of Hardy might help the OP to form a definite idea as to the accuracy of such an asseveration: "... I must deal with a misconception. It is sometimes suggested that pure mathematicians glory in the uselessness of their work*, and make it a boast that it has no practical applications. The imputation is usually based on an incautious saying attributed to Gauss, to the effect that, if mathematics is the queen of the sciences, then the theory of numbers is, because of its supreme uselessness, the queen of mathematics—I have never been able to find an exact quotation. I am sure that Gauss’s saying (if indeed it be his) has been rather crudely misinterpreted. If the theory of numbers could be employed for any practical and obviously honourable purpose, if it could be turned directly to the furtherance of human happiness or the relief of human suffering, as physiology and even chemistry can, then surely neither Gauss nor any other mathematician would have been so foolish as to decry or regret such applications. But science works for evil as well as for good (and particularly, of course, in time of war); and both Gauss and less mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing that there is one science at any rate, and that their own, whose very remoteness from ordinary human activities should keep it gentle and clean. *I have been accused of taking this view myself. I once said that ‘a science is said to be useful if its development tends to accentuate the existing inequalities in the distribution of wealth, or more directly promotes the destruction of human life’, and this sentence, written in 1915, has been quoted (for or against me) several times. It was of course a conscious rhetorical flourish, though one perhaps excusable at the time when it was written. " P.S. a) The emphasis is mine. b) The excerpt comes from the last paragraph of section 21 of Hardy's Apology. 

Let $K = \mathbb Q(\mu_m)$ and $\zeta_K$ it's Dedekind zeta function. We know from the class number formula that, around $0$: $$\zeta_K(s) \sim s^{r_1+r_2-1}h(K)R(K)/w(K) $$ where $h,R,w$ stand for the size of the class group, the regulator and the size of the subgroup of roots of unity. On the other hand, we have the decomposition: $$\zeta_K(s) = \prod_\chi L(s,\chi)$$ where the product is over suitable Dirichlet characters and moreover, $L(0,\chi) = -B_{1,\chi}$ - the generalized Bernoulli numbers. On the other hand, $R(K)$ should not be algebraic and there should be a corresponding transcendental contribution from $L(0,\chi)$ and the explicit formula for $B_{1\chi}$ shows that this comes only from those $\chi$ such that $L(s,\chi) = 0. $ Question 1: In the case that $L(s,\chi) = 0$, is it possible to say what the first non zero Taylor coefficient is? Question 2: Can we decompose (even if it is only conjecturally) $h(K),R(K),w(K)$ into factors corresponding to each Dirichlet character appearing in the decomposition of $\zeta_K$ . What about the order of vanishing of $L(0,\chi)$? 

In point of fact, K. Mahler proved in this paper that, if $p(x)$ in a non-constant polynomial such that $p(n) \in \mathbb{N}$ for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then the number $$0.p(1)p(2)p(3)p(4)\ldots,$$ which is formed concatenating after the decimal point the values of $p(1), p(2), p(3), \ldots$ (in that order), is a transcendental and non-Liouville number. 

The automorphism group of the symmetric group $S_n$ is (isomorphic to) $S_n$ when $n$ is different from $2$ or $6$. In fact, if $G$ is a complete group you can ascertain that $G \simeq \mathrm{Aut}(G)$. The reverse implication needn't hold, though. 

Let us suppose that $x^{n}+y^{n}= z^{n}$ with $x, y,$ and $z$ relatively prime. By the abc-conjecture, $|x^{n}|\ll |xyz|^{1+\epsilon}$, $|y^{n}|\ll |xyz|^{1+\epsilon}$ and $|z^{n}|\ll |xyz|^{1+\epsilon}$. Therefore, $|xyz|^{n}\ll |xyz|^{3+\epsilon}$ which implies that, for $|xyz|>1$, $n$ is bounded. Unfortunately, this establishes only an asymptotic version of FLT. Nevertheless, if we had explicit information regarding the implied constant in the abc-conjecture, we could in principle determine explicit upper bounds for those $n$'s for which the abc-conjecture doesn't settle FLT. 

Enumerate the rationals as $b_1,b_2,\dots$ and define the (set) function: $$f(x) = (x-b_1)^2 + (x-b_1)^2(x-b_2)^2 + \dots.$$ At any particular $x$, only finitely many terms are non zero so this is perfectly well defined as a (set) function but surely, it is not equal to any polynomial! (or is it?) How do I show that there is no polynomial $p(t) \in \mathbb Q[t]$ such that $p(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in \mathbb Q$? If $f(x)$ were defined as $(x-b_1) + (x-b_1)(x-b_2) + \dots$, then this question is not so hard. If $p(x)$ has degree $n$, then testing on $b_1,\dots,b_n$ would show that $p(x)$ is necessarily $(x-b_1) + (x-b_1)(x-b_2) + \dots + (x-b_1)\dots(x-b_n)$ but then $x=b_{n+1}$ derives a contradiction. I don't know how to adapt this approach. Trying to guess the polynomial seems hard even if we think $p(x)$ is degree $1$. I posted a follow up to this question here: (Variation of an old question) Are these functions polynomials?. 

Later on, I would come to the conclusion that they'd decided to disregard the first condition in the definition à la Herstein because in their examples, etc., they were to analize "euclidianness" with respect to the norm in the extension which determines an application that is even completely multiplicative. 

Can any of you guys help me to find out if there is a retrodigitized copy of M. Ram Murty's 1976 thesis available on the online database of Carleton University Library? I really hope this question is appropriate for MO. Thanks in advance for your replies. Sources 

Isn't it weird that nobody's mentioned so far K. Chandrasekharan's treatise on Arithmetic Functions? OK, they've already mentioned his book on the principles of Analytic Number Theory, yet the book I'm now referring to is K. Chandrasekharan. Arithmetical Functions. Die Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften in Einzeldarstellungen, Band 167, Springer-Verlag. You should definitely take a look at it, esteemed rpg16! I consider that none of the texts listed above is more to the point than this one. 

This is a followup to the question here: How to show that the following function isn't a polynomial over Q?. As before, let $b_1,b_2,\dots$ be an enumeration of $\mathbb Q$. The question might be sensitive to the enumeration (but probably not). Question 1: Suppose I define $$f_3(x) = (x-b_1)^3 + (x-b_1)^3(x-b_2)^3 + \dots,$$ how do I show that this function is not a polynomial? I do not believe the answers to the old question extend to this case since they all seem to use the positivity of squares. Can we show that $f(x)$ is not a polynomial? There is a even more general version (and the one I was interested in from the beginning) that I was interested in, however I forgot to omit the trivial cases/there was some ambiguity in the second question, so I asked it again here: Is the following function a polynomial? 

Let $R$ be a DVR with uniformizer $\pi$, fraction field $K$ and residue field $k$. Let $X/K$ be a Severi-Brauer variety and $\mathscr X/R$ a smooth, projective model of it. Is it true that $\mathscr X_k/k$ is also a Severi-Brauer variety? What if we only assume that $\mathscr X/R$ is smooth and proper? One way to try and prove this would be to show that if $X$ is trivial as a Severi-Brauer variety, then $\mathscr X \cong \mathbb P^n_R$ over $R$. Is this true? (Note: I asked this a few hours ago on mathstackexchange but on the suggestion of someone, I am posting it here. I have deleted the stackexchange post.) 

Let $C_{c}^{r}(\mathbb{R}^{\ast})$ denote the set of all functions $f \colon (0,\infty) \to \mathbb{C}$ that are $r$ times differentiable and have compact support. For any $y \in (0,\infty)$ and any $f \in C_{c}^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{\ast})$, let $m_{y}(f) := \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} y\phi(n) f(y^{\frac{1}{2}}n)$ where $\phi$ is the Euler totient function; in addition, let $m_{0}(y) := \int_{0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{6}{\pi^{2}}\right)u f(u)\, du$. In the paper Discrete measures and the Riemann hypothesis (Kodai Math. J. 17 (1994), no. 3, 596–608.), Prof. Alberto Verjovsky proved the folllowing: The Riemann Hypothesis is true if and only if $m_{y}(f) = m_{0}(f) + o(y^{\frac{3}{4}-\epsilon})$ as $y \to 0$ for every $f \in C_{c}^{r}(\mathbb{R}^{\ast})$ with $r \in [2,\infty]$ and every $\epsilon > 0$.

As a matter of fact, P. L. Chebyshev knew already that for any $\epsilon > \frac{1}{5}$, there exists an $n(\epsilon) \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n\geq n(\epsilon),$ $\pi((1+\epsilon)n)-\pi(n)>0.$ In [2], one can find a short report on the problem of determining the smallest $n(\epsilon)$ explicitly once that $\epsilon$ has been fixed.
