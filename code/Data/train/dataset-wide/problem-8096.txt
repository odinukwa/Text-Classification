But if we perturb these definitions a little, we get examples where there is no functor that obviously inverts exactly the weak equivalences. For example, weak equivalences of spaces are "almost" defined to be the morphisms inverted by a product of homotopy group functors, except that a weak equivalence has to be an isomorphism on homotopy groups at all basepoints, and it doesn't seem to be possible to express this in terms of a functor. This is partly why so much machinery like model categories and homotopical categories gets built up: to yield easy-to-check criteria guaranteeing the saturatedness of a class of morphisms. Ad (2) I wouldn't overthink this one. Homotopy theory is all about studying what happens when you see certain morphisms ("weak equivalences") as isomorphisms. For these purposes, it makes no difference to replace the weak equivalences with their saturation if they are not saturated already, because morphisms in the saturation automatically look like isomorphisms from this viewpoint too. Ad (3) I think my general sense is that in practice, if it's natural to localize at a given class of morphisms, that class of morphisms is probably already saturated. It just may be difficult to show. But perhaps there are examples of abstract constructions in the theory of relative categories / categories with weak equivalences / homotopical categories / model categories / ... where one might input one or more categories with saturated weak equivalences and output a category with non-saturated weak equivalences. 

The defining problem of homotopy theory is that often when one localizes a nice category at a reasonable class of morphisms, the result is a very bad category. Does passing to the $\infty$ world fix this (so that homotopy theory becomes no different from ($\infty$)-category theory)? A "nice" category is an accessible one, a reasonable class of morphisms is one which is accessible and accessibly embedded in the arrow category, and the localization is a category with the appropriate universal property. This all transports into the $\infty$ setting. To make this precise, one might consider the strict 2-category (actually, the link only talks about the strict 2-category of all quasicategories, we pass to a locally full sub-2-category) $\mathbf{Acc}$ of accessible $\infty$-categories and accessible $\infty$-functors (which I guess has PIE limits as in the ordinary case, including cotensors to define the arrow category), and ask whether this 2-category has co-inverters. This fails in the non-$\infty$-case -- weak equivalences of simplicial sets are accessible and accessibly embedded, but the co-inserter is the homotopy category, which is not accessible. Or maybe there's a more $\infty$-way to put this, talking about codescent diagrams or something. More generally, one could ask whether the 2-category of accessible $\infty$-categories has all co-PIE colimits. Of course, all of this may be asking too much -- after all, the 2-category of $\lambda$-accessible categories and $\lambda$-accessible functors should be a 2-category of free algebras for the free $\lambda$-filtered cocompletion 2-monad $\mathrm{Ind_\lambda}$ -- and one generally expects that free algebras won't be closed under colimit-like constructions like quotients (or localizations). I suppose that if the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ being localized is locally presentable, then presenting $\mathcal{C}$ as a combinatorial model category, we should be able to use Jeff Smith's theorem to see that the localization is again presented by a combinatorial model structure. At least, this is so long as the localizing subcategory satisfies 2-out-of-3. But it would be nice to remove this technical hypothesis. 

I'd just like to point out that in the many-object case this has been called the fundamental groupoid of a category by Par√©, which would suggest that it could be called the fundamental group of a monoid, a possibility strengthened by the fact that, as Benjamin Steinberg points out in the comments, it's the fundamental group of the classifying space of the monoid. Another possibility might be classifying group, but that's probably ill-advised since it's not clear (to me) what it classifies. 

Here is some background explanation. What is a lax-idempotent 2-Monad? There are a number of different ways to approach lax-idempotent 2-monads (sometimes called K(ock-)Z(oberlein) monads). For a flavor, here are some equivalent definitions. A lax-idempotent 2-monad $(T,\eta,\mu)$ on a 2-category $C$ is a 2-monad such that... 

And so forth. Similar comments apply to other sorts of categorical structures. This is really one of the nice things about category theory -- categorical structures naturally organize themselves into categories, so you can re-use category-theoretic concepts at higher levels of abstraction. For example, there is a category of categories (with functors as morphisms), which is even a 2-category (with natural transformations as 2-morphisms). 

The only way I know to get a locally cartesian closed category which is not a topos is to start with a topos and then throw out some objects so that the category is not sufficiently cocomplete to be a topos. Is that the only way there is? Well, I suppose there's another way: the category of topological spaces and local homeomorphisms is locally cartesian closed. So one can get a similar effect by throwing out morphisms. But in this example the category is not even accessible. Let's stipulate that the category should also not be a poset. After all, a topos is just a locally cartesian closed category with a subobject classifier. Is the subobject classifier merely a representability condition, or does it have additional exactness implications beyond local cartesian closure? 

This is true in the Noetherian case by Nakayama's lemma. Is it true in general? Less tersely, let $R$ be a commutative ring and $I \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(R)$ be an ideal contained in the Jacobson radical. Define the transfinite powers $I^\alpha$ for $\alpha$ an ordinal inductively as ($I^1 = I$ and) $I^{\alpha+1} = I \cdot I^\alpha$, and $I^\alpha = \cap_{\beta < \alpha} I^\beta$ at limit ordinals. This is a decreasing sequence of ideals, so it must eventually stabilize: i.e. there is $\kappa$ such that $I^\lambda = I^\kappa$ for all $\lambda \geq \kappa$,and in particular we have $I \cdot I^\kappa = I^\kappa$. If $I^\kappa$ is finitely generated (and in particular if $R$ is Noetherian), then by Nakayama's lemma, $I^\kappa = 0$ because $I \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(R)$. But is this true in the non-Noetherian case? That is, if $R$ is non-Noetherian and $I \subseteq \mathrm{rad}(R)$, then do we have $I^\kappa = 0$ for sufficiently large $\kappa$? 

Here is a nuts-and-bolts comparison, which I think lurks behind the Rezk / Lurie approach to Goodwillie calculus in Higher Algebra, 6.1.1. I'm comparing to 6.2.2 in Higher Topos Theory for the sheaf case. 

See Johnstone's Sketches of an Elephant, section D.4.5 for the following and more examples. If $G$ is a group, then the topos of $G$-sets satisfies the internal axiom of choice -- every object is internally projective. But the only projective objects are the free $G$-sets. So if $G$ is nontrivial, then this topos does not have every object projective -- it does not satisfy the external axiom of choice. 

Discussion: Condition (2) says that Gabriel-Ulmer duality holds for the doctrine $\Psi$. So it's a condition that only considers $\Psi$-cocomplete categories. So it's remarkable for it to be equivalent to the other properties. Condition (4) basically says that any colimit is an iterated $\Psi$-flat colimit of $\Psi$-colimits, and Condition (3) says that this can be done in one step. More can be said for particular doctrines. For example, Dostal and Velebil investigate the doctrine of finite products. 

The answer is no (I think -- non-pointwise Kan extensions are a pain and I may have messed something up!). I wouldn't lose too much sleep over this, though -- in practice, you never know that some functor is a Kan extension without knowing it's a pointwise one. The non-pointwise Kan extension I gave here works for a counterexample. See there for more details. The Kan extension looks like this: (The best intuition I can offer is that it was actually constructed to have $F$ fully faithful, but the comparison 2-cell $\eta$ non-invertible, which forces it to be a non-pointwise Kan extension.) $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} \mathbf{B}\mathbb{N} @>G>> C\\ @VFVV \nearrow L \\ \mathbf{B}\mathbb{N}_+ \end{CD} Here $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{N}$ is the monoid $\mathbb{N}$ regarded as a one-object category, $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{N}_+$ is the same with an initial object adjoined, $F$ is the natural inclusion, and $C$ looks like this: $G\bullet \overset{(\eta_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}}{\overset{\to}{\to}} L\bullet \overset{L!}{\leftarrow} L\emptyset$ Here $G\bullet$ is the fully faithful image of $G$ (so it's a copy of $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{N}$), and $L\emptyset \overset{L!}{\to} L\bullet$ is the fully faithful image of $L$ (so it's a copy of $\mathbf{B}\mathbb{N}_+$ where $L\emptyset$ is the initial object). $C(G\bullet, L\bullet)$ is generated by an arrow $\eta = \eta_0$ under the equation $\eta_n = \eta \circ Gn = Ln \circ \eta$. So $\eta$ constitutes a comparison natural transformation $G \implies LF$. Why it's a left Kan extension: An exhaustive analysis of the functors $H: \mathbf{B}\mathbb{N}_+ \to C$ (there are 5 families of them, depending on where the objects are sent) reveals that the only one which admits a natural transformation $G \implies HF$ or $L \implies H$ is $L$ itself, and this diagram is in fact a left Kan extension $L = \mathrm{Lan}_F G$. Why it's a counterexample: You can check that $Hom(G\bullet,-)$ and $Nat(Hom(F,\bullet),Hom(G,-))$ are isomorphic; they map $L\emptyset \mapsto \emptyset$, $L\bullet \mapsto \mathbb{N}$, $G\bullet \mapsto \mathbb{N}$. So $G\bullet$ "should" be the value of $\mathrm{Lan}_F G(\bullet)$. even though the value in the actual left Kan extension $L$ is $L\bullet$. 

Stably, phantom maps (nonzero maps which are zero on homotopy) exist, but it's not known if they exist between finite complexes (Freyd's Generating Hypothesis). Unstably, it's easy to find maps which are the same on homotopy but not homotopic (even between finite complexes), however I don't know an example of a map which is the identity on homotopy but not homotopic to the identity. I presume I could take $\Omega^\infty(1+f)$ where $f$ is a known stable phantom map -- and I would be interested to see the details worked out -- but known stable phantom maps seem to hinge crucially on $\varprojlim^1$ issues, and so are "inherently infinitary". I'd like to see an unstable example which is not "inherently infinitary"; concretely it would be nice to see an example on a finite complex, but I'm not wedded to this interpretation of "not inherently infinitary". To sum up: Question: What is an example of a self-map $f: X \to X$ of a (pointed, connected) CW complex which is not homotopic to the identity but such that $\pi_\ast(f): \pi_\ast(X) \to \pi_\ast(X)$ is the identity? Bonus points if $X$ is a finite complex. An equivalent question is: what's an example of a space $X$ such that $Aut(X)$ doesn't act faithfully on $\pi_\ast(X)$, where $Aut(X)$ is the group of homotopy classes of self-homotopy-equivalences of $X$? Another way of putting this is: Whitehead's theorem tells us that the functor $\pi_\ast$ reflects isomorphisms, but does it reflect identities, i.e. is it faithful with respect to isomorphisms? For that matter, I'm having trouble coming up with a space $X$ such that $Aut(X)$ doesn't act faithfully on its homology, either. 

An elementary observation (Proposition 3, section 1, p. F 12): $I$-colimits commute in $\mathrm{Set}$ with $P$-limits iff $I$-limits commute with discrete $\pi_0(P)$-colimits and also with $P'$-colimits for each connected component $P'$ of $P$. Foltz then analyzes separately the cases of $P$ discrete and of $P$ connected. He separately analyzes the conditions that the canonical comparison map be always injective and that it be always surjective. He treats some examples of interest at the end, including the colimits that commute in $\mathrm{Set}$ with pullbacks and those that commute in $\mathrm{Set}$ with equalizers. But it doesn't appear that he discusses how to recover characterizations of filtered or sifted limits. Foltz's criteria are expressed in terms of certain certain subdivision categories, and a lot of zig-zags. Unfortunately, he doesn't discuss how to relate his criteria to other more familiar ones, such as the finality of certain diagonal functors. But it might be possible to convert his criteria into such forms.
