A $B$ with the above two properties gives a positive answer to your question by the following reasoning. We can prove by induction that for any $n$, $B^{(n)} \equiv_T 0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n}$. This is trivial when $n = 0$. Now for the inductive case, assume $B^{(n)} \equiv_T 0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n}$. Then we see that $B^{(n+1)} \equiv_T (0^{(n)} \oplus C_n)' \equiv_T 0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_n$ since $C_n$ is $(n+1)$-generic and hence $1$-generic relative to $0^{(n)}$. Finally, $0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_n \equiv_T 0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_{n+1}$ because either $n \notin A$ and so $C_n = C_{n+1}$ or $n \in A$ so $C_{n+1} \equiv_T B_n \oplus C_n$, but then $B_n \leq_T 0^{(n+1)}$. Hence, $B^{(n)}$ cannot compute $A$ for any $n \in \omega$, since $C_{n}$ is $(n+1)$-generic, and so $0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n} \ngeq_T 0^{(n+1)}$. (Indeed, it's easy to see that $B$ is $GL_n$ for every $n \in \N$). Thus, $A$ is not arithmetically definable relative to $B$. 

If $n \notin A$, then $B_n$ is arithmetically generic, and if $n \in A$, then $B_n$ is $(n+1)$-generic and computable from $0^{(n+1)}$. Hence $\{n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{$B_n$ is arithmetic}\}$ is equal to $A$. For each $k \in \N$, let $m_i$ be the $i$th element of the set $\{m \in \N : m \notin A \lor m \geq k\}$. Then $C_k = \bigoplus_{i \in \omega} B_{m_i}$ is $(k+1)$-generic. 

I'm sorry for asking the question. There is an easy counter-example. Let $\mathbb{F}_1$ be the first Hirzebruch surface and let $\pi \colon \mathbb{F}_1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be a projection which makes $\mathbb{F}_1$ a $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^1$. Let $S \subset \mathbb{F}_1$ be the unique section of $\pi$ which has self-intersection $-1$. Then $\pi$ restricts to a vector bundle $p \colon E \to \mathbb{P}^1$ where $E = \mathbb{F}_1 \setminus S$. The canonical divisor of $\mathbb{P}^1$ is $-2 P$ where $P$ is some point on $\mathbb{P}^1$. On the other hand, $\mathbb{F}^1$ is the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ in one point and thus the canonical divisor of $E$ is given by $-3 F$ where $F$ is a fiber of $p$. But the pull-back of $-2P$ on $E$ is $-2 F$. 

Let $X$ be an affine spherical variety for some reductive algebraic group $G$. Let $X^0$ be the open orbit in $X$ under a fixed Borel subgroup $B \subseteq G$. Does there exists a function $f$ on $X$ such that $X^0$ is the same as $\{ \, x \in X \ | \ f(x) \neq 0 \, \}$? I'm interested in any proof, counter-example or reference. 

There are a couple well known proofs of incompleteness based on properties of PA degrees. PA degrees have been studied extensively in recursion theory. A PA degree is a Turing degree that can compute a complete extension of PA. Obviously, to prove the incompleteness theorem, it's enough to show that no PA degree can be recursive. (If we had a consistent r.e. theory T extending PA that was not incomplete, then its completion would be recursive -- to decide whether $T \models \varphi$ or $T \models \neg \varphi$, simply look for a proof of $\varphi$ or $\neg \varphi$ from $T$, and because $T$ is assumed to be complete, this process always terminates and is hence recursive). One way to see that there are no recursive PA degrees is to observe that any PA degree can compute a nonstandard model of PA via compactness and a Henkin construction. Now apply Tennenbaum's theorem that there are no recursive nonstandard models of PA. Another way to see that there are no recursive PA degrees is with $\Pi^0_1$ classes. Every PA degree can compute a path through each $\Pi^0_1$ class (this is one direction of the Scott basis theorem). To finish, note that one can construct $\Pi^0_1$ classes that do not contain any recursive elements. For instance, there are $\Pi^0_1$ classes that contain only diagonally nonrecursive elements. 

Let $E$, $X$ be irreducible smooth algebraic varieties over the complex numbers and let $p \colon E \to X$ be a morphism which is locally trivial with respect to the Zariski topology. Since $p$ is a vector bundle and the varieties are smooth, we get a natural isomorphism $p^\ast \colon\textrm{Pic}(X) \to \textrm{Pic}(E)$ by the pull-back of divisors, see e.g. Chp. 3 in [Fu84]. Is it true that $p^\ast \omega_X = \omega_E$ where $\omega_X$ and $\omega_E$ denote the canonical divisors of $X$ and $E$ respectively? Any proof, counter-example or textbook reference would be perfect. [Fu84] W. Fulton. Intersection theory, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1984. 

Here is another answer in case $G = \mathrm{PGL}_2 \times \mathrm{PGL}_2$, just using elementary calculations. So let $H \subset G$ be a connected maximal algebraic subgroup. For $i = 1, 2$, denote by $p_i \colon G \to \mathrm{PGL}_2$ the projection to the $i$-th factor. If $p_1(H) \neq \mathrm{PGL}_2$, then $p_1(H)$ is a maximal (connected) subgroup of $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ and thus $H = B \times \mathrm{PGL}_2$ for some Borel subgroup $B$ of $\mathrm{PGL}_2$. Analogously, if $p_2(H) \neq \mathrm{PGL}_2$, then $H = \mathrm{PGL}_2 \times B$. Now, assume $p_1(H) = p_2(H) = \mathrm{PGL}_2$. Let $N \subseteq H$ be a normal subgroup of $H$. Since $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ is simple, $p_i(N) = 1$ for $i =1, 2$ and hence $N$ lies in the kernel of $p_1$ and of $p_2$. Thus $N = 1$ and therefore $H$ is simple. Since $H$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{PGL}_2 \times \mathrm{PGL}_2$, it must be isomorphic to $\mathrm{PGL}_2$. Thus, $p_i \colon H \to \mathrm{PGL}_2$ is an isomorphism for $i=1, 2$ and hence H is conjugate to the diagonal embedding (here one uses the fact that all automorphisms of $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ are inner). [ADDED] There is a more direct argument in case $p_1(H) = p_2(H) = \mathrm{PGL}_2$: the kernel of $p_1 |_H \colon H \to \mathrm{PGL}_2$ is the normal subgroup $H \cap \{ 1 \} \times \mathrm{PGL}_2$ of $H$. Since $p_2(H) = \mathrm{PGL}_2$, one can easily see that $H \cap \{ 1 \} \times \mathrm{PGL}_2$ is normal in $\{ 1 \} \times \mathrm{PGL}_2$. Since $H \subsetneq \mathrm{PGL}_2 \times \mathrm{PGL}_2$, this implies that $H \cap \{ 1 \} \times \mathrm{PGL}_2$ is trivial and thus $p_1 |_H$ is an isomorphism. Analogously one sees that $p_2 |_H$ is an isomorphism. Hence $H$ is conjugate to the diagonal embedding (here one uses the fact that all automorphisms of $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ are inner). [ERRATUM] The direct argument above only shows that $p_1 |_H$ and $p_2 |_H$ are bijective. 

There are $B$ with this property. Lets first recall some definitions and notation. Suppose $X \in 2^\omega$ (which we identify with subsets of $\N$ via characteristic functions). Then $X'$ is the Turing jump of $X$, and $X^{(n)}$ is the nth iterate of the Turing jump of $X$. $X$ is said to be $n$-generic (i.e. $\Sigma^0_n$-generic for Cohen forcing) if for every $\Sigma^0_n$ subset $S$ of $2^{< \omega}$ there is a finite initial segment $\sigma$ of $X$ so that either $\sigma \in S$, or there are no extensions of $\sigma$ contained in $S$. $X$ is said to be arithmetically generic if $X$ is $n$-generic for every $n$. It is a standard fact that if $X$ is $1$-generic, then $X' \equiv_T 0' \oplus X$, where $\oplus$ is recursive join. We also have that if $X$ is $n$-generic and $Y$ is $1$-generic relative to $X \oplus 0^{(n-1)}$, then $X \oplus Y$ is $n$-generic. Finally, if $X_0, X_1, \ldots \in 2^\omega$, then $\bigoplus_n X_n = \{\langle n, m \rangle: m \in X_n\}$ notes their recursive join. Let $A = 0^{(\omega)} = \bigoplus_{n} 0^{(n)}$; the set of true sentences in first order arithmetic. Below, we will construct a $B$ so that:
