It's impossible to say for sure without having more information about what type of link you have. Still, keep in mind how the tools usually measure this bandwidth. The router doesn't maintain a "bandwidth" metric that you can read from SNMP. Rather, it has counters for the number of bytes that have been input and output. So your monitoring tool will poll that number at set intervals and calculate 

On the other hand, I think it's less and less clear that wifi-level encryption on a public/guest network is all that useful since most apps that really need the encryption already provide it at their own level, typically through HTTPS. The era of unencrypted passwords passing over raw POP3 or HTTP for example is (thankfully) nearly past us I think. 

The controller function (not necessarily a dedicated device by the way) is essential to how any wireless network bigger than what you have at home works. 

In classful networks the class is determined by the leading four bits in the ip-address. B-networks start with 10 (binary). So, in fact 190.28.0.0 is a Class B network. $URL$ When it comes to CIDR you can say nothing about the size of a network from just 190.28.0.0. But 190.28.0.0/16 tells me there is 16 bits in the network part of the address and the remaining 16 are host bits. Since ip-address calculations are performed in binary, to find a netmask that will divide a /16 into 8 subnets you do the calculation 2^x = 8 (looking for how many digits you need in a binary number to have 8 combinations) which is 3. So, a /16 can be divided into 8 /19. 

First of all 802.11g is 2.4Ghz only and 802.11a is 5GHz only. If you don't have a dual band client (a+g) it can only connect to g OR a depending on what band your client supports. 802.11n can do both 2.4GHz (gn) and 5GHz (an) depending on your AP. A 2.4GHz 802.11n (gn) device can always behave as a 802.11g device because the n only means bigger channel width (40MHz) and up to four spatial streams. But it can revert back to using just one spatial stream if there is a 802.11g client. The same is true for a 5GHz 802.11n (an) device, it can also revert back to fewer streams if needed. Please have a look at: $URL$ 

In the Cisco world all that gets handled by the WLC, usually as a set of physical appliances, but there are other manufacturers which split this up, such as Aerohive, where the config server may be in the cloud, the radio management part is handled in peer-to-peer fashion by the APs themselves and you can get a sort of vpn gateway for tunneling traffic back to a central point. 

I would also take this opportunity to make this easier for next time: instead of using fixed IPs for printers (or even APs) give them static DHCP assignments. That way if you ever need to change settings again (a new DNS for example) you'll have a mostly one-stop change to make. Also, if you're afraid of breaking things or forgetting something, you can configure your router such that it has the new 172 IP as its primary, and the old 169 IP as a secondary IP. That way, any device you've forgotten will still be reachable until you remove the secondary IP. The new IP has to be the primary as that's what's used for DHCP relay (on Cisco HW anyway). 

I need to reset or default an interface on an Aruba switch. This may be the same for HP procurve switches, but I am not sure. On Cisco, the command would be in global config mode. Is there an equivalent command for Aruba OS? 

We have three small business PoE switches, SG220-50P purchased from two places. They are each randomly rebooting at different times every few days, and sometimes only after a few hours. They have been doing this basically since we purchased them. I initially thought the devices were defective, but I haven't seen anything regarding this model, and I wouldn't expect to get 3 bad ones from two different sources. I've enabled flash logging, and nothing abnormal is recorded, it's not even showing power down. They just come back up as if it were a normal boot. I updated the firmware two times now, and that hasn't helped. Resetting to factory seems to help for a while, but then the problem comes back. The devices are on a UPS that isn't overloaded. They are each consuming about 35W on PoE, with a max of 375 available. What would you recommend to troubleshoot this issue? I'm new to networking admin, so sorry if my question is unrefined. 

It really depends what your objective is. If you're looking to run VoWifi with its sensitivity to coverage issues, or if you have something very different from a garden-variety office (say an industrial plant with metallic structures every which way) you should probably go for the survey, and find someone competent to do it. If the site is both small (under 5 to 10 APs) and fairly "standard" I tend to eyeball it based on a good set of plans of the site and some indications as to where people are, and it usually turns out pretty well. We leave some slack in the wiring so we can adjust things if necessary. I find that the biggest problem tends to be people on site telling me "we need 3 APs" because they are thinking only of signal propagation, but they are forgetting entirely about user density in our world of multi-device always-connected users... so getting the AP count right, and making the site manager agree to an increased AP count and cost, tends to be hardest. 

I have a full mesh core network running OSPF. I use OSPF down to the "L3 Agg switches". Now I want to restrict traffic between some of the networks at our site, but how is this done when there is multiple routes to every network? Behind every "L3 Agg switch" there is a cluster that in some cases need to be isolated from the rest of the network. 

If you divide your network into eight /19 you have 32-19 bits remaining for hosts. To find the number of hosts you calculate 2^(32-19) = 8192. But remember that the first and the last address are reserved for network and broadcast-addresses. That gives you 8190 usable IP-addresses. To find the ranges you set the host part of the address to all zeros to find the network address (first address) and to all ones to find the broadcast address (last address) Edit (Working example) The ip 190.28.0.0 is 10111110.00011100.00000000.00000000 in binary. Let say i choose the subnet 010 to get a /19 network. This gives me the network address 10111110.00011100.01000000.00000000 which translates to 190.28.64.0. To find the broadcast address of the same network we set all remaining bits to 1: 10111110.00011100.01011111.11111111 which translates to 190.28.95.255 You can then do the same calculations for all eight subnets i mentioned above.
