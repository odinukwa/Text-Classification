Apologies for the wasted time, I didn't realise at the time but when I restored the database to the second server I didn't select restore with NO RECOVERY. After making the change and attempting to mirror again the process worked. I still don't understand why I was receiving an error indicating the cluster was not responding considering the problem was on the stand-alone mirrored server. 

I'm implementing security restrictions for a client who would like to prevent admin accounts from logging into workstations. For example each person has a user account and an admin account and only the user account should have access. The admin account is for troubleshooting purposes and for escalating privileges to resolve issues. If I deny Interactive Log-on for the admin accounts, then the ability to use them for Run As is also removed. I also looked at "Allow Log on locally" and specifying only normal accounts but that means removing Administrators from Allow Log on locally which causes further issues. My current recourse is to make a logon script that looks to see if the user is a normal account or admin account and in the latter circumstance start a logout process. Can anyone think of a better way of doing this? We are simply trying to implement least privileged access and ensure the administrators don't login with their admin accounts. 

Are you sure you have ASP configured as a role on the server? Go to Server Manager, Roles and verify that Application Development -> ASP is installed. 

I am trying to recover from a dvd that was made for me using Symantec Ghost software. The GHO file was burned onto a dvd using windows explorer and not the ghost client. We are getting an error trying to recover from the dvd, I don't know the error message though (I am offsite). My local IT tech over there is telling me 

Apologies for such a simple question, but I've been searching for how to download the UE-V 2.x client files for the last few days and all I can find is references on how to install them, nothing on where they are located to begin with. I must be missing something basic, for anyone who has setup EU-V before can you fill me in on what I'm missing? 

I followed a link for a beta version of the client and found that it was included in Microsoft Desktop Optimisation Pack. Apologies for wasting your time... and mine 

I'm trying to determine if we need to upgrade all of our clients if we were to switch over to using Project Server 2010. Right now we are just using Project Professional 2007, so my question is if we need to purchase Project Professional 2010 or can we still use the 2007 version? 

I am looking for a Windows VPS provider that will allow me to install any applications that I want on it. I tried the GoDaddy VPS plan, but it wouldn't let me install the windows updates that were required for SQL 2008. Do I need to go up to full dedicated or is there a provider that can give me full admin control? 

I've built a test lab running Windows Server 2016 and SCCM 2016 and I'm having an issue with PXE booting a VM to install an OS via SCCM. Here's the run down on the configuration. At this stage SCCM isn't being touched Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4 with Hyper-V Role installed Private Network Virtual Switch, no VLAN set, named "Local only" VM - DHCP - Gen2 VM - Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4 with DHCP Role installed, Network Adapter - On vSwitch "Local Only" VM - Win10BC - Gen2 VM - No OS (PXE UEFI), Network Adapter - On vSwitch "Local Only" For both VMs NIC Hardware Acceleration Tab has Enable Virtual Machine Queue ticked, Enable IPsec task offloading ticked with Maximum number: 1 For both VMs NIC Advanced Features Tab has Protected Network ticked DHCP Server has a single domain authorised IPv4 Scope bound to Eth0 192.168.0.5, NICs from full OS VMs in the same configuration can get a DHCP Lease Win10BC VM attempts to PXE Boot - "PXE Network Boot using IPv4 ( ESC to cancel), Performing DHCP Negotiation........" Using Wireshark on DHCP Server I can see DHCP Discover from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, DHCP Server Responds 192.168.0.5 to 255.255.255.255 with DHCP Offer. After a short delay the DHCP Discover and Offer process occurs again and there is no DHCP Request or Acknowledge step returned to the DHCP Server. It ends up timing out and Virtual Machine Boot Summary, 1. Network Adapter DHCP Failed This is where I'm stuck, either the DHCP Offer Broadcast isn't reaching the PXE VM or it's receiving and not responding to the DHCP Server. I've tried adding a vLAN to each member, I've tried turning off VMQ and IPsec task offloading, I've turned off Protected network with no change. On the DHCP Server I've ensured the DHCP firewall rules for IPv4 apply to Domain, Private and Public, Checked the NIC is correctly bound to respond and that other devices can get leases. All of this is on a single Hyper-V host with the DHCP Server and PXE Guest on the same vSwitch. I realise this is Technical Preview software but I'm hoping there is a solution and this isn't a bug in the preview software. Has anyone experienced this before? On 2016, 2012? I can provide screenshots of configuration as required. 

We have Sharepoint 2007 setup with Integrated Windows Authentication and it works fine for the most part. When users access the site, the dialog comes up and has them type in their username/password information and that works well. The problem I am having is that once they go to a document library and try to download a file, it re-asks them for their login information. Is there a way to turn off this 2nd authentication request? EDIT: On Windows 7 with IE 8 and Office 2010, it does not prompt me the 2nd time. On Windows XP with IE 6 and Office 2007, it does prompt me a 2nd time. 

I have one SCCM 2012 server not correctly responding to PXE requests for unknown computers. The server has PXE boot support enabled, enabled unknown computer support, boot images available with OS deployments available and targeted at unknown computers. However every time a computer comes through I receive the following error.

On all other errors I've looked at with people having problems with this step it shows further information about unable to find and then to return with abortpxe.com but mine isn't. ItemKey="2046820353" is "x64 Unknown Computer" in my SCCM at the Primary site for this Secondary site Deployment server. I've deleted all the "Unknown" computers, I've cleared pending PXE deployments and updated Memberships of all relevant computer groups but it still won't work. Does anyone have any idea on where I should look to resolve this problem or to dig deeper? Thanks 

Yea I know its a weird question title, but what I am looking for is something like a KVM that you would see in a server rack, only to server as a laptop kind of device. I am imagining having a computer on the floor and the KVM device with a screen and keyboard/mouse sitting on my lap. Anyone know if such a device exists??? 

Anytime I post a zip file with a renamed extension to .anything, it will always download as a .zip file. I have organizations that need to download these files, but cannot download .zip files. Is there anyway to have SharePoint not convert the file to .Zip when downloading? I do this all the time on ftp sites to bypass the security issue, but it just doesn't work here. Thanks! 

I'm trying to deploy a custom background into %windir%\system32\oobe\info\background\backgroundDefault.jpg and have created bat, ps1 files in both Applications and Packages to try and deliver the file, however when run through CM the file and folders are not created and success is reported. Even if the background folder doesn't exist the Detection Method still states it exists. For the Application method of deployment I tried a File System path detection on File and on Folder. I also tried a custom powershell script for detection. In both cases installation was recorded successful but the files weren't transferred. Package based installation did the same thing, completed with no errors. I'm pretty confused and search engines aren't helping. When I run the scripts manually with admin access the process works. But SCCM running as System (not in user Context) it repeats the same answer. Has anyone seen this? I'm stumped. Here is the basic bat and ps1 scripts, the custom detection method was just a PowerShell Test-Path command on the end file. bat 

OK, I don't know if I'm lazy or impatient, but I really need to get started using Windows Server 2008, but R2 will be out on MSDN on Friday. It is a simple update like a service pack to go from 2008 to R2 or is it like upgrading the operating system? Should I just wait till Friday? -OR- Would it be better for me to use the RC and then upgrade to R2 on Friday? I just don't think I can hold off until then. I have projects I need to get started on right away. 

I've got a MS SQL 2008 R2 Fail-Over Clustered Instance running between two Windows 2008 R2 servers using the inbuilt Windows Clustering features, that is working with a DTC and Quorum with a disk based Witness. This has been working fine for months and little concerns with the functionality. I've now been asked to add DB Mirroring to an alternate site (asynchronously) but when setting up the Mirroring partners the Endpoint on the cluster fails to respond. Pinging the Cluster Name returns the clusters IP so I'm not sure how to confirm its routing to the active host. Firewall port has been opened on both the remote server and the two clustered servers. Can anyone direct me on the steps you need to take to do Asynchronous database mirroring on a W2008R2/MSSQL2008R2 Fail-Over Cluster in order to make the Endpoint on the cluster reachable by the mirror?
