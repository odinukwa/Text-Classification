When using sub-interfaces, you should avoid any configuration on main interface. Connections/configuration between R4, R6 and SW1 should be as clear as the connection between R5 and R6. 

You need to un-provision the removed switch(es) and renumber the current one to be the 1st switch. Your two switches are now standalone switches. In fact, each of them has turned into a single-switch stack and been acting a role of Active/Master. To verfiy all previously-provisioned switches and their numbers, issue the commands and . Below are the sample outputs on a standalone switch which was the 2nd switch of an old two-switch stack (after being broken into two single devices): 

You can get most of the configuration with . For IPSec VPN Pre-Shared Key, you would see it from the output of command. 

The answer is: No, you (do not need to) cannot create seperate (same/duplicate) isakmp policies for different tunnels which have the same isakmp policy setups. That means if you have only single and same on firewalls at your HeadQuater and Remote Offices, that is enough. 

The book mentions /24, /25 and /26 as they are for each customer in 1st, 2nd and 3rd group, respectively. What you are concerning (/18, /19 and /19) is for each group (1st, 2nd and 3rd group, respectively). 

Yes, you can confirm that. Once hold-time expires, the former feasible successor route immediately becomes the successor route and is installed in routing table. I do not think we have a log message of when a feasible successor route becomes a successor route, given the fact that it happens right at the same time when the message of generated. 

On R1, the commands and are not working at all because the network command is to enable/run RIP on connected interface on device, not to "advertise". 

Updated answer: The output of packet-tracer told us that ASA2 did not know where to route/forward the traffic to ASA1 inside network (192.168.0.100 in 192.168.0.0/24) because it does not have anything in its routing table. Please add the followings for testing purposes in this particular setup/lab, then try packet-tracer (and ping) again few times: 

Now back to your question, we should put the picture above together with Conn Flags and ASA interfaces: 

===== You can re-create the VPN tunnel with all points discussed above. I hope it is helpful and you can solve it. 

The command helps to re-enable a err-disabled port automatically. Generally, it means that a port ,which is currently in error-disable state for a specific reason (including port-security violation), will be automatically re-enabled after 300 seconds. You can choose which kind of reason/cause that will re-activate the port back with command (you can check further information on this Cisco page). The command can be used when configuring port-security feature on a switch port. If you do not choose aging type (absolute or inactivity), the default method of absolute is taken into account, meaning after 2 minutes the dynamically learned MAC address ages out. You can connect another host to a switch port. On the other hand, if you choose the aging type as inactivity , the dynamically learned MAC address ages out ONLY after 2 minutes of MAC address inactivity (no frame/packet sent from the host with this MAC address). This kind of command tells you when (after X minutes) you can connect a host to a port, once the old MAC address ages out (absolute or inactivity). 

This should work as long as you configure them properly. Below captures are from Best Practices for vPC on Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches 

L3 EtherChannel and VLAN/Trunk concepts DO NOT work together. In this scenario, you should use L2 EtherChannel between L3-1 and L3-2 switches. Ensure that you create all L3 Int VLANs / L2 VLANs, and trunk them on this L2 EtherChannel between L3-1 and L3-2 switches. 

As I understand, you want to block http/https traffic on switch ports 20,21 and 23 so that users cannot access any web pages (http/https), is it correct? If yes, you can try to use Port ACLs. You would need an ACL and apply it to switch ports 20,21 and 23. Let me assume the format of your switch port 20 is f0/20, the following configuration is an example of Port ACLs on switch port 20: 

Server_TFTP is correctly connecting to interface F0/1 on Router, then ping 192.168.1.1 (Router F0/1). If failed, repeat steps 1 and 2. F1/0 and F2/0 on Router are NOT shutdown and Server_TFTP can ping Router's F1/0 and F2/0 IPs: 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.3.1. If failed, check the Default Gateway IP on this server at step 1. Hosts in LAN_1 and LAN_2 can receive IP addresses from Router and they can ping each other. Then test pinging to/from Server_TFTP. 

No, remote-as value (of neighbor 187.100.0.89) stays unchanged of 65200. Yes, even you do not have 'address-family ipv4 unicast'. Yes, the neighbor inherits policies under 'address-family l2vpn vpls-vpws'. 

So, you need to update your ACL with the following rule to allow destination UDP ports when tracerouting from your Linux/Unix/like hosts and servers: 

You can try to put all subnets under single network object-group, then modify your ACL, crypto ACL and NAT Exemption rules accordingly. This make the configuration look nicer. For example: 

It is confused as you wrote "but interesting thing i can ping from PC A to 10.10.1.1 interface." and in the Result you wrote: "3. from PC A to ASA interface 10.10.1.1 - Ping Failed" With Cisco ASA, you CANNOT ping other ASA interfaces rather than the one you are on. That means from PC A (10.30.1.100) you CAN ping 10.30.1.1 (Interface IP with SL 100) and CANNOT ping 10.20.1.1 (Interface IP with SL 75) or 10.10.1.1 (Interface IP with SL 50). Updated answer: Looks like the real reason is not publicly revealed (or there is no real reason at all :), but I personally think it could be for security purposes ). It is just how Cisco Firewall is degined (since PIX Firewall). You can find the latest information at here. And I hope this answers your question. 

====== In this case, VLANs 300 and 400 are on the right side of the network, You should configure the IP addresses of 10.10.239.253 and 10.10.255.253 are default gateway IPs (Router1 subinterfaces) in DHCP IP Pool 300 and 400 on Router0. ====== I hope it is helpful. 

I am not sure whether there are typos in your code lines above when you typed in or they are exactly what you have in your current configuration, but I noticed that: 

This is because the port f0/22 of this Switch is trunking VLAN 153 as native VLAN while the port f0/21 of another Switch does not (by default, it is trunking vlan 1 as native VLAN) 

In addition, on ASA2, you may need to create an interface access-list on inside interface for traffic from ASA2 inside network to reach ASA1 network/subnet at the other end of VPN tunnel. With dynamic Site-to-Site IPSec VPN, you can initiate the traffic ONLY from dynamic site. Therefore, you need to generate traffic from ASA2 to bring up the tunnel. If it still does not work, run the packet-tracer command (using CLI) on ASA2 as below and update your question with the output. I will check and update my answer accordingly: 

Yes, you can do that. It is called option under configuration section and can be done per SSID. Let us say you want to set the maximum number of devices that can associate using to 5: 

Updated my answer as it is for Cisco: Under configuration part, you can set to zero (0). Zero means the telnet/ssh session remains alive until you close it. 

Your network diagram does not clearly show interface/port numbers between devices. Therefore, I am trying to guess as much as I can. 1. On the right side of your Router1, I see its Int F0/1 is connecting to Int F0/1 of right-side Switch (on which you have two VLANs 300 and 400 configured): Int F0/1 of right-side Switch should be configured as trunk port (allowed VLANs 300 and 400) and Int F0/1 of Router1 should be configured with two subinterface F0/1.300 and F0/1.400. You need to assign IP addresses in subnets of VLAN 300 and 400 for subinterface F0/1.300 and F0/1.400 on Router1, for example 10.10.239.253/28 and 10.10.255.253/28, respectively. These are Relay Agent IP addresses in DHCP request packets. 2. Next, you need to configure the IP address of DHCP server (here is Router0) under Router1's two subinterfaces F0/1.300 and F0/1.400 using command. The IP address of Router0 DHCP server you use here depends on L3 segment/network between your Router1 (Int F0/0 on the left side) and Router0. Your network has 4 VLANs/subnets. On Router1, you already use F0/1.300 and F0/1.400 subinterfaces (in VLAN 300 and 400), therefore you have to assign an IP address in other VLANs (either VLAN 100 or 200) for Int F0/0 of Router1. Let us say we choose the VLAN 100 and create an subinterface F0/0.100 with IP: 10.10.207.253/28, then we have to configure Int F0/2 of left-side switch (connecting to F0/0 of Router1) to trunk VLAN 100 as well. Now, the IP address of Router0 DHCP server we use for command must be the IP address of subinterface F0/0.100 - 10.10.207.254. Because the relayed DHCP requests from Router1 is routed through VLAN 100 on left-side switch, then hit Router1 on its subinterface F0/0.100. 3. Lastly, we need to ensure that Router0 knows how to send the traffic back to Router1 DHCP Relay Agent IP addresses (10.10.239.253 and 10.10.255.253) by adding static routes for them with next-hop IP is the IP address of Router 1 F0/0.100 subinterface (10.10.207.253). 4. I do not put the configuration for Switches here, I assume they are good with all VLANs, trunk and access ports are configured properly. The updated full configuration on Routers and Switches: 

The answer is no. PMKID is an unique value as a result of hash function combines the PMK with Access Point's MAC address and Client's MAC address. 

I hope it is helpful. Later, you can update your question with more findings, I will update this answer accordingly. 

The following simple procedure/script asks you to enter a VLAN ID and its name, then it will configure that VLAN on your device: 

You should use set of commands, they give you all current translation information (NAT/PAT) while just gives your the information of (real) source and (real) destination IPs. 

As you bought this AP (not a new one), I would suggest you reset it to the default configuration and reload the AP image using MODE button (Link here): 

For your second question: yes, one and same ikev1 transform-set (IPSec policy) across your VPN tunnel configurations should not be a problem. I found a problem with your configuration. and are not match You can apply ONLY ONE crypto-map per interface, here is outside interface. If you have multiple S2S VPN tunnels, you have to use the same crypto-map with different priority numbers. Therefore, you should name your crypto-map meaningful and use this for all of your tunnels terminated on that outside interface.
