Theorem 14 of this paper by TamÂ´as SarlÂ´os gives a relative error rank-$k$ approximation of a given matrix $A$ under the frobenius norm. I am looking for reference of a similar result (relative error low rank approximation) under the $l_2$ norm. Pls let me know I am able to put the question clearly. 

For $n>1$ and $~0<p \leq 1$, can we upper and lower bound the following binomial series in terms of $n$ and $p$ $$\Sigma_{i=\lceil p n \rceil}^n {n \choose i} (p )^i(1-p)^{(n-i)}$$ 

Let $G(V_1, V_2, E)$ be a bipartite graph such that degree of all the vertices in $V_1$ is bounded by some constant (say) $d$. Now, for given two positive integer $l$ and $k$, we wish to decide if there is a vertex cover $A\cup B$ with $|A|\leq l$ and $|B|\leq k$, where $A\subseteq V_1, B \subseteq V_2.$ Now, I have following two questions: 1) What is the complexity of the above problem when both $k$ and $l$ are part of input. (Intuitively, it appears to be hard.) If it is hard, then is there any PTAS known to approximate the problem. 2) What is the complexity of the problem when one of the parameters $k$ or $l$ is constant? Pls let me know if there is any doubt about the problem. 

Here is one algorithm. It runs in time at most $O(|S|*|w| + c)$, and probably runs much faster for many inputs. We create a directed graph $G$. The graph $G$ has a vertex $(s,i,j)$ for any $s \in S$ and any indices $i,j$ such that $s=w[i..j]$. Then the graph has a directed edge from $(s,i,j)$ to $(s',i',j')$ whenever $i'=j+1$. Finally, the graph has two additional vertices, a source and a sink. There is a directed edge from the source to any vertex of the form $(s,0,j)$ and from any vertex of the form $(s,0,|w|)$ to the sink. Now notice that the directed paths from the source of the sink correspond exactly to the parsings of $w$. So it's enough to enumerate all (source,sink)-paths in $G$, which can be done in time $O(|G'|+c)$. Note that the graph $G$ kind of represents all the parsings, so for many applications you wouldn't even have to enumerate them explicitly. 

I agree with @usul. I've also never seen the term empirical mutual information mentioned, but I've seen the term empirical entropy quite a lot, especially in the compression community. The definition of empirical information is $-\Sigma p_i \log p_i$, where $p_i$ are the empirical probabilities, i.e. the fraction of the time that each value appears in your samples. To compute empirical mutual information given samples $(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$, I'd just compute the empirical entropy of the $x$'s separately, and of the $y$'s separately, and of the pairs together, and then I'd use the standard equation $I(X:Y)=H(X)+H(Y)-H(XY)$, where all quantities on the right hand side are replaced by their empirical analogue. I don't know if this is equivalent to the equation that @usul gave, and I don't know if this is the quantity referenced in the articles you're reading, but this seems like the natural interpretation to me. 

Consider the untyped $\lambda$-calculus expression $$x(\lambda y.P\;)z$$ ...where (FWIW) $z$ is not free in $P$, and $P$ does not contain a redex. Can this expression be $\beta$-reduced? I've consulted several textbooks, but they are all silent on this point (as far as I can tell). Application is left-associative, so the fully-parenthesized rendition of the expression above would be $$((x(\lambda y.P\;))z)$$ The formalism, as given in all the textbooks I've consulted, specifies a $\beta$-reduction for $((\lambda y.P\;)z)$, namely $((\lambda y.P\;)z)\; \triangleright_{\beta} \;([z/y]P\;)$, but not one for $((x(\lambda y.P\;))z)$. Therefore, the answer to my question would appear to be "no", but a derivation I'm working my way through seems to require an invalid-looking $\beta$-reduction of the form $$((x(\lambda y.P\;))z) \;\; \triangleright_{\beta} \;\;(x([z/y]P\;))\;.$$ Any help with this would be appreciated. In particular, reference to a treatment of the $\lambda$-calculus that explicitly adjudicates this question would be very helpful. Thanks! 

FWIW, for the special case I'm working with, the following additional conditions/considerations apply: 

Suppose that we have $n \geq 2$ distinct triplets $t_0, t_1, ..., t_{n-1}$ of real numbers, $t_i = (x_i, l_i, r_i)$. Define $$\Delta(s) = \max_{i, j} \left[ s (x_j - x_i) + (r_j - l_i) \right]$$ The problem is, given some arbitrary target $\Delta_0$, to find $s^*$ such that $\Delta(s^*) = \Delta_0$. (NB: There may be no such $s^*$. For example, $n = 2$, and $t_0 = (0, -1, 0), t_1 = (0, 0, 1)$, then $\Delta(s)$ has constant value $2$, so the problem has a solution, infinitely many in fact, only if $\Delta_0 = 2$.) 

It's possible to build the suffix array of $s$ in linear time from $s$ and $BWT(s)$ in a somewhat easy way. You do need to build a rank-select data structure on $s$ in order to do this. To see how to do this, look at Ferragina and Manzini's paper "The FM-Index". The LF mapping they describe also essentially computes the suffix array. 

Proof: Let $G$ be a graph which is not strongly connected. We will prove that $\delta^+(G)+\delta^-(G) < n$. Write the decomposition of $G$ into strongly connected components. Let $S$ be a strongly connected component which is a sink (i.e. no edges go outside of $S$) and $T$ be a source (i.e. no edges go into $T$). Since no edges go $S$ to outside of $S$, then $\delta^+(G) \le \delta^+(S) \le |S|-1$. Similarly we get $\delta^-(G) \le |T|-1$, and taking these two things together we get $$\delta^+(G)+\delta^-(G) \le |S|+|T|-2 \le n-2 \ .$$ QED. 

Some work in progress: I'm trying to prove a lower bound of $4^k$. Here is a question that I'm pretty sure would give such a lower bound: find the minimum $t$ such that there exists a function $f:\{S \subseteq [n], |S|=k/2 \} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^t$ that preserves disjointness, i.e. that $S_1 \cap S_2 = \emptyset$ iff $f(S_1) \cap f(S_2) = \emptyset$. I'm pretty sure a lower bound of $t \ge 2k$ would almost immediately imply a lower bound of $2^{2k}=4k$ for our problem. $f(S)$ roughly corresponds to the set of nodes the NFA can get to after reading the first $k/2$ symbols of the input, when the set of these $k/2$ symbols is $S$. I think the solution to this question might already be known, either in the communication complexity literature (especially in papers dealing with the disjointness problem; maybe some matrix rank arguments will help), or in literature about encodings (e.g. like this). 

I am trying to understand the notion of $\epsilon$-coreset and its relation with sampling bounds of a range space having a finite VC-dimension. Although both of them give an $\epsilon$-approximation sketch of the input data. However, for the later case we know a characterization i.e. if a range space has finite VC dimension, then it can be approximated by a small (constant) size sample. On the other hand, for the case of $\epsilon$-coreset (similar to the concept of VC dimension) is there any characterization known over the problems which can or cannot be sketched by a small size sample? Thanks, 

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph. For a given $\rho \leq |V|$ and $\epsilon$ with $(0<\epsilon<1)$, is there any sublinear query algorithm known/possible to decide if the graph has a clique of size $\rho$, or all the cliques are of size at most $\rho(1-\epsilon)$. More precisely, for a given probability tolerance $\delta$ and error tolerance $\epsilon$, algorithm queries $f(\frac{1}{\epsilon}, \frac{1}{\delta}).o(n^2)$ many position of the corresponding adjacency matrix of the graph, and accept with probability at least $1-\delta$ if the graph has a clique of size $\rho$, or reject probability at least $1-\delta$ if all the cliques are of size at most $\rho(1-\epsilon).$ Thanks in advance. 

Here is a wrong answer: it outputs some vertices that are part of non-simple paths from $s$ to $t$ and that are not a part of any simple path from $s$ to $t$ of length $\le \ell$. The answer might still be relevant to the asker's application, so I'm leaving it here. Here is an algorithm that runs in time $O(|V|+|E|)$ (and actually is faster than this when $\ell$ is small). The algorithm runs a BFS search from $s$ that terminates at depth $\ell$. This BFS gives a set $V_s$ of all vertices reachable from $s$ with a path of length at most $\ell$, and it also computes the distances $dist(s,v)$ for each $v \in V_s$. Then I'd do the same from $t$ and get the set $V_t$ and distances from $t$. Finally, the vertices you're looking for are exactly $V_{solution}=\{ v : v \in V_s \cap V_t, dist(s,v)+dist(t,v) \le \ell \}$. The edges are exactly those edges in $E[V_{solution}]$ ($=(v,u) \in E : u,v \in V_{solution}$). The running time of this algorithm is surely $O(|V|+|E|)$ because it just does two BFSs. But the running time is actually $O(|V_s| + |V_t| + |E[V_s]|+|E[V_t]|)$ which will be much smaller than the size of the graph when the $\ell$-radius neighborhoods of $s$ and $t$ are small. Edit: there's probably a somewhat faster algorithm in practice that does a BFS from $s$ and $t$ of depth only $\ell/2$ rather than $\ell$. This discovers all the paths, and then with a bit of bookkeeping you can find all the vertices. This cuts the running time by a square root for the case of a large random-looking graph when $\ell$ is small. 

Let $M$ be a binary ($0-1$) matrix of size $n \times m$. We define binary rank of $M$ as the smallest positive integer $r$ for which there exists a product decomposition $M = UV$, where $U$ is $n \times r$ and $V$ is $r \times m$, and all entries of $U$ and $V$ come from $\{0, 1\}$. My question is that is there known algorithmic way to determine the binary rank of $M$; and Singular value decomposition that support the binary rank. Any reference in this regard would highly help. 

Beck's theorem is a classical result in discrete geometry which describes about the geometry of points in the plane. The result states that a finite collections of points in the plane fall into one of two extremes; one where a large fraction of points lie on a single line, and one where a large number of lines are needed to connect all the points. Formally, the statement of the theorem is as follows: Theorem: Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane. If at most $(n-k)$ points lie on any line for some $0 \leq k < n-2$, then there exist $\Omega(nk)$ lines determined by the points of $S$. Now, my question is that if the generalization/variation of the above result is known in the case of higher dimension $(dim\geq 3)$?
