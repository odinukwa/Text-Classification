This is only a partial answer to your general question (I'm not sure what a fully general formulation would be), but it suggests that working over sufficiently nice infinite semirings while constraining the randomness to a finite domain might actually trivialize the question of whether Adleman's theorem holds. Suppose you're working over the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$, so that circuits compute polynomials over that field, and suppose the function $f$ is itself computed by some polynomial (however complicated) of the $x$ variables. Then it turns out that already for some fixed $r$, $C(x,r) = f(x)$. The reason is that for each $r$, the set of $x$ with $C(x,r) = f(x)$ determines a Zariski-closed subset of $\mathbb{C}^n$, and so must be all of $\mathbb{C}^n$, or else a subset of measure zero. If all of these sets were to have measure zero, then, because there are only finitely many $r$'s in consideration, the set of $x$ where $\exists r : C(x,r) = f(x)$ would also have measure zero. On the other hand, the assumption that $C$ computes $f$ implies this that set must be all of $\mathbb{C}^n$, so it cannot have measure zero. 

Here's a mildly interesting variation where the problem is easy: instead of a ground set of $\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$, allow any subset of $\{1,2,4,8,\ldots\}$. The goal is still to find a permutation $\pi$ so that $A = \{|\pi(2^k) - 2^k| : 2^k \in \Omega\}$ where $\Omega$ is the ground set. The main advantage here is that the new ground set forces each element of $A$ to be $2^{k_1}-2^{k_2}$ for some $k_1,k_2$, and if $k_1\ne k_2$, then $k_1$ and $k_2$ are determined by this difference. It follows that for each difference $|2^{k_1} - 2^{k_2}|$ in $A$, we may infer that $\pi(2^{k_1}) = 2^{k_2}$ or $\pi(2^{k_2}) = 2^{k_1}$ (or both). Efficiently solving this simplified variation is then more or less routine. Begin by constructing the undirected bipartite multigraph $G = (L \sqcup R, E)$ where $L$ and $R$ are distinct copies of the ground set, and add edges $(2^{k_1},2^{k_2})$ and $(2^{k_2},2^{k_1})$ whenever $|2^{k_1} - 2^{k_2}|$ appears in $A$ with $k_1 \ne k_2$. I claim that the following are equivalent: 

Firstly I claim that condition (iii) doesn't help very much, even when combined with condition (i). In particular, there is a reduction from the problem with (iii) ignored to the original version of the problem: Suppose there is an instance with $f_i$'s that are non-decreasing but otherwise arbitrary. Then we can make a new instance (whose data is denoted with primes (')) which has 

proof: Recall that if $M$ is a multilinear function, then we can write $$M(a) = \sum_{x \in \{\pm 1\}^n} M(x) \prod_{i=1}^n \left\{\begin{array}{rcl}\frac{1+a_i}{2} &:& x_i = 1\\ \frac{1-a_i}{2} &:& x_i = -1\end{array}\right.$$ From this formula, it directly follows that if $M(x) \ge 0$ for all $x \in \{-1, 1\}^n$, then $M(a) \ge 0$ for all $a \in [-1,1]^n$. The claim then follows by applying this fact to $M = F - G$, since for $x \in \{-1,1\}^n, (F - G)(x) = (f - g)(x) \ge 0$. 

The conclusion that Th($U$) is at least exponential time. They don't provide a proof for this (they say they will in a subsequent paper, which I believe has never appeared), but they say that their proof for the theory of the real numbers can be adapted by using $ku$ as a representation for $k$. Is there a more detailed exposition of a proof of this theorem? The following points are not clear to me: 

Fischer and Rabin's Super-Exponential Complexity of Presburger Arithmetic (1974) has the following theorem. 

Let $F$ and $G$ be endofunctors over categories $C$ and $ D$, respectively. Suppose that there is a forgetful functor $C \to D$ that has a left adjoint. Can we infer properties of $F$-coalgebras from those of $G$-algebras, or vice versa, by exploiting the connection between the two categories? Presumably the situation here is too vague. Is there some special case of this scenario in which my question make sense and answerable? What are the relevant literature here? (The application I had in mind is this: suppose that I have a coalgebraic modal logic $L$ for coalgebras in $D$, and that $L$ as it is does not generalize to other categories than $D$ since it relies on some special properties of $D$. Can I still use $L$ to describe coalgebras in $C$, at least in some limited cases, by using the adjunction?) 

Whether or not $\mathbf{BPP} = \mathbf{EXP}^{\mathbf{NP}}$ is an open problem, although we believe the former is strictly contained in the other. I guess, from the absence of the proof of the separation, that there should have been a relativized result on this problem, namely, the existence of an oracle relative to which $\mathbf{BPP} = \mathbf{EXP}^{\mathbf{NP}}$. Is there such a result in the literature indeed? 

I've seen pseudorandom generators defined for nonuniform efficient adversaries, or uniform probabilistic efficient adversaries. (For example, a monograph Pseudorandomness by Vadhan (here's its draft does that.) I believe that it's natural to think about pseudorandom generators indistinguishable by uniform deterministic efficient adversaries. Has that notion studied before? Does it have any significance to some degree? EDIT: I was mistaken in that Vadhan defined pseudorandomness against uniform probabilistic adversaries: he did define indistinguishability by uniform probabilistic algorithms, but he neither defined, nor stated facts about, the corresponding notion of pseudorandomness. My interest mostly concerned with uniform adversaries and my original question was about deterministic vs. probabilistic. 

A priority argument, an important proof technique in recursion theory, was introduced by Friedberg and Muchnik, to solve Post's Problem, i.e., the existence of two r.e. sets that do not Turing reduce to each other. My question is whether or not there has been an attempt to formalize priority arguments in some proof system adopted by proof checkers or proof checkers. I believe this is an interesting problem, since: 

Let $L$ be the set of sentences in some logic. I am interested in cases where $L$ is the set of sentences in monadic second-order logic, or it is its $\Pi^1_1$ fragment. Let $K$ be a class of finite structures. The theory $\mathrm{Th}_L(K)$ of $K$ is the set of sentences $\phi$ such that $\forall M \in K$ $M \models \phi$. I am interested in decidability of $\mathrm{Th}_L(K)$. For what kind of class $K$ is this known? What are important / deep techniques here? What is a good source to learn the results and the techniques?
