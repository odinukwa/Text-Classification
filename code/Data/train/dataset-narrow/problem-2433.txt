If this is possible, there is reduction $F$ to odd hole free $F'$. Replace an edge $u'v'$ by the gadget $G$ where $u'=u,v'=v$ and the rest vertices of $G$ are new vertices. According to graphclasses coloring odd hole free is NP hard and 3-coloring is unknown. Computer search suggest small gadgets don't exist (modulo errors). 

A graph is locally bipartite if the open neighborhood of every vertex induces a bipartite graph. (According to searches the same name might be used for something else related to surfaces). 

In the case when the formula is unsatisfiable "The size of the certificate is about 13 GB, and the time needed to verify the certificate was comparable with the time needed to generate it". To my surprise the sizes of the relatively fast solved formulas were much bigger than hard combinatorial problems like factoring or inverting crypto hash function. Formulas are at: $URL$ 

Added by "simple" I mean graph transformation $G \to G'$, s.t. $G$ has DS of size $k$ iff $G'$ has VC of size $f(G,k)$ and the transformation does not depend on $k$ (to avoid reduction to SAT). 

As explained on MO computing the chromatic polynomial $P(G,x)$ modulo $x-3$ is enough for deciding 3-colorability. For non adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$, $G+uv$ is the graph with the edge $uv$ added and the graph $G/uv$ is obtained by merging the two vertices. According to wikipedia $$P(G,k)= P(G+uv, k) + P(G/uv,k) \qquad (1) $$ The recursion for computing $P(G,x)$ modulo $x-3$ is siginificantly faster since induced $K_4$ stops computing further. Consider the following naive algorithm for checking 3-colorability using $P(G,x) \pmod{x-3}$. 

A graph is $(p,q)$-colorable if its vertices can be partitioned into $p$ cliques and $q$ independent sets. For $(2,0)$-colorable graphs clique is polynomial. I am interested how easier (if any) is clique in $(3,0)$-colorable, when the partitions are given. Given graph $G$ and 3 partitions of its vertices $A,B,C : A \cup B \cup C=V(G)$ such that $A,B,C$ induce cliques in G. 

The paper is 48 pages and doesn't appear published in peer reviewed journal. There is only one citation on Scholar.google. 

In the other direction the reduction is simple. Searching the web returned blog. It warns This is not finished yet and experiments suggest the reduction doesn't work. 

We got an argument that 3-coloring bounded degree graphs is subexponential with complexity $O(\exp{(\sqrt{n}\log^2{n})})$. The treewidth of a planar graphs on $n$ vertices is $O(\sqrt{n})$ and 3-coloring it is $O(\exp{\sqrt{n}})$ as shown here p. 8 of the pdf. This paper gives reduction from 3-coloring to 3-coloring planar graph and the main idea is replace each edge crossing with a small gadget, which preserves colorability. If for a bounded degree graph we can find drawing with $o(n^2)$ crossings, we get subexponential algorithm for 3-coloring it. According to second paper for bounded degree graphs, we get approximation with $O(n\log^4{n})$ crossings. After we have found drawing with few crossings, we planarize using the gadget. The resulting graph is bounded degree and planar and on $n+ C n\log^4{n}$ vertices. 

$L(G)$ is finite and the length of words in it correspond to the sums of the subsets in $S$. The Subset Sum has solution iff $1^t \in L(G)$. Not sure about this, but there is a related problem: construct unary CFG $F$ which accepts only $1^t$ using (1) and (2). Set $L=L(G) \cap L(F)$. $L$ is unary language (possibly there are Turing machines corresponding to it). $L$ is either empty or $1^t$, which is another reduction to Subset Sum. The question: 

Knowing $F_n(1)$ or $F_n(-1)$ gives good randomized polynomial algorithm for the factorization of $n$. We have $|F_n(1)|=\phi(n)$ and $|F_n(-1)|=\sigma(n)$ by definition. $\phi(n)$ is Euler's totient function and $\sigma(n)$ is the sum of divisors function. The paper you link to proves the case for $\sigma(n)$. The same paper cites that the case for $\phi(n)$ is known and is derandomized assuming ERH (p. 1). I am pretty sure both algorithms will be quite fast in practice. 

To my knowledge, graph isomorphism for graphs with bounded clique width or bounded rank width is open. 2015 arxiv paper claims it is polynomial: Isomorphism Testing for Graphs of Bounded Rank Width Abstract: 

Added According to a paper they are also called "almost bipartite" and their complements are generalized line graphs which are claw free. 

Thought about planarizing $G'$ by choosing some universal drawing of the clique and replacing edge crossing by planar gadgets preserving colors say $C_4,C_6$ for equal colors and something else for distinct colors. Don't know if this preserves isomorphism. Another possible approach might be automorphism preserving coloring or subdivide every edge of $K_n$, use 3 colors ${0,1,2}$ for vertices $V(G),E(G),E(\overline{G})$ and try to recognize self complementary graphs by automorphism exchanging $E(G)$ and $E(\overline{G})$. 

AFAICT it is not harder than $\#P$ since we can compute the Tutte polynomial at positive random $(x_i,y_i)$ and see which of $F_{G,i}$ agree with the value. 

Addressing the practical part. If $P=NP$, but SAT solvers run in $O(n^{2^{10^3}})$ this will be of no practical interest on current hardware. On April 1st Doron Zeilberger proved (jokingly) that P is equal to NP. From the paper "Alas the complexity of our algorithm is $O(n^{10^{10000}})$ (with the implied constant being larger than the Skewes number)." As far as I can tell sufficiently powerful quantum computer will be of practical interest in this case. 

The orders after the few initial terms are $12 , 24 , 120 , 720 , 5040 , 40320 , 362880$ which is A052565 Dima suggests this might be easy for $n$ large enough and the initial terms are exceptions. 

The equality in Theorem 1.1 appears to imply P=NP since we can compute $\gamma(G)=i(G)$ in chordal graphs by the above result. 

If I understand correctly, factoring can be encoded as SAT decision problem and then recover the actual solution. For unknown $x,y$ and given $N$, encode to SAT the problem $ x \cdot y = N, x > 1 , y > 1$. Basically all you need is an adder circuit and few gates. Call the resulting formula $\phi$. If $\phi$ is satisfiable, then $N$ is composite. Set the first bit of $x$ to $1$ and check if $\phi'$ is satisfiable. If it is, you guessed correctly and try with the second bit. Otherwise set it to $0$ and continue with the second bit. This is linear in the numbers of bits. (Actually in practice real SAT solvers will give you the complete solution if it exists). 

Let $\phi$ be CNF formula with $n$ variables and $m$ clauses. I am looking for a reduction is $\phi$ satisfiable to a problem on a planar graph $G$ with as few vertices as possible. The majority of reductions I have seen use "crossing gadget", which replaces edge crossing by a planar graph. So far the best reference is $|V(G)|=m^2$. The motivation is that the treewidth of planar graphs is at most $4.9 \sqrt{|V(G)|}$ and this gives subexponential complexity for problems exponential in the treewidth like Independent Set. 

There might be other improvements like other 4-chromatic subgraph or $F$ being in a graph class where coloring is polynomial. Experimental results: For several 4-regular graphs on 246 vertices which are the line graphs of 3-regular graphs color3 found 3-coloring in less than a minute in sage 6.2 implementation. For several smaller graphs which are not 3-colorable it correctly returned 0. For reduction SAT to 3-color the running time was fast too. Sage implementation: $URL$ 

A graph is weakly perfect if the clique number equals the chromatic number, i.e. $\omega(G)=\chi(G)$. Deciding membership is NP-complete according to the paper. Because of the inequality $\omega(G) \le \chi(G)$ a $k$-clique is certificate that there isn't smaller than $k$ coloring. 

Several papers appear to imply P=NP via chordal graphs, which suggests something is wrong. As usual $\gamma(G)$ is the domination number and $i(G)$ and $\gamma^i(G)$ are the independence domination number. According to VIZING’S CONJECTURE FOR CHORDAL GRAPHS, p.1 

Partial answer, don't understand enough group theory, but two papers appear to give partial results. GI for circulants is polynomial. Edged-colored GI for circulants is GI complete via the simple reduction $G \to G'$. Make a clique from $V(G)$ and color an edge $e \in E(G')$ with $1$ iff $e \in E(G)$ and $0$ otherwise. To recover $G$ from $G'$ just take the edges colored $1$. $G \cong H \iff G' \cong H'$ where the isomorphism preserves the edge coloring. $G'$ is edge colored clique and hence circulant. This paper claims: 

Suppose the integer program $L$ has polynomially many solutions corresponding to polynomials $F_{G,i}(x,y)$. (The experimental data suggest this). 

The permanent of the adjacency matrix of digraph counts cycle covers and is $\#P$-complete. The decision problem "Is the permanent of (0,1) matrix zero" is in P since finding cycle cover is in $P$. $P \ne NP$ implies there is no reduction of counting $NP$-complete problems to counting $(0,1)$-permanent which maps $0 \mapsto 0$. Edit Related MO question 

The paper On graph classes with logarithmic boolean-width claims that the boolean width of co-k-degenerate graphs is at most $k\log{n}$ and a lot of graph vertex partition problems can be solved in polynomial time. co-k-degenerate graphs include complements of bounded degree graphs. Clique is NP-hard on co-maximum degree 4. On the other hand, graphclasses.org claims that clique is boolean width fixed parameter tractable, giving clique width as reference. Since $\exp{\log{n}}=n$ it could be polynomial. Are there complexity consequence of logarithmic boolean width of co-bounded degree graphs? Like ETH not holding for them? 

Appears to me it might not be NP-complete because the certificate will involve co-NP. Also it might not be in P since it will decide coloring graphs for which the inequality happens "by chance" and possibly by adding disjoint cliques might be improved. Searching the web found algebraic constructions of weakly perfect. In all papers coloring was polynomial via closed form. Related to this. 

Added points out that bad cycle are still "there", but the sum of their weights vanishes. Appears to me the weight of bad cycle in a widget is zero. From page 148 (11 of the pdf): 

Looks like the misunderstanding is this: In the final reduction to (0,1)-permanent they are using modular arithmetic, which breaks my argument. Let $A$ be the original matrix and $B$ the (0,1) matrix. Working modulo $n$, it might happen $perm(A)=0$ and perm $perm(B)=mn$. Though equality holds modulo $n$, $B$ have cycle covers. 

In a MO question basically I asked when the Tutte polynomial of planar graph can be uniquely determined by the polynomially computable values at the special points and at the two hyperbolas. The solution is the unique solution of certain integer program $L$. Possibly misleading experimental data suggests this is possible sometimes. Computing the Tutte polynomial at non-trivial points is $\#P$-complete. In case the integer program $L$ has unique solution, one call to a $NP$-complete oracle would solve $\#P$-complete problem. 

This looks plausible to me, though Wikipedia claims "there is a relativized universe (see oracle machine) where P = ⊕P ≠ NP = PP = EXPTIME" and $P^{\oplus P}$ is not known to even contain $NP$. Even it can't be derandomized the reduction to USAT appears very good in practice given $\oplus P$ oracle. 

$2K_2-free \subset P_5-free$ and the other class contains $P_5$. According to graphclasses, another reason for hardness is clique cover on the complement (another paper), click +Details for references. Question: 

According to Wikipedia and Complexity Zoo unary languages (TALLY) do not contain NP-complete problems unless $P=NP$ and the reductions are related to NP-complete problems. This means unary languages are not expressible enough unless a collapse. 

Likely this is technical error in graphclasses or in me. Appears to me graphclasses claims P=NP. In Domination perfect we have $\gamma(G)=i(G)$ which implies the complexity of Dominating Set (DS) and Independent Dominating Set (IDS) is the same in subclasses of domination perfect. In line graphs we have DS NP-complete and IDS Polynomial. According to the java application of graphclasses, line graphs are domination perfect, one of the reasons is they are claw-free. Appears to me this implies P=NP. 

I don't exclude the possibility reduction SAT to PLANAR SAT to make this possible, though SAT still to be exponential and $\phi$ is subexponential because of the increase in the size. 

This confuses me. One easy case of counting is when the decision problem is in $P$ and there are no solutions. A lecture show that the problem of counting the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph (equivalently, counting the number of cycle covers in a directed graph) is $\#P$ -complete. They give reduction from counting vertex covers of size $k$ to counting cycle covers in a digraph using gadgets. Theorem 27.1 The number of good cycle covers in $H$ is $(k!)^2$ times the number of vertex covers of $G$ of size $k$. Using gadget they leave only the "good" cycles. My understanding of the lecture is that $G$ doesn't have vertex cover of size $k$ iff the transformed digraph $G'$ doesn't have cycle cover. Checking if $G'$ has cycle cover can be done in polynomial time, implying $P=NP$ since we can transform the decision problem to finding solution.
