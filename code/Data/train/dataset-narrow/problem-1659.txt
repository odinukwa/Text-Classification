You are using the wrong answer to create custom services. To start with, custom service files should not be placed within rather you'd use . Secondly, after creating the service file you'd run to notify systemd about your newly created file. Make sure you've restored SELinux file context using After the update, the answer is obvious. 

See how creates a backup file automatically to protect us from overriding the file by accident. See lin $URL$ for examples using the editor. 

Apart from your script being pretty much broken, I suggest you write something as the following. Don't use capitalized variable names. Only environment variables are capitalized by convention. Don't use absolute paths for binaries like etc. 

The is not a good idea to use in scripts. is a human-readable listing command and not meant to be used in scripts. You can simply create an array and loop through the indices e.g 

I am using -m state --state. However I would recommand to use for more. If you feel that you are being overwhelmed by the logs, you might consider changing the . $URL$ can tell you more. 

The ssh command will run only if the previous one has finished its operation. If you need to know more, see command. 

As the title of your question implies, DDoS is a Distributed Denial of Services where the attack comes from different sources. The best chance you have at the moment is contact your Service Provider and explain the situation. On your side there are a few steps you could take to at least limit the cause of this DDoS attack. For more information what you could do, please see $URL$ 

Nothing special. It behaves like a switch, maintaining an internal list of the MAC addresses visible on each interface and passing the packets accordingly. It can even do STP. 

The theory is this: If they've authenticated already, they trigger the rule and are allowed through. If they're not authenticated, it bumps along to the rule. If the sender domain matches "mydomain.com" the sender is rejected. (So unauthed + MAIL FROM "mydomain.com" = reject.) If it's any other domain, it continues on to the rest of your rules. NOTE: This is untested. I would stick a in front of that rule before trying it on a production system. 

If you didn't save the log file and position when you took the snapshot, I don't believe there's a way to figure that out. Some of the snapshot tools, however, do save that data. How did you take the snapshot? For example, if it's a filesystem snapshot taken after flushing / locking all tables, the correct data should be in in the slaves data dir. 

That article describes recovering from completely deleting all of , so this extra step may not apply to your situation. 

It sure looks like OS X uses PAM. In that case you should be abe to use the PAM-MySQL to perform any type of auth you want. Out of the box OS X uses a pretty straightforward PAM config for sshd: 

Here, the line that starts with is treated as a single line and not part of directive which is causing the error. You could simply fix it using a backslash as follows: 

8) Show the status of slave Check for a specific error code and update your answer to provide more details. if possible 

Eval should only be used in legacy systems who do not provide safe tools like the example I'm showing you. This produces exactly the same result as you were running these commands using the interactive shell. Hope it gives you some ideas at least. UPDATE to demonstrate how commands can run remotely too, without defining a local var. 

Use the following to calculate the lines between two time variables. Put the following code in a file called . 

For a safer process management I would use the proper reserved variable or if you have it on CentOS. E,g 

The route is being added but does not do much. The network 192.168.100.0/24 remains unreachable. What ip route show and route -n shows 

If you need to modify files content instantly you can use the . You can add a to backup the original file before any change happens. Adding, that is a Stream EDitor and you rather should use or . Update example: 

I have a virtual directory in my site (test environment). It is a UNC share which is also used as a public FTP. It is configured to connect as a domain admin account and "Test settings" says everything appears to be working. However when I try to connect to it I get: 

Does anyone have any ideas on why the memory usage is constant like this and not peaks and troughs with usage of the app? Here's the output of the MySQL Tuning Primer script: 

So it follows that if I run a script to set the ES_JAVA_OPTS at startup before the elasticsearch service starts. I tried a lot of things to try and get the ES_JAVA_OPTS to be set but when looking at the logs I can see it was using the default. I've tried various things: 

I am using DD4T on an SDL Tridion project and am using the following configuration in the storage config in order to publish Binaries (binaries in this case being anything store in Multimedia Components) to the filesystem but keep Pages in the Content Delivery database. I am finding that as requirements change for what Binary files are needed e.g. the customer wants to offer Adobe Illustrator files for download, I am needing to add more types to the list by changing the config and restarting the deployer which is not ideal.
