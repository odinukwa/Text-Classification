would be a function to compute $xy$ of complexity $|f| + |a1| + \ldots + |ak| + |g| + |b1| + \ldots |bl| + C$, where $C$ represents the bits needed to declare $h$, the parentheses, the return statement and to call concat (string concatentation function). Hence $K'(xy) \le K'(x) + K'(y) + C$. But as is well-know for the usual Kolmogorov complexity we do not have such an subadditivity? EDIT: This will also work if we just allow functions with a single parameter. 

A polynomial language is a languge which could be represented as the finite union of languages of the form: $$ A_0^* a_1 A_1^* a_2 \cdots a_k A_k^* \quad a_i \in X, A_i \subseteq X $$ Such an expression is called a monom and it's degree is the value $k$. Equivalently it could be defined as the smallest class containing the finite languages, languages of the form $A^*$ for $A \subseteq X$ and closed under union and concatentation. The degree of a polynomial language is the maximum degree of the monoms in a minimal (with regard to the degree) representation of the polynomial language in the form of unions of monoms. An ordered monoid $(M, \le)$ is a monoid $M$ together with a partial order which is compatible with multiplication. A set $D$ is called downward closed if $p \in D$ and $q \le p$ implies $q \in D$. An ordered monoid recognized a language $L$ via a morphism $\varphi : X^* \to M$ if $$ L = \varphi{-1}(\downarrow\varphi(L)) $$ where $\downarrow D$ denotes the smallest downward closed subset containing $D$. For the syntactic monoid $Syn(L)$ there is a natural order given by $u \le_L v$ iff $$ \forall p,q \in X^* : pvq \in L \Rightarrow puq \in L. $$ Then for $[u], [v] \in Syn(L)$ it is $[u] \le [v] :\Leftrightarrow u \le_L v$. 

Let $L$ be a regular suffix-free language whose complete minimal automaton has $n$ states and that the minimal automaton of $L^R$ has exactly $2^{n-2}+1$ states. Let $p, q$ be two distinct states of the minimal automaton of $L$ which are neither the initial state nor a sink state, then there exists a word $w \in X^*$ such that $\delta(q, w) = \delta(p, w)$ in the minimal automaton for $L$. That such languages exist is shown in this paper. The above reasoning is used in a paper without any further explanation, and I do not see that it is true. If we denote by $Q = \{0,\ldots, n-1\}$ the states of the minimal automaton of $L$ and by $F$ its final states, where $0$ is the start state and $n-1$ the sink state (which a suffix-free language always has) then it just precedes with constructing a NFA for $L^R$, determinizing by the subset construction and showing that it must contain the $2^{n-2}+1$ sets $\{ \{ 0 \} \}\cup \{ S \subseteq \{1,\ldots, n-2\}\}$ as states. Hence for $p,q \in \{1,\ldots, n-2\}$ we have some $p,q \in S$ such that $\delta_R(F, w) = S$ in the constructed automaton for $L^R$, and then it concludes that $\delta(p, w^R) = r = \delta(q, w^R)$ for some state $r$. 

We consider acceptance by Büchi automata. Let $X = \{0,1\}$ and $X^{\mathbb N}$ the set of all infinite sequences. Then for each $n$ do we have a finite collection $\{ \xi_1, \xi_2, \ldots, \xi_k \}$ of infinite words, such that for every other infinite word $\eta$ there exists some $\xi_i$ such that for every Büchi automaton $\mathcal A$ with $$ |L(\mathcal A) \cap \{\xi_i, \eta\}| = 1 $$ (i.e. the automaton separates both words: accepts one, but not the other) then $\mathcal A$ must have at least $n$ states? Observation. One neccessary condition on the collection of infinite words $\{\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_k\}$: for a given $n$ we must have at least $2^{n-2}$ of them ($k \ge 2^{n-2}$), i.e. one for each prefix of length $n-2$, for otherwise if some prefix $u \in X^{n-2}$ is not among the finite collection, then we can separate $u1^{\omega}$ easily by an automaton having fewer then $n$ states from every word in $\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_k$, simply read upon the first position $i \le n-2$ where it differs from a given $\xi_j$ and then reject or accept according to the sign there, which could be achieved by a Büchi automaton with $i+2$ states. But besides this observation, I do not see if this is possible? Motivation: If we define $$ d(\xi, \eta) = 1/2^n $$ where $n := \min\{ |\mathcal A| \mid |L(\mathcal A) \cap \{\xi,\eta\}| = 1 \}$ for $\xi \ne \eta$, and $d(\xi,\xi) := 0$, then this gives a metric, and the above question asks if the resulting metric space is totally bounded. 

Let $L \subseteq X^{\ast}$ be some language, then we define the syntactic congruence as $$ u \sim v :\Leftrightarrow \forall x, y\in X^{\ast} : xuy \in L \leftrightarrow xvy \in L $$ and the quotient monoid $X^{\ast} / \sim_L$ is called the syntactic monoid of $L$. 

According to R. Impagliazzo, R. Paturi and F. Zane, 2001 an instance of $k$-SAT is called sparse if $m = O(n)$ where $m$ denotes the number of clauses and $n$ the number of variables. The Sparsifiction Lemma, as mentioned in R. Impagliazzo, R. Paturi, 2001 says: 

I am unsure about $f = h_{\ast}$. Surely if $h_{\ast}(p) = u$, then $h(w) = u$ for some $w \in \mbox{dom}(h)$ with $w \sqsubseteq p$. By the defintion of $\mbox{dom}(h)$ this mean the machine halts on $w0^{\omega}$ in exactly $|w|$ steps, hence has read at most $|w|$ symbols, and thereby exhibiting the same behavior on $p$, i.e. we have $f(p) = u$. But now I want to show that if $h_{\ast}(p)$ diverges, then $f$ diverges too, or, giving the same, that if $f(p) = u$ then $h_{\ast}(p) = u$. But for example suppose $f(p) = u$, and let $k$ be the steps taken by the machine reading $p$ to halt and produce $u$, then surely the prefix $v$ of $p$ read in this process has at most length $k$. But as $|v| < k$ is possible, we could not conclude that $v \in \mbox{dom}(h)$, but by padding $v$ with zeros we know $v0^{k - |v|} \in \mbox{dom}(h)$ by definition, and hence $h_{\ast}(v0^{\omega}) = h(v0^{k - |v|})$ so that $f(p) = h_{\ast}(v0^{\omega})$. But this is all I get, I do not see how to conclude $h_{\ast}(p) = f(p)$, as this would mean we have some prefix $x$ from $p$ such that the machine takes exactly $|x|$ steps in producing $u$, but in general we cannot conclude that $v0^{k - |v|}$ is a prefix of $p$ if $k - |v| > 0$. So why does this result holds? And why $h_{\ast} = f$? 

I have a question on Alan Turing's Dissertation Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals, a scanned copy you can find here, or rewritten in LaTeX here, and also a copy of the published version here (but in section 3 I found some errors not present in the original scan, so maybe the original one is preferable). The unclear paragraph comes quite early at the end of section two. After the abstract, introducing the $\lambda$ calculus and what it means for a function to be "effective calculable" he writes: 

My question is related to the seminal paper On $\omega$-regular sets by K. Wagner, which introduced a hierarchy which is now know as the Wagner- (or Wadge-) hierarchy of $\omega$-regular sets. In this paper he introduces several invariants which could be computed from a given automaton for some $\omega$-language, and then he proceeds that these are invariants of the language, i.e. independent of the specific automaton used to compute them. In the course of this proof a special relation is introduced, and on the properties of this relation, for which a proof is not given in the paper, I have some questions. I introduce all definitions. All automata considered are supposed to be deterministic. For a given deterministic automaton $\mathcal A = (X, Q, f, q_0, \mathcal F)$ and $\mathcal F \subseteq \mathcal P(Q)$ (i.e. a table of subsets of states, see Mueller acceptance) we write $T(\mathcal A)$ for the set of all words such that there exists some $Z \in \mathcal F$ such that the states that are traversed infinitely often are precisely the states in $Z$. Now define $$ M(\mathcal A) = \{ Z' \mid T((X, Q, f, q_0, \{Z'\})) \ne \emptyset \} $$ i.e. the sets $Z'$ such that some word loops infinitely often through all the states in $Z'$. Then define $$ M^+(\mathcal A) := M(\mathcal A) \cap \mathcal F, \quad M^-(\mathcal A) := M(\mathcal A) \cap \overline{\mathcal F} $$ and inductively: \begin{align*} M_1^+(\mathcal A) & := M^+(\mathcal A), \\ M_1^-(\mathcal A) & := M^-(\mathcal A), \\ M_{2m}^+(\mathcal A) & := \{ Z' \mid Z' \in M^-(\mathcal A) \land \exists Z''( Z'' \in M_{2m-1}^+ \land Z'' \subseteq Z') \}, \\ M_{2m}^-(\mathcal A) & := \{ Z' \mid Z' \in M^+(\mathcal A) \land \exists Z''( Z'' \in M_{2m-1}^- \land Z'' \subseteq Z') \}, \\ M_{2m+1}^+(\mathcal A) & := \{ Z' \mid Z' \in M^+(\mathcal A) \land \exists Z''( Z'' \in M_{2m}^+ \land Z'' \subseteq Z') \}, \\ M_{2m+1}^-(\mathcal A) & := \{ Z' \mid Z' \in M^-(\mathcal A) \land \exists Z''( Z'' \in M_{2m}^- \land Z'' \subseteq Z') \}. \\ \end{align*} and \begin{align*} m^+(\mathcal A) & := \max( \{0\} \cup \{ m \mid M_m^+(\mathcal A) \ne \emptyset )\}) \\ m^-(\mathcal A) & := \max( \{0\} \cup \{m \mid M_m^-(\mathcal A) \ne \emptyset )\}) \end{align*} Set $m := \max(m^+(\mathcal A), m^-(\mathcal A))$ and for $Z', Z''$ write $Z'' \to Z'$ iff some state from $Z'$ is reachable from some state of $Z''$ and define further \begin{align*} N_1^+(\mathcal A) & := M_m^+(\mathcal A) \\ N_1^-(\mathcal A) & := M_m^-(\mathcal A) \\ N_{2n}^+(\mathcal A) & := \{ Z' \mid Z' \in M_m^-(\mathcal A) \land \exists Z''( Z'' \in N_{2n-1}^+(\mathcal A) \land Z'' \to Z' \}) \\ N_{2n}^-(\mathcal A) & := \{ Z' \mid Z' \in M_m^+(\mathcal A) \land \exists Z''( Z'' \in N_{2n-1}^-(\mathcal A) \land Z'' \to Z' \}) \\ N_{2n+1}^+(\mathcal A) & := \{ Z' \mid Z' \in M_m^+(\mathcal A) \land \exists Z''( Z'' \in N_{2n}^+(\mathcal A) \land Z'' \to Z' \}) \\ N_{2n+1}^-(\mathcal A) & := \{ Z' \mid Z' \in M_m^-(\mathcal A) \land \exists Z''( Z'' \in N_{2n}^-(\mathcal A) \land Z'' \to Z' \}). \\ \end{align*} and then similar \begin{align*} n^+(\mathcal A) := \max(\{0\} \cup \{n \mid N_n^+(\mathcal A) \ne \emptyset \}) \\ n^-(\mathcal A) := \max(\{0\} \cup \{n \mid N_n^-(\mathcal A) \ne \emptyset \}). \end{align*} Now define the relation:
