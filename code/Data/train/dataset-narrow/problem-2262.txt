Another reason is that they're relatively practical theoretical models. A Turing machine, apart from the impossibility of the infinite tape, is kind of an awkward fit for what it's like to program a computer (note that this is not a good analogy to begin with!). PDAs and DFAs however are quite amenable to being models of actual programs in the sense that a PDA/DFA design can often easily be turned into a real program. Compiler design, for example, uses them extensively. So at these sort of connection points between theory and practice, we get a handle on how it all ties together, and what we can and can't do. 

Complexity theory builds off computability theory, and the typical formulation of problems in computability theory is as decision problems, stemming naturally from setting them up as questions about set membership. The roots of computability theory go back some way, but if you want the first strong example of a Decision Problem, then Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem is the ur example - it is German for "Decision Problem". 

I am working on an algorithm for which the running time is a random variable $X$ that has finite expected value, but infinite variance. Are there examples of other algorithms for which this is the case? Are any such algorithm used in practice, or does the infinite variance make the running time too unpredictable? 

Brassard, Hoyer, Mosca and Tapp showed that the generalized Grover search, called amplitude amplification, can be used to obtain a quadratic speed-up on a large class of classical heuristics. The intuition behind their idea is that classical heuristics use randomness to search for a solution to a given problem, so we can use amplitude amplification to search the set of random strings for one that will make the heuristic find a good solution. This yields a quadratic speed-up in the running time of the algorithm. See section 3 of the paper linked above for more details. 

Regarding question A, it is possible to adapt the PRNG to yield uniformly distributed numbers using this. However, the range of this new uniform generator has size smaller than $K$, unless the PRNG is itself uniform. The number of possible outcomes of this new generator will depend on the min-entropy of the original generator. To get some intuition on why this is so, try to view the problem from an adversarial point of view where the goal is to guess the outcome of the PRNG. If $P_{guess}>1/K$ is the probability of the most probable outcome of the PRNG, then there is no deterministic way to lower the adversary's guessing probability without adding randomness. Therefore if you are to transform the outcome to a uniform distribution then all the equaly likely outcomes must happen with probability at least $P_{guess}$, so there can be at most $1/P_{guess}$ outcomes. Of couse, I'm assuming that the adversary knows the deterministic procedure that is applied, as is usually the case in cryptography. So the answer to question B is that this nesting trick does not increase randomness, it can only decrease it. There is no deterministic procedure that can increase randomness. Hope this helps 

A partial answer, in that I don't know a nice "reason" that can be generalised, but the following graph (shameless nicked from here): 

I believe the best result (with regards to the number of queries) is still Håstad's 3-query PCP. So if you choose at least 3, then it's a definite yes. These lecture slides might be a bit more useful as they cut straight to the chase. 

I can see his point, but I think he's really (deliberately?) confusing computation (and the mathematics thereof) and computers. A computer is certainly a device for performing computation, but what Church and Turing created was a (well, two, but they're "the same") theoretical (read mathematical) model of the process of computation. That is, they define a mathematical system which (if you believe the Church-Turing thesis) captures what it is possible to compute on any machine that can perform mechanical computation (mechanical in the sense that it can be automated, and yes, that's a little hand wavy, but that's another story). Computers don't work like Turing Machines (or the Lambda calculus, which doesn't even pretend to be a machine). Bits of them look kind of similar, and indeed Turing does play an important role in the development of modern computers, but they're not a byproduct of the maths, any more than aeroplanes are a byproduct of the dynamics that describe airflow across their wings. 

Hoare logic can be used for proving program correctness (e.g. for deriving correctness statements for the whole program from the statements for the individual commands or constructions; good summary is $URL$ The question is - is there any line of research where Hoare-style reasoning can be made for programs that creates and deletes objects. One thought can be that this reasoning can be simulated by defining large pool of objects which have (for the purposes of correctness analysis) additional state attribute with values from the enumeration {not-created, created, destroyed}. But I guess that better approach should exist. Are there any references or keywords for furher search into this matter. 

Is it possible to construct sequent calculus for nonmonotonic/defeasible logic? If it is possible then those logics can be encoded in proof assistants which require sequent calculus for logic to be encoded (Isabelle, Coq). I am aware of the several papers from the late nineties by Ana Teresa Martins et al. about sequent calculus for paraconsistent logics. the labelling of propositions (given and derived) is used in those papers. But those papers seems to be unpublished, although they contain bright ideas, the quality of language may be a bit higher. It seems to me that those ideas are not caught by others and developed futher. 

The decisional version of your problem can be written in the folowing form: $$EQ(s_1,t_1)\lor EQ(s_2,t_2)\lor \dots \lor EQ(s_n,t_n).$$ This is very similar to the inner product $$x_1y_1\lor x_2y_2\lor\dots\lor x_ny_n.$$ The communication complexity of those two problems is equivalent, since equality can be done at constant randomized communication cost. Also, finding an $i$ such that $s_i=t_i$ is at least as hard as the decisional version of the problem. Therefore, your problem is as hard as solving $IP$ when only one clause is satisfied. I have no direct proof, but my intuition lets me believe that $IP$ with only 1 satisfied clause is as hard as general $IP$. So the randomized complexity of your problem would be in $\Theta(n)$ if I am not mistaken. I hope this helps. 

Back in 2005, Scott Aaronson posted a list of 10 "semi-grand" challenges for quantum computing theory which contained the following challenge: 

I am currently searching for a Ph.D. project and this is the kind of stuff that interests me. I would certainly like to contribute to solving this problem, if it is still open. That is why I would like to know some of the recent developments on this. Is this still an open problem? What contributions were made in the last decade? 

I am considering one optimization problem who is known to be NP hard in the general setting. But there is application of this problem on the cylces of graph. This problem involves several sets and in this setting each set is the set of nodes of cycle in connected unidrected graph. And all cycles of connected unidrected graphs are the all sets for this problem. This is quite specific setting for the problem and I wonder whether there can be improvements in this specific setting. I would like to work out all the details myself but the question is - is there the general theory of all cycles in grpahs (connected undirected). Like - what is the number of cycles, what is the minimum and maximum lenght of them, how much common nodes they can have and so on? Mybe there are connections with group theory - e.g. cycle could be some kind of orbit for a group element (in rude language). Any such information provides the constraint on the initial problem and therefore - the complexity improvements can be possible to achieve in this specific setting. Google gives a lot about Hamiltonian and similar specific cycles. My question is about all possible cycles in graph. Any references could be helpful. Any names for the problems and keywords in this are could be appreciated as well. Thanks. 

In stochastic simulation, we are often interested in estimating the expected value of a random variable. The expected value of a continuous random variable is an integral over the real numbers. To estimate this quantity, we use the Monte Carlo method which consists of generating instances of this random variable from pseudorandom uniform variables. From these uniform variables, we can generate random variables from a given distribution by inverting the cumulative distribution function which is defined itself as an integral. 

I wouldn't think so. I'm assuming your $a_n$'s are normalized, i.e. that $||\sum_n a_n |n\rangle|| =1$. But then your wish output is not normalized since $$||\sum_n e^{ia_n} |n\rangle|| = \sqrt{\sum_n |e^{ia_n}|^2} = \sqrt N$$ where I assume there are $N$ terms in the sum. Quantum (unitary) operations have to preserve the norm so there can't be one that maps the first state to the second one. 

For computational complexity, there is no proof that quantum computers are better than classical computers because of how hard it is to obtain lower-bounds on the hardness of problems. However, there are settings in which a quantum computer provably does better than a classical one. The most famous of these examples is in the blackbox model in which you have access via blackbox to a function $f:\{0,1\}^n\mapsto \{0,1\}$ and you want to find the unique $x$ for which $f$ evaluates to 1. The complexity measure in this case is the number of calls to $f$. Classicaly, you cannot do better than guessing $x$ at random which takes on average $\Omega(2^n)$ queries to $f$. However, using Grover's algorithm you can achieve the same task in $O(\sqrt{2^n})$. For further provable separations, you can look into communication complexity where we know how to prove lower bounds. There are tasks that two quantum computers communicating through a quantum channel can accomplish with less communication than two classical computers. For example computing the inner product of two strings, one of the hardest problems in communication complexity, has a speedup when using quantum computers. 

I am acquinted with the basics of such notions as logic programming, monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning, modal logic (especially dynamic logic) and now I am wondering - does logic programming provides anything new to any logic? As far as I understand, then (at least in dynamic logic) the logic programming refers to the formalization of state transitions (by actions, i.e. - logic programing can be understood just as logic about actions). But the same notion "logic programing" seems to be in use even in domains, where there is not state transition, just exploration of one state (or set of states - in case then the initial set of premises are vague enough to describe more than one state). It seems to me that some authors simply use the notions "logic programming" for describing the procedure how to evaluate the query (I am reading currently about defeasible logic programming). But such procedure (although practical indeed) does not add anything new to the underlying logic. E.g. there is notion of "rational closure" (e.g. used for adaptive logics; just the consequence set for some set of premises) which should contain all the possible knowledge about state and therefore all the possible results of "logic programing" (if it is indeed perceived just as state exploration, derivation). So - the question is - does logic programming provides anything new to the logic and does every logic (to be completely understood and readied for applications) need to have its own logic programming? Maybe I am just missing the point... Just for reference I find the following works interesting about this subject, if there are more along this line, then it would be great to hear! 

Lov Grover published an article in 1997 in which he shows that if you can query the database on multiple items, then a single query suffices to find the marked element. However, it requires a number of preprocessing and postprocessing steps in $\Omega(N\log N)$. If you let $S_1, \dots, S_N$ denote the elements of the database, you query the oracle with the string $S_{i_1}, \dots, S_{i_\eta}$ for some number $\eta$ and the oracle returns $1$ if the marked state appears an odd number of times in the string and $0$ if it appears an even number of times. You query this oracle on a superposition $(|S_1\rangle+ \dots+ |S_N\rangle)^\eta$ and then apply the inversion about the mean operator from Grover's algorithm. Now in each the the $\eta$ subsystems, the marked element has a greater amplitude than the unmarked ones. Measuring all subsystems yield the marked state with greater probability and to have sufficient certitude about the resulting state, $\eta$ must be in $\Omega(N\log N)$. 

Not sure if this is directly linked to your question, but reading it made me think about an article by Peter Høyer I read some years ago. In it, he shows how the most popular quantum algorithms like Grover's or Shor's follow the same pattern of applying what he calls "conjugated operators" and he builds new algorithms also based on that same pattern. As I said, it's been a few years since I've read it so my description is a bit sloppy, but here's the link in case you want to check it out. $URL$
