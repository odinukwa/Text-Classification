If this is going to be a mission critical thing I'd suggest clustering your SQL Server. That particular drawback is specific to IAS so you'd have to take that up with Microsoft. Sorry :-/ 

If you're running SQL 2005 or higher there is a default trace already running that gives you a certain level of auditing. Read about it more here: $URL$ You can also create your own server-side trace to audit what you need. I blogged how to do it here: $URL$ You can also watch a video on how to use the Profiler tool to see what's going on: $URL$ 

VMDK's can be easily grown but not shrunk. Its best to start off smaller and grow as needed for storage management reasons. With VSphere 4 they have thin provisioning now so you can tell the server its 100 GB but on the backend it only provisions how much its really using. $URL$ 

Your risks are that staying with an older system that eventually they'll stop supporting it. As for benefits check VMware's site for 2.0 features and see if it applies to you: $URL$ New Features in VMware Server 2 

Depends on the solution you have in place for your enterprise. For instance we use CA's Arcserve Backup product which relies on agents on target machines. You install the proper agent on machines you want and throw them into a backup rotation and you're good to go! The agents not only pick up drives but Registry states so you can restore bits/pieces. As for storing data on your servers, you're going to have to otherwise your solution is for naught. If you keep backups on the machine you're backing up and the machine goes missing or damaged, what are you going to restore from? If you're truly backed into a corner here then use Windows native backup tools and partition your hard drives. If there's corruption in Windows then at least having backups on different partition provides some sort of protection. 

Communication, communication, communication. Every problem between a sysadmin and a dev can pretty much always be tracked back to a lack of communication. If prior to a project the sysadmins (or a representative thereof) and the devs got together and had a nice framework discussion, SOOOOOOOOOO many problems could be avoided down the line. I can't tell you how many things get fouled up because you develop everyone on one box in development only to watch it go down in flames in prod because the app then gets separated in to App server + DB server + interface server, etc. Kudos for bringing this topic up. 

How long have those snapshots been in place? Typically you don't want a snapshot around longer than a few days otherwise you're liable to run into issues. Best thing I can recommend is either committing those snapshots (might take awhile if they're large/have been running for awhile. Virtual Center might time out but its still deleting in the ESX if its really large). Snapshots are just delta files of a particular VM so there's no way of applying system-wide changes across multiple ones. Update: Why snapshots can stop machines for long time: $URL$ VMware Admin guide (PDF): $URL$ Horror story of "the long snapshot" which should be quite painful for you guys if you decide to commit: $URL$ 

Your answer lies in Powershell but I lack the programming knowledge in that language to give you an exact solution 

You COULD but why would you want to? Theoretically you can have the whole shebang of services on same box (Small Business Server). Just because you CAN do something, however, doesn't necessarily mean you should. The Domain controller holds the AD database so if you want to risk bogging that down with printing (and god forbid) file sharing then that's a risk you'll have to assess yourself. If you want to play it safe stand up a Linux server for free and use that as a network file share or print server and try to keep your Domain Server boxes as just that. 

Another way to really speed up SSMS opening is right-click the shortcut for it, choose properties. Change the Target to this: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\100\Tools\Binn\VSShell\Common7\IDE\Ssms.exe" -nosplash The change is the addition of the -nosplash flag at the end. This will speed you up quite a bit opening. I learned this trick at SQL Saturday. 

Here's a nice blog post: $URL$ White paper on disk alignment: $URL$ In short your OS should be on RAID 1, your data files on RAID 10 (preferably) and log files on RAID 1. SQL Performance article: $URL$ PDF on top 10 best performance tips: $URL$ Also remember to put your TEMPDB on a separate disk for performance reasons. I'm sure Paul Randal will come in here and blow your mind with why in a bit. MS says why for tempdb: $URL$ 

Its tough becoming the unwilling DBA. You can set autogrow its just you should try to size your database up front to avoid fragmentation and performance issues with autogrow. Here's some articles by Paul Randal to help you out. Welcome to the DBA world: $URL$ Sharepoint gold: $URL$ 

If your office is expecting to remote into another office server on your own network, why would you want to go through the internet? If its on the same network you should just be able to use RDP regularly. If you're not on the network check with your sysadmins about a VPN connection.

In addition to the advice K Brian Kelley gave also look into partition alignment. If you're using Windows 2008 you shouldn't have to worry as partitions are automatically aligned for you but on Windows 2003 you'll need to do this manually. Read this whitepaper to understand the who/what/why you should do this. You can get up to 30-40% performance boost by just aligning your partitions. $URL$ 

On Mac hardware the virtualization platform you'd probably want to go with is VMware's Fusion. Solid product and can't go wrong with VMware. You can also look at Parallels. Both of these products are aimed at desktop virtualization though (i.e. running vms locally for testing). You looking to run a prod Linux server from this solution? 

First off my condolences for using Arcserve (I'm stuck w/ it right now and hate it). We have different media pools for stuff like (2weekstaging, 2wkstag_daily, 2wkstaging_mthly, etc.). Our setup is that staging is a VTL before doing migration jobs to tape. The diff pools are needed for each job, not server. 

If its a SQL Express engine you need make sure the SQL Browser service is running otherwise the client won't be able to see named instances on the server side. 

Yes, you CAN but like so many things doesn't mean you should. I've seen a virtualized ESX server running a virtual machine that has another virtual ESX server within it. Granted it was a test just to see if it could be done (and it can) I really wouldn't recommend it. 

Like so many questions given to solution developers, it depends. There's nothing wrong with using Scheduled tasks and as long as whatever solution you're developing clearly states in the documentation what/how you do something you should be fine. There are advantages for running something as a service such as being able to script a solution for a non-admin to run a service if they don't know how to use the services.msc console. Or even being able to monitor said service via Powershell or a network monitoring program such as What's Up Gold. With Scheduled task you can run your program on a schedule you decide but you can also add arguments (which you can also do with services technically) but you can do so in an easy GUI format. Again, whatever you decide is easiest and most useful for your situation. 

If they're just demo sites do you need them all running at same time? With some hosting companies that host your site on a VM you can pay a little more and have them up your resources. If your current hosting company doesn't offer this you may want to shop around. If these sites are that important to you in terms of them performing then you'll eventually have to bite the bullet. If you're going to do hosting from home and don't want to order the business class internet service (which offers static IP) look into using OpenDNS ($URL$ and configuring your router to use them. That should somewhat help you out. 

Best way to protect machines against staff is stringent permission lockdowns and making sure you're not dolling out administrative rights like candy. If they need to do something with NEAR admin rights assign them to power users group. Make sure your antivirus solution is up to date and running as well. 

A fun way to do this across many machines using the power of SQL 2008 is by using the new policy based management. Create a policy that sets the max memory to a number of your choosing. Apply your policy against the target server and your setting will change. If you don't have a SQL 2008 instance in-house yet you can download the 180-day trial of Enterprise Edition and try it out. Try SQL 2008: $URL$ Policy Based Management team blog (great resource): $URL$ Blog regarding PBM against 2000/2005 servers: $URL$ 

I'm not sure what the source of your errors are but here's a place to start looking: 10036 Error: $URL$ 7888 Error: $URL$ NOTE*-If this first link is right, check service enabled in your MOSS setup and make sure you don't have something enabled that you don't need for your particular license type $URL$ 7 Error (need more specifics as this is a generic error): $URL$ NOTE*-From first glance looks like error 7 might point to a bad drive. Is this vm local (workstation) or on ESX? Is it on a SAN or local disk space? Can you do storage migration and try this VM on another disk? 63 Error: $URL$ NOTE- Again, hard to diagnose with no source information but looks like another possible issue with disk. 

Have you cleaned out your MSDB lately? Good article by Brent Ozar as to what ramifications this has on your db's and backups $URL$ 

Run sysprep on the system. This will reset the SID and should fix whatever machine account conflict the network is seeing. Was this machine cloned? 

Ooh I just read this last night in SQL Server 2008 Internals book (thanks Paul Randal). If it runs out of space the snapshot gets deleted. What I mean is in SQL 2005+ the internal engine is actually creating a snapshot behind the scenes and running checkdb against that. You can't access this snapshot as its invisible to you but it still takes up space on the filesystem the files are on. If it doesn't have enough space to create this system snapshot it will throw an error and rollback that snapshot. What you can do is manually create a snapshot of the database on another volume that has enough space and run checkdb against that. Your results should still be valid as the snapshot is simply a collection of differences in page changes against the base data. I'm sure Paul could answer this more eloquently but this is the basic gist of it. Also yes, you can cancel a running checkdb query. 

For those who don't know the Browser service allows clients to see Named Instances, which SQLEXpress (by default) creates a named instance called SERVERNAME\SQLExpress. Without browser service running you won't be able to see it remotely. Also let the service run as Network Service (or trusted AD account is preferred, admin rights not needed) so you can see it without issue over your network. 

Depends on what permissions are granted to the schema you're connecting to on the Oracle side. Have you applied latest patches to your Management Studio client? 

Ummm, why would you want to restrict the network traffic? This type of setting I believe would have to be done at the switch level. If not what you can do is set your NIC to 10 Mbps half/full if you want to do that sort of thing on the server-side. 

I'm not familiar with the NOD32 product (as in I've never used it). Does it offer some sort of registry protector or is it just antivirus scanning? Is the update password for getting updates only or working in general? Is it trial version or paid? 

No you'll be fine. If anything I recommend ratcheting down the max memory setting in SQL Server so it doesn't suck up all the memory resources (as this is the default behavior for SQL). If you're only doing this for testing you'll probably be ok giving SQL between 512MB-1GB of RAM 

VMware released a Powershell toolkit you'll probably want to check out: $URL$ And here's a blog with Top 10 Powershell scripts VMware admins should be using: $URL$ 

Do you have some sort of firewall between the data centers doing any sort of filtering? Have you done a tracert between the offices and seen where in the transaction the "hold ups" are happening? This might help you better figure out where your problem lies. 

Sharepoint needs to be treated like a SQL database because it IS a SQL database so take all your regular SQL setup precautions in setting up shop. As for backups you should not only be backing up your databases regularly you need to back up your 12-hive which holds all of your SP information. Check out this thread for more info: $URL$ 

Another answer (if you're SQL inclined and bored) is that you can open Excel, connect to a SQL datasource, connect to the SQL instance hosting your Virtual Center and query the views that Virtual Center uses 'under the covers' to roll your own reporting solution. Beauty to this is that it will always be up to date since its data coming live from your SQL and its completely customizable provided you're comfortable enough to do it in Excel (or even Reporting Services if you're that advanced/bored). 

I somewhat answered this in another answer recently but this is a good topic. One of the key issues between IT and "the Others" (sue me, I'm a Lost fan) is that in the Dharmaville we call IT, we know what we're doing. We're happy. We understand our parts (for most part) and know how to do it well (again, for most part). The problem comes in how IT is utilized. In the past IT was the hammer that drove the nails. We came out, provided dumb terminals and as long as the mainframe and network were up nobody really questioned anything. Nowadays IT NEEDS to be seen as BUSINESS PARTNER. Nothing gets done without IT involvement now and when people fail to realize that you can't plan to put in a massive product and not even know if 1) It really will help anything 2) If it even works with what we have and if it doesn't what do we need to do to get there. We need to evolve our thinking and update our policies and procedures to accept these new changes or we'll always be stuck in the same old rut.
