As far as I know the NP-completeness of computing the treewidth of a planar graph is still open. The most recent reference I know is a survey by Bodlaender from 2012 called `Fixed-Parameter Tractability of Treewidth and Pathwidth' that appeared in the festschrift for Mike Fellows' 65th birthday. The problem is listed in the conclusion of the survey. 

A recent paper by Isolde Adler1, Frederic Dorn, Fedor V. Fomin, Ignasi Sau and Dimitrios M. Thilikos called Fast Minor Testing in Planar Graphs shows that when looking for a minor $H$ on $h$ vertices in a planar graph $G$, this can be done in $2^{O(h)} n + O(n^2 \log n)$ time. While the dependence on $n$ is not as good as the one mentioned in the answer by David, the dependency on $h$ of this work is far superior. 

Informally, the problem asks whether all terminals can be separated with k vertex deletions, knowing that all terminals lie on the outer face. If we replace vertex deletions by edge deletions, then this is known to be possible in polynomial time by considering multiway cuts in the planar dual, and relating them to certain kind of Steiner trees ( Efficient Algorithms for k-Terminal Cuts on Planar Graphs, $URL$ ). Since the edge-deletion version reduces to the vertex-deletion version, the edge-deletion version seems easier; no reduction in the reverse direction is known. The question is: is Node Multiway Cut on Planar Graphs with terminals on the outer face NP-complete? The reason I am interested in this problem is that it would provide me with a starting point for another complexity lower bound if this is indeed NP-complete. 

Let's say that a graph family $\mathcal{F}$ has long induced paths if there is a constant $\epsilon > 0$ such that every graph $G$ in $\mathcal{F}$ contains an induced path on $|V(G)|^{\epsilon}$ vertices. I am interested in properties of graph families that ensure the existence of long induced paths. In particular, I am currently wondering whether constant-degree expanders have long induced paths. Here is what I know. 

I am interested in the following problem. Node Multiway Cut on Planar Graphs with terminals on the outer face 

For all of these, the relevant parameter is the size of the solution. You can have a look at the open problem list from the 2013 Workshop on Kernelization ( $URL$ ) for others. Pointers to other (but older) open problem lists in parameterized complexity can be found here: $URL$ . 

If $k \leq 0$ then output YES if and only if G is a disjoint union of two cliques. If the input graph contains an induced path on three vertices ($P_3$), then at least one of these three vertices need to be deleted to turn the graph into a cluster graph. Thus we branch in three ways depending on a choice of vertex, decreasing the parameter by 1 in each branch. Output the OR of the recursive calls. If the graph is induced $P_3$-free, it is a cluster graph. If there is only 1 clique in this cluster graph: output NO. If there are two cliques in this cluster graph: output YES. If there are more than 2 cliques: sum the number of vertices in all but the two largest cliques. If this number is more than k, then output NO (all those vertices need to be deleted to reduce the number of cliques to 2, but we can't afford this). If the sum is at most k, output YES. 

Computing a maximum clique in a graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into 3 cliques, is equivalent to computing a maximum independent set in the complement graph, which can be partitioned into 3 independent sets and is therefore 3-colorable. The latter problem is still NP-complete, which can be seen as follows: Start from an arbitrary instance $(G,k)$ of independent set and subdivide each edge twice, i.e., replace each edge ${u,v}$ by a path ${u,e_1, e_2, v}$ on two new vertices. It is not difficult to prove that the resulting graph $G'$ has an independent set of size $k + |E(G)|$ if and only if $G$ has a size-$k$ independent set: for every independent set in $G$, you can add exactly one of the two subdivider vertices on every edge without violating independence. Hence the Clique problem is still NP-complete for such inputs. 

The problem is still NP-complete. Here's a reduction from the Treewidth problem on general graphs. Recall that for a graph G of treewidth at least two, the treewidth is not affected when subdividing an edge by a degree-2 vertex (i.e. replacing an edge $\{u,v\}$ by a new vertex $x$ and edges $\{u,x\}$, $\{x,v\}$ ). Given an input graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, assume without loss of generality that it has treewidth at least two (otherwise we can solve the problem and output an equivalent constant-sized instance). Number the vertices of G from $1$ to $n$, in some arbitrary order. Now assign vertex $v_i$ to set $S_{2i}$, and observe that trivially, each set $S_i$ induces an independent set in the graph; we will maintain this during the following process. As long as the graph has an edge $\{u,v\}$ between two vertices which are not in adjacent sets, say an edge between a vertex in $S_i$ and one in $S_j$ for $i < j$ and $j-i > 1$, subdivide the edge, placing the newly created degree-2 vertex in set $S_{i+1}$. Since this subdivider vertex is placed between the endpoints of the subdivided edge, it decreases the difference between the indices of the sets that its neighbors are in, and therefore each edge of the original graph is subdivided no more than $n$ times. So this process terminates after a polynomial number of steps. The resulting graph $G'$ was made from G by repeatedly subdividing edges, so its treewidth equals that of G. Let us verify that the resulting sets satisfy that all connected components of $G'[S_i \cup S_{i+1}]$ are bicliques. One of the indices $i, i+1$ is odd. By construction, the set for this odd index contains only degree-2 vertices which were added to subdivide an edge. Since the subdivider vertex was placed "in the gap between its two neighbors", each degree-2 vertex has one neighbor in the previous set, and one neighbor in the next set. So the set out of $S_i, s_{i+1}$ with odd index has only vertices which have degree one in the graph $G'[S_i \cup S_{i+1}]$, which shows that the graph is a disjoint union of stars which are bicliques. So the graph G' has treewidth equal to G, size polynomial in that of G, and can be constructed in polynomial time. Since treewidth is NP-complete, so is the restriction to your special graph class. 

Draw it in the plane such that no edge contains a vertex in its interior, and such that no more than 2 edges cross at any point. Replace every crossing point of two edges by a new vertex of degree 4. 

I'm not sure if you're asking this question for the technique or for the answer, but there is a recent paper by McDiarmid and Mueller where they show the number of (labeled) unit-disk graphs on $n$ vertices is $2^{(2 + o(1))n}$; see $URL$ . 

Then the resulting graph is clearly planar. While $K_{3,n}$ has constant pathwidth, some preliminary investigations suggest that regardless of the drawing you use to planarize $K_{3,n}$, you cannot guarantee that the planarized graph has constant pathwidth independent of $n$; I believe the pathwidth of the planarized graph must grow with $n$. Is this known, or implied by some existing result? On the other hand, I have a family of graphs of constant degree and bounded pathwidth, which I can planarize without increasing the pathwidth by more than a constant. Is there a general result saying that this is always possible for graphs of bounded degree and pathwidth? 

Here's how to do (2) for Dominating Set. Since Dominating Set is contraction-bidimensional, we need to show the solution value is $\Omega(r^2)$ on a partially triangulated $r*r$ grid. So consider a partially triangulated $r*r$ grid. There might be vertices on the outer cycle of the grid of large degree (for example, one vertex might be adjacent to all other vertices on the outer cycle). Therefore, we are going to ignore the outermost 2 cycles of the grid, so we look at the $(r-4) * (r-4)$ partially triangulated subgrid "in the center", which has $\Omega(r^2)$ vertices, and we consider which vertices may be used to dominate this subgrid. Due to planarity, no vertex in this inner grid can be adjacent to a vertex on the outer cycle. All vertices which do not lie on the outer cycle have degree at most 8, as the partial triangulation has to keep the graph planar and can only make edges to the 8 vertices which are above, below, left, right, and diagonally adjacent to a vertex. So the $\Theta(r^2)$ vertices of the inner $(r-4)*(r-4)$ grid must be dominated by vertices which have degree at most 8 each. So when it comes to this inner grid, at best each vertex can dominate 8 other vertices and itself, for a total of 9. So you need at least $(r-4)^2 / 9$ vertices to dominate the inner grid, so a dominating set on the partially triangulated grid has size $\Theta(r^2)$.
