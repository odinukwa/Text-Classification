In his 1995 paper Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Prime Factorization and Discrete Logarithms on a Quantum Computer, Peter W. Shor discusses an improvement on the order-finding part of his factorization algorithm. The standard algorithm outputs $r'$, a divisor of the order $r$ of $x$ modulo $N$. Instead of checking if $r'=r$ by checking if $x^{r'}\equiv 1 \mod N$, the improvement is the following : 

Is unbounded fanout a reasonable approximation for realistic (quantum) circuits ? Is there a realistic quantum architecture which is effectively equivalent to the quantum circuit with unbounded fan-out ? 

Peter Shor essentially suggested the formulation 1. in his comment above, and I’ll let experimentalists answer this question. The question 2. seems strange, but I bring it forward because its answer is positive : In a 2009 paper (arXiv:0909.4673, paywalled version), Dan Browne, Elham Kashefi, and Simon Perdrix showed that Measurement Based Quantum Computing (MBQC), is equivalent up to a classical side-processing of logarithmic depth, to the quantum circuit model augmented with unbounded fanout gates. They basically recall that the unbounded parity gate is a Clifford gate and can be therefore be expressed as a measurement pattern of constant depth (arXiv,paywalled PRA) and show that a fanout gate is nothing else than a parity gate “sandwiched” between two layers of Hadamard gates, and can therefore be simulated in constant depth. Therefore, your question 

Since I don’t understand what you don’t understand, I will try to give a quite formal description, hoping it will help. $\newcommand{ket}[1]{\left|#1\right>}$ Let’s suppose the error is the unitary $U$ applied on the $k$th qubit. We have $$\begin{align} U&=aI+bX+cY+dZ\\&=aI+bX+icXZ+dZ, \end{align}$$ with $a,b,c,d$ being real numbers, $I$ is the identity, $X, Y, Z$ the Pauli operators. $X$ is a bit-flip, and $Z$ is a phase-flip. $Y=iXZ$ is a combination of phase and bit-flip. Let’s look at a coherent version of Shor error correction, one where there is no measurement, but a set $A$ of 8 ancilla qubits, initially in the $\ket{0}$ state. Their final state, if measured in the computational basis, contains the code syndrome. The error correction is described by a unitary $V$ acting the 9 qubits of the code ($B$) and the 8 ancilla qubits. Since the code corrects both bit-flips and phase-flips, we have: $$ \begin{align} V⋅(I\otimes I)\ket{\psi}_B\ket{0}_A&=\ket{\psi}_B\ket{0}_A\\ V⋅(X_k\otimes I)\ket{\psi}_B\ket{0}_A&=\ket{\psi}_B\ket{\phi_{k,X}}_A\\ V⋅(Z_k\otimes I)\ket{\psi}_B\ket{0}_A&=\ket{\psi}_B\ket{\phi_{k,Z}}_A\\ \end{align} $$ The action of $Y_k=iX_kZ_k$ is also corrected, since it is a phase-flip followed by a bitflip $^*$ : $$ \begin{align} V⋅(I_k\otimes I)\ket{\psi}_b\ket{0}_a&=iV⋅(X_k\otimes I)⋅(Z_k\otimes I)\ket{\psi}_b\ket{0}_a\\ &=\ket{\psi}_b\ket{\phi_{k,Y}}_a\\ \end{align} $$ If we apply this to an arbitrary error $U_k$ on the $k$th qubit, we have : $$V⋅(U_k\otimes I)\ket{\psi}_b\ket{0}_a=\ket{\psi}_b\left(a\ket0_a+b\ket{\phi_{k,X}}_A+c\ket{\phi_{k,Y}}_A+d\ket{\phi_{k,Z}}_A\right) $$ and the vector $\ket{\psi}_b$ is recovered. 

Let $g_1, \ldots, g_k, g \in S_n$ where $S_n$ is the permutation group on $n$ elements. Testing whether $g \in \langle g_1, \ldots, g_k \rangle$ can be done in $\text{NC} \subseteq \text{P}$ by [1]. Let $u, v \in \Gamma^n$, then simply guess $g \in S_n$, test in polynomial time whether $g \in G$ and whether $g(u) = v$. This yields an $\text{NP}$ upper bound. To complement this answer: 

A semigroup $S$ is $R\text{-trivial}$ iff $a \: R \: b \Rightarrow a = b$ for all $a, b \in S$ where $R$ is Green's relation $a \: R \: b \Leftrightarrow aS^1 = bS^1$. The set of $R\text{-trivial}$ monoids forms a variety which can be ultimately defined by the equations $(xy)^n x = (xy)^n$. A language is $R\text{-trivial}$ if its syntactic monoid is $R\text{-trivial}$. This variety of languages is alternatively defined as the set of all languages that can be written as a disjoint union of languages of the form $A_0^* a_1 A_1^* a_2 \ldots a_n A_n^*$ where $n \geq 0$, $a_1, \ldots, a_n \in A$, $A_i \subseteq A \setminus \{a_{i+1}\}$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$. Another definition given in [Pin], which I'm not familiar with, uses the so-called automates extensifs ("extensive automata"). You can find more results about those languages in [Pin]. There is an English version of this book, I've never read it but I'm pretty sure that you can find the same content. For the sake of completeness, here is an example of an (artificial) $R\text{-trivial}$ language: $\{b\}^* a \{a,c\}^* b \{a\}^* b \{a,b,c\}^* \cup \{d\}^* \cup abcd$. You can build other examples with the previous definitions. Note that all of the properties of varieties of languages hold for $R\text{-trivial}$ languages, therefore they are closed under union, intersection and complementation. It should help to build more complicated languages. 

I complete here Peter’s answer with a characterization of physical maps as CPTP maps. As you know, if the system is isolated, the only operations you can implement are the unitary operations. But, as you noticed, if you use an ancillary subsystem and throw a subsystem away, you can implement some other operations. The set of physical operations are the completely positive trace preserving maps. (Following most of the literature, I’ll call them CPTP maps), and Stinespring’s dilation theorem indeed ensures that any CPTP map can be written as the partial trace of a unitary acting on a larger Hilbert space. Since we are looking at non isolated subsystem, its quantum state has to be described by a density matrix $ρ$. In full generality, a density matrix has to be positive ($ρ≥0$) and having a unit trace ($\mathrm{Tr}ρ=1$). Let suppose we have a generic physical map $\mathcal{E}:ρ↦\mathcal{E}(ρ)$. To be physical $\mathcal{E}(ρ)$ needs to be a physical state for any input state $ρ$, that is, we should have $∀ρ:ρ≥0$, $\mathcal{E}(ρ)≥0$ and $\mathrm{Tr}\mathcal{E}(ρ)=\mathrm{Tr}ρ$. In other words, $\mathcal{E}$ has to be positive and trace preserving. However, it is not enough. For example, the transpose $\mathcal{T}$, is a positive trace preserving map, which is unphysical. The idea is the one behind the Peres-Hordecki criterion: suppose you have a channel performing $\mathcal{T}$ on the thystem $A$. You can add another system $B$ of the same dimension, where you perform the identity $\mathcal{I}$ i.e. wher you don’t do anything. The global map on $AB$ is then $\mathcal{T}_A⊗\mathcal{I}_B$, which is not positive any more: some linear algebra shows $\mathcal{T}_A⊗\mathcal{I}_B(Φ_{AB})$ has $d(d-1)/2$ negative eignevalues, where $Φ_{AB}$ is a maximally entangled state. For a map $\mathcal E$ to be physical, any extension of the form $\mathcal E⊗\mathcal I$ has therefore to be positive. This is the definition of complete positivity. The Stinespring dilation theorem then shows that this necessary condition is sufficient, since it gives a recipe to implement any CPTP map with an ancillary subsystem and and a unitary. 

As a complement to Joshua Grochow's answer: Computing the order of a permutation group given generators is in P by Schreier–Sims algorithm, see also p. 8-9 of these lectures notes by Luks. Just as membership in permutation groups, the problem was believed to be P-complete by many researchers, but it was finally shown to be in NC by Babai, Luks & Seress. The complexity of problems for permutation groups was extensively studied and their complexity was gradually settled for abelian groups, nilpotent groups, solvable groups, groups with bounded non-abelian composition factors, and finally groups (see work by Babai, Cook, Furst, Hopcroft, Luks, McKenzie, Mulmuley, Seress and many more). 

One issue is that it is unknown whether $\text{SPACE}[\log^2 n] \subseteq \text{P}$. That pretty much kills the notion of efficiency. On another note, determining if the intersection of the languages recognized by $\log^{k-1}(n)$ automata is non-empty is $\text{NSPACE}$$[\log^k n]$$\text{-complete}$ under logspace reductions [Lange-Rossmanith]. Perhaps there are some similar problems for deterministic polylog-space. The class $\text{PLOSS} = \bigcup_k \text{TISP}[n^k, k \, \log^2 n]$ has been studied in the past. [Cook] proved that $\text{DCFL} \subseteq \text{PLOSS}$. As noted by Derrick Stolee, this class is now known as $\text{SC}^2$ and has been generalized to $\text{SC}^k$. More informations here. 

Yes, there are some. There is actually an infinite hierarchy of languages which are less and less decidable, namely the Arithmetical hierarchy. Recursively Enumerable languages and their complements are at its level 1. An example of language which isn't RE or coRE is the set of Turing machines computing total functions. 

I personally think the answer to the latter question is “yes”, but the opinions on the feasibility of a given quantum computing architecture tend to be subjective... 

Brief (negative) answer This claim is incorrect as soon as you have three (or more) qubits, as shown by the GHZ paradox, briefly described below, which shows a 3-partite Bell inequality which is beaten by a state stabilized by Pauli operators, which can be prepared and measured by Clifford operations. This paradox is named after Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, who found it in 1989 (2007 arXiv reprint here). The point is that the Gottesman-Knill theorem does not care about locality, but on simplicity. The Gottesmann-Knill theorem (wiki, arXiv) gives a polynomial hidden variable theory for a state constructed with Clifford gates. Nothing prevents this theory to be nonlocal, as the GHZ state shows, but its complexity is bounded : a $n$-qubit state is described by $2n²$ binary hidden variables. On the other hand Bell inequalities characterize local hidden variable theories, without taking care of their complexity. The violation of a Bell inequality by the GHZ states means that it cannot be described by a model where each player has access to a different local hidden variable. Details of the GHZ paradox The paradox can be explained by the following game, with 3 cooperating players and a referee. the referee asks a question, either $X$ or $Y$ to each player, which answers ±1 without communicating with the other players. The referee either asks $X$ to all the players or asks $X$ to one of them and $Y$ to the others. The players win if the product of their answers obeys the equality below corresponding to the question asked: $$\begin{align} XXX&=+1\\XYY&=-1\\YXY&=-1 \\YYX&=-1 \end{align}$$ It is easy to see that the above set of equation is not consistent, and tha no local hidden variable theory allows to win the game with a probabiliyt greater than 3/4. On the other hand, if each of the player has a qubit of a GHZ state $|\mathrm{GHZ}\rangle:=(|000\rangle+|111\rangle)/\sqrt2$, they can win with certainty. Indeed, $|\mathrm{GHZ}\rangle$ is stabilized by the following Pauli operators : $$\begin{align} S_0&=+XXX\\S_1&=-XYY\\S_2&=-YXY \\S_3&=-YYX. \end{align}$$ Therefore, measuring the Pauli operators corresponding to the referee’s question allows the players to always win the game, and therefore violate a Bell inequality with certainty. Furthermore, this state can be prepared from Clifford operations, which invalidates the idea expressed in the paragraph you cite. 

The problem of determining whether a sentence of Presburger arithmetic is true is in between 2-NEXP and 2-EXPSPACE. When the number of quantifier alternations is fixed and at least two, the problem is in between NEXP and EXPSPACE. The existential fragment is NP-complete. For more details, see e.g. Christoph Haase, Subclasses of Presburger Arithmetic and the Weak EXP Hierarchy, CSL/LICS 2014.

Testing whether a Petri net $\mathcal{N} = (P, T, F)$ does not terminate from a marking $M_0$ can be decided by testing whether there exist a firing sequence $\sigma$ and markings $M, M'$ such that $M_0 \rightarrow^* M \rightarrow^\sigma M'$, $|\sigma| > 0$ and $M' \geq M$. By [Rac78], if such a firing sequence exists, then there is one of length doubly exponential. Thus, it can be guessed non deterministically, which shows that the problem is in EXPSPACE. By [Lip76], the problem is EXPSPACE-hard and hence EXPSPACE-complete. See, e.g., Section 3.2.4 of these lecture notes for a presentation of Lipton's reduction. [Rac78] Charles Rackoff.

The reference to [Odylzko 1995] is a “personal communication”, but I was not present when Peter Shor and Andrew Odlyzko discussed this... I perfectly understand why it is an improvement, but I don't know how to show the number of trials is reduced to $O(1)$. Do you know any proof of this? 

As suspected by Peter Shor, it is not true. Almost a counterexample Let $ω_{ABCD}=Φ_{AC}⊗ψ_{B}⊗ψ_{D}$, with $Φ$ being a maximally entangled state and $ψ$ a pure state. Let $U$ be the unitary $I_A⊗σ_{BC}⊗I_D$ swapping $B$ and $C$, so we have $ω_{ABCD}=Φ_{AB}⊗ψ_{C}⊗ψ_{D}$. All the systems are supposed to be of dimension $d$. Your assumptions are almost fulfilled, since $$\begin{align} S(ω_B)=0&<S(τ_B)=\log d \\ S(ω_A)=\log d&\ge S(τ_A)=\log d \tag1 \\ S(ω_{AB})=\log d&> S(ω_B)=0 \end{align}$$ but we have $$\begin{align} S(τ_{AB})-S(ω_{AB})=0-\log d&< S(τ_{B})-S(ω_{B})=\log d -0 \end{align}$$. In this case, the condition (1) is not fulfilled, since you asked for a strict decrease in $A$’s entropy, and kept $S(A)$ constant with a unitary not touching $A$. This can be changed by perturbing $ω$ and $U$, to have a slight decrease in $A$’s entropy. A real counterexample A concrete way to do this without a pertubative argument is to add another system $A'$ to $A$, which is entangled to another system $D'$ given to $D$. $$\begin{align} ω_{AA'BCDD'}&=Φ_{AC}⊗Φ_{A'D'}⊗ψ_{B}⊗ψ_{D}\\ U&=σ_{A'D}⊗σ_{BC}⊗I_{D'}\\ τ_{AA'BCDD'}&=ψ_{A'}⊗Φ_{AB}⊗Φ_{DD'}⊗ψ_{C} \end{align}$$ In that case, we have $$\begin{align} S(ω_B)=0&<S(τ_B)=\log d \\ S(ω_{AA'})=2\log d&> S(τ_A)=\log d \\ S(ω_{AA'B})=2\log d&> S(ω_B)=0 \\ S(τ_{AA'B})-S(ω_{AA'B})=0-2\log d&< S(τ_{B})-S(ω_{B})=\log d -0 \end{align}$$ Despite all your assumptions fulfilled by at least a $\log d$ margin, your final inequality is violated by a $3\log d$ margin The physical intuition begin these counter examples : conditional entropies The inequality you want to prove and your third assumption are thinly disguised conditional entropies. Moving $S(ω_B)$ to the left-hand side of our third assumption, one obtains $$H(A|B)_{ω}≥0,$$ which is verified by all state which are separable across the $A|B$ split (including my counterexamples.) Your final condition is equivalent to $$H(A|B)_{τ}\stackrel{?}{≤}H(A|B)_{ω}.$$ Since the right-hand side is positive by assumption, any negative left-hand side is a counterexample. $H(A|B)$ can only be negative for states which are entangled accross the $A|B$ split. In both my counterexamples $H(A|B)_{τ}=-\log d$ because of the entangled state $Φ_{AB}$. The increase in $B$’s entropy is provided by the move of the half EPR pair from $C$ to $B$. In the second counter example, in order to have a decrease of $AA'$’s entropy, I artificially increased the initial entropy of $A$ with the state $Φ_{A'D'}$. This entropy is sent to $D$ by $U$. 

I've been thinking about your question for vector addition systems with states (VASS) which are equivalent to VAS and came up with this solution. Now, I've read Jérôme's nice answer and I have to say that my answer is very similar, so please accept his answer even if you consider mine correct. 

It appears the problem is in L by [EJT10] and thus L-complete under $\text{NC}^1$ reducibility by [CM87]. See page 2 of [EJT10]:

Details: Let $V=(Q,T)$ be a $d$-VASS, i.e. $V$ is a finite labelled graph such that $T \subseteq Q \times \mathbb{Z}^d \times Q$. Let $O \subseteq \mathbb{N}^d$ be the set of obstacles. Let $\pi ­\in T^*$ and $X \subseteq \mathbb{N}^d$, we write $p(\boldsymbol{u}) \xrightarrow{\pi}_X q(\boldsymbol{v})$ whenever $\pi$ is a run from $p(\boldsymbol{u})$ to $q(\boldsymbol{v})$ with every intermediate configuration in $Q \times X$. We denote ${\downarrow}X = \{\boldsymbol{y} : \boldsymbol{y} \leq \boldsymbol{x} \text{ for some } \boldsymbol{x} \in X\}$. Let $\pi$ be a minimal run such that $p(\boldsymbol{u}) \xrightarrow{\pi}_{\mathbb{N}^d \setminus O} q(\boldsymbol{v})$, i.e. a minimal run that avoids the obstacles. Then, by the pigeonhole principle, $\pi$ can be factorized as a run that enters ${\downarrow}O \setminus O$ only finitely many times. More formally, there exist $t_1, t_1' \ldots, t_{n+1}, t_{n+1}' \in T \cup \{\varepsilon\}$, $\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_{n+1} \in T^*$ and $\{p_i(\boldsymbol{u}_i), q_i(\boldsymbol{v}_i), r_i(\boldsymbol{w}_i)\}_{i \in [0,n+1]} \subseteq Q \times \mathbb{N}^d$ such that
